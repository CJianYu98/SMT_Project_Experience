This is due to the presence of myriad pathways that students can choose to take. Primary school students can take their subjects at foundation level or at the normal level, secondary school students can choose between 3 or 4 streams, including Express, Normal (A) and Normal (T). Tertiary students can choose between 3 to 4 educational institutions as well. I believe stress does exist but it is not due to the nature of the education system, but due to societal influence, parental/family influence or it is self-imposed by the student.\"\n",
