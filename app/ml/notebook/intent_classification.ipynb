Since we are eating, we both were unmasked. We were in close contact for more than 10 mins. There were no other seats so I couldn't move away. There were no other instances where I could have gotten it as that was the only time I was unmasked while being in close proximity with a stranger.The very rule that was supposed to stop the spread was what spread it to me. If the smm didn't exist, there would have been more tables available and that stranger would have found a table elsewhere.TLDR: Random stranger sat opposite me while eating at hawker center cos of lack of tables due to SMM. Tested positive and after looking back, that incident was most probably where I got the infection.\"\n",
