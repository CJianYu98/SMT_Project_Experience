      How to clean up and maximise your smartphone contacts list
  </h1>, 'text': 'Your phone’s contacts app can be easy to treat as a simple address book. But the default versions usually included in Apple’s iOS 15 and Google’s Android 12 can be much more useful – providing specific ringtones, travel directions, birthday reminders and more – if you take the time to flesh out the entries for your favourite people. Here is a quick guide.\nIntroduce Yourself\nApple’s iOS Contacts app and Google’s free Contacts for Android include a card for your own details. It may seem odd, but the information you provide is helpful when working with your phone’s assistant app or using auto-fill fields in the Safari and Chrome browsers. For example, specifying family relationships on your personal contact card helps Siri or the Google Assistant when you say, “Call Mom,” although you will probably need to verbally confirm the relationship with the assistant.\nTo find your card on the iPhone, open the Contacts app. If you do not see it at the top of the list, tap the + icon to set it up. Select your card and tap Edit. Tap “add related name” and choose relationship labels for family members in your contacts. In the Medical ID area, you can designate an emergency contact visible on your phone’s lock screen if you are incapacitated.\nIn Google’s Contacts, tap your Google Account profile icon in the top-right corner, select Contacts App Settings, choose Your Info and tap Edit Contact to fill in your details. On many Google Pixel models, you can designate emergency contacts in Google’s free Personal Safety app or on the lock screens of other Android phones.\nAdd People\nTo create a contact on an iPhone or an Android phone, open the contacts app, tap the + button and fill in the fields. (If you sync your contacts with your computer or an online service like iCloud or Google, the new cards appear there, too.)\nA contact can be more than just a digital Rolodex card. You can add phonetic name-pronunciation guides, social media handles, images, short notes (like “vegetarian” or “Bengals fan”) and birthdays; those dates are then added to your iPhone’s optional birthdays calendar or Google’s Calendar app for Android.\nEdit or Delete Contacts\nTo update a contact, select it and tap the Edit button in the top-right corner of the iPhone screen or the Edit Contact button in the lower-right corner on an Android phone. In the editing mode, add new details, like addresses for future travel directions. To add a profile picture, tap the photo icon and choose an image on your phone.\nOn the iPhone’s contact-editing screen, you can assign a specific ringtone and text tone for that person. If you want to delete the contact, scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap Delete Contact.\nIn Google’s Contacts on an Android phone, tap the three-dot More menu in the top-right corner of an open card to get to the options for assigning a specific ringtone, sharing or deleting the contact, and more. (You can delete multiple entries at once from the main list in the More menu: Choose Select, tap the unwanted contacts and tap the trash icon.)\nDeal With Duplicates\nFinding multiple entries for the same person? In iOS 15, you can link the contacts to hide the duplicates. Just open one of the entries and tap Edit. Scroll to and tap Link Contacts, select the other version and tap Link to unify the cards. (If you are syncing your iPhone’s contacts with the Contacts app on a Mac, you can also group, delete and merge entries from your computer.)\nGoogle’s Contacts includes a Merge & Fix command to clean up duplicates. Tap the Menu icon in the upper-left corner, choose Merge & Fix and follow along; the tool is also available for Google Contacts on the web, as is the ability to label contacts. If you prefer to merge contacts manually, tap the More menu in the upper-right corner and choose Select to pick the entries from the list. Tap the More menu again and choose Merge.\nKeep in Touch\nNow that your contacts have been updated, put them to work. For instance, you can add an iOS widget to your iPhone’s home screen for quick access to your favourite folks. On many Android phones, you can save a contact shortcut to your home screen from Google’s Contacts menu.\nA card’s share option makes it easy to text or email contact details to others. Tell your phone’s assistant to open a specific contact so you can get to the one-tap shortcuts for making video calls, sending electronic cash and more. Or save time and just tell your assistant to start the call or message for you. \nBy J. D.

      Commentary: China welcomes the world in Winter Olympics but its economy is more isolated from West 
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: As the Beijing Winter Olympics get underway, all eyes are on China. There has been\xa0lots of coverage\xa0about\xa0China’s chilly relationship\xa0in the west and its persecution of\xa0the Uighur\xa0and other minorities, but there is also much to be said about the Chinese economy.\nChina’s great rise over the past several decades has been the great economic success of our times, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and giving the global economy wheels in the years after the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009.\nOver the past decade, however, the\xa0miracle became\xa0a bit more ordinary as growth gradually slowed. China found it difficult to keep increasing exports at the same pace year after year, particularly in the face of\xa0weaker international demand\xa0for its products – not least because of the trade war with the US.\xa0\nOther issues\xa0have included an ageing population and the fact that growth had become increasingly dependent on debt, which wasn’t sustainable.\nChina did\xa0seem to have weathered the pandemic better than many major economies, having contained the virus so aggressively. Yet the picture has since deteriorated as renewed\xa0domestic COVID-19 outbreaks, including the new Omicron variant, have caused fresh economic disruption.\nOmicron’s effect on other major economies is not good news for Chinese exports either. Neither is the resurgence of inflation in many countries, which has prompted the US Federal Reserve and other central banks to threaten higher interest rates and an end to creating money via\xa0quantitative easing. \nThis is likely to further dampen demand for Chinese goods.\nChina’s debt has also become an even bigger issue. Leading property developer Evergrande’s financial difficulties in 2021 made headlines, but excessive debt\xa0is rife\xa0throughout the property sector and beyond. If the bubble bursts, it could lead to a prolonged downturn that significantly damages the wider economy.\nThe government has been\xa0pressuring major companies\xa0to reduce their debts, while also restricting borrowing in the property sector and cracking down on informal lending across the country. It also sent a warning to excess borrowers through its willingness to\xa0let Evergrande default.\nWeaker exports and reducing debt mean that China is heading for a slowdown: The World Bank\xa0projects that\xa0its economic growth will be just over 5 per cent in 2022, compared to 8 per cent in 2021.\nMore broadly, China’s traditional growth model based on exports, infrastructure and real estate investment looks like it has run its course. The nation is facing a difficult rebalancing act as it aims to transition to relying much more on Chinese households consuming goods and services, while also\xa0having to move\xa0to a much less carbon-intensive economy.\nUnfortunately for the ruling Communist Party, the best way to achieve this rebalancing is arguably to implement reforms that would limit the government’s influence in Chinese life. For example, the\xa0World Bank thinks\xa0China needs to make it easier for companies to fail and to allow more private competition in sectors like education and healthcare as a way of driving up productivity. \nIt also recommends enabling workers to move around the country by abolishing the\xa0hukou\xa0registration system in cities, since this system stipulates where someone is permanently resident.\nSome World Bank recommendations do involve more government intervention, such as making the tax system more progressive to encourage consumers to spend more and raising government spending on health and education so that people don’t need to save so much. \nGenerally speaking, however, more liberalisation is the order of the day – and looks like the right way forward from my point of view.\nYet China has become more interventionist in the Xi era, clamping down on everything from\xa0tech billionaires\xa0to the number of hours that\xa0children can play\xa0video games each day. \nMeanwhile, China’s\xa0zero-COVID strategy\xa0has involved tightly sealed borders, swift citywide lockdowns and mass testing.\nChina adopted this strategy partly out of fear that its poor healthcare system could be completely overwhelmed by COVID, and more recently as a way of ensuring that the Winter Olympics proceed smoothly. \nYet such is the climate in China that\xa0some commentators fear\xa0that it will not open up again, that the health crisis is turning into a political crisis of more committed isolation.\nChina therefore finds itself at a crossroads. On the one hand, it wants a greater role in the global economy, as can be seen through its\xa0Belt and Road Initiative\xa0to drive infrastructure development around the world in exchange for closer ties with Beijing.\nBut there is a contradiction between continuing to engage with global trade and the Chinese government’s instinct towards technological self-sufficiency and homegrown innovation. \nTrade liberalisation also requires, for example, opening up the banking sector to foreign lenders to make it more efficient. Yet that is a long way from Beijing’s interventionist approach. \nIndeed, the fact that the banks, which are partly owned by the state, were given mandates to lend to state-owned companies with poor financial status was the cause of many the debt problems in the first place.\nUnfortunately, the indications are that China is more likely to move towards greater isolationism from the West. \nThis might mean restricting people visiting the country and concentrating more on domestic consumption than global trade. We might see it further tacking away from globalisation via trade wars, as well as imposing greater\xa0capital controls\xa0to make it harder for money to get in and out of the country. \nObviously, China is partly acting out of provocation from the west, but its overall policy shift has been to a large extent homegrown.\nAs with the Winter Olympics, where China is trying to keep the athletes separate from its people, the nation is also behaving in a similar way with regard to the rest of the world. \nWhat should be a celebration of international cooperation is happening at a time when the exact opposite is taking place.\nKate Phylaktis is Professor of International Finance and Director of the Emerging Markets Group at Cass Business School, City University London.

      In a world going wireless, is radiation from mobile and other devices a growing danger?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Bluetooth headphones, laptops, smart televisions and watches, tablets and Wi-Fi routers — many of us have these at home and also carry a mobile phone all the time.\nHow many people, though, wonder how exposed they and their families could be to radiation emitted by these devices?\nMany more than before, according to several retailers in Singapore that say sales of anti-radiation products have quadrupled over the past five years.\nThere are a variety of these products, from stickers selling for S$2 to products that are claimed to protect the vulnerable — children and pregnant women — like beanies for babies and maternity belly wraps.\nBut how protective are they? And is there a need to be worried about the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) emitted by wireless devices? The programme Talking Point investigates.\nMobile phones and electronic devices use radiofrequency to function, for example to transmit data. Their signals operate in the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the higher end are energy fields such as x-rays and gamma rays.\n“(Radio frequencies) have the ability to, let’s say, heat up the body, for example if that particular device is held close to the body, which in this case is a cell phone,” noted Neelakantam Venkatarayalu, an associate professor from the Singapore Institute of Technology’s (SIT’s) engineering cluster.\nIn 2011, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) International Agency for Research on Cancer classified RF as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, based on a few studies that found an association with a type of brain cancer.\nThis means “there could be some risk” of cancer, with continued evaluations needed even now.\nWhen it comes to mobile phones, before they can be put on the market, they must be designed and tested to operate below international reference levels for a measurement called the specific absorption rate.\nThis measures the amount of RF energy absorbed by the body per mass of tissue. Or as Venkatarayalu put it, “that translates directly into the amount of heat that builds up over time” when using the phone.\nTypically, the regulatory exposure limit for the head and torso is two watts per kilogramme (W/kg). In some countries, like the United States and Canada, it is 1.6 W/kg.\nUsers might not realise it, but mobile phones contain a section on safety: Go to Settings > About phone > Legal information. It includes information on the phone model’s specific absorption rate, either on the page or via a link.\nTalking Point sent five popular phone models for laboratory tests to find out how much radiation they emit when receiving a call.\nThe results showed that the phones’ power densities were below the exposure limit guideline by at least 200 times.\n“All of them are within the … safety limit, so it shouldn’t be a concern,” said Pei Yiyang, an associate professor from the SIT’s infocomm technology cluster who took the measurements.\nAs it is not just mobile devices that emit an electromagnetic field, RF expert Venkatarayalu used an instrument called a spectrum analyser to also take readings of different frequencies around programme host Steven Chia’s house.\nThe readings were below the safety guideline by at least 100 times. Even the Wi-Fi signals from Chia’s router were lower by a factor of about 1,400. And that was a “conservative estimate”.\n“We’re (measuring) a maximum value,” said Venkatarayalu. “It needn’t be emitting that all the time — it could be just a pulse that appears and vanishes.”\nOne professor who thinks the current exposure limits are not conservative enough, however, is Devra Lee Davis, the founder of advocacy group Environmental Health Trust based in Wyoming, US.\n“The limits that we have now … aren’t protective of human health,” she said. “The latest evidence indicates that cell phone and wireless radiation is a human carcinogen.”\nOne of the studies she specified was published last year in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.\nIt found that being on the phone for 17 minutes or more a day for 10 years — or about 1,000 hours of lifetime use — increases the risk of developing a brain tumour.\nDavis wants the exposure limits to be reviewed. For example, the guideline for whole-body exposure level adopted by the WHO and many countries is 10 watts per square metre.\nShe did not, however, go into the specifics of what would be more accurate limits. What she thinks is “essential” as the first step is that the radiation information should come “right on the phone”, as some countries have legislated.\nIn France, for instance, mobile phones come with radiation labelling on the package and a recommendation that the device should be kept away from the stomachs of pregnant women, among other precautions.\nThe country also bans mobile phone advertising aimed at children under 14 years old, as does Belgium for younger children.\nSome people may also want to play it safe, which is why they buy products such as S$68 anti-radiation bracelets.\nTalking Point contacted retailers to find out the best-selling items, and with Pei’s help, tested their effectiveness in blocking the signals sent by a transmitter to a receiver.\nThe sticker, the bracelet, the maternity belly wrap and a stone said to absorb radiation all did not affect the signal quality, which showed that they were “not effective”, she said.\nBut the anti-radiation beanie, which cost $20, had some effect because the signal power dropped.\n“As we can see from the label of this baby cap … there’s some metallic material that reflected the signal,” noted Pei, likening it to the way a metal plate acts as a shield against radiation.\n“This is the extra precaution that you can have to further reduce the RF radiation.”\nDavis said her group has been working to get parents, schools and teachers to understand that “tablets belong on tables” and should, ideally, be wired.\n“You can wire your connections to most of these things. And (the routers) don’t need to be on 24/7,” she said.\nShe thinks mobile phones also “shouldn’t be used much by children”, whom she cited as a vulnerable group along with the elderly, those with pre-existing morbidities and immunocompromised individuals.\n“A child’s head has a thinner skull (than an adult’s). A child’s skull can absorb 10 times more radiation,” she added.\nThe key factor in radiation protection is distance, noted Venkatarayalu. “As we move away from a signal source, the signal strength is going to get … much weaker,” he said, demonstrating this with a transmitter he set up.\nAt 50 centimetres away, its power density hovered around 100 microwatts per square metre. At a metre away — double the initial distance — the reading decreased by a factor of four.\nWhen a phone is in idle mode in one’s pocket, that is a “very low” power mode; and when it is transmitting a call, the power level, though higher, remains below the safety guidelines, Venkatarayalu said.\nEven if a phone gets warm during a call, that is “not necessarily due to RF radiation” as the battery also emits heat, and there can be other factors too.\nRF, by its nature, also does not have “so much energy to cause any damage to the cells”, he added.\nWATCH: Is radiation from our devices dangerous? (22:11)\nBut for people who are still concerned about radiation, he and his university colleague Pei suggest using a hands-free kit or speaker mode to keep the phone further away.\n“They can reduce the amount of time they (spend) using their phone. Maybe shut it off at night,” Pei added. “All these are simple measures that can reduce RF exposure.”\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      Got a mobile phone? Here's how to make your very own animated GIFs
  </h1>, 'text': 'Online “visual” reactions have come a long way since the first sideways smiley-face emoticon appeared four decades ago. Animated GIFs – those files showing a few seconds of choppy motion, like the one of Kermit the Frog flailing his arms excitedly – are ubiquitous in text messages, online forums and chat apps, thanks to the internet’s meme culture.\nBut animated GIFs don’t have to come from the internet. You can make your own GIFs from the photos and videos on your phone. And you may not even need extra software to do so. Here’s a guide.\nA BIT ABOUT GIFS\nWhile they resemble short video clips, animated GIFs have technical differences from videos. Both file types use a series of images to display motion, but GIFs don’t include audio, hence the captions you see on some of them. And the traditional GIF format (which dates to 1987) supports only 256 colors, which are far fewer than many modern video formats – and even newer competing image formats like AV1, also known as AVIF.\nMost GIFs are a few seconds long, play automatically on a loop and have joined emojis as versatile ways to express yourself online.\nAnd GIFs are image files, which can make them easy to share in mail and messages. Some message and keyboard apps even include a GIF library for quick access in your conversations.\n(What is less clear about GIFs is how you pronounce the acronym. Like the peanut butter brand, or like “gift” without the t? The choice is fraught.)\nCREATE A GIF WITH IOS\nThird-party programs are plentiful, but before you head to the App Store, you may be able to whip up a GIF with programs already on your iPhone or iPad. For example, if you’ve captured a worthy shot with Apple’s Live Photos feature (which records the action 1.5 seconds before and after the picture) you can add effects and save it as an animated GIF.\nJust go to the Photos app, open an image from the Live Photos album and tap the gray Live icon in the upper-left corner to add an effect like Loop or Bounce. To convert the live photo to a GIF, open the iOS Shortcuts app for automating actions, or get it from the App Store if you don’t have it already. Search the Shortcuts Gallery for the Make GIF shortcut and add it. Tap the Make GIF icon and select your live photo to convert.\nThe Shortcuts Gallery also holds a Convert Burst to GIF automation that you can use to transform a series of photos taken in burst mode and another, called Video to GIF, that converts video clips.\nCREATE A GIF WITH ANDROID\nOptions for making animated GIFs from photos on an Android-based phone can vary based on the hardware, software and carrier in the mix. Those with certain Samsung Galaxy phones may be able to use the GIF-making features for photos and videos in the free Gallery app.\nIf you use Google Photos on Android (or iOS), you can make an animated GIF from a selection of your pictures. Just tap Library, then Utilities and Create New. Choose Animation, select the photos and tap Create.\nThe burstlike “motion photos” captured on some Google Pixel phones can be converted into animated GIFs right on the device or with a third-party app. (Many Samsung Galaxy phones have a similar “motion photo” feature.)\nFor example, to make an animated GIF on a Google Pixel 4 XL, open Google Photos and select an image saved as a motion photo, or use the search tool to look for “motion photos.” (The Camera app’s settings need to have the Top Shot or motion setting enabled.) When you find a motion photo you want to use, select it and swipe up or tap the three-dot More menu in the top-right corner of the screen. Next, swipe along the row of icons to Export. Tap Export and select the GIF option to save the new file to your photo library.\nUSE A DEDICATED GIF APP\nThe free tools that came with your phone can quickly create a simple GIF, but if you want to add text, have more control over looping or even browse GIF archives for ideas, visit your app store. Many GIF-creation apps are available, and the free Giphy software for Android and iOS is one of the best known. Giphy also has a huge archive of animated GIFs, its own GIF-making tutorial and a best practices guide.\nIf you find Giphy overwhelming, you have plenty of other choices. Many apps are ad-supported but charge a few dollars to ditch the advertisements. They include ImgPlay (for Android and iOS; US$8/S$11 or less); Video to GIF (iOS; US$2) and GIF Maker GIF Editor Pro (Android; US$3). You can even make a GIF out of a selfie clip for a truly personal reaction shot – or just have fun with relatable animal behaviour.\nBy JD Biersdorfer © The New York Times. \nThe article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     mobile ', '     Apple ', '     Samsung ', '     Google ', '     Tech ']}"

      What it’s like test-driving this third-generation Porsche SUV
  </h1>, 'text': ""And just like that, Porsche redeems itself.\nNot all Porsches are made equal, and the German marque’s dominance in the sports car arena hasn't always parlayed as beautifully into other segments.\nFrom its maiden foray into SUVs exactly 20 years ago with the very first Cayenne to the somewhat divisive Panamera four-door sedan, these excursions outside Porsche’s core forte have met success to varying degrees.\nNow along comes the third-generation Macan S with the sporting prowess of a high-performance\xa0beast.\nThe “S” stands for “shiok” or “superb”, if you ask me.\nCornering the bends as the all-wheel drive zigged and zagged its way through the lush, undulating terrain of Mount Faber with a dynamism, agility and surefootedness on our recent test-drive was truly sublime.\nAmong the Macan family, the S variant sits snugly between the base Macan and the range-topping Macan GTS. And, if you’re ever split between choosing the base model versus the S, go for the latter, as it’s a far more superior drive.\nThat is, if the S$40,000 price differential is not a deal-breaker.\nWe test-drove both and the middle child proved itself more worthy of attention, delivering a far more exhilarating experience, with a markedly more powerful and smoother ride.\nFrom behind the new multifunction GT Sport steering wheel adapted from the 911, comparing the two is almost like night and day.\nThe S packs more punch with a 2.9-litre V6 twin-turbo engine that pumps out 280 kW (375 hp) of power (a shade more than before), propelling the vehicle from standstill up to 100 km/h in just 4.6 seconds.\nComparatively, you get a turbocharged four-cylinder engine making 195 kW (261 hp) in the base Macan, for a less brisk century dash of 6.2 seconds – still awesome for an almost two-tonne SUV, though.\nThe base Macan reaches a top speed of 232 km/h and the S goes up to a maximum of 259 km/h.\nRegrettably, we did not get a chance to test-drive the Macan GTS, which completes the Macan range in Singapore. It’s also fitted with a 2.9-litre V6 twin-turbo engine, but serves up a whopping 324 kW (434 hp) of power and bests the century sprint at 4.3 seconds when fitted with the Sport Chrono package.\nAll engines are coupled to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission – shifts are quick, smooth and responsive – as well as the Porsche Traction Management all-wheel drive system, giving the SUV more stability in each of its four drive modes: Sport, Sport Plus, Individual and Normal. \xa0\nThat said, the entry-level Macan is of course the more popular choice, having shifted 600,000 units worldwide since its debut in 2014.\nAnd here’s a bit of Porsche trivia: Around 80 per cent of all Macan buyers are customers new to the Porsche brand, with more women than men opting for the Macan consistently in recent years.\nIn China, Porsche’s largest market for the Macan, for instance, just under 60 per cent of buyers are women.\nSHARPER AND MORE REFINED\nVisually, the compact SUV struts a sharper and more attractive aesthetic to match its enhanced performance.\nAll very subtle, but its new nose with a re-designed spoiler is a little more pleasing to the eye, bookended by a slightly more rounded rump – still unmistakably Porsche with its sloping roof line.\nOne thing you can always expect from Porsche is choice. Every variant offers additional options like the Sport Chrono package that boosts performance, not to mention the suite of parking and safety assistance and other digital enhancements you can add on.\nThe carmaker is as much a lifestyle brand with its assortment of aesthetic options. You can choose, for example, from a total of 14 colours to clothe your Macan, including new shades like Papaya Metallic and Gentian Blue Metallic, as well as Python Green for the Macan GTS with the GTS Sport package.\nTake your pick also from seven new wheel designs, with larger wheels now fitted as standard: 19 inches for the base Macan, 20 inches for the Macan S, and 21 inches for the Macan GTS.\nHEIGHTENED TACTILE PLEASURE\nInside the cockpit, the newly designed centre console is now very neatly arranged and its touch surface controls are a lovely upgrade from previous tactile buttons. Topped with an analogue clock on the dashboard for even sportier feels.\nIt's a cinch to pair your phone to the Porsche Connect operating system and, might I add, enhanced performance also meets enhanced pleasure as the digital interface of the 10.9-inch full HD touch display is a joy to behold.\nAnd expect nothing less than premium acoustics with your music flowing through BOSE or higher end Burmester surround sound systems.\nJust two niggles, though: The new, shorter selector lever is not as wieldy as one would hope, and there was no wireless charging in the unit we drove. No USB Type A ports either, so my poor iPhone was positively parched by the end of the day.\nAs a final footnote, this Macan is most likely the last of its kind to be equipped with a pure internal combustion engine, as the entire automotive industry hurtles toward an electric future. So if you love some throaty vocals, grab the S while you still can.\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nPORSCHE MACAN\nENGINE: 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder turbo\nPOWER: 195 kW (261 hp)\nTORQUE: 400 Nm\nTRANSMISSION: Seven-speed dual-clutch with manual select\nACCELERATION (0-100KM/H): 6.2 seconds\nTOP SPEED: 232 km/h\nFUEL CONSUMPTION (combined): 10.7 l/100 km\nPRICE: From S$260,088\nPORSCHE MACAN S\nENGINE: 2.9-litre V6,\xa0twin-turbo\nPOWER: 280 kW (375 hp)\nTORQUE: 520 Nm\nTRANSMISSION: Seven-speed dual-clutch with manual select\nACCELERATION (0-100KM/H): 4.6 seconds\nTOP SPEED: 259 km/h\nFUEL CONSUMPTION (combined): 11.7 l/100 km\nPRICE: From S$299,988\n"", 'related_topics': ['     cars ', '     technology ']}"

      Four resolutions for a healthier tech life in 2022
  </h1>, 'text': 'The COVID-19 pandemic has been packed with plenty of nasty tech surprises.\nWe ran into the problem of a perpetual scarcity of hardware, like game consoles and graphics cards. Apple this year announced a major change to its data practices, including a tool to scan iPhones for child pornography, which critics labelled an invasion of privacy. And many of us who tried ordering high-quality face masks to protect ourselves from the coronavirus had to swim through an ocean of fakes.\nYet there was a silver lining to all this: Valuable lessons to improve our relationship with tech for years to come, like becoming savvier online shoppers and taking control of our personal data.\nThink of it as New Year’s resolutions, but for tech. Here are my top recommendations.\nRESOLUTION 1: INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST\nThe pandemic, which drove many white-collar professionals to work from home, showed how many of us had sluggish internet connections. That underlined how little we tend to invest in our tech infrastructure, like the networking equipment and broadband services that power the internet connection for our devices.\nWhen people spend on technology, they generally buy gadgets before all else. Electronics like video streaming sticks were among the top-selling items on Black Friday, according to a research report published last month by Adobe.\nBut we should spend on infrastructure before devices. One-fifth of consumers hold on to their routers for more than four years, according to a survey this year from Consumer Reports. That’s cutting it close, since we should upgrade our Wi-Fi routers every three to five years, wireless experts say. New routers introduce new Wi-Fi standards that improve speeds and techniques to mitigate network congestion, making it easier for multiple devices throughout a home\xa0– like laptops and game consoles\xa0– to get a robust internet connection.\nIf your router is fairly new and your connection remains subpar, look to your internet service provider. The broadband plan you subscribed to many years ago may no longer be sufficient, so consider investing in a faster plan. If your household streams lots of video and plays games online, shoot for roughly 40 megabits a second.\nRESOLUTION 2: CHECK BEFORE YOU CLICK THE BUY BUTTON\nIf you tried buying a high-quality face mask online in the pandemic, you probably ran into a fair number of fakes. Counterfeiters have flooded the market with poorly constructed masks, a problem that still persists today.\nWhile fake goods online have long been a problem, the pandemic has made the issue potentially life-threatening with masks. Amazon and other retailers have policies to ban sellers of fake masks, but new sellers with phony masks constantly emerge. It has become a game of whack-a-mole.\nThe lesson? Always vet before you click the buy button. Read buyer reviews. Check the seller and if it’s an unknown brand, research its reputation. Some online tools like Fakespot can scan a product page to look for signs of phoney products and fake reviews.\nBe especially careful when buying anything that can affect someone’s health, including vitamins and dog food. When in doubt, buy these goods at a reputable brick-and-mortar store.\nRESOLUTION 3: PRACTICE SELF-RELIANCE WITH YOUR DIGITAL DATA\nApple, which has long portrayed itself as a defender of digital privacy, delivered one of the year’s biggest tech surprises.\nIn August, the company announced a software update with a twist. The software included a tool to scan iPhones for code linked to a database of known child pornography. Once a number of matches were detected, an Apple employee could review the photos before informing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nApple’s positive intent of preventing child abuse imagery from spreading was quickly overshadowed by the invasive implications of its content-flagging system, which ran counter to the company’s pro-privacy image. In response to the backlash, Apple postponed the software feature’s release and clarified that the technology could be disabled if people opted out of backing up their images to iCloud.\nThe episode was a reminder that when we use cloud services, our data is at the whims of a tech company. The lesson? We should consider changing how we manage our data so that we are more independent of the big companies and their cloud services.\nTaking a hybrid approach to our data is the best way forward, security experts advised. That involves backing up our data to the cloud but also storing it on devices like physical drives and miniature USB sticks. Having such a local backup ensures that you have access to important files even if there’s an internet outage. And if you become unhappy with a cloud service or get tired of paying subscription fees, you have an easy exit because you already have a copy of your information.\nOnly 17 per cent of people take the hybrid approach, according to Acronis, a data protection firm. Don’t procrastinate: The longer you wait to create local backups of your data, the harder it is to pull it out of a cloud service if you decide to leave.\nRESOLUTION 4: SKIP THE ONLINE SALES EVENTS \nLast month, many shoppers who tried snatching up deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday quickly learned there was something amiss.\nMany items that we typically buy at a discount, like new Wi-Fi routers and cheap laptops, were either not on sale or out of stock. That was largely the result of a global chip shortage and disrupted supply chains, which have snarled manufacturing and the shipping of items around the world.\nWaiting until Black Friday to splurge has rarely been wise, but the pandemic-induced scarcity has made this clearer than ever. All year round, deals often emerge that are just as good\xa0– and sometimes better\xa0– than the promotions on Black Friday.\nThe tricky part is knowing when the cool stuff is cheaper. There are many ways to scout for discounts, like following sites that alert you to sales. Our sister publication Wirecutter tracks deals on its Twitter account and website, for example.\nAutomated tools like Camel Camel Camel, a website that lets you plug in products sold on Amazon and set up email alerts for a price drop, can also help track promotions for specific items. In the future, you can get ahead of the holiday shopping frenzy and potentially skip Black Friday.\nBy Brian X Chen © 2021 The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Musk, Bezos lead the charge of US billionaires selling shares
  </h1>, 'text': 'Mark Zuckerberg sold Meta Platforms\xa0stock almost every weekday of this year.\nThe founders of Google began to unload shares in May, which is also when two of the three Airbnb co-founders started diversifying their stakes.\xa0\nThe transactions are part of a surge of selling by the very richest Americans. They unloaded US$42.9 billion in stock through the start of December, more than double the US$20.2 billion they sold in all of 2020, according to an analysis of transactions by US\xa0billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the world’s richest 500 people.\nThe super-wealthy often hold onto shares in the companies that made their fortunes, because realising gains triggers a tax bill. But many rich Americans are deciding to unload shares now, while stock valuations are at records and before their taxes potentially rise at the start of 2022.\n“A lot of our clients are selling,” said Elizabeth Sevilla, a partner at Seiler LLP, an advisory firm based in the San Francisco Bay area. Founders and venture capitalists are deciding they want to diversify concentrated positions, or “they’re looking at the market and saying, ‘We’re at the top of the market.’”\nPlus, biting the tax bullet in 2021 may mean avoiding rate hikes in future years, she said.\nSeveral of the world’s richest people have been selling core holdings after years of hibernation, including Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the reclusive co-founders of Google. So far this year, Page has sold around US$1.8 billion in stock of Google parent Alphabet\xa0and Brin around US$1.7 billion. It was the first time either had sold shares since 2017.\xa0\nElon Musk, the world’s richest person, has unloaded about US$12.7 billion in Tesla shares this year, the first time he’s sold stock since 2016. The selling streak was unleashed after the billionaire, who has a personal fortune of US$253.6 billion, asked in a Twitter poll last month whether he should divest 10 per cent of his shares in the electric-auto maker.\n“Much is made lately of unrealised gains being a means of tax avoidance,” he tweeted, promising to abide by the poll’s results.\nMichael Dell, founder and chief executive officer of Dell Technologies, hadn’t sold shares of his company in at least two years, or since it returned to public markets in 2018. So far this year, he’s disposed of about US$500 million.\nWhether avoiding taxes was their goal or not, selling in 2021 could help these billionaires save billions of dollars. Even as Musk framed his sales as tied to the outcome of a Twitter poll, some of the sale was pre-planned and displayed canny awareness of tax liabilities, both at the federal and state level.\nWhile Democrats have dropped several ideas to hike taxes on the top 0.1 per cent to pay for President Joe Biden’s economic agenda, the bill that passed the House of Representatives last month included a millionaire’s surtax, a 5 per cent levy on incomes over US$10 million and an additional 3 per cent tax on those above US$25 million.\nThe surtax, which is projected by the Joint Committee on Taxation to raise US$228 billion over the next decade, applies to a broader definition of income, including capital gains, making it harder to avoid through deductions. It wouldn’t go into effect until 2022, however, giving the super-wealthy an opportunity to sell now and over the next couple weeks, saving as much as 8 per cent on taxes.\n“It’s not an exodus from the market,” Seiler’s Sevilla said. Instead, planners are sitting down with wealthy tech clients and gauging the impact of the surtax and other tax proposals, then calculating how much investments would need to rise to justify holding onto them. “If they know they cannot exceed that, the decision is easy,” Sevilla said.\nThe 167 Americans on the Bloomberg index are worth about US$3.6 trillion, up 47 per cent since the beginning of last year. Their wealth gains have been driven by a rapid run-up in stock valuations during that period, with the S&P 500 Index up about 45 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gaining 75 per cent.\nThe top billionaires’ stock sales have soared faster than their wealth. In 2019, the richest Americans sold just US$6.6 billion of stock, a similar amount as in previous years.\xa0\nThe selling really picked up in 2020, as Democratic candidates were on the campaign trail proposing to raise rates on the rich. Advisers spent much of the year warning of higher taxes as early as 2021 if Democrats took over.\nMeanwhile, stock valuations were surging last year, particularly in tech stocks benefiting from trends unleashed by the pandemic.\nNvidia\xa0co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang sold shares in the chipmaker in July 2020 as it was hitting new highs, his first sales in almost three years. The stock price has nearly tripled since then, and Huang’s sales have accelerated as well. He’s sold US$426 million so far this year, on top of US$168 million in 2020.\nAnother factor driving sales is a wave of initial public offerings, which made it possible for founders of successful startups to diversify their fortunes for the first time.\nTwo of Airbnb Inc.’s three cofounders -\xa0Joseph Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk - have together sold more than US$1 billion worth of stock since the vacation-rental company went public in December of last year. Another co-founder, CEO Brian Chesky, hasn’t sold any shares this year, according to filings.\xa0\nEven as US\xa0billionaires sell more, their stock purchases are stagnant. Americans on the Bloomberg index bought US$543 million of shares on the open market through Dec\xa03, an increase from last year but less than half their purchases in 2018. The analysis doesn’t take into account other ways billionaires acquire shares, such as stock grants or option awards that are part of compensation packages.\nThe richest Americans could have a variety of personal reasons for selling now, including funding charitable endeavors.\nJeff Bezos, the world’s second-richest person, has sold more than US$9 billion in Amazon.com this year, money that he could use to deliver on recent grants and pledges to fight climate change through his Bezos Earth Fund.\nZuckerberg is liquidating more Meta stock - formerly known as Facebook -\xa0than he has in years, largely to send to his Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. He’s sold US$4.5 billion this year, nearly eight times more than he sold in 2020. Six years ago he and his wife Priscilla Chan pledged to give 99 per cent of their wealth to charity during their lifetimes.\nJack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, has sold nearly US$500 million in stock this year of another company he founded, Block. Last year he announced a promise to donate a large stake in the company, formerly known as Square, to COVID-19 relief. (The billionaire has mostly not touched his Twitter shares, which comprises less than 10 per cent of his US$10.4 billion net worth, according to the Bloomberg index.)\xa0\nIt’s taken all year for Biden and congressional Democrats to coalesce around a tax bill. Along the way, Biden proposed a variety of other provisions targeting the wealthy, including an almost-doubling of the capital-gains tax rate for high earners. Most of those ideas have been dropped, and new proposals - like a so-called “billionaire’s tax” on unrealised capital gains of publicly traded assets - also didn’t make it into the House-passed bill.\n“It’s been a bit of a roller coaster,” said Pratik Patel, managing director of family wealth strategies at BMO Family Office.\nEven now, it’s not clear what the final changes might look like. Negotiations may slip into 2022, assuming Democrats can pass anything at all.\xa0\n“Everyone feels like taxes are going up,” Patel said. But “there’s still uncertainty. A lot of our clients are in a wait-and-see approach.”\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Stocks ']}"

      You may now kiss the avatar: What's it like to get married in the metaverse?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Traci and Dave Gagnon met in the cloud, so it only made sense that their wedding took place in it. On Labour Day weekend, the couple – or rather, their digital avatars – held a ceremony staged by Virbela, a company that builds virtual environments for work, learning and events.\nTraci Gagnon’s avatar was walked down the aisle by the avatar of her close friend. Dave Gagnon’s avatar watched as his buddy’s avatar ambled up to the stage and delivered a toast. And seven-year-old twin avatars (the ring bearer and flower girl) danced at the reception.\nHow the immersive virtual world known as the metaverse, which few of us understand, will change the traditional wedding is, at the moment, anyone’s guess. But the possibilities of having an event unfettered by the bounds of reality are interesting enough to consider.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology is already being incorporated into ceremonies more than ever. Zoom weddings have taken place, and some in-person ceremonies now feature a livestream component for guests who cannot be there. Last year, a couple whose wedding was cancelled because of the pandemic staged a (non legal) ceremony within Animal Crossing, a popular video game.\nLike a ceremony within a video game, any weddings that occur solely in the metaverse are currently not legal. (Even virtual weddings by videoconference, which many states allowed during the height of the pandemic shutdowns, have since been outlawed in New York state and elsewhere.) Still, the metaverse will take these virtual celebrations much, much further, experts say, and offer almost boundless possibilities to couples.\n“There’s no limitations,” said Sandy Hammer, a founder of Allseated, which creates digital planning tools for weddings. The company is investing in the metaverse by creating virtual versions of real-world event spaces like the Plaza Hotel in New York. “If you really want to do something different, in the metaverse you might as well let your creativity go wild.”\nThink guest lists that number in the thousands. Gift registries that feature NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. Maybe even destination weddings in space.\n“They’re going to take their friends on a space rocket,” Hammer said, adding that she envisions wedding parties globe-trotting virtually. “A bride can transport her guests into the metaverse: ‘I want my morning session to be in Italy, my evening session to be in Paris.’”\nNathalie Cadet-James, a wedding planner and designer based in Miami, is approaching the metaverse with “a beginner’s mind of excitement,” and trying to anticipate how her role will change. “I think my role might be more like a producer or film director,” Cadet-James said. “I could create a set that I’ve enhanced. Flowers might come out of the ground as you’re walking into the space. I would add whimsy and fantasy to it – because we could.”\nOf course, this would require the skills of a software engineer, a role not in any typical wedding budget at the moment.\nThe Gagnons had a hybrid wedding of sorts. The two were married in person Sept\xa04 at Atkinson Resort; Country Club in New Hampshire, where they live, in a ceremony officiated by David Oleary, a friend and colleague of theirs ordained by the Universal Life Church, while simultaneously hosting a virtual ceremony in Virbela.\nThey livestreamed their nuptials for those who could not be there in person. Guests of the virtual ceremony attended via computer, which required downloading software and then creating an avatar.\nBoth Traci Gagnon, 52, and her husband, 60, work as agents at eXp Realty. The brokerage has embraced virtual work and the metaverse and is part of eXp World Holdings, which also owns Virbela.\nBefore the couple met in person, their avatars met at a company event in Las Vegas in 2015. And when they announced their engagement in 2019, their co-workers offered to remake Virbela’s cloud campus into a wedding venue, free of charge. (Traci Gagnon estimated that it would have cost US$30,000 (S$40,850) had they paid for it; representatives for Virbela declined to disclose a price for the event.)\nThe Gagnons sent pictures of themselves and their wedding decor to Virbela’s events team and software engineers, who incorporated personalised details like bird of paradise flowers and images of their in-person venue into the virtual ceremony.\xa0\n“They were able to take my wedding dress and customide it, and take a little flower halo and put it on my hair,” Traci Gagnon said.\nPatrick Perry, director of event sales and partnerships for Virbela, said the cost of holding an event in the metaverse “depends on what you want,” adding, “if there’s an engineer building out an MGM ballroom or something of that nature, then the cost goes up,” ranging from a few thousand dollars to well over US$10,000.\nBut, Perry said, as the metaverse gets built out, “there’s going to be more plug and play assets.” Wedding couples will be able to select from predesigned venues, flowers, tablescapes, dresses, musical entertainment and other elements.\nVirbela was designed to be an immersive platform for organisations to host events and build a sense of community in the metaverse. But users have asked the company to host graduations, bar mitzvahs, weddings and other celebrations. Lately, Perry said, Virbela has started to explore the wedding market and is in the planning stages with a few couples.\nHammer said Allseated has not yet worked with a couple interested in having a wedding that only takes place in the metaverse. In addition to the legality of such a ceremony, a hybrid event like the Gagnons’ is “much more in-demand and realistic,” she said, “because couples want both in-person and virtual experiences.”\nFor Traci Gagnon, who hired two videographers, one to capture the in-person event and another to simulcast the ceremony to the cloud, the whole point of the metaverse element was the connection it offered.\nHer maid of honor, who is ill, was still able to walk her down the aisle, if virtually. And Dave Gagnon’s friend, who was unable to attend because his wife has preexisting health conditions, could deliver his toast. The experience of moving through a virtual world as an avatar – a kind of idealised version of yourself – creates a more immersive, emotionally satisfying experience than Zoom, Traci Gagnon said.\n“There is a different level of connection” with the metaverse, she said.\nBeing a metaverse bride had other benefits, too.\n“I’m always a size 4, even in January,” she said, laughing. “And I never have a bad hair day.”\nBy Steven Kurutz © The New York Times.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     weddings ', '     metaverse ', '     fashion ', '     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      How to use your phone’s privacy-protection tools so personal data doesn’t get compromised
  </h1>, 'text': 'Concerned about how your data is being used by apps and websites? Apple’s iOS 15 and Google’s Android 12 operating systems beefed up their privacy controls this year to give you more warnings – and options – when a site or service wants to use personal information like location or browser clicks.\nHere’s a quick guide to those settings.\nSYSTEM SETTINGS\nIn iOS or Android, open the Settings app by tap (or by voice) and select Privacy. You’ll find several screens, menus and switches for restricting access to the phone’s hardware (like the microphone) and software (like your contacts list) on an app-by-app basis. Android 12 includes a privacy dashboard to show what apps have been up to, as well as shortcuts to managing the information that Google collects and stores in one’s Google Account.\nIf you are curious, Apple and Google have posted statements about how they use your data. Keep in mind that blocking web trackers and location information can make your free apps work differently, and many news and cultural sites use tracking software. But if you want more control over your information, here are some specific categories to hit.\nLOCATION\xa0\nYour phone’s location services feature can pinpoint your whereabouts on a map, which is vital for things like providing driving directions. However, in recent versions of iOS and Android, you can share an approximate location instead of a precise one for slightly more privacy.\nOn an iOS 15 device, open the Settings app and go to Privacy, then to Location Services and then System Services. Here, you can disable or enable location services and control which third-party apps (including Google’s software) can use your coordinates – or when\xa0they have permission to use that information. Scroll all the way down the list and select System Services to see how the iPhone uses your location, like collecting your “significant locations” such as your home address; you can turn this off or wipe the history if you find it invasive.\nOn a phone running Android 12, open the Settings app and tap Location to open the controls and to see which apps have permission to use your location. Tap Location Services to get to more settings; you can also manage the Location History setting that records your wanderings. (Google’s business model includes serving up customised ads and services based on your personal information, so your user experience may be affected.)\nAPPS AND ADS\nApple’s App Tracking Transparency feature warns you when an app wants to monitor your online activity, typically for the purpose of targeted advertising. In iOS 15 Settings, tap Privacy and then Tracking to get to the controls. (While Apple’s own advertising platform claims not to share personally identifiable data with others, you can turn off those ads in the Apple Advertising area of the Privacy settings.)\nIn Android 12, open the Settings and select Privacy to get to a slew of controls, including the Ads option for avoiding targeted ads by deleting one’s Advertising ID. And this month, Google announced that Android will automatically turn off permissions for apps you haven’t used in awhile.\nWEB\nBrowsers have been used for decades to track you through cookies and other code that observes your activity for use in marketing and advertising. (Safari’s Private Browsing and Chrome’s Incognito mode keep a surfing session from being stored, but these aren’t much help against browser trackers.)\nApple’s Safari browser includes tools to block tracking; go to Settings, then Safari, and scroll down to the Privacy; Security to make adjustments. The settings for Google’s Chrome browser have a Privacy and Security section, too, where you can request that sites do not track you, although some do anyway.\nSwitching to a privacy-focused browser app like Brave or DuckDuckGo is another way to ditch many web trackers. DuckDuckGo recently announced its own App Tracking Protection Tool and an email protection feature for the Android edition of its DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser; these are in a public testing phase.\nMAIL\nIn some messages, advertisers may use a “tracking pixel” – a tiny hidden image that reports back to the sender when you open the message (among other things). Apple’s iOS 15 includes its own tool to help block mail trackers. To enable it, go to Settings, then to Mail, select Privacy Protection and tap on Protect Mail Activity.\nIn the Gmail app for Android or iOS, you can stop images from automatically loading and squealing on your activity. Just tap open the Menu icon in the top-left corner, choose Settings, then your account name, and in the Images area choose the “Ask before displaying external images …” option. And you can always block or unsubscribe from unwanted mailing-list messages.\nBy JD\xa0Biersdorfer\xa0© The New York Times.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     mobile ', '     Apple ', '     Google ', '     Tech ']}"

      Commentary: Can we finally fix iPhones at neighbourhood shops without voiding warranty?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Sometimes, all Apple users want is to get their iPhone repaired - without long wait times or costly tabs nudging them into thinking replacing it with the latest model might actually be more worthwhile.\nCan they now rejoice? Apple announced on Nov 17 it’ll release self-service repair kits next year, starting with the most common parts like screens, batteries and cameras.\nAll brands try to control customer experiences from start to end, to ensure positive encounters, maintain long-lasting relationships, and establish brand loyalty.\nAnd Apple has been strict on imposing this in repairs. You make an appointment to visit its “Genius Bar” – three in Singapore - or authorised service providers, where certified technicians use only genuine Apple parts. \nBy restricting the use of unauthorised parts often by claiming this could compromise consumer safety, Apple can meticulously maintain product quality while maintaining sales. \nBringing customers into physical stores can also further immerse them in its carefully curated product universe.\nNews of this dramatic policy reversal has sent ripples of excitement among Apple fans and “right to repair” advocates, allowing consumers to potentially engage a third-party technician or make repairs themselves with original parts.\nBut does this mean users can now pop into their heartland handphone shops for a cheaper quick fix?\nNo one knows yet how much the self-repair kits and genuine parts will cost. So it’s uncertain how much value users can get out of self-repair.\nBut even on the assumption that it’ll continue to be cheaper to get repairs done in a third-party shop with Apple kits, this will certainly entail some manner of trade-off.\nSuch trade-offs in repair policy are not unheard of - even Samsung has them.\nA phone call with Samsung’s service centre and the warranty policy on their website provided guidelines that subtly direct customers to choose its repair service or to choose stores using authorised Samsung parts. \nFor instance, consumers can directly purchase limited parts from Samsung directly and fix devices under their responsibility. However, if we get it repaired by parties other than authorised service centres, warranty limitations and exclusions kick in if we need subsequent repairs by Samsung and will incur charges even within the warranty period. \nAnother clause in the same section of the warranty is on replacement with unapproved parts. Samsung may charge for repair services or even restrict it if authorised parts weren’t used. \xa0\nWhile Samsung is less prescriptive about repair services, customers need to take responsibility if the damage is occurred by seeking repairs outside the company’s preferred setting.\nSo when we see out-of-warranty repair costs displayed on Apple’s website – S$669 for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, users will definitely want to keep an eye on how much Apple will price the self-service kits.\nBut a major aspect to watch is how Apple will apply its warranty policy, if self-repair is done by users or third-party repair shops (let alone repairs potentially using unauthorised parts, which may further lower the cost). Some may push for Apple to extend warranties in such scenarios.\nIts warranty policy currently includes a prominent reminder in bold not to open the device and that damage from doing so isn’t covered by the warranty. Elsewhere in the policy similarly excludes damage caused by third party components or non-representative servicing. \nIf Apple changes its policy, chances are it might introduce terms similar to Samsung’s – to entice users to stay within their management.\nWhether it will go further and keep the warranty intact remains unknown. It will partly depend on how sincere this shift towards the right to repair is and their business model. Eventually, the warranty terms on the usage of a self-repair kit will influence the pricing of the self-repair kit. \nMake no mistake, even if this is a more customer-friendly policy change, Apple will still see advantages from a marketing standpoint.\nThis new initiative diversifies its intangible repair service by adding a tangible self-service repair product. Apple plans to distribute not just the authorised parts but also the manuals and tools for customers \nA creative way to position this could be to sell an “Apple repair experience” for tech-savvy customers. With a good marketing strategy, it can be a fun – and lucrative - DIY product line that makes die-hard Apple fans feel like their own “Genius Bar”. \nApple can also better segment customers seeking repairs, matching various needs with repair services and products. \nTech enthusiasts keen on getting their hands dirty can delve further into the inner workings on their treasured devices. This may increase Apple’s brand loyalty – though this is already at an all-time high of 92 per cent according to a 2021 survey of US smartphone users. \nAn experience or culture of self-repair can be amplified and expand online Apple communities such as through sharing tips, teardowns and guided how-to videos.\nFor those who care more about the reliability of repairs but prefer to incur a lower cost, Apple can continue to maintain product quality by making it easier for more users to choose genuine parts. They can simply order the kit and turn to local technicians providing the repair service at a lower cost or try doing it themselves.\nConsumers who don’t enjoy reading fine disclaimer prints about their warranty or don’t mind paying Apple’s prices to avoid uncertainties with independent repair shops will return to the Apple store.\nSuch customer segmentation will likely reduce demands on Apple’s repair service personnel. Wait times will become more manageable in-store for those in need of serious repairs or for product purchases. \nAt the same time, Apple will maintain or even see an increase in its revenue stream by converting part of its manual-intensive labour into “authorised parts products.” \nAfter years of resistance, the timing of Apple’s reversal of its strict repair policy follows months of growing pressure from repair activists, regulators, and a shareholder resolution, which environmental advocates filed with the company in September.\nThis timely move may pre-empt potential regulatory action from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) involving unlawful “right to repair” restrictions,” which made it official for the agency to investigate unlawful repair restrictions.\nWhatever Apple’s intention, having this additional option for repairs is better than none. \nApple’s self-service repair will start only with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 in the United States in early 2022.

      Digital regulations needed to build trust so people, businesses have confidence participating in digital domain: Josephine Teo
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: There is a ""growing international consensus"" that digital regulations are needed to build trust, so\xa0people and businesses continue to have ""a sense of confidence"" participating in the digital domain, said Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo on Wednesday (Dec 1).\xa0\nMrs Teo was speaking to reporters during a\xa0work trip to London, where the Singapore Government signed three Memorandums\xa0of Understanding (MOUs) with the UK.\xa0These MOUs are in the areas of digital trade facilitation, digital identities and cybersecurity.\xa0\n""The MOUs between Singapore and the UK will further support opportunities to grow the digital delivery of cross-border services between Singapore and the UK, provide a basis for working closely with like-minded digital partners, and help set a global benchmark on high standards for digital cooperation to bring economic and societal benefits to both countries,"" said\xa0the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI).\nMrs Teo also participated in the Future Tech Forum, where she met with key government and industry leaders to discuss Singapore\'s approach to digital regulations.\xa0\nIn every aspect of\xa0daily lives, there are some regulations to make sure that there is safety, Mrs Teo told reporters.\n""And so the same in the digital domain. People, citizens of every country will expect that someone is regulating the delivery of digital services to make sure that they don\'t do\xa0individuals as well as society harm,"" she said.\xa0\n""Of course online harm is just one aspect of it. But the new regulations are intended, at least at the start of the design process, to recognise\xa0the need to protect the users from online threats.""\xa0\nMrs Teo said\xa0that\xa0there has been ""an erosion of trust"" in how digital technologies can be applied.\xa0Digital regulations are ""very much needed in order to build trust"", she said.\nIn response to questions about whether the Government plans\xa0to clamp down\xa0on big tech companies, such as Facebook, Mrs Teo said Singapore adopts a ""collaborative approach"".\xa0\n""We\'d like to bring them into the conversation. We\'d like to involve them in designing the solutions for them. And so that\'s going to be still the approach that we take. It does not mean, however, that when regulations are needed, we won\'t go ahead with them,"" she said.\n""But even in designing the interventions, whether it\'s laws or updating our codes of practices, we would want to engage with all the companies, the representatives, including the tech giants, to understand how it will impact them or not impact them.""\xa0\nAt the forum, Mrs Teo also\xa0noted\xa0interest from other countries\xa0in how digital technologies have helped Singapore combat the spread of COVID-19, but at the same time, ""how\xa0appropriate regulations were needed to give people the confidence that the technology is trusted and that it isn\'t used against them"".\xa0\nFor example, participants were interested in ""how POFMA (Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act) had been invoked several times"" to address misinformation related to COVID-19, such as falsehoods about vaccines, she said.\xa0\nParticipants from other countries were also interested in the TraceTogether app, she added.\n""The fact that I shared that people were able to trust it enough to use it every day to perform check-ins. It intrigued other participants that the number of check-ins that are\xa0tracked on TraceTogether and SafeEntry exceeds 10 million every day. That\'s something that\'s quite interesting to them,"" she said.\xa0\n""They were very curious about\xa0Singaporeans\' acceptance of a tracking device, like\xa0what technology did we use in order to give people the assurance that it\'s\xa0not a Big Brother\xa0watching them.""\nWhen asked by reporters whether a law like POFMA\xa0is at odds with the Government\'s ""light touch"" to regulations, Mrs Teo said there must always be balance.\xa0\nShe said that ""in essence, a law like POFMA says our society value truthfulness"".\n""In public discourse, we can disagree with others, we can have different opinions, but they have to be grounded in facts. If public discourse is based on falsehoods, then I think we have a problem,"" she said.\xa0\n""Does it mean that as a result of upholding this value, each one of us has to be constrained in some way? The answer is yes. But does it prevent you from expressing your views (and)\xa0participating actively? I think even after POFMA has been\xa0enacted and put into effect, the kind of participation in the online space has not reduced. It has only gone up.""\nWhen we think about regulations, ""it is always a fine balance"", she added. ""It is about doing things not too early, not too late.""\n""We don\'t\xa0rely only on rules and regulations and laws, even though we will certainly not avoid them ... When it comes to regulating the digital domain because it is changing so fast, we cannot approach it believing that we will get every piece of intervention right the first time.\n""But at the same time, we must have the courage to stay the course if we think that what we\'re doing is actually producing the results.""\xa0\nThe need for balance means there is\xa0""a lot of judgment involved"", said Mrs Teo.\n""And this judgment has to be grounded on our understanding of the technology ... and an objective assessment of the impact on individuals and on society.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Josephine Teo ']}"

      The best tech gifts for Christmas that aren't gadgets
  </h1>, 'text': 'My favorite holiday tech gift doesn’t require batteries or software updates. It’s not even a gadget, though it was made with technology.\nCan you guess what it is?\nA few years ago, my wife experimented with her iPad and a digital stylus to make digital illustrations. Using Procreate, a drawing app, she loaded a photo of our beloved corgi, Max, as a reference to trace over before embellishing the image with a polka-dot bow tie and a cartoonishly long tongue. I liked it so much that I picked a background color that would complement our home and uploaded the illustration to the app Keepsake, a printing service that assembles your images in a nice frame before delivering it to your door.\nA large, framed portrait of Max now hangs as a centerpiece in our living room in all its two-dimensional glory. It makes me smile and is always a conversation starter when we have guests over. That’s more than I can say about other tech gifts that I’ve received over the years, such as video games and smart speakers, which only brought short-lived joy.\nThis type of gifting exercise –\xa0tech-adjacent presents that don’t involve hardware or thoughtless Best Buy gift cards –\xa0may be especially welcome this year. That’s because we are living in a pandemic-induced era of scarcity driven by a global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions that have made conventional gifts difficult to buy. (Anyone trying to buy a game console for the last year understands this pain.)\nSo here’s a list of ideas for tech gifts we can give without actually buying tech, from the presents you can create to experiences that will last a lifetime.\nTHE GIFT OF FIXING\nLast week, I told a friend I had a special present for her: I would fix her iPhone problem.\nShe had complained to me about her five-year-old iPhone SE. The device could no longer take photos or install software updates because nearly all of the device’s data storage was used up.\nSo before she left for her Thanksgiving vacation, I met her for lunch and walked her through the process of backing up photos to an external drive before purging all the images from the device. Then I plugged her phone into a computer to back up all her data before installing the new operating system.\nShe was thrilled to have this problem fixed before her trip. She can now take lots of photos on vacation. Plus, a new Apple software update has a tool to add a digital vaccine card to the iPhone’s wallet app, which makes holiday travel slightly less stressful in the pandemic.\nFor those who are somewhat tech savvy, this may serve as a template. Listen to your loved ones’ complaints about their tech and offer the gift of solving the problem. If it’s a sluggish Wi-Fi connection, see if you can diagnose the issue to boost speeds. If it’s a short-lived phone battery, consider taking them to a repair shop to get the battery replaced for a small sum.\nIn some ways, this beats giving a brand-new gadget because it spares them the hassle of learning how to use a new piece of tech.\nTHE GIFT OF CREATION\nApart from the example of the digital illustration of my dog, there are plenty of other ways we can use tech to create for friends and family.\nFor one, I’m a fan of photo books that can easily be created with web tools. A few years ago, a colleague’s Secret Santa gift for me was a calendar she made using Google’s photo books service. She created it by pulling photos from my dog’s Instagram account and compiling them into a calendar –\xa0each month was a different photo of Max posing next to an entree cooked by my wife and me. I was delighted.\nIn general, photo-printing services offer nice ways to turn digital photos into physical keepsakes in the form of old-school, large prints and even mugs and Christmas ornaments.\xa0\xa0\nTHE GIFT OF KNOWLEDGE\nBefore the pandemic upended our lives, my wife bought a DSLR, the type of digital camera used by professionals, with the goal of learning more about digital photography. Then the lockdowns happened, vacations turned into staycations and the camera ended up living in a drawer.\nMy plan for a holiday present for my wife is a two-hour digital photography lesson with a photo studio in San Francisco that takes students on a stroll across the Golden Gate Bridge while teaching the fundamentals of photography. (Hopefully she doesn’t read this column.)\nWhat would your friends and family like to learn? We have plenty of options for potential gift classes, since the pandemic drove many teachers to offer virtual instruction online, including for cooking lessons and workout routines. The gift of knowledge goes a long way and sometimes gives back, like when the recipient of online cooking lessons uses that newfound knowledge to make you dinner.\nTHE GIFT OF NO TECH\nThe pandemic may have exposed us to more screen time than we could ever imagine enduring, so a great gift this year could also be anything that takes our attention away from tech.\nThat could be renting a cabin in an area with no cellular service, tickets to a play, a winter hike and a picnic — anything that gives us respite from our inevitable return to screens.\nBy Brian X Chen © The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Christmas ', '     shopping ', '     technology ']}"

      Femtech in Singapore: Is women-centric health technology the next big thing?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Healthcare technology tailored for women is a booming market, with global funding for start-ups in the sector crossing the US$1 billion mark for the first time this year.\nGiven that women make up half the population of the world, the sector has a huge potential market, but it is also a market that has historically been underserved, especially in Asia, said experts.\nExacerbating the problem, many women themselves lack awareness of their health issues.\nHealthcare industry analyst Suchismita Das of Frost and Sullivan calls female technology (femtech) the “stepchild” of digital health.\nShe argues that it is time to go beyond general health treatments that do not take gender differences into account.\nFemtech refers to products that use technology to improve women’s health.\n“Women’s health is usually misunderstood as just reproductive health. But a woman’s body shape and a man’s body shape are different. Yet, when a woman goes for hip replacement surgery, she is receiving general prosthetic implants that were designed by a man, on a man and for a man – because the clinical trials were conducted on a basis of a man’s body and body shape,"" said Ms Das.\n""There are other similar examples. In chronic conditions such as diabetes, women experience different symptoms to men. So in an era of precision medicine and precision health, we need to acknowledge that it is time for women to receive gender-specific treatment and care,” she added.\nThis access gap is what femtech businesses hope to bridge.\nMr Rio Hoe and Ms Guadalupe Lazaro founded Ease Healthcare in 2019.\nThe couple say that the business was inspired by their own personal experiences accessing sexual and reproductive health services in Singapore.\n“We faced different barriers along the way, such as the stigma of going down to a clinic or the judgment from doctors. So we wanted to change things,” said Ms Lazaro.\nThe result was the creation of a telemedicine platform that aims to make healthcare more accessible, convenient and discreet.\nUsers can book online medical appointments, and medications are delivered within four hours - in personalised and discreet packaging.\nThe start-up recently received seed funding of US$1.3 million – the largest femtech round in Southeast Asia. The funding was led by Insignia Ventures.\nInsignia Ventures\' founding managing partner Tan Yinglan said: “One of the things we look out for particularly is that they really understand the pain points of the customer and the market that they are addressing. And they were able to build up a massive community and content which is very relevant to their target audience.”\nThe app was launched last year, and now has about 20,000 users.\nWith its social media strategies and a slew of community building activities, the interface is designed to appeal particularly to a younger, digitally savvy audience.\nAt the other end of the age spectrum, is another major sector in the femtech space – menopause.\nAccording to Frost and Sullivan, by 2025, more than 1 billion women globally will be experiencing menopause. That is around 12 per cent of the world population.\nSingapore-based start-up EloCare is hoping to find data-driven solutions to address this condition.\nDr Tan Thiam Chye, EloCare’s clinical adviser, said there are currently not many health tech solutions dealing with menopause.\nSo even though about three-quarters of women will experience symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, many may not be aware of those signs.\nThe start-up’s aim is to improve the diagnosis, detection and monitoring of the symptoms of menopause.\nThe company has been awarded a seed grant by Singapore Health Technologies Consortium (HealthTec) – a platform for industry and academia to collaborate on technology that will transform health and wellness.\nThe funding will help support EloCare\'s development of an algorithm to identify the symptoms of menopause.\nThe aim is to help ""differentiate between (menopause) symptoms and other noises"", said Ms Mabel Nguyen, co-founder and CEO of EloCare.\n""So we make sure that if you are having these hot flushes, it’s not because you are feeling hot. If you have some sleep disruption, it\'s because of menopause and it’s not because of something else,"" she added.\nHaving such data empowers women to understand their bodies better and to make informed decisions on healthcare solutions, all of which will have a short-term and long-term impact on health outcomes.\n“Menopause can be so disruptive to a woman’s health. The symptoms can last for years. And beyond the short-term symptoms that can affect their life, their health and their work productivity, their relationship and family environment,” said Ms Nguyen.\nFemtech start-ups have raised more than US$1 billion this year, more than 10 times the US$98 million raised in 2011, according to PitchBook, which provides private & public capital market data.\nIt is expected that revenue from the femtech sector will reach US$1.1 billion by 2024, with annual projected growth of 12.9 per cent, said Frost and Sullivan.\nSingapore is the femtech hub of the region – with more than half of the femtech companies in Southeast Asia based here.\nExpanding to the region will come with a new set of challenges – and opportunities.\nEase Healthcare has its eye on this market, knowing that the pain points it is trying to address in Singapore, such as convenience, accessibility and cost, are similar in many other Asian markets.\nAt the same time, co-founder Ms Lazaro acknowledges that such personal health topics are sensitive. She says businesses like theirs need to adjust to different expectations and cultural norms, and adapt their language and marketing accordingly.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', ""     Women's Health "", '     technology ']}"

      Welcoming a new era of personal air-filtering wearables with Philips Fresh Air Mask
  </h1>, 'text': 'Almost two years on, some COVID-19 precautions have become habit. Along with our wallets, mobile phones and keys, we now include face masks in our leave-home routines. Whether disposable or reusable, face masks dominate as the obvious preventative measure we can all take to stay protected. However, the discomfort of mask-wearing, be it from fiddly straps or heat- and moisture-trapping fabric, can be a pain for many.\xa0\nIn comes the Philips Fresh Air Mask – a next-generation face mask that includes a built-in airflow system, so you can find comfort in your day without sacrificing protection.\nINHALE AND EXHALE, WITH EASE \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nWith Singapore’s warm and humid climate, having a fan for cool relief is almost a necessity. Now, you can have a mini fan within your mask for a refreshing effect. Equipped with a small fan module customised specially for this mask, the Philips Fresh Air Mask provides breathing comfort by allowing filtered air exchange between the space within your mask and the air outside. Precise engineering has given the tiny but powerful tech piece the capability of allowing up to 41 litres per minute1 of fresh air flow for its users.\nThe module even sports three speeds to provide different levels of comfort. One might not need it activated in an air-conditioned environment, but if you’ve just chased down a bus and are breathing a little heavier than usual, you can have the setting turned up to ease your breathing. In fact, if you’ve always struggled with masks after exercising, you can now find sweet relief with the highest setting turned on. With up to three and a half hours of runtime (subject to the power setting), it’ll be adequate for your day’s routine. And it takes only three hours to charge up fully.\nThe Philips Fresh Air Mask also boasts an aerodynamic design, and the result is better ease in breathing, with reduced exhalation and humidity – say bye to foggy glasses and “dewy” make-up around your lips. When coupled with the micro-porous fabric specially selected for the reusable outer shell, users will find comfort in its breathability and feel, yet enjoy durability with its robust make and elasticity.\nN95-LEVEL FILTRATION PERFORMANCE\n\nThe replaceable inner layer of the mask ensures its other critical mission is achieved – protection. With this internal filter layer, the Philips Fresh Air Mask boasts a N95-level filtration performance2 that stops 95 per cent of pollen, PM2.5 particles and 99 per cent bacteria of 3μm.\nThe filtration sheet sits right against the external shell, providing enhanced protection from pollutants and microbes for peace of mind. The layer has a lifetime of up to 122 hours (when air quality index is 0 to 503) and includes sun protection of UPF 50+.\nDon’t worry about replacement filters – they are easily available across the island at major retail brands such as Best Denki, Amazon and the online Philips store.\nTHE IDEAL FORM\nFit is everything. Protection weakens considerably when the seal around the mask is compromised, which is why extensive research was conducted to find the ideal form for the Philips Fresh Air Mask.\nFocusing on the “golden anchor point” as defined by the folks at the Philips laboratory, designers experimented to create a form that relieves the pressure often felt at the bridge of the nose, cheeks and ears. The end result, manufactured using 3D laser precise cutting, is a flattering next-generation mask that confers comfort and also keeps its shape after repeated washing, for many months of better breathing.\nBreathe better. Live better. The Philips Fresh Air Mask is available at\xa0Best Denki stores islandwide, Philips.com as well as Amazon. \n1Based on Philips’ internal lab results; calculated only for the fan itself.\n2With reference to the test conditions of the United States’ National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and Philips’ corporate standard; tested and certified by a third-party laboratory; consumers should follow mask usage instructions. \n3Based on Philips’ internal lab data; test condition of air quality index 0-50 (with PM2.5 as the primary pollutant); refers to the longest recommended length of cumulative use of a single filter; replacement time to be adjusted according to personal use habits and environmental conditions.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Philips ', '     COVID-19 ', '     N95 masks ', '     innovation ', '     technology ']}"

Never has the pace of change been so fast though, driven by the urgency of climate change and the fast development of technology, said the bus maker’s president and managing director, Paul Davies.\nThe transportation sector is responsible for about 20 per cent of all global emissions. It is a major polluter that needs to be decarbonised in order for the world to keep global warming to less than 1.5 degrees, a major aim of ongoing climate change talks at COP26 in Glasgow. \n“Coming out of the pandemic, everything is changing,” Davies told CNA. “Here at COP26, countries from around the world are going to agree on policies to get to net zero or whatever their intentions are. We have to embrace that because the tailwind is there. We’re part of the solution, we’ve been part of it for 126 years. Now is the time to modernise,” he said.\nThe company is deliberately “technologically agnostic”, Davies said, a way of staying flexible and nimble to the needs of its global consumer base.\nThat means it produces battery-electric buses and also has hydrogen fuel cell buses in its order pipeline, as well as the final wave of more conventional diesel engine buses.\xa0\nIt has facilities in 10 different countries, including Hong Kong, China and Singapore, where public transport users may be familiar with the hundreds of Enviro500 double-deck buses in service.\nIn the apparent race of technologies to decarbonise the transport sector, Davies believes that it will not be a case of a single solution, but rather, many.\n“The big debate about whether it’s going to be battery-electric or hydrogen, the reality is it’s going to be both of them,” he said.\nHe added: “There are pockets of the world or even within countries, where there will be infrastructure to support hydrogen buses, which is the big challenge. There are places where it works and makes sense to do it but other places where battery-electric will be the answer.“The pace is really fast right now. From 2016 to 2021 we have delivered 500 battery-electric buses. In 12 months that will double to 1,000 because that’s the speed of change.”\nWhile both battery-electric and green hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are clean and\xa0emission-free technologies, there are differences in range, cost and suitability in certain climates.\xa0\nIn hot countries, like in Southeast Asia, the extra energy requirements for providing cooling with air conditioning on buses will impact the performance of buses running on electricity.\xa0\nAnalysis from the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that bus auxiliary power for cooling or heating can consume 20 per cent of onboard energy.\xa0\n“This is significant. It can impact the performance of the bus. However, where bus routes are not long and where there is possibility for opportunity charging, it can be possible to use batteries,” said Leonardo Paoli, an IEA energy technology analyst. \nSingapore aims to phase out petrol and diesel-powered vehicles by 2040 and will not allow diesel cars and taxis to be registered from 2025.\xa0\nPublic charging infrastructure is being rolled out at speed, with an aim to have 60,000 charging points across the country by 2030 to support the transition to electric vehicles.\xa0New public housing developments will have capacity to support electric vehicle charging in 15 per cent of their parking lots.\nSingapore also aims to have 100 per cent greener, cleaner energy public bus and taxi fleets by 2040.\xa0Yet, the Land Transport Authority’s (LTA) last order with ADL - awarded in 2019 - was for diesel Enviro500 buses.\n“We’ve got some work to do. The challenge for us is to take these buses from being diesel to something else. We now need to transform these to net zero emissions,” Davies said.\xa0\n“Hydrogen could be a real solution for Singapore. Hydrogen development is going to happen at pace. We’re ready for any and all of it. We have hundreds of talented engineers to navigate us through it.”\xa0\nInterest in fuel cells is growing, but there remains debate over its applications.\nIEA’s Paoli said that recent market developments place electric power trains ahead of fuel cell ones, and in a net zero world, hydrogen will act to fill gaps in hard to decarbonise areas, like heavy-duty trucking or shipping.\n“Right now there are more than 350 electric car models available while there are only three\xa0models for hydrogen-powered cars. Similar trends are seen for buses and heavy-duty trucks, although with less of a stark proportion,” he said.\n“This doesn't mean fuel cells should be discarded for transport. There are still applications where they can be useful.”\nLong-range and flexibility are some of the reasons why momentum is ramping up behind fuel cell investment, according to Nigel Holmes, the CEO of the Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association.\n“One of the expressions comes from an old advert that used to run in the UK for Heineken lager. The ad was ‘refreshes the parts that other beers cannot reach’,” he explained.“Hydrogen is often being labelled the Heineken of the energy system, reaching the parts that can’t be easily treated by other means. In a zero carbon context, this is where hydrogen complements electrification, especially in transport.”\nHolmes said the Scottish city of Aberdeen is a leading example of hydrogen fuel cell buses running on normal routes without passengers really noticing the difference.\nGetting those vehicles on the road has been a product of many years of capacity building and experimenting with technology. The outcome is a public transport fleet with no carbon emissions, and the side benefits of cleaner air within the city and less traffic noise.\xa0\nThe costs remain high though, and that remains a challenge for many cities and countries, particularly those in the developing world.\n“The technology is mature and it’s now more a question of how we bring the cost down to be affordable. In the bus market, we’re starting to see great progress. Scaling up is one of the ways that costs can continue to come down,” Holmes said.\nWith transport and cities also on the agenda this week at COP26, this could be a “massive tipping point” for governments and transport providers to start taking real steps to decarbonise, said Isabel Dedring, the global transport leader for Arup and London City’s former deputy mayor for transport.\n“About ten years ago, decarbonisation was excruciating. It was like pulling teeth. Hybrid systems seemed like a wacky idea. Electric buses were considered to be for airports not for proper urban environments. Things have actually changed a lot,” Dedring said.\n“Transport is a traditional, high bound, slow moving industry. Now you have countries developing and adopting technology at pace. It might seem like an anodyne point, but the picture is much more positive than people think. Now we have to springboard off that.”\xa0\nOne change, at least superficially, might be that zero emission buses start to actually look different from their fossil fuel chugging brethren, through innovation and creativity.\nDemand for public transport has declined steeply due to COVID-19 and part of winning back users could involve taking them along on the net zero journey, ADL’s Davies said, hinting at a new upcoming project in Asia.\xa0\n“You want people to differentiate that something is zero emissions, it’s new, it’s a bit more futuristic. We’re doing some work there,” he said.\xa0\n“People will know it’s a zero emissions bus straight away. It’s going to make a statement.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     LTA ', '     COP26 ', '     hydrogen ', '     technology ']}"

      Broke and depressed in Taiwan, actor Andie Chen starts a gaming company
  </h1>, 'text': 'The metaverse is proving very useful for Andie Chen. A year ago, the actor relocated his family to Taiwan in search of career prospects. But within six months, he had run out of funds, to the point where he was borrowing money from his parents.\nHis wife, Kate Pang, returned to Singapore where she could earn an income through her lifestyle company. This left Chen to care for their two young children, who were enrolled in school in Taipei, solo. An unfamiliar new country, loneliness and his dire financial situation all took a toll on his mental health.\n""I was just really sad and unhappy all the time,"" he told CNA Lifestyle. ""I was the primary caregiver for my kids, and sometimes I would cry at night. I would try to hide it from my kids. If they spotted me crying, they’d come and hug me to sleep.""\nHe revealed, ""I had a bout of depression when I was 19, with suicidal tendencies, and it lasted for more than a year. So, I am very aware of my mental health status on a day-to-day basis. It was a feeling of helplessness and emptiness. I have built enough routines that I could still have gone on, but it was on auto-pilot.""\nUnexpectedly, he found a light at the end of the financial tunnel in the form of a lifelong hobby: Online gaming. Yes, he found a way to earn money by playing games.\nA friend introduced him to Axie Infinity, a game at the forefront of the trending ""play to earn"" movement that melds blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFT) with online gaming.\nTo play the game, he purchased NFTs, and as he progressed, started renting the extra NFTs he gained to players who couldn\'t afford to buy the starter NFTs. These players earned tokens within the game known as ""smooth love potion"" (SLP), which can be traded for cash.\n""The players that got to use my NFTs were coming back with stories of fixing their roof, buying medicine for their parents, buying a new phone, and so on. That became a very positive experience,"" he said.\nWith the help of his brother, entrepreneur Adam Tan, Chen decided to turn it into a business, establishing a company called Freedom Nation that ""bridges and provides resources for people of all levels to prosper in the inevitable migration into the metaverse"".\nIn three months, he claimed, they have generated S$500,000 of value, based on the value of SLP at average market price, and they are on track to hit a million dollars in the next three months. He values the company at S$12 million.\nHis wife ""used to give me a lot of shit\xa0for playing games, mainly passive aggressively,"" he laughed. ""But now, when she sees me playing games, she gets me tea or snacks, and asks me not to work too hard. Gotta love blockchain gaming!"" \xa0\nChen said he dived deep into educating himself on blockchain and cryptocurrency, watching lots of explainer videos and reading books and white papers.\n""I lost a decent chunk of money at the start, but I took it as school fees,"" he said.\nIn the not-so-distant future, he said, people will spend more time in the digital space than in the physical world.\n""I don’t see it as a good or bad thing, I think it’s a natural progression, just like radio to TV to Netflix. The younger generation are already living in Fortnite\xa0and Roblox. It is just us old folks who are still fearful of this change.""\nIn his case, adversity bred innovation.

      Apple’s most back-ordered new product is not what you expect
  </h1>, 'text': 'Apple this month unveiled an array of new gadgets: More powerful MacBook laptop computers, AirPod wireless headphones with longer battery life and HomePod Mini speakers in three more colours.\nBut a different and unheralded Apple release is garnering so much interest that it has become the company’s most back-ordered new product: A US$19 (S$26), 6.3-by-6.3-inch cloth to wipe smudges and fingerprints off screens.\nThe cloth, imprinted with the Apple logo in the corner, is made with “soft, nonabrasive material” to clean the screens of iPhones, iPads and MacBooks “safely and effectively,” according to the product page. The listing adds that the Polishing Cloth\xa0– capital P, capital C\xa0– is “compatible” with 88 different Apple products. For most US shoppers, shipment is delayed until Jan 11, at the earliest.\nCharging US$19 for a piece of cloth about the size of two stacked dollar bills is bold even by Apple’s standards, a company whose legions of loyal customers are conditioned to stomach steep prices. An Apple-branded set of four wheels to “improve mobility” for the Mac Pro, the company’s most expensive desktop computer, is priced at US$699, for instance.\nBut the Polishing Cloth stands out because it is far more expensive than widely available alternatives. MagicFiber, a popular brand of microfiber cloth that uses ultrafine fibers to clean glass without scratching the surface, offers a pack of six for US$9 on Amazon.\n“You have to give them credit for the chutzpah to charge US$19,” Walter Gonzalez, president and founder of Goja, the parent company of MagicFiber, said of Apple.\nEven so, the price has not stopped Apple fans from rushing to be early adopters.\nAlbert Lee, 47, a director at a consulting firm in New York, said he bought the cloth at an Apple Store on Tuesday. He was picking up a new MacBook Pro, a high-end laptop computer, when the Polishing Cloth caught his eye. He bought four and then posted a picture of his bounty on Twitter.\n“It’s just a point of sheer excess,” Lee acknowledged, calling the splurge an impulse buy of “the most elite cloth.” He added:“I just spent US$4,000 on a laptop. What’s another US$19?”\nOn Twitter, the cloth has been fodder for jokes and even a parody account since Apple quietly put it on sale on Oct 18. Later that week, when Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, posted a tweet promoting a new retail store in Turkey, Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, needled him by replying, “Come see the Apple Cloth” with a trademark logo. Technically, the cloth is not a new product. Apple had previously provided it free for customers who bought one of its high-end monitors, Pro Display XDR. The US$5,999 display has a special type of glass that reduces glare, but may scratch if wiped with a conventional cloth. Apple said it designed its own cloth for that special glass and decided to sell the product separately when some customers asked to buy extras.\nAn Apple official said in an interview, based on the condition that The New York Times not quote or identify her, that the company was not surprised by the demand for the Polishing Cloth. The official said the cloth was very effective and had been designed to be special, including a custom light gray colour. Apple said the cloth was made of a nonwoven microfibre but declined to elaborate. Federico Viticci, editor-in-chief of MacStories, a website dedicated to Apple news and apps, said he initially thought the Polishing Cloth was a joke.\n“I’ve been cleaning my iPhone screen and my iPad screen with the cloth that comes with my eyeglasses or my T-shirt, or a paper towel like normal people,” he said.\nBut Viticci, who is based in Italy, said he ended up buying the Polishing Cloth because “I kind of realised the meme potential here.” His tweets about the product have since gotten hundreds or thousands of likes and retweets, with subscribers to his site asking for exclusive cloth photos.\nPatrick Tomasso, 32, a Toronto-based YouTube creator of tech and photography-related videos, said he also thought that Apple charging 25 Canadian dollars for the cloth was “ridiculous” since many tech products include a free microfibre cloth.\nBut when he noticed that it was not shipping until next year, he said he got a “bit of FOMO”\xa0– fear of missing out\xa0– and quickly snapped up two sheets from a nearby Apple store. As a spoof, Tomasso then made an “unboxing video” of himself opening the “most revolutionary Apple product.”\nIn the video, he noticed that the Polishing Cloth’s colour looked different in person\xa0– more gray, less white\xa0– and that there was a big crease in the middle that might need to be ironed.\nHis assessment? It’s a nice cloth worth maybe US$5.\n“I probably would not buy it again but I like the fact that I own one,” Tomasso said. Then he paused and added, “But I hate that I like that I own one.”\nBy Daisuke Wakabayashi © 2021 The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Want to focus better? Here's how to block your phone from interrupting you 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sometimes, you just need to get stuff done\xa0– that budget spreadsheet, your novel or even a nap\xa0– but your smartphone insists on distracting you with notifications, texts or the pull of social media.\nSure, the Do Not Disturb setting can temporarily stifle interruptions when you need quiet time or a mental break, but recent versions of Android and Apple’s new iOS 15 include a more flexible Focus mode with other tools for concentration.\nHere is a quick guide.\nFind your Focus\nIn Android 12, look for the Digital Wellbeing icon in your app drawer. If you do not see it, open the Settings icon and select Digital Wellbeing & Parental Controls; you can download the app, too. For the hands-free approach, just say, “OK, Google, open the Digital Wellbeing settings.”\nOn an Apple device running iOS 15, open the Settings icon and scroll to Focus; saying, “Hey, Siri, open my Settings,” works, too. On the Focus screen, you will see that the old Do Not Disturb setting has moved in, and you have a button to share your settings across other Apple devices, including Macs.\nBlock interruptions\nOn Android’s Digital Wellbeing screen, tap Focus Mode. Choose the Set a Schedule option to block out the timeout you need from your phone. In the “Your distracting apps” list, select the programs you would like to disable when Focus Mode is on. (The Manage Notifications controls in the Digital Wellbeing settings let you decide what types of alerts you get in the first place.)\nTo temporarily silence most calls, go back to the main Digital Wellbeing screen and select Do Not Disturb. Tap the People option and choose the contacts allowed to bother you when you have Do Not Disturb enabled; you can do the same for apps and turn off alarms. (Some Android phones have a Flip to Shhh setting, which puts your phone right into Do Not Disturb when you place it screen-side down.)\nThe iOS 15 Focus settings provide several scenarios (Work, Personal and so on) to configure and customise based on the situation. Tap a category and select the apps and people who can interrupt you; contacts can see your Focus status displayed in the Messages app. You can set a timed schedule for each focus category or have it automatically activated by location; for example, your “Home” Focus settings pause your Slack notifications and work email when you arrive at your apartment. (If you are working from home, use the schedule timer instead.)\nTap the plus icon on the main Focus screen to set up even more situations, like when you want to have uninterrupted reading time; you can even have Reading Focus kick in when you open your e-book app. If you do not want to automate things, you can always swipe down to the Control Centre screen and tap Focus to cloak or decloak yourself from the world.\nResist temptation\nScreen timers are not just for children! If you find yourself lured by games and videos when you are supposed to be working, have your phone save you from yourself.\nIn Android’s Digital Wellbeing settings, tap Dashboard and set the timers for specific apps. (Programmes you have already put on the distracting apps list will be grayed out and unusable until you turn off Focus mode.)\nIn the iOS 15 Focus settings, each of your Focus scenarios includes controls for your home and lock screens. Tap the Home Screen option to hide notification badges on apps. When you enable the Custom Pages setting, you can hide the home screens where you keep your most distracting (and fun) apps.\nIn the Lock screen settings, set the screen to dim and have your muted notifications quietly appear there\xa0– or not. The iOS Settings have a separate Screen Time section where you can set time limits for apps.\nGet some sleep\nIf you would like to standardise your sleep schedule\xa0– or break the habit of staying up too late screen-scrolling in bed\xa0– here is help. With Android, open the Clock app and tap the Bedtime icon on the bottom-right corner. You can set your sleeping hours and pick a relaxing soundscape to clear your mind.\nIn the Digital Wellbeing settings, tap Bedtime Mode to add further sleep-friendly encouragements, like enabling your Do Not Disturb shield, turning the screen black-and-white or just keeping it off.\nThe iOS 15 Focus settings also include a Sleep option, which you can set up just like your Work and other Focus scenarios.\nThis bedtime focus links to the Sleep feature in Apple’s Health app, where you can schedule your hours for sleeping, set your alarms and select your Wind Down shortcuts\xa0– which can include a set amount of time for listening to music, meditating or another relaxing activity as you drift off to uninterrupted (by your phone, anyway) slumber.\nBy JD Biersdorfer © 2021 The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Commentary: China’s long-term prospects as a top investment destination haven’t been derailed
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: China is top of every investor’s mind, as they try to understand its policy shift towards ""common prosperity"". \nSuch policies range from curbing working hours for technology sector employees, to a ban on for-profit tuition and designated video-gaming hours for minors.\nThis series of policy upheavals is pushing up the risk premium in China asset markets, wiping out trillions from market valuations. \nShocking as this has been however, China’s long-term growth prospects have not been derailed when you consider the deeper ambitions for more sustainable development and inclusive growth undergirding these changes.\nOne should not forget China’s economic miracle over the past four decades occurred under a hybrid of capitalism and socialism. \nGrowth may have been uneven in recent years, deepening income inequality, especially between urban and rural areas, and worsened by the pandemic. \nCommon prosperity hence signals China’s changing focus from “growth first” to “quality first” and aims to balance economic gains and sustainable development, for inclusive growth. To power its economy, all segments of the population - especially lower-income households and less-developed cities - must grow together, the thinking goes. \nBut China is pressing on with its ambitious Vision 2035 plan to double gross domestic product in the next decade – no easy feat for a fairly mature economy. \nWith a slowdown in momentum, China is likely to tread cautiously. It recognises that the private sector has been a vital engine of growth and jobs, making up more than 60 per cent of the economy and 70 per cent of technological innovations. \xa0\nRecent moves on its technological giants are unlikely to reduce the sector’s overall competitiveness despite short terms pains and ties closely with China’s new dual circulation plan, focused on growing the economy both domestically and externally.\nOn the one hand, China wants higher-quality domestic consumption. And yet its growing capacity in value-add manufacturing will be key to its rise as a self-sufficient nation with a wealthy middle class by 2035. \nAnd recent economic focus has been to support small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) via monetary, fiscal and other policies. China also wants to raise public sector productivity and has been working on breaking implicit guarantees for state-owned enterprises and lowering leverage.\nExternally, China’s wants to foster stronger regional trade and investment partnerships with Southeast Asia, the Belt and Road region and developing economies. \nCommon prosperity is a new domestic priority to ensure social harmony amid decelerating economic growth. \nRecent regulatory changes also aim for fairness and efficiency but these get less spotlight. For example, the ban on private tutoring is complemented by increased resourcing for public schools and a roll-out of low-cost community childcare services.\nIn Zhejiang, a pilot programme to demonstrate common prosperity by 2025 has introduced policies designed to reduce inequality, by raising incomes through private sector investment in poorer areas and encouraging rural residents to start their own businesses. If successful, it will be replicated in other cities to encourage private enterprise and consumption.\nChina’s transition from investment to consumption and from manufacturing to services will accelerate, boosting about 65 per cent of households to the middle class by 2027. Rising incomes and aspirations will drive consumption and a stronger social safety net may lower precautionary savings.\nAmid the great rebalancing from speed to quality of growth, efficiency to equality, and mega corporates to innovative SMEs, China’s market still offers attractive investment returns for savvy global investors.\nThe challenge lies in identifying high-potential, more resilient sectors less exposed to policy risks associated with anti-trust enforcement, personal data protection and social inequality. \nOrganisations aligned with common prosperity goals – that drive progress in technological innovation, green energy and sustainable growth and seek to improve people’s well-being – will stand out and three sectors will be priority for China.\nFirst, new consumer groups emerging from China’s demographic shifts will fuel discretionary spending. An ageing population will drive demand for healthcare products and services, including insurance, as a self-sufficient domestic market. \nSecond, China is on a cusp of a green revolution. Its 14th Five-Year Plan aims to accelerate urbanisation and promote development of smart cities, and opportunities such as electric vehicles (EV) and environmental protection sectors can help China meet de-carbonisation goals. \nThe EV market is recovering strongly after a dip in sales in early 2020, thanks in part to the combination of more attractive, cost-competitive models and the government’s strong support for the auto industry. \nMandatory emission quotas on internal combustion engines have been tightened, which will boost EVs to a 20 per cent market share of new car sales by 2025, or about 6 million units a year, up from 1.3 million in 2020. This will reach 50 per cent by 2035.\nThird, a sustainable agricultural revolution is needed to feed the world’s largest and growing population. The rising middle class will further alter food consumptions patterns observed elsewhere, away from grains to resource-intensive foods like meat and seafood. \nMore sustainable farming techniques and agricultural innovation will be important for China’s food security and resilience. China aims to increase crop outputs in rural areas, decrease manpower needs and optimise supply chains, and are adapting 5G network capabilities, cameras, smart sensors and drones into farming practice.\nFourth, China is transforming from the world’s factory to smart manufacturing, with a comprehensive plan to upgrade manufacturing capabilities by 2025. Priority areas include emerging technologies like robotics, aircraft engines, artificial intelligence, new energy vehicles and smart cars.\nHigh-tech manufacturing is developing rapidly, surging in added value by 22.6 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2021, sending the two-year average growth to more than 13 per cent. \nInvestors should also focus on innovative industry leaders in digital infrastructure, automation and 5G. Such sectors include advanced manufacturing of tech hardware, semiconductors, certain industrial machinery and equipment, and software and artificial intelligence. \nIndustry observers currently hold a neutral view on Chinese equities. Their focus is on diversification as they search for companies which benefit from strong policy support - for technology self-sufficiency, manufacturing upgrade, 5G capabilities, automation and net-zero transition. \nIn this climate, investors should also focus on companies with clear competitive edge, strong management and corporate governance, and sustained earnings growth.\nIn the years ahead, China’s financial market will further integrate with the rest of the world. The increase of China equity and bond weighting in global indices will in any case spur further international investment. \nIn the long run, China’s more regulated, stable business environment will benefit investors, in reducing system vulnerabilities and ensuring sustainable growth.\nDespite short-term volatility, international investors cannot ignore the long-term prospects of China. Its investment opportunities remains expansive - China has simply set out clearer parameters within which it will facilitate, or even allow growth. \nJames Cheo is Chief Investment Officer, Southeast Asia for Global Private Banking and Wealth at HSBC Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     investment ', '     technology ', '     electric vehicles ']}"

      Apple objects to links to outside payments ahead of Epic Games hearing
  </h1>, 'text': 'Apple on Friday outlined its objections to allowing app developers to link to third-party payment options ahead of a hearing next month that could determine whether a set of antitrust court orders is put on pause.\nAfter a lengthy trial earlier this year brought by Fortnite creator Epic Games, US District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers issued a ruling that was largely favourable to the iPhone maker and upheld its practice of requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, for which it charges commissions.\nBut Gonzalez Rogers expressed concern that consumers did not have access to information about other ways to pay for apps. She ordered Apple to stop its ban on ""buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms"" beyond Apple\'s own payment systems.\nApple has until Dec 9 to implement the order, but the company has appealed the ruling and asked the order to be put on hold while the appeal plays out, which could take a year or more. A hearing on the request is set for Nov 9.\nApple on Friday for the first time signaled that its strongest objections are to the requirements to allow buttons and links that provide a ""mechanism"" for outside payments. The filing provided the first suggestion that Apple objects less strongly to allowing developers to provide information about other ways to pay.\nThe company said that links and buttons harm its ability to require developers to use its in-app payments (IAP), which the court upheld.\n""Restrictions on linking out are inextricably tied to Apple’s requirement that developers use IAP for purchases of digital content — a requirement this Court considered in detail and upheld against Epic’s challenge,"" Apple said.\nApple posed fewer objections to in-app messages about other forms of payment, but said it may want to ""constrain their placement, format, or content"" and that the judge\'s orders as currently written would not allow it to do so without facing further legal challenges.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Apple ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Facebook changes its name to ‘Meta’ but not its path to track our data
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has announced the company will change its name to Meta, saying the move reflects the fact the company is now much broader than just the social media platform, which will still be called Facebook.\nThe rebrand follows several months of intensifying discourse by Zuckerberg and the company more broadly on the metaverse – the idea of integrating real and digital worlds ever more seamlessly, using technologies such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).\nZuckerberg said he hoped the metaverse will be a new ecosystem that will create millions of jobs for content creators.\nBut is this just a shallow PR exercise, with Zuckerberg trying to reset the Facebook brand after several scandal-ridden years, or is it a genuine bid to set the company on course for what he sees as the future of computing?\nWhat’s not in contention is that this is the culmination of seven years of corporate acquisitions, investments and research that kicked off with Facebook’s acquisition of VR headset company Oculus for US$2 billion in 2014.\nOculus had risen to prominence with a lucrative Kickstarter campaign\xa0and many of its backers were angry that their support for the “future of gaming” had been co-opted by Silicon Valley.\nWhile gamers fretted Facebook would give them VR versions of Farmville rather than the hardcore content they envisioned, cynics viewed the purchase as part of a spending spree after Facebook’s US$16 billion stock market launch\xa0or simply Zuckerberg indulging a personal interest in gaming.\nUnder Facebook, Oculus has gone on to dominate the VR market with over 60 per cent market share. That’s thanks to heavy cross-subsidisation from Facebook’s advertising business and a console-like approach with the mobile Quest\xa0VR headset.\nBeyond Oculus, Facebook has invested heavily in VR and AR. Organised under the umbrella of Facebook Reality Labs, there are nearly 10,000 people working on these technologies – almost 20 per cent of Facebook’s workforce.\nLast week, Facebook announced plans to hire another 10,000 developers in the European Union to work on its metaverse computing platform.\nWhile much of its work remains behind closed doors, Facebook Reality Labs’ publicised projects include Project Aria, which seeks to create live 3D maps of public spaces, and the recently released Ray-Ban Stories – Facebook-integrated sunglasses with 5-megapixel cameras and voice control.\nAll these investments and projects are steps towards the infrastructure for Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse.\nAs he said earlier in the year: “I think it really makes sense for us to invest deeply to help shape what I think is going to be the next major computing platform.”\nThe metaverse may eventually come to define how we work, learn and socialise. This means VR and AR would move beyond their current niche uses and become everyday technologies on which we will all depend.\nWe can guess at Facebook’s vision for the metaverse by looking to its existing approach to social media. It has moulded our online lives into a gigantic revenue stream based on power, control and surveillance, fuelled by our data.\nVR and AR headsets collect enormous amounts of data about the user and their environment. This is one of the key ethical issues around these emerging technologies\xa0and presumably one of the chief attractions for Facebook in owning and developing them.\nWhat makes this particularly concerning is that the way you move your body is so unique that VR data can be used to identify you, rather like a fingerprint. That means everything you do in VR could potentially be traced back to your individual identity.\nFor Facebook – a digital advertising empire built on tracking our data – it’s a tantalising prospect.\nAlongside Project Aria, Facebook launched its Responsible Innovation Principles\xa0and recently pledged US$50 million to “build the metaverse responsibly”.\nBut, as Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein note in their book Data Feminism, responsible innovation is often focused on individualised concepts of harm, rather than addressing the structural power imbalances baked into technologies such as social media.\nIn our studies of Facebook’s Oculus Imaginary - its vision for how it will use Oculus technology -\xa0and its changes over time to Oculus’ privacy and data policies, we suggest Facebook publicly frames privacy in VR as a question of individual privacy (over which users can have control) versus surveillance and data harvesting (over which we don’t).\nCritics have derided Facebook’s announcements as “privacy theatre” and corporate spin. Digital rights advocacy group Access Now, which participated in a Facebook AR privacy “design jam” in 2020 and urged Facebook to prioritise alerting bystanders they were being recorded by Ray-Ban Stories, says its recommendation was ignored.\nAppropriately enough, the metaverse under Facebook is likely to resemble the term’s literary origins, coined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash to describe an exploitative, corporatised, hierarchical virtual space.\nBut it doesn’t have to be this way. Tony Parisi, one of the early pioneers of VR, argues we already have a blueprint for a non-dystopian metaverse.\nHe says we should look back to the original, pre-corporatised vision of the internet, which embodied “an open, collaborative and consensus-driven way to develop technologies and tools”.\nFacebook’s rebrand, its dominance in the VR market, its seeming desire to hire every VR and AR developer in Europe, and its dozens of corporate acquisitions – all this sounds less like true collaboration and consensus, and more like an attempt to control the next frontier of computing.\nWe let Facebook rule the world of social media. We shouldn’t let it rule the metaverse.\nMarcus Carter is Senior Lecturer in Digital Cultures at the University of Sydney.

      Is it safe to charge my phone overnight? Your battery charging questions answered
  </h1>, 'text': 'A few years ago, I woke up to a peculiar phenomenon. My handphone, which had been plugged in to charge the night before, developed a bent battery cover. It was pushed out of shape by the bloated battery underneath it.\nNeedless to say, that was the last time I let my phone charge overnight. But I’m sure many of us are guilty of doing the same thing, just to make sure your phone is at 100 per cent at the start of the day. \nSpeaking of prolonged charging, you probably dock your expensive vacuum cleaner in its wall-mounted charger because, well, that\'s what the advertisement says, right? Your tablet or work laptop is also likely to be plugged into the wall socket 24/7 for convenience\'s sake – whether or not the battery is depleted.\xa0\nWe don\'t think much of our charging habits until something drastic happens, such as a ballooned handphone battery or worse, a fire caused by leaving our personal mobility device or PMD to charge overnight as seen in news reports.\nThen, the paranoia kicks in and you start to wonder: Is it okay to charge anything rechargeable overnight? Can you over-charge? Even when you\'re not sleeping, is it okay to leave a device in its charging station all day? \nWe reached out to the department of electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University to find out if we were charging our phones and other gadgets correctly. And as it turned out,\xa0our\xa0regular habits might not actually be helpful to our devices.\xa0Read on to find out.\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CHARGE DEVICES SUCH AS MY HANDPHONE, LAPTOP, POWER BANK OR EVEN HOME APPLIANCES OVERNIGHT?\nInterestingly, the battery doesn’t stay at 100 per cent throughout the night. It will drop a little as the gadget uses a bit of power to keep it running in the background, according to a Time article. Every time there’s an energy dip, the charger kicks in and juices the battery back to 100 per cent. This is known as trickle charging. \nSo, what’s the big deal? For one, the lithium-ion battery that powers your handphone or laptop actually does not like to be fully charged, according to the Battery University website. In fact, the high voltage from a full charge stresses out the battery. \nFurthermore, the capacity of lithium-ion batteries (meaning, their ability to hold the charge) starts to diminish once you start charging – and keeps going down. Each time you charge your phone, you’re killing the battery a little. This is also noted on online support pages such as Apple’s, which mentioned that the battery’s capacity lowers after a certain duration of charging. \nAnd this applies to home appliances, too, from the expensive vacuum cleaner to the affordable electric toothbrush, as long as they are powered by lithium-ion batteries. \nCAN I ACCIDENTALLY OVERCHARGE MY GADGETS? \nNo, you can\'t overcharge your devices. According to Assistant Professor Christopher Lee, the rechargeable lithium-ion battery can automatically stop charging once it’s fully topped up, thanks to its battery management system or BMS. \nThe BMS doesn\'t only consist of the actual battery but also the circuitry and other components; together, they ensure the right range of voltage and current reaches the battery for a duration of time. So, in that respect, you can\'t overcharge your handphone or vacuum cleaner. \nWhat about the rare occasion when lithium-ion batteries swell up like mine did? Is that caused by overcharging? No, the phenomenon occurs when the materials inside a battery have decayed or are subjected to stress or physical damage over time, according to the PC Mag website.\nThe compromised battery can\'t handle the uncontrolled energy coursing inside it during charging and, in turn, causes heat and gas to build up.\nI\'M PARANOID AFTER READING ABOUT THE PMD FIRES. SHOULD I SWITCH OFF ALL CHARGERS BEFORE I GO TO BED? \n""It is not a straightforward question and it is hard to comment whether to switch off all of your charging stations before sleeping,"" said Asst Prof Lee. ""A trade-off should be made between safety concerns and charging urgency."" \nBut generally,\xa0it\'s okay to charge your devices overnight, added Asst Prof Lee, provided the BMS of the battery is not inferior, faulty or tempered with, as can be the case of batteries from dubious origins. Other things that can also short-circuit these rechargeables, said Asst Prof Lee, include the battery over-heating during charging or using an incompatible charger.\nYour best bet: If you\'re not sure, don\'t do it.\nWhat about if you do charge overnight once in a while or you occasionally forget it\'s plugged in? After all, there\'s a BMS to supposedly safeguard your devices, right?\xa0\n""It is not easy to suggest a quantitative frequency of overnight charging,"" said Asst Prof Lee, explaining that it is, again, about the ""trade-off between the safety risks and charging requirements"". So, if you\'re not certain about the reliability of your gadget (such as certain online purchases), try not to charge overnight if you can.\nWHAT ABOUT THE HANDHELD VACUUM CLEANER OR ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH THAT I LEAVE CHARGING ALL THE TIME?\nThe BMS of the battery in these home appliances can manage the constant charging, said Asst Prof Lee, and in fact, the effect of charging non-stop on the battery life is insignificant. \nHowever, over-discharging or over-draining the battery is another issue and it may affect battery life much more, he said. (See optimal battery percentage below)\nWHAT IS THE OPTIMAL BATTERY PERCENTAGE TO KEEP MY HANDHELD DEVICES SUCH AS THE HANDPHONE, TABLET OR EVEN VACUUM CLEANER AT?\nDon’t plug it in to charge when it’s still 80 per cent juiced. Remember, lithium-ion batteries hate to carry full charges. But don’t let it drop below 20 per cent either; the battery will need a high voltage to get back its charge – which also diminishes its capacity. \nA sweet spot that optimises charging time without affecting the battery’s capacity too much is to keep the battery percentage between that range, said Asst Prof Lee. \nWHEN IT COMES TO YOUR ELECTRICITY BILL, DOES OVERNIGHT CHARGING CONSUME MORE ENERGY?\nTypically, no, said Asst Prof Lee. The power consumed in trickle charging (which is explained earlier) is ""very low and insignificant"", he said. ""The electricity bill added is less than a few per cent of the electricity bill."" \nCAN YOU CONTINUE USING YOUR GADGET WHILE IT IS CHARGING?\nYou can but it is not recommended as doing so may lead to a rising temperature inside the battery. “A thermal management system in the BMS can manage the temperature in lithium-ion batteries, typically from 20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius,” said Asst Prof Lee. \nHowever, using your phone while it’s charging can result in “complex electrochemical reactions” that can raise your gadget’s temperature beyond that range. \nWE\'VE HEARD A FEW THINGS ABOUT HANDPHONE CHARGING SUCH AS WIRELESS CHARGING CAUSING RADIATION, AND SWITCHING TO AIRPLANE MODE LETS US CHARGE FASTER. ANY TRUTH TO THAT?\nYes, wireless charging does create radiation and the further the charging range, the higher the radiation, said Asst Prof Lee. Gadgets placed on charging pads typically have less than 1cm to 2cm of space in between, so the radiation is very acceptable, according to IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) standards. \nHowever, the radiation can be of concern if the wireless charging covers a range of 10cm to 15cm or more, said Asst Prof Lee. \nIt is also accurate that turning on the airplane mode can help you charge your handphone faster as it stops all the applications, especially the network service, said Asst Prof Lee.\xa0 \nBut there\'s a catch: Doing so may not save you that much time anyway, around a few to 10 minutes, he added.\nWILL USING THIRD-PARTY EQUIPMENT SUCH AS USB CABLE AFFECT THE CHARGING?\nStructurally, all cables are more or less the same because they are copper transmission lines, said Asst Prof Lee. However, in addition to the BMS, original cables have a protection chip that safeguards the phone from being exposed to more charge than it needs. \nWithout it, the power may not be optimum and can affect the BMS over time. And that’s where third-party cables can be less effective.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      Commentary: China’s long march with tech firms just got started
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: China’s clampdown on leading Chinese technology firms seems the conclusion to its decades-long soul-searching exercise on the extent to which national interests should override private gain.\nAlthough a hallmark of China’s economic miracle has been Deng Xiaoping and subsequent Chinese leaders’ openness to global markets and foreign investments, that pendulum may now be swinging the other way under President Xi Jinping.\nThese recent moves under Xi – the clampdown on tech firms, the rules on gaming hours and the demand for ride-hailing to provide full-time employment – have demonstrated rising techno-nationalism. \nIt’s clear China has decided market reforms should serve the Leninist one-party rule. \nIn this model, Chinese authorities are reverting to an old command economy approach to align companies and minimise risks, while also granting them a certain degree of autonomy.\nFor years, as China moved up its developmental model to leapfrog most modern economies with new capabilities in areas like fintech, transport and gaming, the economy flourished.\nHomegrown firms became household names, and, in turn, evolved to global tech titans – such as Ant, Didi, ZTE, Tencent and ByteDance. Crucially, this growth supported the rise of the world’s biggest middle class.\nThe time spent also gave the Chinese political leadership space to master the art of leveraging tech to support national interests. \nRegulators may be taking an expansive view of national interests when they decided to limit gaming to a maximum of three hours a week for under-18s, to combat gaming addiction and to cultivate “younger generations in the era of national rejuvenation”. \nBut national security remains at the heart of concerns. Didi was said to have been targeted because, as a New York Times report puts it, it chose to have its initial public offering in the United States and potentially put reams of data into the hands of an adversary.\nSuch recent efforts to rein in tech companies have occurred in parallel with the pursuit of modern technologies for social ends, for instance, the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) for surveillance and the creation of a digital yuan granting the Chinese government greater power in digital payments and transactions. \nIt it little wonder therefore that Beijing should also seek to more closely align tech companies with national policy and desired norms. \nBut Chinese authorities, often taking the long view, still view big companies – many of whom are emerging as global leaders in the tech industry – at the forefront of its model of Chinese development.\nBeijing knows it cannot slay the golden goose. Rather than clamping down on such firms in order to squash dissent, the goal is to continue to maintain regime legitimacy by fostering technological innovation while keeping Chinese enterprises aligned with the regime’s nation-building efforts. \nChinese political elites know they need to continually produce pipelines of innovative and job-producing, world-class companies to help China sustain economic growth.\nXi’s focus on targeting tech firms and the rising prominence of frontier technology sits in the wider context of the country’s pursuit of modern technologies. \nAs outlined in the Chinese State Council’s 2017 New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, the development of AI\xa0is viewed as a means for China “to enhance national competitiveness and safeguard national security” while serving as the “new engine of economic development”. \nHaving first access and control over new technologies also gives the Communist Party of China a leading edge over its territory and population – especially as it mobilises these resources for stability. \nAuthorities in Xinjiang rely on a grid system – fusing facial recognition technologies, smart surveillance systems and information stored on a database known as the Integrated Joint Operations Platform – to identify, track and locate activities of terrorists. \nIt’s Chinese AI companies such as SenseTime corporation and Hikvision that have supplied the Chinese government with the surveillance technologies used there. \nChina’s remarkably rapid roll out of a digital yuan is also instructive. With the world’s largest unbanked population, the digital yuan seeks to correct this by bringing onstream millions of such citizens into the financial system without the need for a bank account or Internet access. \nNevertheless, it also promises “controllable anonymity”, allowing authorities to monitor capital flows and financial transactions down to the last cent.\nWhile anonymised transactions are not normally accessible, Beijing can choose to access them if they suspect unlawful activities, such as\xa0money laundering or gambling.\nSuch moves to align the Chinse tech sector to national security interests may have been motivated by the vulnerability of Chinese tech firms to punishing actions by the US, including blacklisting, presidential executive orders during the Donald Trump years. \nAnd why not, when on Jul 14, the Biden administration added Chinese companies and other entities to its economic blacklist, following allegations of their involvement in human rights abuses and high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang.\nThe great power competition between the US and China is heating up and both sides know technological dominance underpin this contest. \nThis may be a clash of narratives and the battle for hearts and minds, as much as it’s a fight for material superiority.\xa0 \nFor some in the US, the rise of Chinese tech fuels a form of digital authoritarianism that threatens Western liberal democratic values. \nChinese officials have likewise framed the development of AI\xa0as an issue of national security and degrees of freedom, a train of thought present since the first day the Great Firewall was erected. \nA deep-seated anxiety to overcome its century of humiliation and avoid a repeat of history also underpins China’s “securitisation” of tech. \nIn recent years, China has also sought to buttress its evolving approach with strong institutions, with the creation and expansion of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission which oversees the Cyberspace Administration of China and the Central Commission for Cybersecurity and Informatisation, chaired by Xi Jinping personally.\nBut China is playing offence as much as defence. It wants to prove the ideological superiority of its values which the Chinese model of governance hinges on. \nIt was proud of the global coverage of its success with deploying high-tech surveillance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and commentary that this was a model to emulate. \nIt was lauded for controlling the spread of the pandemic with new digital tools without the deliberative democratic processes constraining Western liberal societies. \nSo there is little surprise the Chinese state has adopted a utilitarian approach to including tech into its updated Chinese developmental model – one able to rival the conventional market-driven model.\nWhether China succeeds will depend on its “discourse power” (huayuquan) – its ability to set agendas and shape international norms. This is an area for strategic rivalry. \nAs the global economy becomes increasingly more digital, the development, usage and export of emerging technologies in cyberspace, AI and more are currently unclear and open for contestation, and first movers hold an advantage.\nSemiconductors are now the technological arena where the battle between the US and China will play out and it remains to be seen how China will wrest back control.\nAs outlined in its national strategic policy, Made In China 2025, China plans to increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing as a share of domestic consumption to 80 per cent by 2030. \nIt also plans to reduce all external dependences, including reliance on firms such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. \nNevertheless, there is growing pushback against sharing sensitive tech, more cautious knowledge transfers, coupled with increasingly hostile relations with the US, Taiwan and some quarters of Europe. These developments are making it harder for China to realise its full potential to be self-sufficient in semiconductor production.\nWith massive state support, coupled with a surfeit of talent and resources, China is already a technological powerhouse. \nHowever, China’s moves to align the tech sector with national security issue could encumber foreign tech firms and make the Chinese market less attractive for global labour and capital. \nBut one thing’s clear: Beijing’s long march to mobilise the country’s technological prowess for national imperatives has only just begun. \nStefanie Kam is Associate Research Fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University.

      Deep dive into deepfakes: Frighteningly real and sometimes used for the wrong things
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The video started\xa0with what appeared\xa0to be former US president Barack Obama sitting in the White House Oval Office. There was\xa0no mistaking the identity of the person in the video, that is, until he began to speak.\n""President Trump is a total and complete ****. Now, you see I will never say these things, at least not in a public address. But\xa0someone else will,"" the person in the video said.\nGiven that the accent, mouth movements and facial expressions were highly accurate, the only red flag was how unlikely it was for Mr Obama to say something like that publicly.\nThe video is one example of artificial intelligence-synthesised media, more colloquially known as deepfakes. It\xa0uses\xa0a technique called facial re-enactment to manipulate the performance of a subject in an existing video.\nAudio recorded by a voice actor who spoke with\xa0an identical accent was inserted into the video. The former president\'s mouth movements were then modified to match the dialogue.\n""This kind of technology, you can download the software, you can compile it, they are open source,"" explained Associate Professor Hao Li, founder of Pinscreen, a start-up that develops photorealistic AI-driven virtual avatars.\n""But at the same time, it\'s even more accessible because all you need is actually just go to the App Store, and there are various forms of apps that allow you to do AI-synthesised video.""\nTo give a sense of how accessible the technology has\xa0become, a 2019 study found that the number of deepfake videos online almost doubled in nine months. Cybersecurity firm Deeptrace found 14,698 of such videos in September 2019, compared with 7,964 in December the year before.\nAssoc\xa0Prof Li delivered a presentation, which included the doctored video of Mr Obama, on Oct 14 at the recently concluded Singapore Defence Technology Summit, where he talked about advancements in deepfakes and how they could be dangerous if used maliciously.\nFor instance, some have used the technology to superimpose\xa0faces of celebrities in porn videos, while others have pretended to be a different person to defraud a company.\nBut perhaps the most nefarious is how deepfakes could disrupt national security, by spreading misinformation and influencing public opinion.\n""This becomes very concerning because this type of information could make things like social media very dangerous,"" said Assoc\xa0Prof Li, who taught computer science at the University of Southern California.\n""Because the content that you upload there is loosely regulated –\xa0there is always fact-checking that comes afterwards –\xa0but anyone can spread information very quickly.""\nBefore deepfakes came about,\xa0Assoc\xa0Prof Li was involved in bringing deceased actor Paul Walker ""back to life"" for the action film Furious 7, released in 2015.\nWalker died in a car crash\xa0in 2013, and a digital version of the actor was needed to finish filming a ""massive amount"" of scenes, Assoc Prof Li told CNA after his presentation.\nFilmmakers decided to use Walker\'s brothers and a similar-looking actor\xa0in the remaining scenes, with Walker\'s face superimposed on their bodies. Assoc\xa0Prof Li was in charge of animating this digital face.\n""What I helped them with was to\xa0develop a solution for tracking his brother\'s face ...\xa0 and transferring his facial expressions on to the digital version of Paul Walker,"" he said.\n""We used computer vision algorithms to automate the tracking of his face in 3D. That was something that back then was new, we didn\'t use any advanced AI. Back then, there was no deepfake that was used for this.\n""If we had this tool back then, we wouldn\'t need to spend billions of dollars to create the same effect.""\nThe term deepfake was first coined in 2017, Assoc\xa0Prof Li said, when researchers\xa0used deep neural networks\xa0– a sub-field\xa0of machine learning that predicts more accurately\xa0– to generate very realistic facial expressions or even swap one face\xa0with another.\nThis is possible due to the increasingly large amount of footage and images available for these networks to train with, and better hardware in the form of faster graphics processing units, he explained.\n""The way it works is that you train a network so that whenever it takes your input, like in a specific frame of a video, I say, keep the expression, keep the pose and keep the lighting, but swap the identity to be mine,"" he added.\nResearchers then began open-sourcing this technology, leading to the proliferation of face-swapping apps that can also perform tasks like ageing or de-ageing and turning faces into cartoons.\nSome apps allow users to insert their faces into any video, while others let them insert another person\'s face into a recorded video.\n""We can basically make someone do anything you want. The results are extremely convincing because everything is data-driven,"" Assoc Prof Li said.\nIn fact, the\xa0technology is progressing so rapidly that people can now create high-fidelity deepfakes that do not come with the usual blurriness or compression.\nOne example Assoc Prof Li showed\xa0in his presentation was a deepfake video of Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro giving a speech. The video was presented in high-definition, with extremely realistic contours and shadows on Mr Bolsonaro\'s face.\n""In this video, we have shown that all the state-of-the-art deepfake detectors, as of last year, were not able to detect that there was any manipulation in any frame,"" Assoc Prof Li said.\nHe also demonstrated a system that allows people to create high-quality deepfakes in real-time, such as by swapping their face with that of a famous person during a video call.\nWith such accurate deepfakes, Assoc Prof Li acknowledged that there are ""obvious threats""\xa0like impersonating a doctor to spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, or someone from the defence industry stealing sensitive information pertaining to national security.\nSome states use deepfake technology to disrupt a target across the political spectrum, S Rajaratnam School of International Studies senior fellow Benjamin Ang previously told CNA, citing research done on national security issues.\nIn April, reports emerged that politicians from the UK, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia had been tricked into having video calls with a Russian prankster claiming to be Leonid Volkov, chief of staff to imprisoned Russian anti-Putin politician Alexei Navalny.\nWhile the politicians said they had fallen victim to a deepfake, the group behind the prank said it created a lookalike only using make-up and artfully obscure camera angles, The Verge reported.\n""Using deepfakes, you can make this more convincing,"" Assoc Prof Li said.\nDespite that, Assoc Prof Li said it is ""still difficult"" for an average person to create a deepfake that is really good, citing the need for advanced production techniques. He told the BBC last year that his technology was never designed to trick people, and will be sold exclusively to businesses.\n""The second thing is, there is some level of fact-checking on social media. It\'s not like you put whatever on social media and everyone believes it,"" he said.\n""So, you still need to need to hack into someone\'s account and make that person share something to have this level of threats.""\nNevertheless, Assoc Prof Li said it is useful to raise general awareness of deepfakes and have technology that can detect them, pointing to a project he is working on with the US\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\nThe project is developing media forensics\xa0algorithms that\xa0can identify whether a video has been manipulated and is being used for malicious purposes.\n""Imagine, I can press a\xa0button here and I could see, well,\xa0it looks legit, or something is wrong with your lighting or the way your mouth moves, which could warn me that something is wrong,"" Assoc Prof Li said.\nFacebook also said in June that it has developed AI software to not only identify deepfake media but also to figure out where they came from.\nIn July, AI Singapore launched a five-month long competition to design solutions that will help detect fake media, with participants having\xa0access to datasets of original and fake media videos with audio.\nParticipants will need to build AI models that estimate\xa0the probability that any given video is fake, with the winner\xa0– expected to be announced in January next year\xa0– standing to earn S$100,000 and a start-up grant of S$300,000 to further develop their solutions using Singapore as a base.\nBeyond the use of\xa0AI, Assoc Prof Li said deepfake technologists should also work closely with regulators. ""You want to impose laws that basically prevent an illegal use of these kinds of technologies,"" he added.\nHowever, Assoc Prof Li stressed that deepfakes could be used positively, such as to enhance visual effects including\xa0de-ageing in videos. He is currently working with high-end production studios on movies using 4K AI-synthesised effects, mainly\xa0focused on faces.\n""One of the technologies that we\'re building here in Pinscreen is basically augmenting traditional computer graphics with high-fidelity neural rendering that can run in real-time, so that we have enhanced virtual avatars for various applications,"" he said.\n""It can be used for gaming, it can be used for the creation of virtual assistants, but also for highly realistic telepresence applications where people can immerse in virtual worlds.""\nAssoc Prof Li predicted that deepfake technology will eventually become mainstream, given how people are already living in a digital society with various tools on social media to change how they look.\n""Once these things look\xa0better,\xa0people will start to use these technologies differently and go beyond what is possible,"" he said.\n""So, you may not even want to be yourself, you want to be someone else. This, I think, is going to be for sure a capability that will be available.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     deepfake ', '     artificial intelligence ', '     technology ', '     cybersecurity ']}"

      Has your phone started to slow down? 3 tips for giving it a boost
  </h1>, 'text': 'There is a widely shared conspiracy theory that phone manufacturers deliberately slow down phones as they age to entice you to buy a new device. In reality, the opposite has been true. In the last few years, Apple’s iPhone software updates have made older phones faster, and Google’s Android 12 release, expected in coming weeks, was also designed to improve performance.\nIt is true that phones slow down over time –\xa0but for different reasons. Like a car, smartphones need maintenance to stay in tiptop shape. Here are some tips for what to do to give your phone a boost if it’s feeling sluggish.\nREPLACE THE BATTERY\xa0\nSome manufacturers, like Apple, slow down phones when the battery is on the fritz to keep the device running longer. A simple remedy is to replace your battery through the company or at a local phone repair shop. Depending on the phone model and the repair shop, a battery replacement can cost between US$30 and US$80.\nBE MINDFUL OF YOUR STORAGE\xa0\nMany people don’t realise that just because your iPhone or Samsung phone has 64 or 128 gigabytes of storage doesn’t mean you should fill it all the way up. The device will run faster if more of its storage is available. So at least once a year, purge the apps, photos and files that you no longer use.\nSTART FRESH\nOver time, phones can feel slow and buggy because of software updates, tweaked system settings and so on. If the basic maintenance steps above don’t help, try backing up all your phone data and completely erasing all the data on the device. Then reinstall the operating system and restore your data from the backup. This can solve software problems that would otherwise be tough to diagnose.\nBy Brian X Chen © The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      18 students make this year’s Singapore 100 Women in Tech List
  </h1>, 'text': ""We may sometimes forget it, but technology pervades almost every aspect of our lives, from virtual work meetings to seeing a doctor.\xa0And a new list puts the spotlight on Singapore's most influential women in this field.\xa0\nThis year's\xa0Singapore 100 Women in Tech List was released on Friday (Oct 15)\xa0to\xa0celebrate\xa0women in the local infocomm technology industry, highlighting their contributions in areas such as healthcare, cybersecurity, computer sciences, engineering, mathematics and communications.\nNow on its second year, the list is a partnership between the Singapore Computer Society (SCS) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). It was unveiled at the annual\xa0SCS Tech3 Forum, where Minister for\xa0Communications and Information Josephine Teo was the guest-of-honour.\n“Today, women make up 41 per cent\xa0of our tech workforce, well above the global average of 28 per cent,”\xa0said Teo in her opening remarks at the virtual event.\xa0\n“This is good, of course, but I do believe, as many of you as well, that there is so much more we can do to attract and retain female talent in tech-related careers,”\xa0she added.\xa0\n\xa0\nThe list of 100 women also\xa0includes a new category\xa0called Girls in Tech, which lauds 18 female students.\nThe young women were nominated by their respective schools as role models who use tech to benefit the community.\xa0\n“This year, we are pleased to include our first batch of aspiring girls in tech. Every one of these women and girls has a unique story that will inspire and motivate us to do the seemingly impossible,” said SCS president Dr Chong Yoke Sin in a press release.\xa0\nOne of the 18 students is 22-year-old Glenda Wee, a first-year\xa0medical student at Duke-NUS Medical School who recently graduated from Singapore University of Technology and Design's Computer Science and Design course.\xa0Wee volunteered as a user-experience designer for SupplyAlly too, a website and app for local government agencies to track the distribution of items such as masks and laptops to the public.\nWee, who is passionate about healthcare innovation, said she hopes to “speak both the languages of engineers and doctors”.\nAnother young honouree is 22-year-old Ellie Lew. The final-year Nanyang Technological University (NTU) undergrad is one of the three founding members of a youth-led non-profit initiative called Skills for Good.\xa0\nThe tech platform matches volunteers to projects in social enterprises, allowing them to contribute their skills in marketing, content creation and website development.\n“First, we wanted to provide opportunities for our peers to practise their skills in real life projects. Second, we wanted to help social organisations focus on their purpose of creating social impact without worrying about things like digitalisation and marketing,” said Lew on the NTU website.\xa0\nSrishti Arora, who’s in her penultimate year at NTU, helped develop a mental health app called Calmify, encouraging users to “indulge in a self-care routine” that includes randomly generated self-care cards that link them to resources such as yoga and poetry. It also includes a journaling feature.\nThe younger ones on the list who are still in secondary school are not any less impressive.\xa0\nChristy Ann Heng from Admiralty Secondary School is an “avid” participant of tech competitions and spends her free time acquiring Python coding and artificial intelligence (AI) skills from web design events.\nMeanwhile, Mrunal Makarand Kulkarni from Temasek Secondary School is volunteering to teach coding to underprivileged kids through Google and IMDA’s Code In The Community project.\xa0\nAnd two students from Raffles Girls’ School, project partners Sarah Tan and Chanz Boo, developed an innovative robot called ViBuddy for the visually impaired. \xa0\nElsewhere, other women cited in the list include UOB’s Head of Group Technology and Operations Susan Hwee and HDB’s Chief Information Officer Khoo Mui Kheng.\nHwee plays\xa0a key role in driving the popular e-payment method PayNow in Singapore while Khoo helps\xa0ensure the smooth operations of critical online public services such as Build-To-Order housing applications.\nTham Loke Kheng, Chief Executive Officer of Mediacorp,\xa0was recognised\xa0for her work in embracing technology, and establishing and leading the organisation to becoming a digital-first media platform.\nAll the 600 nominees for the 2021 Singapore 100 Women in Tech List went through a selection and evaluation process by a panel comprising several honourees from the inaugural 2020 list, as well as influential leaders in business, technology and academia, said the press release.\nIn addition to their achievements and contribution, the panel also considered the nominees’ technical expertise or entrepreneurial spirit, said Professor Alex Siow, chairman of the SG100WIT Selection Committee and a professor in NUS School of Computing.\xa0\nSee the full 2021 Singapore 100 Women in Tech List here.\nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      The Big Read: Screen time all the time — the unspoken effects of COVID-19 on digital addiction
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: When social media sites Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp were temporarily down on Monday\xa0(Oct 4) night, it was the first time in a long while that Xiu Ting, 23, managed to go to bed before midnight — without spending at least half an hour on her bed mindlessly scrolling through the sites, a common pre-bedtime ritual for countless people around the world.\xa0\n“It helped me sleep earlier ... I was quite happy to be honest,” she said, adding that she typically looks through her Facebook feed just before she sleeps in order to catch up with news.\nWhile Monday night offered a temporary reprieve, Xiu Ting, who works at a tech firm, said that she engages in some form of screen time for most of her waking hours — a situation made worse by the pandemic as it accelerates the digitalisation of all aspects of people’s lives.\xa0\nWorking from home means that she would sometimes wake up at 7am “in a panic”, several hours before work begins, afraid that she may have missed messages from her colleagues. When she works, she would be conscious of appearing online and as a result, continually switches between different messaging applications.\nShe keeps a close eye on her phone during lunchtime as well, anticipating messages from her colleagues who may have already finished their meals.\n“I definitely did not do that when I was working in the office, because everyone will be eating lunch with you, so how can they text you?”\nAfter work, she would speak to her boyfriend, whom she is in a long-distance relationship with, over a video calling app. Later in the evening, she would often watch shows on streaming app Netflix to wind down.\n“It feels like I am on my phone (or screen) at every waking hour,” said Xiu Ting, who declined to give her full name.\nSuch overdependence on screen time has affected not just working adults here like Xiu Ting, but children as well.\nA secondary school teacher, who wished to be known only as Peter, said that he often finds it difficult to convince his children to put down their devices.\nHis seven-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter have seen a significant increase in their screen time during the pandemic, due to home-based learning and the reduction in outdoor activities.\nWhile his children used to have only one hour of daily screen time before the pandemic, they are now engrossed in their screens for about seven hours a day — about four to five hours for home-based learning, and another three hours on their own mobile devices during their free time.\n“We try to control them, but it’s really difficult because we also have our own work and aren't able to monitor them closely,” said the 39-year-old. “As a result … we allow them a lot more screen time than we usually did before.”\nHe believes that the increased screen time has led to worsening myopia in his children. His daughter has had to change her spectacle lenses three times over the last three years, and his son did this once in the last one-and-a-half years.\nPeter’s attempts to limit his children’s screen time have also been unsuccessful, as they tend to look to him as an example.\xa0\n“When I tell (my son) ‘you’ve been watching your iPad for so long’, he will tell me ‘you also’, which is true,” he said.\nThe time which people — both young and old — spend looking at their screens, along with its ill-effects, has been on the rise here even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck early last year.\nBut the phenomenon has been exacerbated by the move towards working from home, and coupled with social distancing measures, more people are being pushed to interact online instead, according to those spoken to.\n“In the wake of the circuit breaker last year, there was a sudden switch to online everything — online work, online home learning, online leisure (and) online socialising,” said Professor Lim Sun Sun, the head of humanities at Singapore University of Technology and Design’s (SUTD) Arts and Social Sciences.\nWhile the use of technology is helpful in helping people to connect during a time of isolation, there soon comes the problem of overdependence on technology, when people feel that “everything is being done online”, said the researcher, who is also a professor of communication and technology.\nThe problem is not unique to Singapore, with various studies from abroad showing an increase in screen use among adults and children during the pandemic.\nFor instance, a study on more than 700 young adults in the United States revealed that their weekly screen time increased from about 25 hours a week in 2018 to about 28 hours a week when they were surveyed again at the height of the unprecedented global crisis last year.\nThe form of screen time most commonly reported to have gone up was that of television shows and streaming services, said the study which was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health in April.\nStudies done last year in countries such as Germany, Canada and Turkey had also shown similar increases in people’s screen time during the pandemic compared to before it.\nAnecdotally in Singapore, excessive screen use has led to a rise in the number of patients with symptoms related to their digital habits, said psychologists, psychiatrists\xa0and ophthalmologists\xa0 spoken\xa0to.\nDr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist at Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, said that compared to pre-pandemic days, he has seen in recent months a 10 per cent increase in patients coming in for conditions such as sleeping troubles, increased stress levels, and the inability to focus at work, all partly due to excessive screen usage.\n“I even have patients who come and see me and they have meetings and calls (on their phones) at the same time,” said Dr Lim. “Having to use the screen more, people find it very difficult to concentrate.”\nFor one legal executive, who wanted to be known only as Cassie, working from home via online communication tools has led to increased stress and anxiety levels, as well as physiological symptoms such as acid reflux, which leads to stomach pains.\nEchoing the sentiments of many employees interviewed, the 26-year-old, who works for a transport company, reiterated that the problem of trust arises during periods of working from home, which she did not experience when she was back at the office earlier this year.\n“The office uses (a messaging application), and if status is not green, my boss will think I’m not at my desk, and not available.”\nAdding to her anxiety, Cassie said that online work conversations often come across as harsh and no-nonsense, as it is hard to “read the tone” of her colleagues, while interactions back in the office have been warmer and more constructive when they talk face-to-face.\n“It affects you psychologically, you can sense a lot more frustration.”\nTo counter the stress from work, Cassie will intentionally go offline for about an hour during lunch — but then finds herself watching either Netflix or Disney Plus on the same screen during the break.\nAside from the acid reflux, her sleep has also been affected. She said that even when she sleeps eight to nine hours, she still feels tired.\nTo combat the ill-effects of excessive screen time, one mother decided to implement some drastic measures.\nMs Joey Lim, a mother of three, was alarmed when she saw that her sons, aged six, eight, and 11, were starting to learn mature language and ideas based on the shows they were watching on streaming sites YouTube and Netflix.\n“As children, they learn things very quickly, by imitating the language from the shows,” said the 37-year-old. “It is not right.”\n“Even when I install parental control, there are still ways to go around it… It is not easy to control.”\nWhile her sons had a lot more time outdoors to play with their friends when the community cases were lower earlier this year, they hardly go out anymore due to the sharp spike in COVID-19 numbers in recent months.\nThis has led to her children becoming less social, with their heads buried in their mobile devices regularly.\nSo, Ms Lim decided last month that she would ban the use of screen time for her kids outside of home-based learning. The past three weeks have been challenging, she said, since her children had been kept occupied by the mobile devices and TV.\nNow, her children would constantly interrupt her as she works, bored from not being able to use their mobile devices. They would also mess up the entire house by rummaging for toys or other items to keep themselves busy.\nAt times, the children would also quarrel among themselves.\nBut Ms Lim said: “They are playing a lot more with each other, fighting a lot more, they interact more … If they sit in front of the TV for so many hours, the whole afternoon is just wasted.”\nAccording to several experts, excessive screen use can have a range of harmful effects.\xa0\nOn the social front, increasing screen time can lead to overdependence on our devices.\nSUTD’s Prof Lim said that overdependence depends on what one is willing to trade off in order to get more screen time.\n“If you find that you have become so reliant, fixated on technology that you will trade off going out with your friend or trade off talking to your family member just to remain online, that’s when you should be bothered,” she said. “Obviously, your technology use is impeding your healthy functioning as adults.”\xa0\nAgreeing, Ms Carine Liew, a clinical psychologist from Mind What Matters, said that the time spent on screen would disconnect us from real-life interactions.\n“This may lead to social difficulties such as feelings of loneliness and isolation,” she said.\nFor children, the use of screens can impede their social and emotional development.\nDr Geraldine Tan, a psychologist at The Therapy Room, said many children have “forgotten how to speak on an audio call” due to prolonged screen use.\n“Many of them have learnt internet lingo, learnt how to type, they will say they have plenty of friends online… but when they have to speak face to face, you find that they are very inept,” she said.\n“It’s a skill that you acquire when you are interacting with another person, and you have to practise and sharpen those skills… (the younger) generation has little opportunity to do that.”\nAgreeing, Peter, the secondary school teacher, said that even during their freetime, the children at his school tend to use their phones rather than talk to each other.\nThere was a period of about two months where the children were allowed to use their phones during recess, and this decision “killed their social interactions”, he said.\n“The students were seated together but they were glued to their screens, oblivious to whoever was around them,” he said. “Sometimes, they didn’t even touch their food until the last five minutes, then they would gobble it down.”\nAnother effect of excessive screen time is the tendency to “zone out”, said the experts.\nThis can happen when people are scrolling through their social media accounts for new content mindlessly, sometimes for prolonged periods.\nDr Lim, the psychiatrist, said that people zone out because they are conditioned to expect engaging and exciting content at every turn. He likens the phenomenon to gambling.\n“In gambling, when you pull a jackpot machine, it is not like you will win everytime, but randomly you win, so our brain is very drawn to random positive reinforcement,” he said.\nHe added the same can be said for content on social media, where people “don’t know if the next video or post will be interesting or rewarding” and this keeps them scrolling.\n“Before you know it, you have spent a lot of time, and it takes up a lot of energy and gets you hooked onto it,” said Dr Lim. “While it may seem to be relaxing, it is actually quite a strain on the mental effort.”\nHe added that being on the screen for prolonged periods of time also leads to a loss in routine, when every activity involving work, leisure, and social connections is all on the same screen.\nOften, this also bleeds into each other — when people regularly reply to messages from friends during work, or watch an episode of a drama during a work lunch break.\n“They don’t realise that all this adds on to their stress and anxiety,” said Dr Lim.\nThis could lead to physiological symptoms, such as the acid reflux experienced by Cassie.\nMs Liew added that juggling work and leisure on the same screen could also mean falling behind on daily tasks when one is constantly distracted.\n“If (multitasking) eats into your productive time, then maybe you will feel more stressed, because you can’t finish your work,” she said.\xa0\nThe space where a screen is used also matters. For instance, if people keep using their phones while lying in bed, they will associate the bed less as a place of rest but as a space to use these devices.\n“The loss of routine disrupts their circadian rhythm (and) it can be quite disruptive to their sleep,” said Dr Lim.\nAssociate Professor Marcus Ang, a senior consultant at the Corneal and External Eye Disease Department of the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC), said that common symptoms of excessive screen use include eye strains, teary eyes and dry eyes.\nThese symptoms normally present themselves to those who are 40 years old and above, and get progressively more severe for those who are older.\nHe said that before the pandemic, fewer than half of his patients would come to him due to excessive screen use, but now, a “vast majority” of them do so.\n“There’s a majority of (patients) who work from home who will report these symptoms, so it’s definitely significant,” said Assoc Prof Ang.\nThe other concern which he has is the increase in myopia — or short-sightedness — among younger patients and children.\nHe said that the Myopia Centre at SNEC has been seeing an increase in the number of children seeking treatment for myopia in the past two to three years.\nAssoc Prof Ang, who is also the co-clinical director of the Myopia Centre, said that while it is debatable that excessive use of screen time directly causes myopia, it has been proven that the more time spent outdoors, the less likely a person is to develop myopia.\n“It’s very complex… a person who does more home-based learning also spends less time outdoors. They don’t take the bus, go to school, go to the playground, so it comes hand in hand,” he said.\xa0\nSNEC was unable to provide data on the rise in myopia cases during the pandemic.\nHowever, based on latest available statistics, the Ministry of Health website states that in 2019, the prevalence of myopia in Singapore was among the highest in the world, with 65 per cent of children here being myopic at Primary 6, and 83 per cent of young adults having the same problem.\nAssoc Prof Ang expects the situation to get worse in the coming years, with up to 80 per cent of children here possibly becoming myopic.\nWhile a digital detox is almost impossible, there are some practical ways to better manage one’s screen time, said the experts interviewed.\nPeople can change their daily routines and habits around their screens.\nFor example, Dr Lim said that it is best to “leave all your work in one corner”, and not do work in different spaces in the house such as on the bed.\n“If you keep using (your device) in bed, the brain will think this is a work space and it becomes alert,” he said.\nDr Tan said that people should also learn to have off-screen time.\nThis can be as simple as having a 10-minute walk after work without a phone, or even a lunchtime workout.\nFor parents, they can help their children by implementing breaks from their digital devices.\nMs Liew said that parents can create a schedule for their children that indicates when they are allowed to use their devices, so they “know what to expect”. For instance, mealtimes can be designated to be phone-free.\nParents should also focus on the content that their children are consuming, and one good way to do so is to watch the programmes with them.\n“Notice what the children are doing on the devices... teach them how to use the tools to build connection and creativity, besides just using social media mindlessly,” she said.\nIn laying down these restrictions, Prof Lim said that it would be better if parents explain to their children why they are taking the devices away.\n“When your child knows why you are doing this, there is a greater likelihood of your child seeing the value in it,” she said. “If you say ‘just do what I say’, that creates this tension between you and the child that closes the door to future conversations.”\nAnother way to better manage screen time is to embark on hands-on activities and hobbies. These can include sedentary pastimes such as solving jigsaw puzzles and knitting, which can help people relax and destress.\nProf Lim said that while the online environment continuously stimulates the mind, the bombardment of information takes up a lot of mental space.\n“The cognitive load is much higher than when you’re knitting and cooking, because for that, you are just focused on one task,” she said.\nWhen doing these hands-on activities, people can also have interactions and conversations with family members who may want to join in, she said. This is not the same as using a device, where people can be in our “own bubble” even with others around them.\nEven an activity as simple as doing a crossword puzzle can be more beneficial than using a phone, since one is still engaging in some psycho-motor skills when pressing pen to paper.\n“People have a bit more sensory feedback when writing, this tactile, sensory feedback is something that many of us are lacking,” Dr Tan said.\nMs Liew said that parents should also think about activities such as board games and sports to engage their children.\n“Children should develop other areas of interests and skills … get them to balance out screen time with other activities as well,” she said.\nHaving face-to-face interactions is also essential and cannot be fully replaced by the conversations that take place online, said experts.\nDr Lim said that when working from home, a lot of nuances are lost in online conversations.\n“For example, they don’t get little reassurances like the pat on the shoulder from a colleague … they lose the personal touch and people find it a bit disconcerting,” he said. “People don’t realise how much they need reassurances.”\nDr Lim said that one can take the extra step of simply making a phone call instead of messaging their friends or colleagues.\nHe added that one-on-one meet-ups should also be encouraged, even for children.\n“We shouldn’t be too paranoid about COVID-19 and learn to live with it,” he said. “If your child would like to have friends visit or go out for a walk in an open space, we should encourage that.”\nTo prevent symptoms such as dry eyes and blurry vision, Assoc Prof Ang said that those who are working for long hours in front of a screen should adopt the 20-20-20 rule, where for every 20 minutes, they take 20-second breaks to look at something 20 feet (or about 6m) away.\nThis will help reduce the strain of staring at a screen less than 1m away.\nTo prevent myopia, he said that outdoor time is very important, especially for children.\nParents can aim to spend one to two hours a day outdoors with their children to walk around parks or cycle, for example. They should also take their children to an eye doctor for regular checks.\nIt is crucial to start early if parents want to prevent the onset of myopia.\n“Myopia is irreversible … If a child becomes more myopic during this pandemic, it may affect them for the rest of their lives,” said Assoc Prof Ang.\xa0\nWhile the pandemic has aggravated the issue of increased screen time, the problem is unlikely to go away even after Singapore learns to live with Covid-19 and more people return to their workplaces and schools.\nLove it or hate it, but the reality is that people will not be able to do without technology even post-pandemic, said the experts.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has merely sped up the trend towards a greater adoption of technology, and it is up to individuals to better manage it.\n“The stronger reliance on the screens means that we need to learn to manage it rather than reject it,” said Dr Tan. “It should not be treated like an enemy but a tool to help us to move forward.”\nEven for children, home-based learning should also be seen as a potentially beneficial tool to help them learn better.\nAssociate Professor Lilian Chee from the School of Design and Environment at the National University of Singapore, said that tackling the negative side effects of excessive screen time does not necessitate an “outright ban on technology”.\nAfter all, she said that online learning programmes can be “as enlightening as in-person classes”.\n“It’s about equipping children with the skills to navigate technology and the problems that arise from them — like addiction and cyber-bullying,” said Assoc Prof Chee, who is leading a study on home-based work in Singapore.\n“For that, it requires parents, teachers and caregivers to be mature in our understanding of technology as well.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     The Big Read ', '     COVID-19 ', '     technology ', '     myopia ']}"

      Commentary: Chinese tech giants will only get stronger
  </h1>, 'text': 'SHANGHAI: Over the last 20 years, a number of thriving technology companies have emerged in China. This has invited much speculation about the country’s scientific and technological prowess, and about its ability to innovate.\nSome argue that China is already nipping at America’s heels in these domains and has become a world leader in some sectors.\nOthers believe that China is not quite as far along as it may appear, and the government’s regulatory clampdown on tech companies will impede its continued progress.\nWhich is it?\nThose who doubt China’s progress emphasise the country’s reliance on Western technology, pointing out that its homegrown tech companies still do not compete with their American counterparts globally.\nBut China optimists note that those companies continue their rapid international expansion, a reflection of China’s exceptional capacity for learning.\nThe latter camp has a point. In fact, China’s capacity for learning is the secret to the country’s economic success, and it says much more about China’s prospects than where the country stands technologically.\nAfter all, technological innovation is less an input than an output of entrepreneur-led economic development. It is by building thriving businesses that entrepreneurs gain opportunities to develop new technologies and applications.\nTrue, China has faced growing external challenges in recent years, including clampdowns on technology sharing by developed economies.\nFurthermore, the government’s efforts to maintain internal economic order and mitigate financial risks, such as through increased regulation of tech companies, have been controversial in the market. And some foreign manufacturing firms have reportedly withdrawn from China.\nBut the economy has not ground to a halt. On the contrary, the entrepreneurial impulse driving China’s development remains strong.\nIt helps that China has a huge internal market of 1.4 billion people connected by well-developed transportation systems, advanced communication networks, and flexible and efficient supply chains.\nWhile many foreign firms have come and gone, this has always happened, and it is not because outsiders are treated unfairly in the Chinese market.\nForeign companies simply struggle to compete with local companies, which enjoy a significant advantage, including less bureaucratic red tape and deeper market knowledge.\nMoreover, while foreign firms might arrive in China with a slight technological advantage, it is usually short-lived, given how fast Chinese companies learn.\nToday, there is a staggering number of successful small and medium-size Chinese companies. They might not be household names – in fact, they’re referred to as “invisible champions” – but they are constantly innovating in applying advanced technologies.\nAnd their ranks continue to grow.\nThere is also a large number of Chinese companies serving overseas customers, with many maintaining a far larger presence in Europe and the United States than in China.\nThese firms leverage China’s efficient warehousing, distribution, and logistics systems, as well as its superior capabilities in product design and manufacturing, to bolster their competitiveness in overseas markets.\nShein, an online fast-fashion retailer that was founded in 2008 in Nanjing, is a typical example of such a firm. It began as a cross-border e-commerce company, selling clothing via platforms like Amazon and eBay.\nBut, in 2014, the company created its own brand and launched a bespoke website and app in markets around the world, from the US and Europe to the Middle East and India.\nBy selling inexpensive clothing directly to consumers, Shein thrived. Before long, it had become the second-most-popular e-commerce site for young Americans, behind only Amazon.\nAccording to Google trends, users in the US – Shein’s leading market – search for Shein more than three times as often as they search for Zara.\nDespite being worth an estimated US$15 billion, Shein was not particularly well-known in China until last year, when it was listed as one of China’s top-ten “unicorns” (private companies with a valuation over $1 billion).\nThat is because it does not serve the Chinese market. Instead, it has leveraged China’s advantages – the result of huge amounts of government investment over the last 20 years – to build its own flexible supply chain, concentrated in Guangdong, the country’s most developed manufacturing center.\nThanks to this supply chain, Shein is reportedly able to take a product from design to production in ten days.\nIts fast-fashion competitors – whose products are typically designed in Europe, manufactured in Southeast Asia and China, sent to European headquarters for warehousing, and then shipped to global markets – simply cannot keep up. Shein has also started to build warehouses in some key markets.\nShein is no anomaly. China boasts a number of other fast-fashion cross-border e-commerce platforms, and a total of 251 unicorns, as of last year.\nThe list includes social media apps such as TikTok, which has taken the world by storm. The influence of Chinese Internet companies is large and still growing in the European, American, and South Asian markets.\nChina’s government is partly to thank. After the SARS outbreak of 2003, it worked to support the expansion of e-commerce.\nThen, to offset the shock of the 2008 global financial crisis, it made continuous investments in Internet, communication and transportation networks, mobile-payment systems, logistics and warehousing capabilities, and supply chains, while promoting linkages among sectors.\nThese efforts have helped strengthen and sustain the economy’s base-level sources of innovative dynamism.\nTo be sure, China’s super-size, fast-growing economy suffers from its structural problems, which seem not to correspond with its underlying dynamism.\nThis apparent discrepancy is a reminder of the economy’s complexity. For example, because the state-owned sector captures a disproportionate share of financial resources, it is often regarded as a source of misallocation.\nBut recent studies find that state-owned enterprises might have served as an informal channel for alleviating the financing constraints of small and medium-sized enterprises. \nThose who focus excessively on surface-level phenomena will continue to underestimate China’s economic resilience. \nOne cannot truly understand the Chinese economy and its prospects without paying attention to the irrepressible dynamism that forms its base.\nZhang Jun, Dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University, is Director of the China Center for Economic Studies, a Shanghai-based think tank.

      Commentary: Facebook found Instagram could hurt teens’ mental health, but is it doing enough to address it?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Facebook says its mission is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together”. \nBy espousing such lofty aims, the company sets itself up to be judged harshly when it falls short. \nAnd it has - many times. For years, critics have slammed Facebook for enabling the spread of fake news and hate speech,\xa0and for contributing to political polarisation\xa0from America to the United Kingdom and\xa0Myanmar. \nAs the global COVID-19 pandemic rages on, Facebook only recently started taking a tougher stance on vaccine misinformation, including long-debunked mistruths.\nNow the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has reported on another casualty of one of the company’s platforms: Teen mental health. \nFacebook’s research on Instagram showed, to quote an internal presentation from 2019 that an employee leaked to the WSJ, “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls”. \nOne slide said: “Teens blame\xa0Instagram\xa0for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression. This reaction was unprompted and consistent”. \nAnother\xa0showed that some teen users attributed feelings of being “not good enough”, “unattractive” - and even suicidal thoughts - to the app.\nThe notion that teenagers’ mental health is impacted by social media use is not new. For example, a UK study of 5,000 young people found that heavy social media use was linked to low self-esteem, especially in girls. \nBut it is all the more concerning when the company’s own research says so. \nTo be fair, Facebook deserves some credit for conducting research on potential harms. \nAnd no single study can prove, authoritatively, that Instagram use causes teens to feel inferior to the carefully curated images posted by celebrities, influencers and friends. Social science requires replication. \nStill, it’s never ideal for whistle-blowers to beat a company to exposing its bad news. Facebook could have proactively announced its research findings, even if preliminary, and called for further study of the problem and even pre-emptive safeguards.\nInstead, Facebook appears to have gone the other direction. When asked in congressional hearings in March\xa0about the platforms’ effects on children’s mental health, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that research showed that “using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental health benefits”. \nIn August, US senators specifically requested for Facebook to reveal its internal research on children’s mental health. Facebook refused, calling it proprietary and confidential and adding that they were unaware of an expert consensus on how much screen time is “too much”. \nSuch evasion is not what we’d expect from a company that commits itself, in its own words from Instagram’s Terms of Use, to “fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment”.\n“The problem with Facebook is Facebook” goes the line coined by Professor Siva Vaidhyanathan, a media scholar at the University of Virginia.\nThe problems, Vaidhyanathan explains, result when the platforms perform exactly as designed. \nFacebook earns almost all of its revenue from serving advertising tailored to each of us. The platforms gather data on which content makes us linger, click “like”, or leave a comment, then they serve us more of the same. \nThe longer we stay, the more ads the platforms serve. So Facebook has an incentive to send us deeper down our own personally-tailored rabbit holes. \nThat’s great if you’re digging into your new hobby of bird watching. You’ll see more birds. \nIt’s not so great if you get sucked into a whirlpool of baseless conspiracy theories. \nAnd it may be hazardous when teens are obsessing over influencers and their lifestyles. They’ll see more posts of beautiful, glamorous people. The problem is that teens are particularly vulnerable to negative social comparison - including feeling miserable when they fall short of beauty ideals. \nAnother leaked Facebook document from 2020 says: “Social comparison is worse on Instagram” than on rival platforms. On TikTok, the focus is on performances, like dancing, rather than bodies and lifestyles, Facebook noted. \nTikTok, whose mission is “to inspire creativity and bring joy”, is nonetheless vulnerable to similar criticisms. It works the same way as Instagram. \nIn another investigation, Wall Street Journal reporters created TikTok accounts for fictional 13- and 15-year-old users. They used the accounts to linger on videos about sexual fetishes or drugs. The app’s algorithm flooded them with recommendations of similar content. \nNo one is suggesting heavy-handed solutions like purging models’ photos so the rest of us don’t feel bad about ourselves. Some safeguards are worth examining, however. \nFirst, the problems must not be allowed to grow. Facebook made\xa0plans for Instagram Youth, targeted at children ages 10 to 12, despite the objections of state attorneys general and child welfare groups.\nIn the wake of the leaks, Facebook put the plans on hold on Monday (Sep 27), after resisting such calls as recently as July. Facebook should not extend its services to even younger, potentially more vulnerable users until it can ensure that safeguards are in place. \nSecond, Facebook can only fulfil its commitments to safety if it is more transparent. To gain trust, Facebook must fully and openly acknowledge problems. \nFacebook’s proprietary data on users puts it in a unique position to identify possible harms and solutions. It could promptly release internal research findings and fund further external researchers’ investigations, perhaps through an independent grant-giving foundation to reduce the appearance of conflicts of interest. It could share anonymised user data with researchers. \nThird, to the extent the problem lies with recommendation engines, design tweaks need not be complicated. Platforms could adjust their algorithms to slow down the barrage of recommendations, especially to teens, of content\xa0associated with problems like body image issues and eating disorders. Instagram suggested as much following the WSJ report.\nFacebook has taken the step of supporting a non-profit that produces videos encouraging teens to do daily affirmations like, “I am in control of my experience on Instagram”, according to the WSJ report. \nHow much such a campaign helps is another research question that Facebook can help answer. But such efforts may come across as half-hearted if not accompanied by firmer commitments to install safeguards.\nSocial media platforms like Instagram and TikTok may be toxic when they work as designed. So they can be made safer, by design - if their creators truly want to live up to their lofty mission statements. \nDr Mark Cenite is Associate Dean (Undergraduate Education) at Nanyang Technological University’s College of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences.

      What the metaverse is, who’s in it and why it matters
  </h1>, 'text': 'The metaverse is a virtual world that blends aspects of digital technologies including video-conferencing, games like Minecraft or Roblox, cryptocurrencies, email, virtual reality, social media and live-streaming.\nQuite how these pieces will fit together is a work in progress, but investors and executives including Facebook CEO\xa0Mark Zuckerberg are already interested in the commercial potential.\nIt’s hard to describe because it doesn’t truly exist yet. It may be easier to grasp the concept by first saying what it isn’t: It’s not a single product, it’s not a game, and it’s not being created by one company. Rather, it’s akin to a 3D world wide web, where businesses, information and communication tools are immersive and interoperable.\nIn a way it’s a digital facsimile of how we live in the physical world. Just as you might create a document in Microsoft Word and send it via Gmail to a colleague to read on an iPad, items in the metaverse should be able to move across an ecosystem of competing products, holding their value and function.\nA piece of virtual art bought as a “non-fungible token” from Company A, say, should be displayable on the digital wall of a house in a game made by Company B.\nWork and play. For example, “Jane” creates a 3D avatar within Facebook or Microsoft Teams and uses it in virtual meetings. After work, she attends a virtual music show with friends and their avatars appear among the hundreds of little heads in the audience.\nThe music finishes and the band says: “Don’t forget to buy a T-shirt!” Jane browses the designs at a virtual stall just as she would on Amazon, Asos or Taobao today, pays for one with cryptocurrency and wears it at the next day’s virtual meeting. A colleague asks to borrow it for his daughter to use that evening inside a Roblox game, and she lends it to him easily.\nThis simple scenario involves corporate communication tools, live-event streaming, e-commerce and sharing something of value. But it only works if each provider builds its system in a way that makes assets such as avatars and shirts compatible and transferable.\nZuckerberg, for one, sees great promise in the metaverse, and it’s a factor behind his company’s investment in products such as the Oculus virtual-reality headset.\nComputer-graphics chipmaker Nvidia wants its Omniverse platform to power some of the underlying framework, as does software-maker Unity Software.\nVideo-game developers such as Roblox\xa0and producers including Epic Games and Microsoft\xa0all want a piece of the pie. Roblox is also in China through a joint venture with Tencent Holdings, which launched a parallel platform that follows rules set by the Chinese government’s censors. Tencent also has registered a slew of metaverse-related trademarks for its own social app QQ.\nTikTok-owner ByteDance has ploughed money into VR headset maker Pico and mobile game maker Reworld. There are even specialist consultancies such as UK-based Dubit to help companies move into the metaverse. And don’t forget payment providers and cryptocurrencies -\xa0someone’s going to need to facilitate those cross-virtual-border transactions.\nThe metaverse won’t reach its full potential - millions of people accessing and living in the virtual world anywhere, at any time - without ultrafast, low-latency Internet. Case in point is the online world Second Life, which came out before smartphones caught on and lost its appeal in part because it couldn’t provide real-time, on-the-go interactions.\nToday’s 4G\xa0connections can just about support multiplayer apps like Fortnite, but can’t handle hundreds of concurrent streams of time-sensitive data.\nThis is why mobile carriers around the world are spending billions of dollars to build 5G networks. They may need even 6G to take it further. The same is true at home and in the office, where bigger screens drain more bandwidth, favouring fibre optic connections wired directly into premises.\nIt could be a technological leap forward similar to the 1990s, when the web grew from static text and images on a page to a place to buy a book or watch a movie, and then into a way to attend college lectures and collaboratively design products.\nOver the next two decades, work on a metaverse will result in changes to how we perceive value and expect portability in our virtual life. Some mobile carriers are already creating their own metaverse platforms, seeing it as a “killer app” for monetising 5G after losing out to giants such as Facebook and Apple in reaping profits fuelled by social media in the 4G era.\nBut a key challenge will be ensuring large corporations don’t build proprietary silos. Children might play Roblox but want to move their objects or purchases to another platform as they grow up.\nThe concept of a metaverse goes back decades in science-fiction novels, notably Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash.\xa0Movies like The Matrix\xa0and Ready Player One\xa0incorporated key themes.\nSecond Life used metaverse concepts -\xa03D worlds, an economy, live events, workplaces and so on -\xa0but they were locked within the walls of a proprietary ecosystem. Same with Minecraft today.\nAll the components of a metaverse exist today. The missing piece of the puzzle is to join together all the building blocks used by thousands of competing businesses and creators. Achieve that, and you have your metaverse.\n', 'related_topics': ['     metaverse ', '     Internet ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Seniors are spending too much time on their smartphones which can spell trouble
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Hands up those of you who have trouble getting your Ah Ma or Ah Kong to pay attention to you at the dinner table – because they were busy watching a TikTok video on their phone or playing Candy Crush?\nThis scene, while charming in some ways, is fast becoming a common one. And what a change it was from just a few years ago. The elderly among us have always been singled out as the slowest to adapt to digital technology.\nWe’ve heard of older hawkers unable to pivot to food delivery platforms to seniors who are digitally estranged from family because they could not communicate using Zoom or Skype.\nWhen it comes to digital technology, seniors have been consistently painted as reluctant and “technophobic”. But there are valid reasons for this. Some are newly retired and more interested in pursuing other activities while others have trouble reading off the screen of a mobile phone. \nYet, just as many are not averse to technology. This became particularly important during COVID-19 when lockdowns and restrictions gave them the impetus to use tech to stay connected to their children and grandchildren. \nThe rise in the number of seniors adopting technology is clear. According to the 2020 IMDA Annual Survey on Infocomm Usage, smartphone use has risen sharply from 2019 to 2020 for residents aged 75 years and over – from 41 per cent to 60 per cent, alongside the rise in Internet usage for residents in this age group. \nThe seniors I speak to share stories of using their smartphones to watch drama series’, follow YouTube channels and play games. Instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat have also become a popular means of accessing and disseminating information too. \nRecent announcements by the IMDA to expand outreach efforts, increase resources and work with more partners to get seniors to become tech-savvy will only supercharge this trend.\nFor many, communications on instant messaging platforms are often driven by desires to maintain as well as to intensify their relationships – for instance, sending that morning greeting and what seems to be an important warning about COVID-19 can be seen as a way to strengthen their ties to family and friends.\nThis could mean they sometimes prioritise entertainment and appearing relevant as opposed to being accurate. Coupled with their general unfamiliarity with the Internet and increasingly sophisticated disinformation tactics, the phenomenon of seniors becoming more susceptible and spreading falsehoods is deeply troubling. \nIn a 2020 survey, the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) found that the elderly, or those aged 55 and above, had generally lower awareness and adoption of good cyber practices like strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.\xa0\nThis makes them easy prey for online scams. Many seniors I meet are savvy in person but can be quite vulnerable when it comes to online tactics because these are sophisticated and new to them. \nIn 2018 for instance, the Singapore Police Force reported elderly persons were cheated of S$88,000 – a huge jump from just S$4,700 in the previous year.\nScam tactics are also persuasive, particularly if they’re conflated with similar experiences and processes, they are familiar with in the real world (such as giving personal details to verify account details in a bank).\nEducation can help. At the recent Scaminar\xa0conference organised by the Home Team Behavioural Sciences Centre of the Ministry of Home Affairs, one suggestion was to make conversations about scams a daily activity within families and friends. \nBeyond the obvious awareness campaigns of scams and online falsehoods, the risk of too much dependency on smartphones is something that cannot be dealt with as easily. \nWhile there is no direct evidence of excessive use, the increase in seniors using mobile devices for various online activities is clear. The IMDA Annual Survey on Infocomm Usage is a good indicator. \nThe most notable increase came from using social networking sites on the mobile for those aged 50-59 years old – from 64 per cent in 2018 to 85 per cent in 2019. This is a 21 per cent jump when compared to the average increase of just 3 per cent across all age groups for this activity is significant. \nThis shows how dominant social networking has become among this older age group. These numbers were based on pre-COVID-19 times – the frequency of many of these activities would have intensified during the pandemic. \nLike youths, seniors can be enthralled with mobile games, online videos and social media. But the danger is that they may replace important in-person social interactions and physical activity with time on their smartphones. \nIt may seem counterintuitive. After all, smartphones have been used by seniors to connect with family members and deal with boredom. Social media can also be used to rekindle friendships and discover new interests and communities. \nBut too much of a good thing can become bad. Research shows experiencing new, exciting things (such as the apps in our smartphones) can release dopamine to make us feel happy. \nA surprising notification on our social media, a hilarious meme in a chat group or that unexpected bag of coins we find when playing a mobile game can all release dopamine in our brains, increasing our dependence on smartphones. \nSeniors are not immune to such effects. \nFacebook for instance is especially popular because it is easy to use and has a high interactive nature. It’s no surprise the company is expecting its largest growth of new members joining the platform in the United Kingdom to be those over 55.\nIn our quest to get them up to speed with apps and platforms, we also need to talk about digital mindfulness. Learning how to download and play games or navigate online videos on the smartphone can be fascinating, but seniors can turn to them as a quick resolve to loneliness and anxiety. \nBut studies show that such use can in fact worsen their existing emotional and mental health. Like young people, they too can become heavily invested in likes, shares and comments.\nThe conundrum is that unlike children for whom you can set time limits, for seniors, this is not a practical option. So, the next best thing to do is for loved ones to talk to them about excessive use. \nTheir children or caregivers can actively encourage them to go out and exercise or meet face to face, so they don’t become heavily dependent on their phones to pass the time. \xa0\nIn his book on Digital Minimalism, Cal Newport suggests useful questions to ask on how we use technologies – these can be used to start conversations with a senior who has a new phone or is downloading new apps. \nFor instance, family members can discuss how YouTube is great for entertainment but to also explain how this platform works, that algorithms can serve up recommendation videos on a constant loop and some of these are unhealthy to watch. \nThe result of conversations on what they consume and how much they consume it can inspire the whole family, and not just seniors, in changing the way they use digital technologies. \nNatalie Pang is a senior lecturer at the Department of Communications and New Media, National University of Singapore. Her research interest is in digital inclusion, as well as information practices and digital resilience.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Smart Nation ', '     elderly ', '     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      Upgrading? Here's what you can do with an old mobile device 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Upgrading your smartphone or tablet will leave you with a decision: What to do with your old device?\nTrading in, donating or recycling retired gear are all popular options, as is passing on a serviceable phone to a family member sharing your wireless-carrier account. But you have countless other ways to get more productive use from outdated hardware without putting a lot of money into it.\nHere are just a few ideas to get more use out of your demoted device.\nMAKE A MEDIA MACHINE\nNeed an extra television in the kitchen or home office? If you subscribe to a TV provider or streaming service, your old phone or tablet can step up. Just download your TV provider’s app (like Spectrum cable or Verizon Fios) or your separate service (Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Fubo.tv, Netflix or whatever) and log into your account. Prop up the device near an outlet so it can run on electrical power while you watch, since chances are good that the old device has a worn-out battery.\nLikewise, parking your old phone in a speaker cradle that also charges gives you a bookshelf sound system for music and podcasts. Or you can keep the phone connected to its charger and stream music to a nearby wireless Bluetooth speaker. Powered speaker docks can be found online starting at around US$40 (S$54), and a wide variety are available. Wirecutter, the product-testing and review site owned by The New York Times, has suggestions for Bluetooth speakers, general audio gear and those shopping on a budget.\nAnd even if they have to stay tethered to a charger, old tablets also make good dedicated e-book readers or digital picture frames for photo slideshows.\nCONTROL YOUR WORLD\nSmart home appliances, music libraries, internet-connected televisions – so many things can be controlled by apps these days, so why not convert your old phone or tablet into an all-purpose universal remote? Third-party remote apps abound, but many tech companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, LG Electronics, Roku and Samsung, to name a few) have their own programmes. Just take a stroll through your app store for software that matches up with your hardware.\nAnd even if you have not lost the tiny stick remote that came with your set-top streamer yet, the on-screen keyboard included with most apps makes it easier to type in passwords. (Apple, which used to have a stand-alone Remote app, folded the Apple TV remote software into the operating system in iOS 12 but still has an iTunes Remote app for iPhone/iPad users to control their iTunes music collections stored on Macs and PCs.)\nGET YOUR GAME ON\nDepending on the processor and battery state, dedicating your old device to the pursuit of gaming is another way to give it extra life. Wiping off all the old data to start afresh gives you more room to download and store new games.\nPlaying old games on old phones may have nostalgic appeal, and you can find many classics converted for mobile play in the app stores. And you are not limited to stand-alone games. Subscription services like Apple Arcade and Google’s Stadia can run on many mobile devices, and you can beam your games (and other video) to the big screen if you are using the Google Chromecast game mode or the AirPlay technology that Apple devices use to share the screen on Apple TV.\nIf tapping a touch screen has never been your idea of serious gaming, consider snapping your old phone into a special controller that brings physical buttons, the standard D-Pad and thumbsticks to the gaming experience. The Razer Kishi (US$80 to $100) or Backbone One (US$100) are among the options.\nENTERTAIN AND EDUCATE\nIf you have decided that your child can handle a hand-me-down phone or tablet for games and educational apps, take a moment to do a little bit of setup to protect both of you. Visit the settings area and erase your personal information first.\nNext, create an account for the child and configure the parental controls for screen time, app purchases and internet access; operating systems for Amazon, Android, Apple and Samsung all include similar parental control settings.\nIf the phone still has a functional camera (and can still hold a charge for an hour or so), you can also use it to teach the fundamentals of photography. Loading up the child’s app store account with a prepaid app store gift card can impart money management skills. And if the device’s old battery conks out after an hour, you can teach time management.\nBy JD Biersdorfer © 2021 The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Worried about your teen on social media? Here's how to help 
  </h1>, 'text': 'The Wall Street Journal revealed last week that researchers at Instagram had studied for years how its photo-sharing app affects young users and found that it can be particularly harmful to teenage girls, news that alarmed parents and lawmakers.\nAccording to the research, which was not publicly released, Instagram makes body image issues worse for one in three teenage girls. And among teenagers who reported suicidal thoughts, “13 per cent of British users and 6 per cent of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram,” the Journal reported.\nFacebook, which owns Instagram, issued a statement in response, saying in part that “research into the impact social media has on people is still relatively nascent and evolving” and that “no single study is going to be conclusive.” Instagram noted in a statement that social media can have a “see-saw” effect, where the same person might have a negative experience one day and a positive one the next.\nFor some parents, the study’s findings weren’t necessarily surprising given the platform’s preponderance of unattainable, altered images, but it raised an important question: What can we do to help our kids have a healthier relationship with social media?\nSeveral experts offered advice for parents of adolescents on navigating social media, whether their children are already online or on the cusp of receiving their first phone or tablet.\nDON’T GO FROM ‘ZERO TO 100’\nRather than gifting your kid a smartphone and letting them download multiple social media apps, consider letting your child text with a best friend or a cousin on a shared family device to start, suggested Devorah Heitner, the author of Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in Their Digital World.\nThen think about the most appropriate age for your child to start using social media, taking into account their personality, impulsivity and maturity level. Allow them to add one social app when they’re ready, Dr Heitner said, rather than going “from zero to 100.”\nIf your daughter has body image issues, for example, maybe an app like Instagram isn’t right for her, said Jean M Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and the author of iGen, a book about teens and young adults and their relationship with technology.\n\xa0\nYour kid may want to use an app like Snapchat because all their friends are on it, even though the company’s rules say they’re too young. And if that happens, you can reach out to other parents to see if there’s an alternative way for the kids to communicate that allows you to stay true to your own values, Dr Heitner said.\nDr Twenge, a mother of three, has this blanket rule: “Children 12 and under should not be on social media,” she said. “The answer is no, and the law is behind you.”\nThe law she is referring to is called the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits companies from collecting data online from children under 13\xa0– and as a result, social media platforms say children under 13 cannot create their own account. But kids 12 and under can easily evade any age-related restrictions on social media platforms by lying about their birth year, said Linda Charmaraman, the director of the Youth, Media & Wellbeing Research Lab at Wellesley College.\nIn 2019, over 90 per cent of the 773 middle schoolers surveyed during the first wave of a longitudinal study conducted by Dr Charmaraman’s lab reported that they had their own smartphone. Nearly three-quarters of those kids had already starting using Instagram or Snapchat, and more than 40 per cent were 10 or younger when they first joined.\nFacebook, which is developing an Instagram app for children under 13, says the new app would keep children off its main platform while addressing safety and privacy concerns. But lawmakers, state prosecutors and children’s and consumer groups are deeply concerned.\nSET TIME LIMITS\nIt’s not as though once a child reaches the age of 13 they are suddenly ready to handle all of the issues that can accompany a social media account. After all, some adults still struggle with it.\nThink about the least invasive ways to set time limits and establish social media etiquette rather than constantly monitoring your child’s online interactions, and aim to come across as supportive and helpful, rather than someone who will be perceived as anxious, shocked or punitive, Dr Heitner suggested.\nWhen you decide that your kids are ready to have their own device, don’t give them 24-7 access to it, the experts said.\nRemove phones, tablets or other electronic devices from your child’s bedroom at night. And if your teenager uses their phone as an alarm clock, buy an alarm clock that is not connected to the internet, Dr Twenge said.\nChoose one platform and one time period, she added. You could say, for example, that your child can use Instagram for 30 minutes a day. You can set that limit via your phone\xa0– on Apple look for the Family Sharing settings and on Android you can use an app called Family Link. When the time limit is up, the app on your child’s phone will no longer be accessible. To prevent unwanted downloads, there is also an Ask to Buy setting on Apple phones that will send a request to the parent when kids want to buy or download a new item.\nIf you have a kid who is tech savvy and might try to override settings like this, you may need to physically remove their device after the time limit, Dr Heitner said.\nYou can also consider getting your child a Gabb phone, which does not allow for web or app browsing, or Pinwheel, a smartphone with multiple built-in parental controls, including the ability to monitor your child’s communications.\nA 2019 report from Common Sense Media found that most tweens and teenagers with a phone or tablet do not use apps or tools to track their device time, however the experts said this is something everyone, including parents, can benefit from.\nIf you prefer not to monitor social media use electronically, you can simply ask your child to hand over their phone while they focus on homework or another activity, Dr Twenge said.\nIt’s important for kids (and adults) to understand that the more we pay attention to our phones the less we’re investing energy in the rest of our lives and, as a result, “the rest of our lives actually become less interesting,” said Anna Lembke, the chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University and the author of Dopamine Nation.\nAt the dinner table and elsewhere family members need to “collectively all turn our attention to each other,” she said. “We have to do that in order to preserve those connections.” Be honest about your own struggles curbing media usage. Take digital breaks when needed and encourage your kids to log off too.\n“Social media platforms are designed to be addictive,” Dr Twenge said. “It’s not just an individual problem, it’s a group problem.”\nHELP YOUR TEEN UNDERSTAND AND CURATE THEIR FEED\nA study published in 2016 found that fewer than half of the parents surveyed regularly discussed social media content with their tween and teenage children.\nBut the experts said it’s helpful to talk to your teenager about who they are following, and how these accounts make them feel.\nDr Heitner warned that teenagers should be especially cautious of any dieting or exercise sites because they could “clog up your feed” and potentially encourage unhealthy thoughts or behaviour. Algorithms will serve content related to who your kids follow, what they search for and how they browse online.\nLaura Tierney, the founder and chief executive of The Social Institute, an organisation that teaches students across the country how to navigate social media in positive ways, advises teenagers to dig into their social media settings to find out why certain ads pop up in their feeds.\nStart by visiting the Instagram app’s settings, then choose “security,” and then “access data.” Under “ads interests” you can view the specific things that Instagram thinks you like, based on your personal data. In Ms Tierney’s experience, “most students have no idea this even exists.”\nShe also suggested helping your child find true role models. “This is about surrounding yourself with positive influences,” she said. They could be peers, or celebrities like gymnast Simone Biles. If your child’s feed has accounts that are chipping away at their self esteem, those are the ones that your child needs to quickly unfollow, Ms Tierney said.\n“As a parent, your job is to listen and ask open-ended questions,” she added. To start, you can ask what your child’s top five accounts are versus their bottom five accounts\xa0– and share your own as well\xa0– and talk about why you ranked them this way.\n“You want to be around accounts that help you become the best version of yourself,” she said.\nBy Christina Caron © 2021 The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Lithuania says to throw away Chinese phones due to censorship concerns
  </h1>, 'text': 'VILNIUS: Lithuania\'s Defence Ministry recommended that consumers avoid buying Chinese mobile phones and advised people to throw away the ones they have now after a government report found the devices had built-in censorship capabilities.\nFlagship phones sold in Europe by China\'s smartphone giant Xiaomi have a built-in ability to detect and censor terms such as ""Free Tibet"", ""Long live Taiwan independence"" or ""democracy movement"", Lithuania\'s state-run cybersecurity body said on Tuesday (Sep 21).\nThe capability in Xiaomi\'s Mi 10T 5G phone software had been turned off for the ""European Union region"", but can be turned on remotely at any time, the Defence Ministry\'s National Cyber Security Centre said in the report.\n""Our recommendation is to not buy new Chinese phones, and to get rid of those already purchased as fast as reasonably possible,"" Defence Deputy Minister Margiris Abukevicius told reporters in introducing the report.\nXiaomi did not respond to a Reuters query for comment.\nRelations between Lithuania and China have soured recently.

      Commentary: Smartphones last longer so why do some people still upgrade theirs each year? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Each year, a familiar pattern occurs. Apple launches its new iPhone. Shortly after it’s available in stores worldwide, snaking physical and online queues of people wanting to get their hands on this glitzy new product will form.\nThis year’s cycle has just started, with the iPhone 13 launched on Tuesday (Sep 14) and the phone available in Singapore starting Friday (Sep 24).\nWhile framed by Apple as innovative, tech reviews say those small improvements in the iPhone 13 - a slightly better camera, faster processors, and more new colours – do not seem all that ground-breaking compared to its immediate predecessor, the already impressive 5G-capable iPhone 12. \nThat longer battery life of a few more hours might be warmly welcomed but that’s about it. \nIndeed, with each generation of iPhone adding modest advances and more people already having a decent smartphone, we should expect fewer iPhones to be bought each year. And yet last year saw Apple sell over 194 million iPhones, an increase from 2019. \nWhy are some people still upgrading their phones frequently? \nThere’s little doubt the iPhone has evolved from a niche product for fanboys and early adopters to become a modern-day miracle and the best-selling tech product over the past decade. \nIt was a potent economic force propelling Apple forward. In those early years when each iPhone introduction brought new functionalities and significant enhancements, novelty drove sales. \nEnthusiasts of iPhones typically couldn’t wait to place pre-orders\xa0when an Apple led by Steve Jobs wowed the world with striking new innovations like the touchscreen phone, the front-facing camera (iPhone 4) and a Siri personal assistant (iPhone 4S). \nAnd so the number of iPhone users surged by about 50 per cent from 2008, only slowing down after 2012. \nThese days, the changes in each model seem less head-turning. Better cameras may have helped the iPhone catch up with slick Android phones in the late noughties, but nicer colours and new screen notches seem unremarkable to an average user. \nUntil the 5G capability was added to iPhone 12 last year, the name of the game seemed like continuous improvements, with higher processing speeds and a more powerful camera. Apple makers hoped these slight improvements would prod people, particularly its loyal base, to continue buying their phones.\nIndeed, the urge to upgrade may be stronger for people who use their iPhone for creative work in entertainment and professional photography. \nBut even then, such users have been deferring upgrades until one or two more new models are available for a perceptible change in appearance, style, functions and performance. \nPerhaps Apple’s biggest strength in making durable, lasting phones might be its Achilles’ heel. Almost one in four of Apple’s 1 billion iPhone users have not upgraded their phones for over three years, according to wealth management firm Wedbush. \nThat could open up a brand-new business opportunity since iPhone users will require some form of repair and maintenance services. \nBut the kicker is that such services might remain unattractive to run. Repairs at Apple shops are expensive. And device repairs themselves have been a loss-making business for Apple since 2009. The control-freak firm has also been loath to allow independent repair stores to meddle with their products. \nA new Independent Service Provider Programme launched this year that appoints certified Apple technicians across 200 countries may be a shot in the arm for Apple’s repair business arm. But the terms and conditions, like those giving Apple the right to inspections for up to five years after partners leave the scheme, seem onerous and might discourage shops from signing up.\nStill, Apple is pressing forth. The introduction of an AppleCare+ warranty programme that also provides battery replacement can remedy common pain points when phones age. \nApple is even making use of robots like Daisy to disassemble millions of iPhones each year so parts can be extracted and recycled.\xa0 \nSuch trends tie in well with growing eco-consciousness and the need to reduce discarded smartphone e-waste among consumers, in a world where lightning-fast technological advances are creating mountains of obsolete gadgets made from hazardous materials like rare earth minerals.\nMaking up 50 million tonnes in waste, smartphones contributed to 10 per cent of global e-waste in 2019. Meanwhile shortages in those same metals have created a global microchip shortage.\nThat being said, Apple is unlikely to shy away from annual launches. The smartphone has\xa0morphed from a phone to become an all-encompassing tool that allows us to do pretty much everything, and is\xa0the one device people will shell out good money for.\nAt the heart of the dilemma is a good old-fashioned arms race: The frequent release of new models with limited new features may be a competitive necessity to tech giants like Apple. Without doing so, the processing speeds of iPhones in the hands of consumers can easily be outperformed by the stuff competitors offer. \nThis annual launch cycle also plays into Apple’s new subscription-based strategy that entrenches its position in the electronics market. With the excitement of obtaining a new iPhone each year at a perceived lower cost, iPhone users are locked into an eco-system generating even more revenue for the tech behemoth. \nApple will likely aim to serve up even more bundled services to this segment - including Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and iCloud storage - in an ambitious end-game to retain its pole position in the consumer tech space. \nThis is the sharp edge of Apple’s new pivot. Revenue from such services has increased year-on-year and is estimated to reach US$50 billion in profit by 2025.\nStill, mobile phone makers like Apple should be careful that annual smartphone launches don’t raise unrealistic expectations for loyal customers more willing to wait for substantive leaps in tech instead of throwing cash at incremental upgrades whenever new models are available – and disappoint them. \nThere’s only so many less tech savvy family members who can\xa0benefit from our older, used iPhones.\nMuch of Apple’s big sell is its image – one that is visionary and savvy about the future. As younger consumers become more climate-change conscious and demand corporates walk the talk on environment, social and governance (ESG) goals, Apple would do well to show how its iPhone – the iconic centrepiece of its business – embodies that.\nDr Lau Kong Cheen and Dr Vanessa Liu are senior lecturers at the Singapore University of Social Sciences School of Business’ marketing programme.\n', 'related_topics': ['     iPhone ', '     Apple ', '     Big Tech ', '     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      Cambodian students build manned drone to aid community

      Meet the British MD of Jaguar Land Rover, who speaks Korean
  </h1>, 'text': 'In life, you just have to take a leap of faith sometimes. That’s how Alistair Scott’s journey to Asia first began some 30 years ago.\nThe year was 1992 and Scott was at university in Newcastle, the United Kingdom, when a prompt from one of his professors inspired him to switch degrees from a politics major to East Asian studies where he would then learn the Korean language and embark on an exchange programme to South Korea.\n“I said ‘yes’ without even thinking about it and it was probably the best career move I ever made without realising it at the time, because I never would have travelled and studied or worked overseas otherwise,” he said, recollecting one of the most pivotal moments of his life.\nAnd travel extensively he has.\nIntriguingly, Scott spent part of his childhood growing up in Nigeria as his father worked in the African country in the late 1970s to early 1980s. \xa0\n“That was an interesting time to be living out there as a young boy. To be at that age, around 10 or 11, in that part of the world, was quite an unusual upbringing,” he recalled.\nDuring university, Scott would fly back and forth between Newcastle and Hong Kong where his father was based for a good decade in the 1990s.\nUpon graduating, he moved to Vietnam, trailing his Dad in his relocation and armed with a plan to use the former French colony as a base from which to explore the region.\n“But I soon ran out of money so I had to start working in Vietnam, for leasing agency Chesterton Petty, letting apartments out to diplomats and foreign nationals,” shared Scott.\nMeanwhile, his former professor, who still kept strong government ties back home, ended up being invited back to South Korea to take on the role of press secretary to former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.\nEventually, the Brit did put his Korean studies to good use during his four-year stint working in South Korea, which served to deepen his love for the Asia-Pacific.\nAnd he still hopes to one day visit North Korea.\n“Two of my friends have been there through a charity organisation in Beijing but I never made it when I had the chance. Because my degree was on Korea and I studied international relations – specifically North Korean and South Korean politics – and what happened in the war and post-war, I’m very intrigued with North Korea as a nation and I’d like to go visit. It’s a shame that a wonderful country such as Korea just split and there’s no sign of it ever being reunified,” he shared.\nOf all his travels in the world, Scott’s most memorable experience was his trip through the Gobi desert as part of an ambitious months-long overland journey from Hanoi to Helsinki in an old UAZ Russian van almost two decades ago.\n“Those six weeks were really wonderful and exciting taking in the beautiful landscape and terrain. I got lost in the Gobi. And I had a driver, a Mongolian gentleman called Goonga, who turned up with his wife and son without telling us and we ended up travelling together as sort of a family,” he reminisced. \xa0\nScott was 31 at the time and now in his 50s looking back on the biggest life lesson travelling has taught him that parlays well into business and leadership, it’s “patience, patience, patience,” he said.\n“Because you get put in circumstances that can be very difficult and challenging, and regardless of your emotions or how you feel at the time, you just have to suck it up, bear with it and take it onboard,” he added.\nHis advice for other travellers – when we can globetrot again freely – is to have an appreciation for others’ surroundings.\n“What might be the norm in your home country is not necessarily the norm when you’re travelling, and that teaches you to be more tolerant,” he offered.\nA post shared by Jaguar (@jaguar)\nTHE FUTURE OF ELECTRIFICATION: WIRELESS CAR CHARGING\nA true global citizen will, invariably, end up in Singapore at some point in their career or lifetime and Scott arrived four years ago with his wife and two teenaged daughters.\nHe had joined Jaguar Land Rover in 2013 as a regional business manager in the UK responsible for the Brazil, Latin America & Caribbean, Australia and Asian markets then moved up to sales director for the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.\nIn 2020, he assumed the role of acting managing director for APAC and was formally appointed in May this year.\n\xa0\nWhile it’s been a whirlwind 12 months steering the company through these transformative headwinds, it’s also been very exciting for the business leader.\n“The industry is going through many changes right now but having the next level of management control and the ability to determine the long-term path of the business and where we want to lead the region is very exciting for me,” he said.\nTo be sure, the automotive industry is at an inflection point in history, and Scott has witnessed the industry transform tremendously in his 25 years working in the auto world; eight of which with Jaguar Land Rover.\nThe greatest challenge for most carmakers right now is the inescapable push towards electrification, with Jaguar Land Rover leading the charge.\nThe Indian-owned, UK-headquartered British brand was one of the first in the automotive industry to make such a bold declaration of producing purely electrified vehicles under the Jaguar brand by 2025, as part of its “Reimagine” global strategy.\nA post shared by Land Rover (@landrover)\nLand Rover, meanwhile, will drive along the same track, but with a slightly longer timeline, with its first all-electric model to arrive in 2024 and all new models produced offering MHEV and PHEV hybrid variants by 2030.\n“There’s an expectation that by around 2030, 60 per cent of all sales will be pure electric and won’t be running on the internal combustion engines as we know it today,” said Scott.\nThe automaker also aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039.\nThat said, these strategies will need to be carefully calibrated against market readiness across the different countries to ensure the necessary infrastructure and policies are in place to support the shift.\n“Many markets have shifting policies in emissions and support, and different incentives. So long as that exists, there will be a need for different forms of electrified vehicles including standard hybrids,” Scott reasoned.\nManufacturing of vehicles with diesel engines will also be phased out by 2026.\n“The industry is rapidly changing and we know that diesel is no longer popular here in Singapore as a consequence of the Vehicles Emissions Scheme,” he observed.\nSingapore, Scott believes, is the market in which the electric conversion ought to meet with success.\n“If any country can influence change in any industry, Singapore is probably in the strongest position to do so because of the very nature of the government. They have very strong infrastructure within the country, they’re nimble, they’re able to make quick decisions and it’s a nation-state where economies of scale are easy to manage,” he noted.\n“Unquestionably, there will be challenges but if any country plans ahead, there is no country – as far as I can see – in this part of the world that can plan ahead as quickly and with such ability to deliver on their commitments [as Singapore],” he added. \xa0\nTo this end, Jaguar Land Rover is in talks with the Land Transport Authority to explore a wireless charging programme in Singapore similar to its initiative with the city of Oslo in Norway.\nThrough this pilot programme, Oslo became the first city in the world to install wireless, induction-based high-powered charging bays for electric taxis.\nThe system uses no cables and works via resonant magnetic induction between a transmitter pad embedded under the road surface and a receiver pad attached to the base of the vehicle. It therefore requires no physical connection between charger and vehicle, unlike current charging stations available today.\n“So as soon as the vehicle drives over it, within a split second, it automatically starts charging and you don’t even need to get out of the car,” Scott explained.\n“It’s really exciting because many people complain that they don’t have a charging station in their house and it’s of course easier to install one in landed properties than in HDB areas,” he elaborated.\nThe company is also working with the government of New Zealand to implement such a programme in the city of Wellington, and Scott hopes to bring that technology to Singapore to help facilitate more widespread adoption of electric vehicles here.\nA CARPE DIEM KINDA GUY\nEclectic background aside, Scott strikes you as a carpe diem kind of guy with a penchant for extreme travel and sports.\nHe’s into biking and cycles a lot – two to three times a week, covering about 200km in total each week – and also enjoys cooking: Italian, mostly, but Latin cuisine on weekends.\n“It’s a really good way to wind down and de-stress,” he shared.\nStaying stuck in one country this long has been tough for the adventurous spirit but reflecting back on his university days and the Korean connection that led him to Asia, Scott mused: “Sometimes it’s instinct; sometimes you see an opportunity, you just take it. I’m fortunate enough to have done that and here I am today. And I did a politics degree; there’s no reason why I should end up in the automotive industry.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     cars ', '     technology ']}"

If the software, which also collects location data, does not verify the image against a ""facial signature"", police may follow up with a visit to the location to confirm the person\'s whereabouts.\nThough the technology has been used in Western Australia since last November, it has more recently been pitched as a tool to enable the country to reopen its borders, ending a system in place since the start of the pandemic that requires international arrivals to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine under police guard.\nAside from the pandemic, police forces have expressed interest in using facial recognition software, prompting a backlash from rights groups about the potential to target minority groups.\nWhile the recognition technology has been used in countries like China, no other democracy has been reported as considering its use in connection with coronavirus containment procedures.\nGenvis Chief Executive Kirstin Butcher declined to comment on the trials, beyond the disclosures on the product website.\n""You can\'t have home quarantine without compliance checks, if you\'re looking to keep communities safe,"" she said in a phone interview.\n""You can\'t perform physical\xa0compliance checks at the scale\xa0needed to support (social and economic) re-opening plans so technology has to be used.""\nBut rights advocates warned the technology may be inaccurate, and may open the window for law enforcement agencies to use people\'s data for other purposes without specific laws stopping them.\n""I\'m troubled not just by the use here but by the fact this is an example of the creeping use of this sort of technology in our lives,"" said Toby Walsh, a professor of Artificial Intelligence at University of New South Wales.\nWalsh questioned the reliability of facial recognition technology in general, which he said could be hacked to give false location reports.\n""Even if it works here ... then it validates the idea that facial recognition is a good thing,"" he said. ""Where does it end?""\nThe government of Western Australia has said it banned police from using data collected by COVID-related software for non-COVID matters. The Western Australia\xa0police say they have put 97,000 people through home quarantine, using facial recognition, without incident.\n""The law should prevent a system for monitoring quarantine being used for other purposes,"" said Edward Santow, a former Australian Human Rights Commissioner who now leads an artificial intelligence ethics project at University of Technology, Sydney.\n""Facial recognition technology might seem like a convenient way to monitor people in quarantine but ... if something goes wrong with this technology, the risk of harm is high.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Australia ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Why does Singapore need robots to remind us to be civic-minded?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Last year, Singapore made international headlines unveiling Spot the robotic dog, who patrolled Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park, reminding park-goers to practise safe distancing.\nFast forward a year, and we now have Xavier, a four-wheeled robot designed to detect “undesirable social behaviours” -\xa0a category that includes smoking in prohibited areas, illegal hawking, improperly parked bicycles, personal mobility devices (PMDs) and motorcycles on footpaths and people gathering in groups of more than five.\nUnlike Spot, Xavier is somewhat more imposing, lumbering around at 5kmh with its cameras capturing 360-degree images. \nWhen such behaviours are displayed, Xavier displays the appropriate warnings to the offender and sends real-time alerts to a human controller, who can activate any necessary additional resources.\nSome joke that these robots in our urban environment are simply the first step towards a dystopian Terminator-esque future, where drones threatening penalties replace gentle reminders driven by moral suasion to be considerate.\nThe actual experience with Xavier is probably far more mundane. \nYet this reality raises two questions: Why do we need to be “policed” to behave in a socially responsible manner, and do we really need robots to do that?\nIt is discouraging if such moves suggest Singaporeans are now less civic-minded, even after years of campaigns to be courteous, save water, refrain from littering and more.\nJust think about it: Are there jobs like Tray Return Ambassadors anywhere else in the world?\nIt has been more than a year and a half after safe distancing was introduced to fight COVID-19. Yet we still need constant reminding to stand 1m apart.\nAre Singaporeans just getting more apathetic, so used to being told what to do that they tune out until alerted in person? And to the point that we’ve outsourced our nagging to robots for greater efficiency?\nRobots have been replacing humans for years and this is little different in a way.\nFrom the assembly line to automated phone services and robo-investors, the employment of technology to enhance and replace certain jobs, including repetitive, energy sapping, menial functions, frees up human operators for higher value work and is to be welcomed.\nBut even the most advanced technology has limitations. Xavier can take your picture and flash messages at you, but it is your reaction that determines how effective the robot is.\nSimilarly, it is the human operator who makes sense of the data it gathers\xa0to decide, in this case, if physical enforcement efforts must be stepped up.\nIn fact, these robots are probably more akin to a new generation of mobile CCTV cameras with better video surveillance capabilities. \nStill, the appearance of robots to carry out public education campaigns suggests we have become more comfortable in using technology to shape society, which is not bad news.\nXavier and Spot are not likely to become robotic overlords but there’s little doubt our society has been transformed by fundamental shifts in how digital data is gathered, analysed, shared and stored.\xa0\nSecurity cameras are already playing a key role in the drive towards smarter cities and the burgeoning industrial Internet of Things in Singapore. \nDeep learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are becoming more prevalent, and data gathered can allow us to make predictions based on integrated analytical software.\xa0\nMany families also have smart homes, powered by wireless devices and doorbell cameras.\nOur focus on deploying technology for the greater good is clear. When the National University of Singapore launched the Centre for Technology, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and the Law in 2019. Edwin Tong, then Senior Minister of State for Law and Health, urged its researchers to engage the Government and the public to improve lives and benefit society.\nIndeed, the larger question is how authorities will review whether the use of Xavier and Spot have tackled inconsiderate behaviours for the better and pushed Singapore to become a more gracious society.\nUltimately, these robots are reminders for us to be\xa0dutiful and obey the law. We should aim for civic virtue\xa0- to do the right thing without being compelled simply because it is the right thing to do.\xa0\nBut having robots to nag at us should not be an indictment of Singapore’s social graces. We have shown that we are capable of doing the right thing, with or without the law. \nToday, we tend to wait at the side of the MRT platform doors for other commuters to alight first, with the queue markings as a prompt. There was a time when it was almost impossible to exit quickly because passengers would try boarding the moment the doors opened. \nIf we need a gentle reminder (robotic or otherwise) to do the right thing, that’s probably more a reflection of the rules and norms in Singapore that encourage responsible behaviours.\nGrowing up, the smartly uniformed traffic police officer in white astride his powerful motorbike never failed to capture my attention.\xa0\nHe was the iconic law enforcer on the road. His ubiquitous presence was a deterrent. And we trusted him to do his job to protect us from reckless driving and other malfeasances.\xa0 \nToday, as drivers, we automatically check our speed whenever we see a Traffic Police patrol vehicle near us. As shoppers, we naturally space out from other groups of people when we see a Safe Distancing Ambassador looming.\nTimes have changed, tools have changed, but our duties to society (and our personal civic virtues) should remain the same.\nThat said, some interactions may do better with a human touch. A friendly gesture from a passer-by to put on a mask might be more effective than an automated message on loop.\nDr William Wan is General Secretary of the Singapore Kindness Movement.\n', 'related_topics': ['     safe distancing ', '     technology ', '     society ']}"

      China tells Internet companies to stop blocking each others' links
  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING: China\'s industry ministry said on Monday (Sep 13) it has told the country\'s Internet companies to end their long-standing practice of blocking each other\'s links on their sites, vowing to take measures against those firms that fail to fall in line.\nThe move, which would put an end to what analysts have called the ""walled gardens"" of China\'s giant online firms, is just the latest step in a broad regulatory crackdown by Beijing that has ensnared sectors from technology to education and property.\nThe government\'s campaign has wiped billions of dollars off the market value of some of the country\'s largest companies, and left investors on edge over which sector may be next to be targeted.\nAnnouncing the measure in the capital, Zhao Zhiguo, spokesperson of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that restricting normal access to Internet links without proper reason ""affects the user experience, damages the rights of users and disrupts market order"".\nThe new Beijing instruction came after the 21st Century Business Herald newspaper reported on Saturday that China\'s industry ministry told tech giants including Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings to stop blocking each other\'s website links from their platforms.\nChina\'s Internet is dominated by a handful of technology giants which have historically blocked links and services by rivals on their platforms.\nTencent, for example, restricts users from sharing content from ByteDance-owned short video app Douyin on Tencent\'s instant messaging apps WeChat and QQ. In February, Douyin filed a complaint with a Beijing court saying that it constituted as monopolistic behaviour.\nIn other cases, Alibaba\'s Taobao and Tmall e-commerce marketplaces do not allow Tencent\'s payment service WeChat Pay to be used as a payment option.\nTencent told the state-backed Securities Times newspaper that it firmly supported the ministry\'s decision and would implement it in phases. Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIndustry ministry official Zhao did not mention any specific firms in comments on the new instruction to companies, but said that there was still a gap between the understanding of some internet companies on the issue of blocking links and the actions required of them.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     Internet ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Thoughtful tech applications can help charities reach those in need even with COVID-19 restrictions
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: COVID-19 forced many of us to stop being creatures of habit.\nLike most educators, we enjoyed in-person face-time with our students but had to jettison our resistance to moving courses online with the pandemic. \nWe simply had to become masters of our trade behind the camera, as much as we were in front of the classroom.\nToday, we are the better for it in many ways but it doesn’t negate how challenging this journey can be. \nCharity organisations usually come to mind in thinking about organisations facing big challenges in embracing technology that might need extra help. \nMany rely greatly on face-to-face interactions to achieve impact. The use of digital technology is not only expensive but impractical for them. \nThey support the aged, isolated and marginalised who lack the connectivity and digital literacy we tend to take for granted – people who usually do not own a smartphone or know how to use one. \nAnd yet because of COVID-19, charities are forced to turn towards technology to continue delivering services in ways that comply with safe management measures. \nBut what if we told you that for some forward-looking charities, change preceded COVID-19?\nSeeing the need to go digital, Food from the Heart (FFTH) - a charity distributing food packs to the disadvantaged - issued each beneficiary a physical card bearing the beneficiary’s unique QR code in 2019. \nTheir QR code is scanned each time they collect food rations from the community shop or when they receive food packs. \nThe introduction of a QR code has helped the charity better plan their inventory and develop insights into collection patterns and consumption rates, ensuring relevant food items are available for their beneficiaries at the right time. The fact that they only need a card and do not have to carry a phone is a huge boon to many elderly folks. \nBefore this, FFTH relied entirely on its volunteers for information about their beneficiaries’ needs. \nAnother charity that operates a 24-hour crisis intervention hotline uses artificial intelligence to “triage” their text messaging service. \nThrough a series of critical questions, a chatbot prioritises and guides callers through\xa0the service. \nFrom the words and emojis callers use, the technology algorithmically directs certain callers to skilled volunteers. Those who express an intention to harm themselves in a text message are promptly directed to the volunteer who can assist them. \nEvery call is important but the chatbot function separates non-crisis situations from those warranting immediate attention. The text service aims to reduce time to escalate calls – a precious resource for persons in distress. \nYet another example is Touch Senior Activity Centre which partnered with Artify Studio in 2020 during the pandemic to teach seniors how to paint through WhatsApp video-conferencing. \nEmployees at the senior activity centre instructed seniors to\xa0turn\xa0on the camera in their smartphones and connect to virtual art sessions conducted by volunteer artists from Artify Studio using WhatsApp. \nTechnology satisfied both the innate desire for interaction while the programme incentivised seniors to become more digitally savvy.\nOne myth is that digitalisation is expensive and will add unnecessary costs. The annual operating budget of FFTH is about S$2.5 million. As a charity, FFTH operates with 22 employees and does not have a chief technology officer on their payroll. \nDigitalisation for FFTH began with determining the pain points and differentiating between needs and wants. \nFFTH maintains an inventory of food items in their warehouse. Volunteers pack these into individual parcels before distributing them to almost 9,500 disadvantaged families islandwide. \nMaintaining sufficient inventory for food packing can be a challenge when data for the supply and stock of each item are held in separate, unintegrated systems not updated in real-time. \nFFTH could have adopted an enterprise resource-planning system to integrate and automate end-to-end processes from warehouse inventory, logistics distribution to fulfilment. But this would have required heavy capital investment in technology. \nInstead, FFTH prioritised a simpler approach that focused on their beneficiaries and ensured change was\xa0hassle-free for staff. \nWhen volunteers scan a beneficiary’s QR code each time someone collects food, the data is fed into the same backend system for warehouse and inventory management. \nThis way, FFTH maintains updated information about the supply and demand of each food item and has insights into dietary habits to inform food distribution planning. \nHowever, for this solution to work, employees had to convince volunteers and partners to use and scan the card. Employees did that by showing volunteers and partners how the data captured will be used to allocate food packs. \nVolunteers soon learnt the quantity of food packs that can be collected from FFTH may be impacted when they failed to capture this data. They got into action and deployed interns to visit partners to demonstrate how to use a mobile phone for QR-code scanning.\xa0\xa0 \nBut then again did FFTH thrive because their employees were young and tech savvy? Not really. The staff at FFTH are anywhere in their 20s up to 68 years-old. \nBut they did deploy younger workers in front-facing partnership engagement functions, while senior staff worked in warehouse and related functions. \nStill, training staff working in the warehouse to monitor stock required them to learn how scanning works. In retail operations, this is common but FTTH is not a retailer but a food charity.\nPerhaps mindsets are at the core of this. Ms Sim ensured she picked the right staff with the can-do attitude for this project and empowered the staff to own it.\n“The leaders who are championing the journey must be patient to explain and ‘sayang’ people along the way and ease any anxiety,” Ms Sim told us. \nVolunteers used to account for food inventory at FFTH’s warehouse with pen and paper. Today, all they need is the barcode scanner app on their mobile phones, just like a supermarket check-out counter. \nCOVID-19 has forced technology upon us. But the thoughtful application of technology even in high-touch sectors can enable equal access to those in need. \nDr Caroline Lim is the Head of Organisation and\xa0Leadership for Non-Profit Programme at the SR Nathan School of Human Development, Singapore University of Social Sciences.

      From phones to face masks: Why some everyday products aren’t designed for women
  </h1>, 'text': 'Soul legend James Brown sure wasn’t kidding when he crooned that this is a man’s world.\nDespite companies pouring more money into product research and development than advertising these days – a Harvard Business Review report puts the ratio at 10 to one – it still feels as though many goods and inventions are simply not made with women in mind. \nTake smartphones for instance. Because women’s hands are typically smaller than men’s by about 2.5cm or so, phones over 12.5cm are difficult, if not impossible, to use with one hand without fumbling or dropping. Yet phones are getting ever bigger, with the largest current models nearly 17.5cm in size.\nThis male-leaning tendency was noted in a 2010 expert paper on the gender dimensions of product design, prepared by a group of Danish researchers for the United Nations. \nThe paper concluded that there is a male gender bias in many tech products, and that differences in male and female preferences need to be considered in order to create products that cater for women, too. \nMany of the most popular health trackers, like Fitbit and Nike, did not have a period tracking function in their initial models. Neither did Apple’s in-phone Health app when it was first released in 2014, although it covered everything else from calorie count and respiratory rate to sodium intake. \nIn her 2016 study, data scientist and sociolinguist Dr Rachael Tatman found there was a 70 per cent chance that Google’s speech recognition software would register male speech more accurately than female. \nNot that such disparity is limited to the field of technology. \nThink about power tools which are unwieldy and heavy for women to use, work chairs that are not ergonomic, food jars and can or bottle openers that aren’t friendly to female hand sizes and strength, and face masks that don’t fit well on women’s faces. \nMore alarming still are the health and safety consequences. \nSince the 1970s, car safety tests have been using crash dummies based on the 50th percentile male body, which is considerably taller and heavier than the average woman. But despite various research showing that this puts women at far higher risk of injury than men, the first female crash dummy wasn’t developed until 2012 and is still not mandatory in tests now. \nIt’s a similar story in medicine. In Singapore, CPR dummies with a female physique only officially came into use this year. \nHeart attack symptoms are based on male experiences, resulting in doctors possibly missing the condition in women because they display “atypical” signs. \nAnd historically, medical research and drug trials have either excluded women because their shifting hormones complicate results, or don’t separate the findings by gender. Instead, it is simply assumed that what works for men works for women, too. \nMINDING THE GENDER GAP\nIt’s been said that women are the most powerful consumers in the world today and the stats more than back this up.\nIn the United States, women influence 85 per cent of buying decisions and drive 70 to 80 per cent of consumer spending. A Global Times report puts the female consumer market in China in excess of 10 trillion yuan (S$2.08 trillion) in 2020, with women contributing 75 per cent of total household consumption and buying half of male-targeted products. \nAnd on a global level, market research firm Frost & Sullivan found that the female economy is set to outpace some of the biggest nations’ economies in the next five years. \nSo then, why is the male gender still the default standard for product design while women’s needs are not captured? \nFor an explanation to that, we probably have to look at where the gender imbalance starts – the universities, design companies and engineering firms. \nAccording to statistics from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), fewer than 20 per cent of students enrolled in engineering and architecture in Singapore are females.\nThe picture looks better when you zoom out, with the Ministry of Education reporting that women accounted for 41 per cent of university students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in 2019. Even so, only 30 per cent of local researchers and engineers are women. \nOver in the UK, a 2018 study by the Design Council found that 78 per cent of its design workforce is male; this rises to a whopping 95 per cent in the sub-sector of product and industrial design. \xa0\xa0\nTrechelle Lyn Ras, a learning designer at digital creative business school Hyper Island, who also teaches design and innovation modules, called this lopsidedness “the design debt that’s been generated by years of male-dominated industries”. \nShe added that achieving equal representation and inclusive design would require many things to fall into place. “Education, the availability of talent, the design principles of companies, business opportunities, the technology that makes production possible, to name just a few. It’s a whole system at play,” she said.\nFor now, many companies simply fall back on the “pink it and shrink it” game plan, where products are made smaller, cuter and in a range of pretty hues without understanding what women actually want them to do. What good is a toy-sized drill or hairdryer or laptop with swirly floral patterns if it’s underpowered and can’t get the job done? \nIt goes to the heart of the problem: A\xa0failure to grasp that gender – both the designer’s and the user’s – affects design. \n“Often, designers forget they are designing for others and that they carry biases and views which can colour the products they create. This takes a lot of awareness and courage to admit and many designers are just not yet equipped with this level of introspection. \n“They don’t realise the responsibility they have to the creations they put out and the potential impact on users,” said Ras. \nLEVELLING THE DESIGN FIELD\nWhile all this may seem rather depressing, there are promising signs that things are, slowly but surely, looking up. \nAssociate Professor Yang Hui Ying, who specialises in engineering product development at SUTD, said that although there are certain gaps between males and females in terms of income, education, and employment, the situation on the whole has been improving for women over the past decades, especially in developed countries.\n“Women now have the same capabilities and opportunities to perform and excel in jobs and activities that used to be done by men. Therefore, to rethink many of the ordinary items that we use in our daily life and design products with less gender bias is a very important task with huge potential market,” she said. \nShe cited gender-neutral bicycles, which come in a wider fit range, with smaller incremental changes between sizes, enabling them to suit all riders. Household products like vacuum cleaners that used to be considered housewife items have also evolved, taking a more genderless form, such as cleaning robots.\nRas attributes the recognition of design’s gender bias to the rise of feminist movements. “In the last few years, movements like Me Too, Women’s March and manels (all-male panels) have been pivotal in renewing interest in women’s rights and shedding light on the plight of women living in a world dominated by men,” she said. \nWith this growing awareness also comes an understanding that the problem goes back to the beginning of the design process, where there is a lack of female representation in both the classroom and boardroom. \n“I think it would be better if more female designers can join the engineering and technological industries so the opinions of female designers can be heard, as there are still some disconnects between female consumer demands and the number of female designers at the table,” said\xa0Associate Professor Yang. \nEchoing this view, Ras sees education as a powerful tool for bringing about change, not only by increasing sensitivity towards the issue but also by shaping the lenses that people take with them into the roles they play.\n“Inclusive design starts with inclusive teams. That is why at Hyper Island, we instil the importance of human-centred, collaborative teams. Sharing a wide range of disparate views is critical to creating a complete picture of a problem or need, and developing solutions that meet the needs of the many versus the few,” she said. \xa0\nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

For example, accounts on social networking sites vKontakte, LiveJournal and elsewhere in Russian, German, Spanish and other languages have asserted that the novel coronavirus emerged in the United States before China and that it was developed by the US\xa0military.\nMultiple Russian-language LiveJournal accounts used identical wording: ""US\xa0Ft\xa0Detrick was the source of COVID-19"", referring to the US\xa0Army\'s Fort Detrick installation in Maryland.\nIn addition to promoting false information on the virus, researchers said priorities for the group include criticizing fugitive Chinese propagandist Guo Wengui and his ally, former Donald Trump strategist Steve Bannon, and exploiting concerns about anti-Asian racism.\n“We have observed extensive promotion of Russian, German, Spanish, Korean, and Japanese-language content on US and non-US-based platforms, in addition to the typical English and Chinese-language activity that has been widely reported on,” FireEye said in a report published Wednesday.\nMany of the accounts link to each other or use the same photos, helping the researchers see connections among them.\nMany of the posts echo claims in state-controlled Chinese media, and they are consistent with other government propaganda efforts.\nThe researchers do not have proof of involvement by a specific arm or ally of Beijing.\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.\nSo far, the accounts on the main US platforms and major networks elsewhere such as Russia-based vKontakte have gained little interaction with authentic users, the researchers said.\n""A lot of it is tweeting into the void,"" said John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at FireEye.\nSome of the posts urged protesters to demonstrate against racism in the United States.\nIn addition, they called on protesters to rally in April outside what the accounts said was the New York home of wealthy expatriate Guo, but there was little evidence that people showed up.\nThe coordinated fake accounts took that in stride, instead distributing doctored photos of a different protest in a different place.\n""It\'s almost like they are being paid by volume,"" instead of engagement, said Shane Huntley, director of the threat analysis group at Google.\nAlphabet\'s YouTube has been removing about a thousand channels a month tied to the campaign, though most promote Chinese entertainment more than political views or misinformation.\nThe production quality is improving, with higher-resolution video and better subtitles, suggesting an investment for the long haul.\nThough the accounts have not been successful at blending in and attracting native followers, Hultquist said he was concerned that the dedication of resources would lead to improved technique and more convincing misinformation spreading.\n“They\'ve clearly got a wide mandate that\'s global. Someone is giving them pretty broad orders,” Hultquist said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     China ']}"

      Commentary: China’s new data privacy law a blessing in disguise for tech giants
  </h1>, 'text': 'HONG KONG: China has just passed a major data privacy law. Inspired by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) comprises a far-reaching set of rules governing how tech companies handle user data.\nAnd, on the surface, it seems pretty tough: In fact, The Wall Street Journal hailed the PIPL as “one of the world’s strictest data privacy laws”.\nBut it will probably do less to protect Chinese users than many believe, and it might even entrench further the dominance of China’s incumbent tech giants.\nTo be sure, the PIPL represents an important first step toward protecting the privacy of Chinese citizens.\nIt gives regulators a new set of weapons to use in their fight against China’s mighty tech firms; limits companies’ ability to engage in algorithmic price discrimination; tightens rules on cross-border data transfers; and imposes additional compliance burdens for large tech firms deemed “gatekeepers”.\nBut a close look at the PIPL reveals its major weaknesses.\nFor starters, although it requires businesses and government agencies to obtain individual consent before processing personal information, it exempts them from doing so when there is a “statutory basis” – while failing to specify which statutes qualify.\nBecause many Chinese government authorities, including central ministries and local governments, possess some degree of legislative power, a vast array of lower-level rules and regulations could potentially be used to circumvent the PIPL.\nNotably, exemptions could be granted on the basis of statutes that facilitate China’s controversial social credit system. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been drafting credit information guidelines that will bring an abundance of online consumer data – covering, for example, transportation, communication, property, and payments – under the purview of its credit system. \nThis goes far beyond the existing social credit system, which mostly collects negative credit information, such as personal debt defaults and legal violations.\nNot surprisingly, it has fuelled heated debate in China, with many arguing that the new guidelines amount to a serious violation of personal privacy.\nFor the PBOC, however, they are central to an ambitious plan to create a nationwide credit database – a step that will significantly boost the state’s ability to pressure fintech giants such as Ant Group to transfer their vast troves of personal data to state-controlled storage infrastructure.\nSuch companies previously resisted such official pressure on grounds of consumer privacy. But China’s regulatory war on the country’s tech giants – especially its suspension of Ant Group’s initial public offering – has strengthened the PBOC’s hand considerably.\nNow, the central bank is aggressively pushing its credit database plan, purportedly in the name of financial stability.\nThe PIPL also fails on another front: It does not create a new independent data protection agency. The Cyberspace Administration of China will manage coordination, leaving enforcement to a patchwork of national- and local-level regulators, which tend to be thinly staffed. \nThis probably explains why legal sanctions are not the only form of enforcement envisaged by the PIPL. Instead, the law allows for soft legal measures, such as administrative interviews with firms to request that they rectify their behavior.\nWhile these soft measures could offer a flexible and efficient alternative to legal sanctions, they may leave too much to the discretion of bureaucrats and weaken deterrence.\nMoreover, the new law is unlikely to rein in Chinese tech giants’ market power. After all, these companies have deep coffers and strong legal support – resources that put them in a strong position to shoulder PIPL compliance costs. The same cannot be said of their smaller rivals.\nThe law’s data portability requirement – which allows consumers to move their personal data more easily between platforms – is a case in point. \nThe rule is intended to encourage multi-homing (wherein consumers patronise multiple platforms), and to reduce platform-switching costs for consumers.\nBut studies suggest that it could discourage new entrants, as smaller businesses often cannot afford the costs of forced data transfers.\nSimilarly, strict privacy protections may place smaller firms and new entrants at a competitive disadvantage. Consider ByteDance, which owes its exponential growth to its application of algorithms that gauge consumer preferences and recommend relevant content and advertisements. \nStricter privacy protections would have made it impossible for ByteDance to acquire sufficient data to become a true challenger to incumbent firms. If new entrants cannot gather the data they need to compete, it could end up harming users – the very group privacy laws are supposed to protect.\nChina’s new data privacy law will undoubtedly increase the compliance burden for China’s Big Tech firms, which have faced regulatory onslaughts over the past ten months. \nBut, in the end, the PIPL may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for them.\nAngela Huyue Zhang, a law professor, is Director of the Center for Chinese Law at the University of Hong Kong.

      Remote work: Who wins and who loses when companies can hire from anywhere?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Who wins and who loses when companies can hire from anywhere?\nSome employees and freelancers who can work remotely will have vastly expanded opportunities and the possibility of significant increases in pay, but remote workers in general figure to face more competition and have a higher dependence on luck.\nOne thing that seems unavoidable, research suggests, is an intensification of inequality.\nIn his 1981 paper, The Economics of Superstars,\xa0Sherwin Rosen described the impact of recording and broadcasting on the incomes of athletes and entertainers. As technology enabled individuals with specialised skills to reach a giant market — one hour of work in a single location could suddenly reach many people across the country — fewer stars captured more of the rewards.\nRosen expected that over time many other professions would follow a similar pattern. A teacher’s income, for example, was traditionally limited by the number of students who could fit into one classroom. But today on Udemy, an online learning platform, teachers like Chris Haroun have earned millions from courses they created, especially after COVID-19 lockdown pushed enrollments on the platform up by 425 per cent. The vast majority of teachers on Udemy don’t come close to Haroun’s earnings, however, resulting in an extremely unequal distribution of income between superstar teachers and everybody else.\nA meaningful shift in the distribution of income can also be seen in platforms where remote instruction is more similar to traditional teaching. On Outschool, an online marketplace for virtual classes for children, hundreds of teachers earn more than US$100,000 a year, and dozens earn over US$230,000. But most Outschool teachers earn far less, partly because they treat online teaching as a hobby or side hustle, and partly because they haven’t yet figured out how to attract students.\nA post shared by Peloton (@onepeloton)\nThe adoption of remote work is also affecting more traditional institutions. Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told me in April, “Because all my classes are remote now, the school asked me, ‘Can you go from 160 — dictated by the size of Stern’s largest classroom — to 280?’ That’s 120 fewer seats for the other marketing professors to fight over.”\nSimilar dynamics can be seen in professions that were assumed to be inherently “in-person"".\xa0During the lockdowns, most fitness instructors were out of work. But a handful were thriving — especially those who worked for Peloton. By the end of 2020, Peloton had about 4 million members — equal to the number of gym patrons in New York state. Unlike New York’s fitness industry, Peloton did not employ 86,000 people in a single state.\nInstead, the company’s millions of members were served by several dozen instructors who could live anywhere they liked. While most fitness instructors could not work at all, some Peloton instructors earned more than US$500,000 — more than 12 times the median salary of their peers.\nWhen a market expands, the benefits tend not to accrue equally to all participants, a dynamic true in fields beyond teaching and instruction. As early as 1995, economists Robert Frank and Philip Cook observed that payoff structures previously common in entertainment were becoming more prevalent in a variety of other professions. Some lawyers, doctors, consultants, bankers and managers were making more than ever, while fewer of their colleagues occupied middle-income jobs.\nThe two economists attributed these changes to “the revolution in information processing and transmission"",\xa0which provides “increasing leverage for the talents of those who occupy top positions and correspondingly less room for others"".\nThis trend continued into the 21st century. According to a 2020 study by economists David Autor, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, most of the increase in income inequality over the past two decades occurred “within, rather than between, education groups"".\xa0Some college-educated employees — particularly those with advanced degrees — earned more than ever while most of their peers stood in place or retreated. Technology contributed to this increase by enabling companies to produce more and reach more customers while depending on fewer but more specialized employees.\nSignificant as it was, technology’s impact on many professions was constrained by geography. When most companies hired only employees who lived within commuting distance of the office, the size of the labor market was capped. This put a ceiling on the employment options and earning capacity of employees with the most specialized, in-demand skills. It also put a floor beneath other professionals who enjoyed a decent salary and relative job security by virtue of living within commuting distance to a central business district or office park.\nThe constraints of geography are loosened now that Silicon Valley and other industries are embracing remote work — gradually, then suddenly. The Economist recently analyzed job listings on Hacker News, a site popular with programmers. It found the share of jobs mentioning “remote” reached 75 per cent\xa0in 2021, up from 35 per cent\xa0pre-COVID-19 and 13 per cent\xa0a decade earlier.\nHow will this affect the average tech worker?\nThere are some early indications. In June, Google told rank-and-file employees it would reduce the pay of those who choose to work remotely or move farther from the office. Avoiding the office saves employees money — in commuting costs, for example — but as economist Austan Goolsbee recently wrote for The New York Times, companies in the last 40 years have usually found a way to claw back any potential gains for workers.\nFor most tech workers, remote work means competing in a much larger pool of equally qualified candidates, many of whom are based in lower-income cities and countries.\nShould this worry the most in-demand engineers and product management? Probably not. For them, working remotely means competing for the highest-paying jobs from a larger number of companies.\nBut even many highly qualified and specialised employees have something to worry about.\nAs Enrico Moretti pointed out in The New Geography of Jobs,\xa0hiring “is very similar to dating"".\xa0Access to more potential candidates in a bigger pool of people increases the chance of finding an ideal match. Matching specialized talent to specific jobs is a major reason that innovation, productivity and salaries are higher in large cities.\nBut the biggest markets don’t just offer the biggest rewards. They also tend to distribute these rewards unevenly and, often, unpredictably. Income inequality grows with city size.\nAnd while access to more candidates increases the odds of an ideal match, it also introduces more “noise” into the selection process, leaving a bigger role for chance events in determining which candidates end up earning more throughout their career. The same dynamics figure to intensify as employees join a remote labor market that is orders of magnitude larger than any city on Earth.\nDuring the deep and sudden recession last year brought about by lockdowns, those who could work remotely kept their jobs or quickly found new ones. A job that could be done from anywhere was a source of comfort and security.\nBut in the long term, remote work’s promise is more ambivalent. It offers more flexibility, accommodating people who would otherwise give up office work altogether. For many, it offers access to better economic opportunities, regardless of location. But for some it will also introduce more competition. Ultimately, remote work ushers some freelancers and employees into a global arena that seems to promise a higher ceiling, but a lower floor as well.\nBy Dror Poleg\xa0©\xa0The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in\xa0The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     technology ', '     jobs ']}"

      Tech tips: 4 mobile phone camera tricks to help you take photos quicker
  </h1>, 'text': 'Have you ever missed capturing the perfect photo or video opportunity because you got hung up getting to your smartphone’s camera app in time? Your phone likely has a number of shortcuts built into its software and settings, although some may be less obvious than others.\nHere’s a quick guide to getting the speed you need so you don’t miss your moment.\nINSTANT CAMERA\nNeed the camera\xa0now? With most recent iPhones running iOS 14, just swipe left from the lock screen to go directly to the camera app. Pressing the camera icon in the bottom-right corner of the lock screen also opens the app.\nOn many Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones running Android 11, you can open your default camera app by rapidly pressing the phone’s power button or Side key twice. (If not, open the Android system settings and check the Gestures options, or confirm that Samsung’s Side key settings have the Quick Launch feature enabled for the camera.)\nYou can also tell your phone’s assistant to open the camera for you. Android’s Google Assistant will even snap the shutter or start recording on command, as will the Bixby assistant on Samsung Galaxy phones.\nAnd the volume buttons on many phones also double as an additional shutter button.\nGET SET\nSmartphones typically have one front-facing camera for self-portraits and at least one camera on the back. To switch between them, tap the circular-arrows icon in the camera app or tell the voice assistant to “take a selfie.”\nOn recent Google Pixel models, hold the phone and twist your wrist twice to switch between the front and back cameras. On newer Samsung Galaxy phones, swipe up or down in the camera app to switch cameras.\nOn phones with multiple rear cameras (wide-angle, standard and telephoto), tap the screen to choose one. Move the on-screen zoom slider to adjust the angle. Tap the screen to get to the controls for exposure and focus.\nWant to jump right into video recording? With an iPhone XR or later, press and hold the camera’s shutter button to record a QuickTake video, or slide your finger to the right to lock the video recording so you can still snap photos. On a Google Pixel and certain Samsung Galaxy phones, press and hold the shutter button to record without having to swipe to the Video mode.\nIn Samsung’s Single Take mode on newer Galaxy phones, tap the shutter button once and move the camera around. The phone will capture up to 10 seconds of photos and video of the scene from different angles.\nENHANCE YOUR SELFIES\nYour phone may also have settings that let you automatically improve your self-portraits. On the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12, widen the angle of your selfie by tapping the arrows on the screen.\nThe Google Camera app on recent Pixel phones offers a zoom function as well as selfie-specific settings to illuminate your face and smooth out appearances; tap the arrow at the top of the camera screen to open those settings. Many of Samsung’s Galaxy phones also include options in the camera settings for the color tone and angle of self-portraits.\nCAPTURE THE ACTION\nSome subjects are fast-moving, like athletes, animals or toddlers. When you don’t have the inclination to make a video, you can quickly capture a stream of continuous still photos in “burst” mode and then go back and select the perfect shot from the batch.\nOn recent iPhone models, swipe the Camera app’s shutter button to the left to start snapping photos; on the iPhone X and earlier, long-press the shutter button. After you release the button, open the thumbnail image in the camera roll, tap the Select button and swipe through the images in the burst, selecting the ones to keep. Many Samsung Galaxy phones take burst shots in a similar way by swiping the shutter button, but check your manual for specifics.\nGoogle doesn’t have a dedicated burst mode for its Pixel phones running Android 11, but you can pull out favorite frames from a video or motion photo. Open the Google Camera app, tap the arrow at the top of the screen and enable Motion Photos (which, like Apple’s Live Photos or Samsung’s Motion Photo, capture several frames of action when you press the shutter). Then tap the Settings icon, choose Advanced and turn off “Social media depth features"".\nAfter you’ve taken your image or clip, open it and swipe up on the screen. Select “Shots in this photo” or “Shots in this video"".\xa0Swipe through the sequence until you find your favorite, then tap the save option.\nFeatures vary based on your own phone’s hardware and software, but taking a few minutes to explore your camera’s shortcuts can save time later — when you really need it.\nBy J D Biersdorfer\xa0©\xa0The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in\xa0The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     iPhone ']}"

      A guide to phone upgrades: Should you buy a new one or wait?
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s almost phone season again — the time of year when tech companies like Apple, Google and Samsung bombard us with glitzy marketing campaigns to persuade us to upgrade.\nTheir new phones vary somewhat, but the pitch is always roughly the same: The phone you have is no longer good enough because this new one has a fancier camera and brighter screen, plus it’s faster. So give the “old” one to a less tech-inclined member of the family or trade it in for credit toward a shiny new gadget.This hype cycle creates an annual dilemma: Is it time to upgrade? We all know that after a few years, our phones no longer work as well as they used to. It might not be able to run the latest apps. It can feel sluggish. Some components, like touch-screens, may begin to fail.\nAt some point, it does become practical to get a new phone, like when too many negatives add up or the cost of fixing a broken part is too high. But often, upgrades may be unnecessary because the elements that make us unhappy with our phones can be remedied with some care.\nIn any case, let your personal situation — not the allure of phone season — guide you, and take your time to contemplate.\n“In general, we need to get away from tying the upgrade to: ‘Hey, there’s a new iPhone out. Now is the time to think about it,’” said Nick Guy, a senior staff writer at Wirecutter, The New York Times’ sister publication that tests products. “There’s nothing wrong with getting a phone later.”\nHere are some questions to ask yourself — and some practical advice — to help deliberate this decision.\nAM I UNHAPPY WITH MY PHONE?\nThe first and most important step is to gauge your satisfaction with your phone. If there are elements that make you unhappy, drill down on the problems.\nA lot of what makes us displeased with our phones can be fixed, so it helps to be aware of the solutions. Here are two of the most common frustrations and their remedies:\n— If the device feels slow or doesn’t last throughout the day, one of the simplest and most affordable solutions is to replace the battery. Apple stores will replace an iPhone battery for US$50 to US$70, and plenty of independent technicians can service batteries for Apple and Android phones for around the same price.\nReplacing the battery greatly elongates a device’s life and speeds it up. Because batteries have a finite life, it’s recommended to replace them every two to three years anyway, said Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, a company that publishes instructions on repairing gadgets.\n— Another common issue is running out of data storage, which prevents people from taking more photos and downloading apps. A quick fix is to purge apps that you no longer use. On iPhones, Apple offers the iPhone Storage tool, which shows a list of apps that take up the most data and when they were last used. On Android devices, Google offers a similar tool, Files.\nSome major problems can’t be easily remedied. A broken touch-screen could cost US$200 or more to replace, for example, which approaches the price of a decent new phone, like the US$400 iPhone SE or US$300 Google Pixel 4A. When a repair is more than half the cost of a new phone, it may be time to think about trading in your beat-up gadget for credit toward a new one.\nCAN I GET SOFTWARE UPDATES?\nPhone manufacturers regularly publish software updates that include new features but also address security vulnerabilities, so it’s important to stay on top of installing them. A good rule of thumb is to consider an upgrade when you can no longer get software updates.\nApple phones get software updates for five to six years. (Apple’s iOS 15 software, arriving this fall, will be compatible with phones back to the iPhone 6S from 2015.) Android devices get them for a shorter period — about two to three years.\nAlthough security updates are important, it may not be practical for some people to upgrade as soon as software updates run out, said Sinan Eren, an executive at the security firm Barracuda Networks. In countries like Turkey, various taxes can add up to a markup of about 100 per cent\xa0on electronics, he said, meaning customers have an economic incentive to hold on to a device for longer than five years.\n“It’s a tough situation and therefore a luxury to even think about security,” Eren said.\nThere are ways to work around this problem. Anti-malware apps, like Malwarebytes, may keep older Android phones running safely just a little longer. Apple phones can also run apps like 1Blocker, which blocks malicious ads from loading on websites.\nHOW WOULD A NEW PHONE CHANGE MY LIFE?\nIt is important to imagine what your life would look like with a new phone, said Guy of Wirecutter. If you have a newborn on the way and your phone camera takes blurry shots, an upgrade with a better camera will probably change your phone experience in a remarkable way.\nBut if you mostly use a phone just for basic tasks like making calls, messaging and browsing the web, a newer, faster one won’t make a big difference because phones have been plenty fast for years.\n“Don’t replace something that works just fine just because there’s a newer, shinier version out,” Guy said.\nBy Brian X Chen ©\xa0The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     iPhones ', '     Apple ']}"

      Commentary: Techies essential for Singapore to stay relevant as regional business hub 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The drive towards digital transformation spurred by the pandemic has exacerbated the shortage of tech human capital or techies. \nThis could adversely impact Singapore’s status as a regional business hub. \nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a passing reference to this in his National Day Rally Speech on Sunday (Aug 29) when he emphasised the need to “refocus on the future” to generate “new growth”, “new jobs” and prosperity for the future, as the global economy picks up. \nHighlighting how video-conferencing giant Zoom opened a research and development centre here, he also urged Singapore to remain open to investors and encouraged Singapore companies to make their mark in the new economy and seize fresh opportunities.\nA vital ingredient in an increasingly digital work are tech workers. They perform critical functions across all sectors, especially in the growing finance and IT sectors, and both local and foreign tech talent are required to maintain and grow Singapore’s status as a regional business hub. \nThe concern over shortages of tech talent was highlighted in a poll by the Singapore Infocomm Technology Federation (SiTF) as far back in 2017. This shortfall was most felt by start-ups (91 per cent), small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (76 per cent) and multinational corporations (MNCs) (75 per cent). \nThe five hardest jobs to fill were programmers (54 per cent), business development (50 per cent), cybersecurity specialists (40 per cent), system architects (38 per cent) and engineers (36 per cent).\nThe entry of tech giants such as Tencent, Bytedance, Zoom and existing demands from “unicorns” such as Grab and Sea Ltd may have further fuelled the war for tech talent. \nAn Amazon Web Services (AWS) report in early 2021 highlighted that Singapore will need an additional 1.2 million digital workers by 2025 - a 55 per cent increase from today’s level - to remain competitive. \nDuring the pandemic, companies including a range of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in all sectors accelerated their digital transformation to leverage remote working capabilities and develop a new customer base to cope with curbs on physical interactions. \nSurprisingly, the rapid adaptability of workers and consumers in the digital space increased connectedness and service experiences. Driven by necessity, workers and consumers made the digital leap overnight. \nBut this change in how workplaces operated, and consumers bought drove demand for new tech skills especially around tech domains and industry expertise that enabled seamless and cost-effective integration of new and legacy IT systems. \nIn the construction industry, the need to share pockets of data from software like MS Excel onto a single digital platform for project coordination has created the need for a tech systems integrator. \nThis comes even as construction companies are simultaneously moving from longstanding design tools like AutoCAD used since the 1980s to more sophisticated 3D-imaging software like GRAPHISOFT’s Archicad, which requires skilled tech workers to convert older designs to 3D images.\nBut employers are seeing productivity gains in embracing new digital solutions. In 2020, as part of digital transformation, Randstad Singapore’s COVID-19 Employer Pulse Survey found that 46 per cent of employers aimed to increase investments in tech to improve their staff’s agility while remote working, including building a strong and secure cloud infrastructure that enables the sharing and accessing of encrypted files. \nStill, the start-up ecosystem needs tech skills desperately. Randstad Singapore estimates about 50,000 new tech jobs requiring advanced skills and familiarity with deep tech - in artificial intelligence, data analytics and machine learning - are much sought in catalysing the inflow of capital and funding but border control measures compound the challenges of supplying such manpower. \nThe payoffs can be huge. Local start-up Breathonix, after hiring experts to join the team, developed revolutionary non-invasive breath tests that can detect COVID-19. \nAdded to that\xa0is demand from MNCs and banks that use Singapore as their regional base. It’s no wonder the tightening measures on inflow of foreign tech workers and our slow expansion of the local tech talent pool have resulted in intense competition for tech talent – with high turnover rates and unsustainable salary increases. \xa0\nAlmost half of surveyed Singapore workers say they intend to leave their current jobs in the next 12 months – the highest in Asia Pacific region, according to a study by IDC and Workday. \nThis comes as little surprise when some tech professionals could command pay increases of up to 30 to 35 per cent in shifting to new jobs, according to Randstad.\nIn a bid to alleviate the shortage, the Government has been retraining thousands of workers at the entry and mid-career levels to nurture a pipeline of tech workers.\nSince 2017, the intake for IT courses in Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) has risen 17 per cent to around 7,600 in 2020. Company-hosted traineeships and attachments also account for about 4,900 more roles as of late last year.\nGovernment grants to hire and meet the wage expectations of mid-career switchers have also helped smaller companies. \nSMEs are even leveraging gig contract workers and internship schemes to alleviate short-term IT manpower gaps. Software solutions firm Adventus Consultants, which designed Scoot’s booking engine and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital’s corporate website, for example hires interns to work on real-life projects where they can also gain work experience. \nCompanies know sharing scarce IT talent might be the new way forward.\nSpeaking in May at a webinar on financial sector jobs, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Ravi Menon highlighted that Singapore workers have made inroads in some tech skill areas. \nSingaporeans occupied 70 per cent of net new jobs as cybersecurity engineers and user experience or interface designers and 50 per cent of net new jobs as data analysts and scientists. \nHowever, there remains an acute shortage of software engineers with strong programming skills and in-depth business knowledge.\nOn this, Mr. Menon highlighted that rather than restricting the inflow of tech expertise, individual financial institutions and MAS need to collaborate to build strong skills in technology. \nThe good news is the tech talent crunch has not discouraged global companies from locating in Singapore, which attracted a record 12-year high of S$17.2 billion of investments in 2020. \nIn order to maintain Singapore’s regional business hub status, the Economic and Development Board (EDB) continues to seek and ensure that global tech companies in Singapore have access to a skilled local workforce and a diverse set of foreign tech talent through schemes like the new Tech Pass Visa. \nThey know Singapore’s continued relevance as a business hub is dependent on creating a complementary system of both local and foreign top-tier tech talent. \nAnd that concerns over the sustainability of recruiting foreign techies can be mitigated by the nurturing and upskilling of local tech talent.\nDr Faizal Yahya is a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     National Day Rally 2021 ', '     Singapore economy ', '     jobs ', '     technology ']}"

      Rent-a-robot: Silicon Valley’s new answer to the labour shortage in smaller US factories
  </h1>, 'text': 'LIVERMORE, California: Silicon Valley has a new pitch to persuade small companies to automate: rent-a-robot.\nBetter technology and the need to pay higher wages to humans have produced a surge in sales of robots to big companies all across America. But few of these automatons are making it into smaller factories, which are wary of big upfront costs and lacking robot engineering talent.\nSo venture capitalists are backing a new financial model: Lease robots, install and maintain them, charge factories by the hour or month, cut the risk and initial costs.\nSaman Farid, a former venture capitalist who invested in robots for over a decade and saw the challenges of getting robots into factories, set up rent-a-robot Formic Technologies with backing from Lux Capital and Initialized Capital, an early investor in self-driving tech start-up Cruise.\nInitialized Capital partner Garry Tan sees a confluence of cheaper and better robot computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, low interest rates, and the threat of US-China tensions on supply chains stoking interest in robot subscriptions.\n“It\'s at the center of three of the largest mega trends that are driving all of society now,” said Tan.\nTechies and small business owners do not always understand each other, a dilemma that led an industry group, the Association for Manufacturing Technology, to set up a San Francisco office a couple of years ago, to bring the two together.\nThe lease model puts much of the financial burden on robot start-ups which carry the risk of a manufacturer losing a contract or changing a product. Smaller factories often have small runs of more tailored products that are not worth a robot. And Silicon Valley Robotics, an industry group supporting robot start-ups, says that in the past, funding has been a challenge.\nStill, some high-profile investors are on board.\nTiger Global, the biggest funder of tech start-ups this year, has backed three robot firms offering subscription in seven months.\nBob Albert, whose family owns Polar Hardware Manufacturing, a 105-year-old metal stamping factory in Chicago, bought Formic’s pitch to pay less than US$10 an hour for a robot, compared with more than US$20 an hour for his average human worker.\nHe watched this month as a robot arm picked up a metal bar from a bin, spun around, and placed it in an older machine that bent it into a 107-cm door handle.\n“If the robot works really well, we’ll use it a lot,” said Albert, who was pleased with the initial results. “And if it doesn\'t work out, neither one of us comes out very well. We have less skin in the game and they have some skin in the game.”\nWestec Plastics, a family-owned plastic molding factory in Livermore, California, got its first robot in January 2020 and now has three - named Melvin, Nancy and Kim - from Rapid Robotics which charges US$3,750 a month per robot in the first year and US$2,100 from year two.\n“Melvin runs 24 hours a day, all three shifts, and that replaced three full operators,” said President Tammy Barras, adding that she is saving about US$60,000 in labour costs a year with the one robot alone.\n“We\'ve had to increase our wages quite significantly this year because of what is going on in the world. And luckily, Melvin has not increased his pay rate. He doesn\'t ask for a raise.”\nBarras, who has 102 employees, says robots cannot replace humans today as they can perform only repetitive, simple tasks like picking up a round plastic cylinder and stamping a company logo on the correct side.\nJordan Kretchmer, co-founder and CEO of Rapid Robotics, said he encounters some skepticism. “A lot of times we\'ve walked in and there\'s a graveyard of robots that they bought in the past,” he said. But he added, ""robots can be easy and they do work when they\'re in the hands of the right people"".\n\xa0\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Western Digital-Kioxia in talks to create chipmaker giant -source
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK/TOKYO :Western Digital is in advanced talks for a possible US$20 billion stock merger with Japanese chipmaker and partner Kioxia, a person familiar with the matter said, a move that would create a NAND memory giant to rival Samsung Electronics. \nThe companies could reach an agreement as early as mid-September, and Western Digital CEO David Goeckeler would run the combined firm, the person said, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential matters. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported the talks earlier on Wednesday. Kioxia Holdings Corp and Western Digital both told Reuters they do not comment on speculation about mergers. \nA combination of the two would rewrite the competition to capture robust demand for memory chips that has been driven by 5G expansion and a pandemic-fueled rise in work from home. \nWhile Samsung dominates with over a third of the NAND market, according to research firm TrendForce, Kioxia has a nearly 19per cent share and Western Digital 15per cent. South Korea\'s SK Hynix Inc and U.S. firms Micron Technology Inc and Intel Corp are the other large players. \n""Such a deal would be a defensive, but prudent, move by  Western to reinforce its competitive position in the swiftly consolidating chip market,"" Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said in a research note. \n""In the long term, we expect the NAND market to ... consolidate down to about three leading players for a largely commodity-like product,"" Kerwin said. \nThe memory chip industry is already consolidating, with Hynix agreeing to buy Intel\'s NAND business for US$9 billion last year, a deal still awaiting anti-trust clearance. \nA Western Digital-Kioxia merger is also likely to draw anti-trust scrutiny in several countries, including in the United States and China. \nMonopoly concerns and a years-long trade conflict between the United States and China have scuppered deals in the past few years. \nQualcomm Inc, for instance, walked away from a US$44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after failing to secure Chinese approval in 2018, and Nvidia Corp\'s planned US$40 billion acquisition of British chip designer ARM hit a major hurdle last week in the UK. \nChinese antitrust watchdog State Administration for Market Regulation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on approval for a potential Western Digital-Kioxia deal. \nKIOXIA OWNERS\nIn Japan, the two companies jointly produce NAND chips, which don\'t need power to retain data and are used in smartphones, TVs, data center servers and public announcement display panels.\n""For privately held Kioxia, we think US$20 billion or more would secure a solid return,"" Morningstar\'s Kerwin said.\nKioxia, sold by Toshiba Corp in 2018 to a consortium led by Bain Capital for US$18 billion as Toshiba Memory Corp, shelved plans last year for what would have been Japan\'s largest initial public offering in 2020. \nAn IPO is still a possibility should Kioxia fail to reach a deal with San Jose, California-based Western Digital, the source told Reuters. Financial magazine Diamond in June said Kioxia was planning an IPO as early as September. \nKioxia said in its statement to Reuters on Thursday that it was considering the appropriate timing for an IPO. \nToshiba, which still owns about 40.6per cent of Kioxia, is in talks with at least four global private equity firms to seek their ideas for a new strategy, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources. \nToshiba\'s shares were up 1.3per cent in afternoon trading.\nWestern Digital\'s shares closed up 7.8per cent on Wednesday, giving it a market capitalization of more than US$20 billion. \nToshiba said it was not involved in the management of Kioxia and not in a position to comment. It said it continues to consider the most appropriate approach to its investment in Kioxia to maximize shareholder value.\nBain was not immediately available for a comment.    \n (Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru, Krystal Hu in New York and Makiko Yamazaki in Tokyo; Additional reporting by Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Writing by Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by Stephen Coates and Tom Hogue)\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Western Digital ']}"

      Commentary: The real reason most super apps are not super great
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: The most valuable real estate in the world is not in Hong Kong, Manhattan, Knightsbridge or Monaco. It’s in your pocket.\nYour smartphone’s home screen has space for about 30 apps, depending on the display size. There are more than 2 million apps in Apple’s App Store and nearly 3.5\xa0million on Google Play vying for those slots.\nThe prize for landing one is huge: According to App Annie, a market data company, consumers spent US$143 billion on apps last year, consuming trillions of hours of screen time.\nNo wonder, then, that tech companies are racing to turn themselves into “super apps”\xa0– one-stop shops for a range of services, designed to entrench their app in your life.\nUber, Bolt, Grab and Gojek all\xa0claim to be super apps for transport, food delivery and logistics. PayPal, Klarna and Revolut hope to be financial super apps. \nSpotify is on its way to becoming a super app for audio, adding podcasts and chat rooms to its music library.\nPitches for the “next super app” arrive in my inbox almost daily. It is a trend I fear is annoying for the user at best and hostile to new competition at worst.\nThe grandfather of super\xa0apps is Tencent’s WeChat. In China, it’s used for everything from messaging and gaming to food delivery and paying the rent, and has some 1.25\xa0billion users.\nBut WeChat’s position in China is unique and will be hard to replicate. It launched in 2011, just as smartphone sales in China exploded.\nWith mobiles serving as most Chinese users’ gateway to the Internet, WeChat fulfilled a similar role to web portals such as AOL, Yahoo and CompuServe in the 1990s in the US.\nSuper apps are also succeeding in other emerging mobile-Internet markets, such as Southeast Asia, where Gojek and Grab dominate.\nBut US and European super apps launching today find themselves in a totally different online world. Smartphone penetration is reaching saturation and, by some estimates, the number of apps we each use has peaked.\nData from SensorTower and Pew suggest US smartphone owners used an average of 46 apps a month in the first half of this year. That is down from a pandemic high of 48 in the second quarter of last year and only a couple more than were used each month in 2019.\nI sympathise with app developers’ predicament. App stores have become overcrowded, and the instinct to maximise revenue from existing customers will only have been accentuated by Apple’s restrictions on targeted advertising, which make it harder to hook users.\nCompetition is also asymmetric. A few Big Tech companies are dominant enough to colonise multiple places on home screens.\nGoogle, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft\xa0and Amazon, as well as Tencent and ByteDance in China, have all succeeded in building a “family of apps”, each with a more focused function.\nBut developers that respond by bundling ever more features into a super app risk frustrating users. Single-purpose apps are faster and easier to navigate. \nBy contrast, the super-app approach involves cramming as many features as possible into one bloated piece of software.\nSpeed and responsiveness are vital on a mobile. A Deloitte study found a 100-millisecond improvement in the loading speed of a mobile ecommerce site improved conversions by as much as 8 per cent and customers spent 10 per cent more.\nSite performance data from Google show users can lose focus if they are made to wait for more than a second for an app to load.\n5G networks may support “heavier” apps, but if users have to spend several seconds tapping through an overcomplicated interface to find the function they want, that will deter them from coming back.\nSpotify’s interface, for instance, has become cluttered and confusing since it added podcasts. Google tried to foist its Zoom rival Meet on every Gmail app user, adding an annoying tab that gets in the way of reading email (it can be disabled).\nPayPal says it will use personalisation to bring the features each user wants to the fore. But past experience with algorithmically generated content shows it can just end up promoting whatever new services a company wants to sell this month.\nThis is my real issue with super apps: Most solve a problem for the company, not the customer. \nNo property developer would sell a home, then months later stuff it with vending machines. App developers should resist the same temptation.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Big Tech ', '     Apple ', '     Google ', '     Grab ', '     Gojek ']}"

      Toshiba in talks with four investment firms for strategic ideas: Sources
  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO/HONG KONG: Toshiba is in talks with at least four global private equity firms including KKR & Co and Blackstone to seek their ideas for its new strategy, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.\nBain Capital and Canadian investment firm Brookfield have also been tapped by the scandal-hit Japanese conglomerate\'s strategic review committee to put together and submit their ideas for Toshiba, the sources said.\nThe latest process is not meant to formally solicit buyout bids for the overall company or some of its assets, and it\'s not immediately clear whether the engagement with buyout firms will result in formal offers in the future.\nThe step, however, indicates that Toshiba is engaging with potential bidders since shareholders ousted its chairman in June after the company was found to have colluded with the Japanese government to put pressure on foreign investors.\nAfter the chairman\'s ouster, Toshiba, which has many lines of business and units and operates in several jurisdictions, launched a full review of its current assets, and also pledged to engage with potential strategic and financial investors.\n""As announced, Toshiba\'s strategic review committee is considering and discussing a wide range of initiatives without delay,"" Toshiba said in a statement to Reuters.\nToshiba, which had a market valuation of about US$19 billion as of Wednesday, ""plans to present the achievements when we announce the new business plan in October"", it said, but declined to comment further.\nSpokespersons at Bain, Blackstone, KKR and Brookfield declined to comment.\nThe sources declined to be identified as the talks were private.\nAt an earnings briefing this month, Toshiba Chief Executive Satoshi Tsunakawa said the company had been ""vigorously engaged in dialogue not only with shareholders but also with financial and strategic investors.""\nHe also said that the company was open to take private bids although it had not received any offers since a US$20 billion takeover bid from CVC Capital Partners, which was subsequently dismissed in April as lacking details.\nToshiba\'s previous CEO left in April over controversy about CVC\'s buyout offer.\nBain, Brookfield, and KKR had earlier weighed potential bids to take Toshiba private. The conglomerate at that time had said it believed being publicly traded provided a ""capital structure suitable for enhancing long term value creation"".\nToshiba\'s move to talk with the private equity funds has puzzled some investors who have questioned why the company has not started an official process to elicit bids.\nIn June, an investigation concluded Toshiba colluded with Japan\'s trade ministry to block investors from gaining influence at last year\'s shareholders meeting - a finding that put governance at Japan Inc under the spotlight.\nToshiba, whose products range from escalators to sewerage, remains one of Japan\'s few manufacturers of nuclear power reactors and makes defence equipment, meaning any sale of the company would need government approval.\nShares of Toshiba opened up 3 per cent on Thursday before giving up half of the gains in late morning trade.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Toshiba ', '     technology ', '     Japan ']}"

      Finally, an EV from Mercedes-Benz. Is it worth considering?
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you thought Maserati was late to the electric party, well here comes Mercedes-Benz with the new EQC, its first fully electric vehicle (EV) – finally.\nAs the first emission-free vehicle to roll off the production lines at the carmaker’s brand new sub-brand, Mercedes-EQ, the EQC marks the first milestone in Mercedes-Benz’s Ambition2039 plan to have a fully networked and completely carbon neutral new car fleet by 2039. But first, the carmaker aims to have plug-in hybrids and EVs make up more than 50 per cent of its global car sales by 2030.\nNow the EQC is an all-electric SUV that moves to the tune of 408hp of power, 760Nm of torque, and nips the century dash in a respectable 5.1 seconds.\nIts range is not to be sniffed at, either: Jostling for top spot among all EVs produced today at an impressive 423 km.\nThis should take you twice round the outermost edges of Singapore before you’ll need a recharge. But based on past experience, estimating an EV’s real range is often a dicey affair.\nMANAGING RANGE ANXIETY\nI’ll be honest: Each time I get behind the wheel of an EV, I suffer from acute range anxiety. So I was rather assured to learn of the EQC’s very comfortable range thanks to its large high-voltage lithium-ion battery, arranged in the vehicle floor, between the two axles.\nIn reality, though, the actual range you manage often depends largely on the drive mode you select, paired with your personal driving style.\nThe all-wheel drive EQC comes with four drive programmes: Comfort, Eco and Sport plus an individually adaptable program. Sport mode is undeniably the most fun but undoubtedly sucks up the most energy; Eco focuses on efficiency in a bid to max out your range but your SUV grows more sluggish and you feel the heft of this two-and-a-half tonne car. So Comfort is, of course, the most comfortable compromise. Oh, and if you chuck your phone on the wireless charging tray, it’s going to drain even more juice from your electric ride.\nEnergy management is therefore the name of the game and the EQC amps up the fun for sport.\nThey call it intelligent recuperation: A regenerative braking function that charges the EQC’s batteries on the move to help optimise range. \xa0\nSo whenever you lift your foot off the accelerator or step on the brake, the electric motors function like generators, effectively converting the mechanical rotation into electrical energy – and, for kicks, you’ll enjoy watching the dynamic percentage fluctuation of recuperative deceleration displayed on the digital dashboard as you drive. \xa0\nIt gets even more interesting – the driver gets to decide the level of regenerative braking you desire. Just flick the paddles behind the steering wheel: The one on the left increases the level of recuperation, and the paddle on the right reduces it. There are four settings: D + completely removes the recuperation so the vehicle rolls freely; D shifts to normal recuperation; D - results in strong deceleration in overrun mode such as when driving downhill; and D - - offers maximum recuperation and deceleration in overrun mode.\nIt’s all very clever but unless you’re at risk of growing dangerously low on energy, anything other than D + feels rather jarring and takes quite some getting used to if you’ve just made the leap from a combustion engine drive.\nOutside of normal recuperation D mode, you almost have to unlearn and relearn a new style of driving, which is particularly niggling for drivers of the heavy-footed variety – and even less fun for passengers onboard. So no recuperation for me, thank you very much.\nThat said, you can also just set it to auto and let your smart car do its thing.\nAs for charging your EQC, there’s the option of AC charging at 11kW, which is more suitable for home charging because it takes forever. Or the swifter alternative of DC charging at 110 kW, which can juice your EV up to 80 per cent in just 40 minutes – provided you can find an available EV charging station on this island, which is still sorely lacking in EV infrastructure.\nThere are, however, several apps that can help you locate EV charging stations and check their availability in advance, such as Greenlots by Shell.\nELECTRO STYLING\nBy virtue of its muscular proportions, the EQC is classed as a crossover SUV. An extended roofline meets a low waistline and shorter wheelbase compared to comparable SUVs, while its coupe-like roof recesses at the rear to visually position the EQC between an SUV and an SUV coupe.\nThere’s currently only one engine variant available – the EQC 400 4MATIC – but it comes with the option of Electric Art or AMG Line design models, both distinguished by their “electro” styling where blue trims and lettering reflect its electric lineage.\nThe former features a tad more classic cues while the sportier latter flexes a distinctive front apron in an unmistakable jet-wing AMG design with MULTIBEAM LED headlamps, accentuated by several new AMG wheel designs of 20 and 21 inches.\nCLIMATE AND OTHER CREATURE COMFORTS\nOn the inside, the EQC’s attractive multimedia complex rules; a 10.25-inch touchscreen central media display houses the automaker’s MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) multimedia system, which supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\nAlternatively, you can also send operating controls via finger scrolls on the touchpad located in the centre console. \xa0\nOf all the thoughtful creature comforts, the pre-entry climate control, which sets your desired temperature for the time of your intended departure (programmable via the Mercedes me App), is perhaps the most appreciated given the blazing heat of late.\nThe 4-way electro-pneumatic lumbar support seat adjustment comes a close second. And, with a view to sustainability, seats are upholstered in man-made ARTICO leather.\nThere’s also a 13-speaker Burmester surround sound system delivering first-class surround sound and 64-colour ambient lighting to help set the mood. And the ventilation outlets with rose gold-coloured louvres are a nice touch.\n\xa0\nYou can also be assured of the latest-generation safety and driving assistance systems plus a 360-degree camera onboard, including active brake and blind spot assists, with many more assistance programmes available as optional.\nUltimately, the question is, is the new Mercedes EQC worth rocking down to electric avenue?\nWell, with the range on this baby, it’s a resounding yes for me.\nMERCEDES EQC 400 4MATIC TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONSDRIVE SYSTEM:\xa0two asynchronous motors, all-wheel drivePOWER:\xa0408hpTORQUE:\xa0760NmRANGE: 423kmACCELERATION (0-100KM/H):\xa05.1 secondsTOP SPEED:\xa0180km/hBATTERY: Lithium-ionPOWER CONSUMPTION:\xa021.5kWh/100kmPRICE:\xa0from S$303,888\n', 'related_topics': ['     cars ', '     technology ']}"

      Facebook launches VR remote work app, calling it a step to the 'metaverse'
  </h1>, 'text': 'Facebook on Thursday (Aug 19) launched a test of a new virtual reality (VR) remote work app where users of the company\'s Oculus Quest 2 headsets can hold meetings as avatar versions of themselves.\nThe beta test of Facebook\'s Horizon Workrooms app comes as many companies continue to work from home after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down physical workspaces and as a new variant is sweeping across the globe.\nFacebook sees its latest launch as an early step towards building the futuristic ""metaverse"" that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted in recent weeks.\nThe world\'s largest social network has invested heavily in VR\xa0and augmented reality (AR), developing hardware such as its Oculus VR headsets, working on AR glasses and wristband technologies and buying a bevy of VR gaming studios, including BigBox VR.\nGaining dominance in this space, which Facebook bets will be the next big computing platform, will allow it to be less reliant in the future on other hardware makers, such as Apple, the company has said.\nFacebook\'s vice president of its Reality Labs group, Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth, said the new Workrooms app gives ""a good sense"" of how the company envisions elements of the metaverse.\n""This is kind of one of those foundational steps in that direction,"" Bosworth told reporters during a VR news conference.\nThe term ""metaverse"", coined in the 1992 dystopian novel Snow Crash,\xa0is used to describe immersive, shared spaces accessed across different platforms where the physical and digital converge. Zuckerberg has described it as an ""embodied Internet"".\nIt has been referenced in several recent earnings calls by tech CEOs including Zuckerberg, Microsoft\'s Satya Nadella, gaming company Roblox\'s David Baszucki and Match Group\'s Shar Dubey, who have talked about how their companies could shape aspects of this futuristic realm.\nIn July, Facebook said it was creating a product team to work on the metaverse, which would be part of its AR and VR group Facebook Reality Labs.\nIn its first full VR news briefing, the company showed how Workrooms users can design avatar versions of themselves to meet in virtual reality conference rooms and collaborate on shared whiteboards or documents, still interacting with their own physical desk and computer keyboard.\nThe app, free through the Quest 2 headsets which cost about US$300, allows up to 16 people together in VR and up to 50 total including video conference participants. Bosworth said Facebook was now using Workrooms regularly for internal meetings.\nThe company said it would not use people\'s work conversations and materials in Workrooms to target ads on Facebook. It also said users must follow its VR community standards and that rule-breaking behaviour can be reported to Oculus.\nFacebook recently halted sales of its Oculus Quest 2 headsets and recalled the foam face-liners due to reports of skin irritation in cooperation with the US\xa0Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nThe recall notice said it affected about 4 million units in the United States, providing an estimate of Quest 2 headset sales which have not yet been officially announced by the company. Facebook reported non-advertising revenue, which comes from the AR and VR part of the business as well as e-commerce, of US$497 million in the second quarter of 2021.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Facebook ', '     Internet ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: US always needed a foil. It just happens to be China
  </h1>, 'text': 'BOSTON: The Chinese government’s clampdown on Alibaba last year, and on the ride-hailing company Didi last month, has generated fevered speculation about the future of that country’s tech industry.\nSome view the recent Chinese regulatory interventions as part of a justifiable trend paralleling US authorities’ own intensifying scrutiny of Big Tech.\nOthers see it as a play for control of data that might otherwise be exploited by Western countries. And still others, more plausibly, see it as a shot across the bow to remind big Chinese companies that the Communist Party of China is still in charge.\nBut, most consequentially, the Chinese government’s actions are part of a broader effort to decouple China from the United States – a development that could have grave global implications.\nDespite steady deterioration in Sino-American economic and strategic relations, few thought the rivalry would turn into a Cold War-style geopolitical confrontation.\nFor a time, the US was overly dependent on China, and the two economies were too closely intertwined. Now, we may be heading toward a fundamentally different equilibrium.\nThree interrelated dynamics defined the Cold War. The first, and perhaps most important, was ideological rivalry. The US-led West and the Soviet Union had different visions of how the world should be organised, and each tried to propagate its vision, sometimes by nefarious means.\nThere was also a military dimension, illustrated most vividly by a nuclear-arms race. And both blocs were eager to secure the lead in scientific, technological and economic progress, because they recognised that this was critical to prevailing ideologically and militarily.\nWhile the Soviets eventually proved less successful than the US in driving economic growth, they did chalk up early technological-military victories. The successful launch of the Sputnik satellite served as a wake-up call for the US.\nThe stark rivalries of the Cold War were possible largely because the US and the Soviet Union were decoupled. US investments and technological breakthroughs did not automatically flow to the Soviets (except, sometimes, through espionage) in the way that they have with China in recent decades.\nBut now, Sino-American hostilities, exacerbated by Donald Trump’s incoherent diplomacy, have created modern analogues of the Cold War rivalries.\nThe ideological rift, which was not even on the horizon 20 years ago, is now well defined, with the West extolling the virtues of democracy (warts and all) while China confidently pushes its authoritarian model around the world, especially in Asia and Africa.\nAt the same time, China has opened new military fronts, not least in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\nAnd, of course, the economic and technological rivalry has been escalating over the past decade, with both sides concluding that they are in an existential race to achieve dominance in artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlthough this focus on AI may be misguided, there is little doubt that mastery of digital technologies, bioscience, advanced electronics and semiconductors is of paramount importance.\nSome observers have welcomed the new rivalry, believing that it will give the West a well-defined common purpose. The “Sputnik moment”, after all, motivated the US government to invest in infrastructure, education and new technologies.\nA similar mission for public policy today might yield many benefits; indeed, the Biden administration has already begun to frame US investment priorities in terms of the Sino-American rivalry.\nIt is true that many of the West’s Cold War-era success stories depended on the Soviet Union serving as a foil. Western Europe’s model of social democracy was viewed as a palatable alternative to Soviet-style authoritarian socialism.\nSimilarly, market-driven growth in South Korea and Taiwan owes much to the threat of communism, which forced\xa0governments to eschew overt repression, undertake land reforms, and invest in education.\nAnd yet, the potential benefits of a new Sputnik moment are probably far outweighed by the costs of decoupling. In today’s interdependent world, global cooperation is fundamental.\nThe rivalry with China, though essential to the defense of democracy around the world, is not the West’s sole priority. Climate change also poses a civilisational threat, and it will require close China-US collaboration.\nMoreover, commentators nowadays tend to downplay the Cold War’s tremendous costs. If the West now lacks credibility when advocating human rights and democracy – including in Hong Kong and China – that is not only because of a generation of disastrous military interventions in the Middle East.\nDuring the years when the US thought that it was locked in an existential conflict with the Soviets, it toppled democratically elected governments in Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954), and supported vicious dictators like Joseph Mobutu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Augusto Pinochet in Chile.\nIt is an equally grave mistake to think that the Cold War fostered international stability. On the contrary, the nuclear arms race and brinkmanship on both sides prepared the ground for war.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis was hardly the only time that the US and the Soviets came close to open conflict (and mutually assured destruction). There were also close calls in 1973, during the Yom Kippur War; in 1983, when Soviet early-alert systems sent a false alarm about a US intercontinental ballistic missile launch; and on other occasions.\nThe challenge today is to achieve a model of peaceful coexistence that allows for competition between incompatible visions of the world and cooperation on geopolitical and climate-related matters.\nThat doesn’t mean the West should accept human-rights abuses or abandon its allies in Asia; but nor should it allow itself to fall into a Cold War-style trap.\nA principled foreign policy should still be possible, especially if Western governments allow their civil societies to lead the scrutiny of China’s actions at home and abroad.\nDaron Acemoglu, Professor of Economics at MIT, is co-author (with James A Robinson) of Why Nations Fail: The Origins Of Power, Prosperity And Poverty and The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, And The Fate Of Liberty.\n', 'related_topics': ['     United States ', '     China ', '     trade ', '     technology ']}"

      What’s the difference between these two Mercedes-Benzes? S$70,000, for starters
  </h1>, 'text': 'Mercedes-Benz is a master of many things. Its ability to make best-in-class, cutting edge limousines in the form of the S-Class have seen them have a virtual stranglehold on the segment for well over half a century.\nIt is also the master of sub-dividing vehicle classes, as can be seen in its current model lineup, which is, to say the least, bewilderingly large. Take the A-badged family, making up the base of the vast Mercedes-Benz product pyramid (well, actually, its topography resembles more a sprawling metropolis), for example.\nYou can have an entry-level Mercedes-Benz in no less than five flavours, ranging from hatchbacks, saloons, crossovers and even a slinky little station wagon, known in automotive circles as a shooting brake.\nEven more confusingly, there are a pair of saloons within that, badged the A-Class Saloon and the CLA-Class Coupe respectively. The latter being a bit of a misnomer, since it has four doors and not two, as is traditional.\nFor all intents and purposes, both cars are identical, with the CLA being the (very slightly) longer, wider and lower of the pair. And also sleeker-looking of the two, with the A-Class being the (again, very slightly) boxier model.\nBut that’s not all, because it gets even more baffling when you get to the AMG-badged models. As you know, those three magic letters are only applied to the three-pointed star’s most rapid cars.\nThe odd thing being that the top-tier “45” model is only available on the CLA-Class, with the A-Class Saloon only being available with the second-rung “35” variant. On the plus side, you do get a little more headroom (thanks to the taller roofline) and you’ll be saving yourself some S$70,000 in the process…\nWAIT. RUN THAT BY ME AGAIN?\nThe fact that the A-Class Saloon is not available in full-fat, fire-breathing “45” guise is a mystery to us all as well. Perhaps for the same reason Mercedes-Benz maintains the CLS-Class and GT 4-Door Coupe further up the range.\nYou can, however, get the CLA-Class as a “35”, though you’ll be paying some S$9,000 extra for the privilege of those curvier lines. On the plus side, the CLA’s boot is 40 litres larger at 460 litres, though you’ll be trading off some rear bench headroom with its sloping roofline.\nBUT THE REAL MAGIC IS UNDER THE BONNET\nBoth the A35 and CLA45 come with 2-litre turbocharged engines hooked up to an all-wheel-drive system, but that’s about where the similarities end.\nTo be sure, the A35 isn’t a slouch in the power department, with 306hp at its disposal and a century sprint time of 4.8 seconds. But the CLA45 is a beast in every sense of the word, pumping out a thumping 421hp, giving it even more horsepower per litre of engine displacement than its big brother, the GT63 4-Door Coupe.\nOut in the real world, the difference between the A35 and the CLA45’s power output truly is, as with their dimensions and styling, splitting hairs. Unless you’re armed with a stopwatch, it’s rather difficult to tell the pair apart.\nThat being said, the CLA45’s motor is a marvel of modern automotive engineering. Where the A35 can feel a little strained and short of breath if pushed too hard, with the CLA45 there’s a certain inexhaustibility of thrust, along with some old-school turbocharged charm.\nIn a modern turbocharged car, one almost expects linearity, but there’s a distinct dead zone in the CLA45’s rev range under about 3,000rpm, and after that the engine explodes to life. This may sound like a bad thing, but the surge is simply addictive, intoxicating and is key to the CLA45’s (considerable) appeal. \xa0\nIn the case of the A35, its engine is far more linear, with no dead spots in the rev range unless you get to its upper registers. It pulls strongly and cleanly, like a strong, insistent push against the kidney-punch brutality of the CLA45.\nAs for which one is more usable daily, there’s honestly not much difference out in the real world. The A35’s 306hp will get you in trouble in no time flat, and with the CLA45’s 421hp, you can only imagine. Suffice it to say, both cars have more power than you’ll ever need, but where you will find a perceptible difference between the A35 and CLA45 is in its interiors.\nAN INSIDE JOB\nApart from the engine and the (numerous, too many to list here) chassis tweaks the CLA45 has, where it really has a leg up over the A35 is in its interior. To be fair, though, you are paying some 70 grand more, so it’d better be.\nBoth cars get a monolithic freestanding screen that virtually covers the entirety of the dashboard. This comprises both the infotainment display and instrument cluster, though with the CLA45, you get some displays and telemetry data only available to top-shelf AMG products.\nThe CLA45 also has a model-specific steering wheel with configurable “ears” (to turn off the stability control, open up the exhaust flaps, among other things) and a rotary dial to control the driving modes. In the A35, you’ll have to make do with the controls mounted on the centre console next to the infotainment system’s touchpad.\nIn addition to that, the A35 also has “regular” seats (albeit ones with contrast stitching and upholstered in Alcantara), as opposed to the deep, thin-backed bucket seats on the CLA45.\nIs there a real difference? Well, if we’re being honest, yes. Along with the above, there’s a tangible sense of the CLA45’s cabin being a more upmarket place to be. You know what they say, you get what you pay for.\nBUT S$70,000 IS A LOT OF MONEY…\nOh, no doubt. It certainly is. The CLA45’s current price tag of S$337,888 is huge, money you could well use to get yourself a slinky little two-door sports car, or a mid-sized SUV, like Mercedes-Benz’s own GLC.\nOn that note, the A35 isn’t exactly what you’d call a bargain-basement buy either, with its S$260,888 price tag just S$2,000 less than a GLC200. Of course, the GLC200 has far less performance potential than the A35, let alone the CLA45.\nBoth the A35 and CLA45 are clearly not cars you’d buy with your head. Fast though they may be, there will always be a nagging thought in the back of your head that you just paid top dollar for cars that nominally sit at the foot of the vast Mercedes-Benz family tree.\nThen again, that’s why they’re so alluring. There’s a certain sort of hilarity in small cars with hugely powerful engines, in that these are vehicles that could conceivably run rings around “proper” sports cars.\n', 'related_topics': ['     cars ', '     technology ']}"

      Punggol Digital District secures first batch of global players; more than 2,000 jobs to be created
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Four global companies in the fields of blockchain, cybersecurity, robotics and smart living solutions have confirmed plans to set up base in the upcoming “smart business district” in Punggol, becoming the first batch of international firms to do so.\nThese companies,\xa0as well as other tech agencies and associations that have\xa0 confirmed their plans in the Punggol Digital District (PDD) at this stage, will collectively create more than 2,000 technology jobs , national industrial estate developer JTC said on Wednesday (Jul 28).\nThe four companies are: Boston Dynamics, Delta Electronics Int’l (Singapore), Group-IB, and Wanxiang.\nThe latter two will locate their regional headquarters in the Punggol Digital District, which remains under development and will progressively open from 2024.\n\n\nDescribed as “Singapore’s first smart business district”, the 50-hectare district will incorporate a business park, the\xa0Singapore Institute of Technology’s (SIT) new campus as well as community facilities.\nIt will be powered by an open digital platform, which will collect real-time data from the district and can be used to roll out solutions such as optimising temperatures in buildings.\xa0\nWhen fully ready, the Punggol Digital District is set to create 28,000 digital economy jobs, authorities have said.\n“The strong business interest and investments in PDD is testament to Singapore’s reputation as the region’s digital innovation hub,” said Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong at an event on Wednesday where he announced the first batch of international firms.\nHe noted that the digital economy is a bright spot for businesses around the world amid the disruptions of COVID-19. It is also “critical to the economic success for Singapore and Singaporeans”, he said.\nWhile Singapore is already home to many global tech firms, Mr Gan said it needs to keep enhancing its value proposition in order to remain the location of choice for tech businesses in the long term.\nThe country has taken “active steps” such as remaining “vigilant and determined” in its approach to combat the pandemic, as well as strengthening its digital infrastructure including plans for two nationwide 5G networks by 2025.\n\n\nIt is also on track to achieving its “smart city” ambitions, with the Punggol Digital District being “a living lab for new concepts and solutions” in artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, cybersecurity and smart living.\nMr Gan described the digital district in Punggol as the first to integrate physical and digital spaces between a business park and an academic institution.\n“The co-location of businesses and the future Singapore Institute of Technology\xa0brings businesses to talent, and talent to businesses,” he said.\n\n\nThe Punggol Digital District also offers businesses “plug and play” digital infrastructure through the open digital platform, which makes data available for companies, students and the public to testbed new concepts and solutions in a safe environment before actual deployment, the minister added.\nApart from these unique offerings, Mr Gan noted that companies also stand to “benefit from Singapore’s status as an open global hub for innovation, business and talent”.\n“The PDD will create good job opportunities for Singaporeans, including those living and studying in the Punggol district,” he said.\nThe 2,000 jobs that the inaugural batch of four companies are expected to create range from digital forensics and data analysts to solution engineers, cyber threat hunters, and artificial intelligence and blockchain developers, according to JTC.\nWHAT THE COMPANIES PLAN TO DO\nOne of these global players is US-based robotics company Boston Dynamics, best known for its “Spot” robot.\nThe four-legged robot was previously used by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) to trial robotics applications. For instance, Spot patrolled Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park last year as part of safe distancing efforts.\n\n\nMoving forward, Spot will be used in the Punggol Digital District to “test real-world use cases” such as laser scanning of construction sites and inspecting remote or dangerous environments.\nBoston Dynamics will also partner local start-up dConstruct Technologies and SIT on the learning and applied research of robotics systems.\nBy using Spot and dConstruct’s proprietary software programming tool, students will be able to develop robotic solutions to improve campus experiences.\n“Our robotic stack is something that we’re going to provide to SIT, to empower their students with the same capability to actually have self-driving robots on campus, and this will allow them to actually solve a lot of their campus challenges,” said dConstruct’s chief technology officer Chong Jiayi.\n“For example, they want to do autonomous scanning – ability for robots to scan to construct a 3D digital twin on campus. These are some of the very exciting projects that we are going to be empowering SIT in partnership with Boston Dynamics,"" he added.\nThe local start-up will also be moving into the Punggol Digital District by 2024, said chief financial officer Hazel Kuok.\n“We will work with the industry and the education institution in the same ecosystem to develop workforce capabilities in robotics hardware and software. We see the PDD as the nucleus for this opportunity,” she said.\nMeanwhile, Delta Electronics, a global provider of power and thermal management solutions, has launched its first automated container farm at the Punggol Digital District’s site gallery.\nIt also retrofitted the site gallery with its Internet-of-Things-based automated solutions, such as lighting controls and video surveillance. These are integrated into the open digital platform, allowing for remote monitoring and machine learning of usage patterns to optimise building performance.\nWith these, the company will set up a PDD Smart Living Programme to provide companies with access to smart living solutions for learning and test-bedding purposes.\n\n\nAsked why the company is keen on being located in the Punggol Digital District, managing director Cecilia Ku cited the advantages of a fully-digital platform and the potential for partnerships.\n“Without the company giving up source code, JTC and the Government actually worked out a way to make the data available for technology companies like us (to) test out solutions,” she told CNA.\nOne area is smart farming where the company will be able to work with others to develop different hydroponic seeds or species of vegetables.\nAnother area that it plans to test bed is its smart living solutions.\n“The Government’s plan is to go green and has a Singapore Green Plan 2030 so we are trying to … see whether we can convert existing buildings to green buildings first,” said Ms Ku.\n“We will monitor the energy consumption and everything. With the data collection, if we need to transform the green buildings to super-low energy (in future), then we have the data to know which areas to work on … So this is something that we want to test out in PDD because there’s data available.”\nDelta Electronics also has plans to set up a regional headquarter in Kallang by 2022, in addition to a satellite office at the Punggol Digital District.\nWith these coming up, the company will be investing almost S$30 million over the next five years.\nInternational threat hunting and cyber intelligence firm Group-IB and Chinese conglomerate Wanxiang will be locating their regional headquarters in the new digital district.\nThe former will collaborate with SIT to design and engineer a virtual testing environment for early-stage companies and start-ups to test their solutions to cyberattacks.\nIt also partnered the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and cybersecurity community Division Zero to organise the inaugural PDD bug bounty programme, where students were given four hours to identify “bugs” that can compromise smart lighting and building management systems hosted on an isolated network managed by SIT.\nSuch applied learning is an example of future cybersecurity activities that will be organised to nurture talents, JTC said in its press release.\nFor Wanxiang, it is teaming up with blockchain accelerator Tribe to launch a blockchain makerspace and incubation programme for students and start-ups.\nThe company will also join hands with a local training provider to launch a series of programme to help mid-career professionals build skillsets and provide certification in areas such as blockchain and cloud computing.\nTECH AGENCIES, ASSOCIATIONS\nApart from the international players, the ecosystem at the Punggol Digital District will be further strengthened by the CSA, GovTech and a network of tech associations, said JTC.\nIt added that the PDD will house the highest concentration of cybersecurity associations in Singapore.\nThe associations, together with other industry and community groups, will curate activities like international conferences and hackathons to upskill students and mid-career job seekers in the digital tech field, the press release said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jobs ', '     technology ']}"

The Cupertino, California, company earned US$21.7 billion, or US$1.30 per share, nearly doubling profits earned during the same period last year. Revenue surged 36 per cent to US$81.4 billion.\nBut in a Tuesday conference call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook lamented that the steadily spreading delta variant of the coronavirus is casting doubt on how the rest of the year will unfold.\n“The road to recovery will be a winding one,” Cook said. That uncertainty has already led Apple to delay employees’ mass return to its offices from September to October. Most of Apple’s stores, though, are already open.\nThe iPhone 12, released last autumn, is shaping up to be Apple’s most popular model in several years, largely because it’s the first to work on the 5G networks that are still being built around the world. Apple’s iPhone sales totaled nearly US$40 billion in the latest quarter, up 50 per cent from a year ago.\nApple’s services division, the focal point of a high-profile trial revolving around the commissions it collects from iPhone apps, saw revenue climb 33 per cent from last year to US$17.5 billion. A potentially game-changing decision from the trial completed in May is expected later this summer.\nAmong Apple's upcoming challenges is whether shortages of computer chips and other key parts will force the company to delay its next iPhone this year, as it did last year.\nWhile Apple expects revenue to rise 10 per cent in the current quarter, it said it may have more trouble getting parts for iPhones and iPad during the upcoming months. Executives skirted questions about another possible iPhone delay.\n\n\n\nALPHABET\nGoogle’s earnings improved markedly over the year-ago period, when the pandemic was starting to bite consumer spending and its partner, advertising. Now that vaccines have allowed people to shed the shackles of the pandemic and splurge again, a big chunk of that pent-up demand has spurred advertisers to spend more too, with a big chunk going to Google and its corporate parent Alphabet.\nPowered by Google, Alphabet earned US$18.53 billion, or US$27.26 per share, during the quarter, a nearly threefold increase from last year’s earnings of US$6.96 billion, or US$10.13 per share.\nGoogle’s advertising revenue soared 69 per cent to US$50.44 billion thanks to what CEO Sundar Pichai called a “rising tide” of online activity among consumers and businesses.\nRetail, along with travel and entertainment ads, were the biggest contributors to the revenue increase, the company said.\nTotal revenue surged 62 per cent from last year to US$61.88 billion. Revenue after subtracting TAC, or traffic acquisition costs, was US$50.95 billion.\nThe April-June quarter looks particularly strong since the 2020 downturn forced Google to report its first decline in quarterly ad revenue from the previous year.\nAnalysts were expecting Alphabet to earn US$19.24 per share on revenue of US$56.2 billion, and US$46.2 billion after subtracting TAC.\n\n\nMICROSOFT\nMicrosoft on Tuesday reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit of US$16.5 billion, up 47 per cent from the same period last year. Net income of US$2.17 per share beat Wall Street expectations. The software maker also topped forecasts by posting revenue of US$46.2 billion in the quarter that ended on Jun 30, a 21 per cent increase over the same time last year.\nAnalysts were expecting Microsoft to earn US$1.91 per share for the April-June quarter on revenue of US$44.1 billion. Microsoft profits have soared throughout the pandemic thanks to ongoing demand for its software and cloud computing services for remote work and study.\nGrowth in sales of Microsoft's cloud services, which compete with Amazon and other companies, and its Office productivity tools for handling work documents and email both outpaced overall revenue growth. The company's historical pillar — personal computing — grew just 9 per cent in the quarter.\nMicrosoft noted that supply issues were affecting its personal-computing division, including for its Surface and Windows products. The company recently unveiled the next generation of Windows, called Windows 11, its first major update in six years. It will be available later this year.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Apple ', '     Microsoft ', '     Google ']}"

      Commentary: Anti-trust laws needed against Big Tech firms that have too much power
  </h1>, 'text': ""CHICAGO, Illinois: With the prominent anti-monopoly advocate Lina Khan having been appointed the new chair of the Federal Trade Commission, it is a good time to consider what influence the so-called New Brandeisians will have on US anti-trust law.\nKhan is a leading figure in that movement, and another prominent exponent, Tim Wu, now sits on President Joe Biden’s National Economic Council.\xa0\nArguing that anti-trust law and enforcement are too weak and ineffectual, the New Brandeisians, named for the US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, are more open than traditional anti-trust experts to breaking up monopolies.\nEven before the New Brandeisians achieved prominence, there was a growing consensus that US courts and regulatory agencies do not enforce anti-trust law as vigorously as they should. A long period of lax enforcement has led to more concentrated markets, higher prices for consumers, and skyrocketing corporate profits.\nNO CONSENSUS YET\nA partial solution is to give regulators more resources and strengthen the standards that regulators use to approve big business mergers. A bill sponsored by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota proposes to do precisely that.\nBut beyond supporting these simple measures, the consensus among anti-trust experts dissolves.\nThe debate is shaping up as one between centrist or centre-left technocrats who consider more enforcement resources and higher merger standards sufficient, and New Brandeisians who seek much more. The right seems to be sitting on the sidelines, merely grumbling that Big Tech companies discriminate against Republicans.\n\n\nFor their part, the technocrats are committed to traditional anti-trust analysis, which weighs the benefits of market competition against the advantages of size. They believe that firms should be allowed to grow by offering superior products and services, even if they end up dominating markets.\xa0\nMergers should be permitted as long as they generate economies of scale that outweigh the anti-competitive effects.\nThe New Brandeisians draw their inspiration from the anti-monopoly agitation of the Gilded Age.\nLate-19th-century populists and 20th-century progressives like Brandeis were not primarily concerned with efficiency, nor did they distinguish carefully between the effects of monopoly on prices, wages, competition, and other economic variables.\n\nNO POLITICAL INTERFERENCE WELCOMED\nTheir argument was that the “robber barons” – men like the oil tycoon John D Rockefeller and the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie – and their companies were simply too powerful.\xa0\nTheir political and economic power were inconsistent with democratic self-government. It was this problem that anti-trust law was meant to solve.\nIn the new anti-trust debate, Big Tech is the flashpoint. When the technocrats look at that sector, they see firms that offer superior products and services at low prices, or even at no price at all.\nBusiness practices that raise anti-trust concerns can be handled under prevailing standards, and should be condemned only after proof that, despite appearances, they raise prices.\xa0\nBut the New Brandeisians see the recurrence of Gilded Age monopolisation and insist that while the harms are not recognised by traditional anti-trust analysis, they are harms just the same.\nOne such harm is political interference. Monopolies no longer dole out bribes to legislators as they did in the 19th century, but Big Tech clearly exerts substantial influence on US politics.\n\n\nDemocrats are still seething that the Russians used Facebook to propagate misinformation before the 2016 election, while Republicans complain that Facebook and Twitter kicked Donald Trump off their platforms.\xa0\nDepending on how you look at it, YouTube either spreads conspiracy theories or censors legitimate political dissent.\nMULTIPLE THREATS \xa0\nAnother concern is perceived unfairness. Google supplies search results that include listings for Google-owned products and services. The Apple App Store sells Apple apps that compete with third-party apps.\xa0\nCritics argue that these and other companies take advantage of information they obtain from competitors who use their platforms to give their own products and services a competitive edge.\nYet another problem is the loss of consumer autonomy, stemming from the fact that Big Tech knows everything about us, from our shopping habits and search histories to our medical records and personal communications.\n\n\nNever before has so much been known about so many people. In some countries, this information is shared with the government. In the US, not so much; but it is shared with other companies, and it often falls into the hands of hackers and other bad actors.\xa0\nWorse, some tech companies have used their engineering prowess and psychological know-how to addict and manipulate users.\nFinally, the Big Tech companies are seen as a threat to a diverse, textured internet economy.\nMany people lament the loss of quirky online offerings, which have been replaced by the drab monocultures of Facebook, Google, and Apple.\nThe suddenness of this change helps to explain why people were once so upset when Walmart moved in and destroyed many small towns’ central shopping districts. While prices fell, a unique, often beloved, local commercial ecosystem was lost.\nNow, many towns are ploughing taxpayer dollars into downtown revitalisation efforts, using public funds to recreate amenities that the public valued and that the market destroyed.\nOTHER OPTIONS TOO\nAgainst this backdrop, traditional economists argue that anti-trust – a technical area of the law concerned with economic efficiency – is not the solution.\n\n\nThreats to small towns or larger democratic and economic values are better addressed with campaign finance laws, zoning laws, health and safety regulations, and so forth.\n\xa0There is much good sense to this view: If we replace anti-trust law with an all-things-considered judgement about the good and bad that any large firm may do, regulators and courts will flounder, and political considerations will intrude.\nIt would be better to address the pathologies of the tech market with well-defined legislative reform.\nBut New Brandeisians would counter by pointing out that big companies can use their political power to obstruct those very reforms.\xa0\nAfter all, the tech giants have already opposed privacy and data protections, and regulations of corporate speech will go nowhere with the current US Supreme Court precedents that protect it.\n\n\nRemember, the main 19th century worry about monopolies was that they wielded too much political power.\nIf you cut them down to size, perhaps they won’t, allowing democracy to flourish.\nAnti-trust law is the only existing tool in US law for converting a big company that has too much power into a bunch of small companies that don’t.\nEric Posner, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, is the author, most recently, of The Demagogue's Playbook: The Battle for American Democracy from the Founders to Trump.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     US ', '     technology ', '     Big Tech ']}"

      Chinese apps could face subpoenas or bans under Biden order: Sources
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden\'s executive order aimed at safeguarding Americans\' sensitive data would force some Chinese apps to take tougher measures to protect private information if they want to remain in the US market, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe goal is to keep foreign adversaries like China and Russia from gaining access to large amounts of personal and proprietary business information.\nThe US Department of\xa0Commerce may issue subpoenas to collect information about certain smartphone, tablet and desktop computer software applications. Then the agency may negotiate conditions for their use in the United States or ban the apps, according to people familiar with the matter.\nBiden\'s Jun 9 order replaced former President Donald Trump\'s 2020 bans against the popular Chinese applications WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings, and ByteDance\'s TikTok. US courts halted those bans.\n\n\nUS officials share many of the concerns Trump cited in his order banning TikTok, according to one person familiar with the matter.\nNotably, they fear that China could track the locations of US government employees, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.\nWhile the new order does not name companies, it could end up capturing more apps than the Trump bans and hold up better if challenged in court.\xa0\nReuters is the first to report details on how the Biden administration plans to implement the order, including seeking support from other countries.\nUS officials have begun speaking with allies about adopting a similar approach, one source said. The hope is that partner countries will agree on apps that should be banned.\nUS Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo will decide which apps to target for US action, but they must meet certain criteria. For instance, they must be owned, controlled or managed by a person or entity that supports the military or intelligence activities of a foreign adversary such as China or Russia.\n\n\nWECHAT, TIKTOK MAY BE REVIEWED\nIf Raimondo decides an app poses an unacceptable risk, she ""has the discretion to notify the parties"" directly or publish the information in the government\'s official daily publication, the Federal Register, a Commerce Department spokesman said.\nCompanies will then have 30 days to object or propose measures to secure data better, the Commerce spokesman said.\nThe process stems from a May 2019 Trump executive order for reviewing information and communications technology from foreign adversaries.\nApps from China are most likely to find themselves in the Commerce Department\'s crosshairs given escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing, the Chinese government\'s ability to exert control over companies and the number of Chinese apps used by Americans.\xa0\nWeChat, TikTok and eight other apps targeted by the Trump administration in its last months are eligible for review by Biden\'s team, one source said.\n\xa0The Trump targets also included Ant Group\'s Alipay mobile payment app, WeChat Pay, Tencent Holdings Ltd\'s QQ Wallet, Tencent QQ, CamScanner, SHAREit, VMate published by Alibaba Group subsidiary UCWeb and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software’s WPS Office.\nSome of the apps named by Trump have serious data protection issues, while it\'s unclear why others pose a heightened risk to national security, according to another person familiar with the matter.\nThe order will apply to business apps, including those used in banking and telecommunications, as well as consumer apps, the first source said.\nApps linked to other adversaries such as Iran or Venezuela are already blocked under broader sanctions.\n', 'related_topics': ['     US ', '     China ', '     Joe Biden ', '     technology ']}"

      The new BMW 4 Series Convertible takes top-down motoring back to the future
  </h1>, 'text': ""Think fabric roofs are a throwback to retro motoring? Think again. In the new BMW 4 Series Convertible, engineers switched from a folding metal roof in the previous 4 Series Convertible to a fabric top.\nBut while that may seem like a switch to a more traditional design, it is actually a technological leap forward.\n“We decided to go back to the soft top because we now have the technology to combine the best of two worlds,” said Mr Thomas Roth, the project leader for the new 4 Series Convertible.\nMAKING A SOFT ROOF RIGID\nThe fabric roof on the new 4 Series Convertible features a series of interlocking pieces called bow panels, which help to form the roof structure. This gives the fabric roof a similar rigidity to a convertible hard top, while still remaining compact and light.\nThe roof is some 40 per cent lighter than the previous 4 Series Convertible’s metal version and takes up significantly less room when folded. It also offers 80 litres more boot space than in its predecessor. And yet, with the roof up, the new 4 Series Convertible is as quiet as the 4 Series Coupe at highway speeds.\nThere’s another benefit to the new roof. “The bow panel system underneath prevents the roof from sagging, or ending up with a tent-like, hanging effect, which the conventional convertible used to have,” said Mr Lim Seungmo from BMW Design. “The new 4 Series Convertible now has perfect tension with this fabric top.”\nA fabric roof also means reduced weight on the highest part of the car, helping to deliver sharper handling.\nSTYLISH CONFIDENCE\nWith the latest 4 Series Coupe as a starting point, the new 4 Series Convertible flaunts a sense of style and confidence.\nIt features the same vertical double kidney grille as the new 4 Series Coupe, a design element that makes a powerful impression. Together with its sporty stance and athletic proportions, the new grille ensures that every journey in the 4 Series Convertible culminates in you making a grand entrance.\nBut it’s not all just for show. With a low centre of gravity and a reinforced body structure, the new 4 Series Convertible has the agility that BMW drivers expect.\nMatching that handling is power. The 184hp 420i Convertible M Sport offers the ability to go from 0-100kmh in 8.2 seconds, while the 258hp 430i Convertible M Sport Pro performs the same sprint in 6.2 seconds.\nThe 430i Convertible M Sport Pro takes its dynamics a step further with 19-inch BMW Individual wheels framing red M Sport brakes and Adaptive M Suspension for top performance on all road conditions.\nIn addition to acceleration and cornering prowess, stowing the new 4 Series Convertible's roof takes just 18 seconds with the touch of a button, which is something that can be done even if you’re on the move, at speeds of up to 50kmh.\nA TECH-LADEN, TOP-DOWN APPROACH TO MOTORING\nWith great performance comes great responsibility, and the new 4 Series Convertible has new driver assistance systems that can turn every drive — whether leisurely or spirited — into a safer and more comfortable affair.\nA variety of standard safety features are included. For instance, the car’s systems can automatically apply the brakes if sensors detect an impending collision and inform drivers of the current road speed limit. On-board systems can also help the car stay at the centre of a lane if they detect the driver drifting too close to the next lane.\nMeanwhile, an enhanced digital cockpit places what would once have seemed like the stuff of science fiction, right at the driver’s fingertips. It offers a fully digital screen grouping comprising a 12.3-inch instrument cluster and a 10.25-inch control display, which means the driver has easy access to all relevant information in a stylish, futuristic package.\nWith such features in place, the driver is free to simply enjoy the 4 Series Convertible, either as a more conventional ride with the roof overhead, or as a classic open-top driving experience with the top lowered.\nAbove all, the striking looks of this new BMW mean it’s a car crafted for the extroverted, exuberant driver. When the 4 Series Convertible conceals its innovative new roof, it’s time for you to flaunt your style.\nFind out more about BMW’s approach to top-down motoring.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     design ', '     luxury ', '     technology ', '     Advertorial ']}"

      Commentary: Fastly's global Internet outage – how could so many sites go down at once?
  </h1>, 'text': 'PERTH: If you were having difficulty accessing your favourite website on Tuesday (Jun 8) evening, you’re not alone.\xa0\nA jaw-dropping number of major websites around the globe suddenly became unavailable with no immediately obvious explanation – before reappearing an hour later.\nIt’s disconcerting when the sites we rely on suddenly become inaccessible, and even more so when it happens on such a vast scale.\xa0\nThis outage saw seemingly unrelated sites go dark, including the BBC, Pinterest, the Financial Times and\xa0Reddit.\nHow can so many sites, from so many different organisations, all be affected by the same incident?\n\n\nHOW ONE COMPANY BROUGHT DOWN THE INTERNET\nWhile it’s too early to provide a comprehensive diagnosis of the incident, the Internet (once it was accessible again) quickly pointed to the culprit: Fastly.\nFastly is a cloud computing company that provides content delivery network (CDN) services to a range of websites including Amazon and Deliveroo.\xa0\nWhen we access a website, we might assume our browser goes off to the Internet, talks to the remote site, and then presents the page on our screen. While this is in essence what happens, it masks a much more complicated process, which can include CDN services.\nA CDN is a service that allows popular websites to keep copies of their pages closer to their customers.\nFor example, if we want to browse the BBC website, we could talk directly to a server in the United Kingdom. While the Internet is perfectly capable of transferring the web page from the UK to Australia, there is an inevitable delay (perhaps a few hundred milliseconds). And nobody likes delays.\nThe experience for the user can be up to ten times quicker if a copy of the page (or elements of its content) can be held in Australia and delivered on demand.\nOf course, accessing a version of the page held in Australia would work great if you’re in Australia but not so much if you’re in, say, Los Angeles. So, to ensure fast content delivery for everyone around the world, CDNs usually work on a global scale.\nA CDN service provider will typically operate data centres around the world, holding copies of popular content in major population centres to deliver content in each region.\nThe speed of delivery of a single image or page element may not be noticeably faster coming from a CDN – the difference between 200 milliseconds and 20 milliseconds isn’t discernible to most users.\nHowever, modern websites often contain many elements, including images, videos and so on. When combined, the speed improvement through CDNs can be significant.\n\n\nA COSTLY FAILURE\nCDN services provide a valuable service to improve our web browsing experience – but at a cost.\nWhen a major CDN provider such as Fastly experiences a failure, it doesn’t affect just one website; it’s likely to impact every website they support.\nIn Tuesday’s example, sites across the world suddenly went offline as requests for the CDN-hosted content were not serviced.\nThis incident demonstrates how reliant we are on technology – and on the specific implementations of technology in our modern lives.\nIf each website we visit hosted its own content exclusively, we would not be facing these issues. However, our web browsing experience would be much slower, reminiscent of the days of dial-up modems (well, perhaps not quite that bad).\nDespite the global outage, it was resolved within about an hour. That would seem to indicate it’s unlikely to have been a security- or hacking-related issue.\nIt was more likely due to a short-term failure in Fastly’s infrastructure, or a misconfiguration that spread through its systems.\nFastly is not the only CDN provider. Other high-profile services include Akamai and Cloudflare. Outages are not uncommon, but they are usually short-lived.\nReaders can be assured (assuming you haven’t lost Internet again) that service providers are closely watching this incident to ensure lessons are learned for next time.\nAssociate Professor Paul Haskell-Dowland is the Associate Dean for Computing and Security in the School of Science at Edith Cowan University.

It is not clear what legislation in the House will look like or when it might take it up.\n\n\nThe Bill has a number of other China-related provisions including prohibiting the social media app TikTok from being downloaded on government devices, and would block the purchase of drones manufactured and sold by companies backed by the Chinese government. It would also allow diplomats and Taiwanese military to display their flag and wear their uniforms while in the United States on official businesses.\nIt would also create broad new mandatory sanctions on Chinese entities engaged in US\xa0cyberattacks or theft of US\xa0intellectual property from US\xa0firms, and provides for a review of export controls on items that could be used to support human rights abuses.\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a co-sponsor of the measure, warned of the dire consequences of not funding research to keep up with China.\n""If we do nothing, our days as the dominant superpower may be ending. We don’t mean to let those days end on our watch. We don’t mean to see America become a middling nation in this century,"" Schumer said.\nBiden praised the Bill: ""We are in a competition to win the 21st century, and the starting gun has gone off ...

      US agency not doing its job to halt tech to China's military: Congressional report
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: The US\xa0Commerce Department is failing to do its part to protect national security and keep sensitive technology out of the hands of China\'s military, according to a US\xa0congressional advisory report seen by Reuters.\nThe US-China Economic and Security Review Commission report, due to be published on Tuesday, said the Commerce Department had been slow to create a list of sensitive technology that should be scrutinised before export to China.\nThe lag in developing the list of emerging and foundational technologies, as required by a 2018 law, may exacerbate national security risks, the report said.\nThe Commerce Department, entrusted to strengthen US\xa0export control laws, ""has, to date, failed to carry out its responsibilities,"" said the report, titled, ""Unfinished Business: Export Control and Foreign Investment Reforms.""\nIn a statement, the Commerce Department declined to directly respond to the lack of a list, but noted it had published four rules on controls on emerging technologies and more are pending.\nIt also said it had expanded the military end user rule and added companies to its entity list, which restricts US\xa0suppliers from selling to companies like Huawei Technologies and Hangzhou Hikvision.\nIn 2018, Congress tightened US\xa0export policies and the process for screening foreign investment in response to efforts by Chinese entities to obtain sensitive US\xa0technology and use civilian innovation for the military.\nThe report questions whether a more-than-two-year delay in developing the list should be investigated\xa0by the Commerce Department\'s inspector general. It also asks whether the authority to enforce export controls should be delegated to another agency.\nCongress passed the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 to make it harder to export key technologies to adversaries like China.\nThe law directed the Commerce Department to work with other agencies to identify emerging, or cutting edge, technologies and so-called foundational technologies essential to making key items like semiconductors, that should be controlled.\nIn November 2018, the department published 45 examples of emerging technologies, including face and voice recognition, but no list was ever finalised. And it has yet to propose a list of foundational technologies, instead asking for input in August about how to define the category.\nThe report did note some actions by Commerce.\nThe department has proposed to regulate software for gene editing, which can make it easier to develop biological weapons, but the rule has not been finalised. It also released an interim rule on geospatial imagery involving AI neural networks.\nAdvanced surveillance technology has received some attention as well, including on export controls to promote human rights, given its use in Xinjiang for the detention of minority Muslim Uyghurs.

      Penang South Islands: Making a green mark on the global stage
  </h1>, 'text': 'Imagine a sustainable township that features car-lite options, water canals plied by eco-friendly water taxis, energy-efficient power systems and green buildings, and tech-forward company campuses lining the streets. That is the utopian vision of the Penang South Islands (PSI) project, a new urban development that encompasses work sites and homes off the coast of the Malaysian state.\n“PSI is meant to be an Internet of Things (IOT)-enabled smart city to complement George Town – one that’s modelled on sustainable and green living, incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, with the aim of creating a top investment destination in the region,” said Penang Chief Minister Mr Chow Kon Yeow.\nAmong its green ambitions, PSI aims to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in CO2e emissions compared to ‘business as usual’ by 2030. This will be accomplished through various means, including a 40 per cent reduction in urban planning emissions and an 80 per cent reduction in transport emissions. For those who will work and live there, this would mean no traffic jams, reduced air pollution and a cleaner living space.\nMore than 20 per cent of the land will also be set aside for open spaces, parks, beaches and esplanades, all of which will be accessible to the public. In addition to open green spaces, canals and coastal buffers will serve as flood retention basins as part of the urban stormwater management system.\nSILICON VALLEY OF THE EAST\nPenang already enjoys a good reputation. The state is known as the Silicon Valley of the East and has the highest gross domestic product per capita among Malaysian states. It also has a youth literacy rate of 99.5 per cent as of 2014, making it a great place for MNCs to set up operations.\nGlobal technology giants such as Micron, Motorola, Intel and National Instruments are already engaged in high-value, high-tech activities present in Penang, with many situated at the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone. With its focus on sectors such as software and integrated circuit design development, as well as chip product manufacturing, PSI will make an ideal location for tech firms to expand their footprint in Penang.\nThe PSI project will see 1,820ha of space divided into three man-made islands – Island A (930ha), Island B (566ha) and Island C (324ha).\nSome 15,000 job opportunities are expected to be created once the reclamation of Island A starts. The island will be where an industrial zone called the Green Tech Park is to be built, with vacant possession ready by 2024. This 283ha development will provide a sustainable environment that will not only be a place for existing businesses to expand, but also provides a location for new businesses to establish themselves in Penang, amongst the robust ecosystem that has been in place over the past 50 years.\nThe GTP will also be accessible to residential, commercial and recreational facilities – key features to attracting and retaining talent, something that is high on the priority list of companies when considering venturing or expanding into a new location.\nIsland A will see an array of world-class tourist attractions such as botanical gardens, aquarium and underwater museum, waterfront esplanade, fishermen wharf and other exciting attractions, complementing the old-world charm of Georgetown.\nA GREEN INITIATIVE\nThe project is set to be built against a robust PSI Green Plan. Mr Chow shared that the project will be supported by sustainable master planning, smart mobility, renewable energy, super low energy (SLE) building technology, smart features, as well as efficient waste and water management.\nGamuda, the construction company in charge of the project, has benchmarked against best practices in accordance with ESG principles.\n“Embracing ESG principles will position PSI on a global stage in an environment where investors are looking at their investment’s wide-ranging impact in various ways, beyond the straightforward financial returns,” explained Mr Chow.\nTo promote green mobility, everything on PSI is designed to be within easy reach to “put bicycles and pedestrians ahead of cars”. Together with the seamless integration of public transport modes such as water taxis, e-trams and LRT, this move will help to reduce carbon emissions.\nThe planners have envisioned a wide range of incentives to coax more residents into embracing low-impact mobility. “The development is aimed to be carbon-neutral, climate-resilient and highly livable, right from the start, and this can be seen in how the masterplan and integrated transportation network are sustainably laid out on the PSI,” said Mr Chow.\nMeanwhile, power consumption on PSI will be moderated using smart grids, buildings that rely on energy-efficient cooling systems, and a host of other smart tech features that optimises cooling, ventilation, lighting, irrigation and security systems to make this built environment a low-impact one.\nPSI will also employ green building designs that embrace passive cooling through the alignment of the city grid and buildings to prevailing winds. This essentially creates a wind tunnel effect to maximise natural ventilation and reduce the dependence on air conditioning.\nFind out more about the Penang South Islands project.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Our obsession with work emails has worsened during COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': ""LONDON: Herbert A Simon, the economist who first outlined the idea of the “attention economy”, warned us years ago that too much\xa0information muddled our brains. Instead of listening, we bought iPhones.\nI can draw a neat line between the phenomenal financial results of US tech companies during the pandemic and my own deteriorating attention\xa0span.\nLockdown has accelerated every bad habit. Reflexively scanning WhatsApp, Slack, Twitter, Instagram, emails\xa0and texts is now a near-constant activity.\nThat includes work messages. The slight anxiety of not knowing what’s in your inbox can feel more stressful than quickly checking it the second you wake up.\n\n\nWhen I asked around to make sure it wasn’t just me, colleagues and friends with email-centric jobs said the same thing. The tiny minority who declared that they did not look at their emails out of hours turned out to be in contact with their offices by WhatsApp instead.\nThat may have made sense at the panicky height of the pandemic\xa0when many of us were adjusting to remote work. Now that offices are reopening, perhaps there is a way to moderate constant, unnecessary contact.\nRIGHT TO DISCONNECT\nIreland’s solution is a new “right to disconnect” that means employees shouldn’t routinely have to work outside normal hours, including responding to emails.\nThe code, published by the country’s Workplace Relations Commission, also includes the “duty to respect another person’s right to disconnect” — for example, by not sending emails outside work hours.\nOther countries are discussing similar ideas. The UK union Prospect, which represents engineers and tech workers, wants companies to be legally required to negotiate rules on when they can contact staff for work purposes.\n\n\nYet even if governments set policies that prevent employers from demanding constant email replies, it will be difficult to force employees to stop checking their messages.\nSocial media is designed\xa0to be addictive. Email is too.\nThe unpredictability of not knowing whether there is something new to see keeps us coming back again and again. When there is something, it offers a teeny dopamine hit, no matter how inconsequential the message.\nMAIL ON HOLIDAY\nThere was a moment a few years ago when the war against constant emails seemed to hang in the balance. In 2014, car company Daimler generated reams of positive press by creating a system that automatically deleted emails while employees were on holiday.\nThe system, Mail on Holiday, is still in place. Emails sent while workers are away are deleted and the sender receives a reply offering an alternative contact for urgent requests. This means that employees cannot check their emails while out of the office and do\xa0not return to thousands of unread messages.\n\n\nThe bad news is that Mail on Holiday is not a system that slots into place as soon as someone switches off their computer and waves goodbye. Employees have to opt in. The company says that the number of participating employees is not measured, but I bet a fair few Daimler employees do not turn it on at all.\nMost of the corporate world has kept suspiciously quiet on the subject.\nThere appears to be an unspoken agreement that companies will not officially request that employees answer emails at all hours — but they also know workers are likely to be checking. What this means, of course, is that working hours can extend in some form into every waking moment.\nTHE BATTLE FOR ATTENTION\nAttention is a scarce and precious resource. Tech companies know this; that’s why they employ all sorts of tricks to keep you focused on their products.\nAllowing attention to be leached away by non-urgent work emails, even if there is no requirement to reply, feels instinctively unhealthy. If augmented reality wearables start beaming messages straight into our eyes, then the fight will be truly lost.\nThere is one answer — though it is less dramatic than automatically deleting emails or creating new laws for digital disconnection.\nThe return to office life is a good moment to introduce more structure to our days. Instead of firing off messages late into the night, scheduling emails to arrive within working hours is a simple, sane solution.\nNot only is it less stressful for the recipient, but it also means messages are less likely to be read and forgotten.\nReducing the number of emails that arrive out of hours is more polite, too. In the battle for attention, we should try fighting on the same side.\nListen to\xa0EngageRocket CEO Leong Chee Tung and HR strategist Adrian Tan\xa0debate the merits of returning to the office on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     technology ', '     social media ']}"

      Always busy and can't get organised? Here's how to maximise your phone's free apps
  </h1>, 'text': 'Getting organized is serious business, judging by the number of checklist and chore-tracker programs available. If you are new to mobile task manager software, Apple and Google have their own free apps that combine the convenience of a notes app with the ability to set notification alerts to make sure things get done on time.\nApple’s Reminders app runs on its iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, Apple Watches, Mac computers and iCloud.com. The Google Tasks app for Android and iOS is also integrated into Gmail and Google Calendar.\nHere are the basics for both apps.\nAdd a Task\nTo get started on your iPhone, open the Reminders app, tap New Reminder in the screen’s bottom-left corner and enter a task. The toolbar below supplies shortcuts for assigning a notification date; you can set a specific time and a repeated schedule. You can choose a specific location to be notified (say, near your supermarket), flag the reminder to emphasize it or insert an image to it to add visual information.\nTo get started with Google Tasks on the phone, download it from the app store if it is not already installed. Open the Google Tasks app and tap the large + button at the bottom of the screen. Type in what you need to do. You can add more information by tapping the Details icon or set a timed reminder by selecting the Calendar icon. Tap the Save button.\nYou can also add a reminder to your schedule by commanding Apple’s Siri or the Google Assistant to create it for you. (Samsung’s Bixby assistant can similarly wrangle reminders on Galaxy phones.)\nAnd when you finish a task, tap the circle next to it to mark it “Done”.\nCreate Lists\nWant to corral several related reminders in one place? Just group the tasks on a list. In Apple’s Reminders, tap Add List in the screen’s bottom-right corner. Name the list, assign it a colour, give it an icon – and then assign specific reminders to it. The main Reminders screen will show all your lists in progress, including automatically generated lists for scheduled, flagged and current tasks.\nIn the Google Tasks app, tap the Menu icon in the screen’s bottom-left corner and select “+ Create new list.” Enter a name, tap the Done button in the upper-right corner and add tasks by tapping the + button at the bottom of the screen. To switch between lists, tap the Menu button and select the list you need.\nOrganize Tasks\nTo reorder items in Apple Reminders, press down on a task and drag it to a new position on the list. To move an entry to a different list, swipe to the left on the item and tap the Details button. On the Details screen, go to List, tap it and choose another list.\nTo make an entry a subtask of another – like listing various kitchen gear to buy under your main “Buy New Appliances” task – swipe to the right next to an item and select Indent to make that entry a subtask of the one above it; you can also press and drag a task on top of another to make it a subtask.\nTo reorder items in Google Tasks, select an entry, then press down and drag it to a new position. To sort by date, tap the three-dot More menu in the bottom-right corner, tap Sort By and choose Date.\nTo move a task to a new list, tap it and use the drop-down menu on the next screen to select a different list; you also have options here for adding more details about the task, assigning a date and time or adding a subtask.\nShare Tasks\nAny tasks added to the Family list in Apple Reminders are automatically pushed out to people in your iCloud-connected Family Sharing group. You can share lists with others via email, message, Slack or other apps, too, which can be helpful for project planning. Select a list, tap the More menu in the upper-right corner, choose Share List and pick your sharing method. Once you share a list, you can assign specific tasks by tapping the Assignment button and selecting someone from the group. Users on a shared list can add, delete and mark off items – and everyone is updated.\nGoogle Tasks does not offer a dynamic sharing feature, but if you are a Gmail/Google Calendar user, you can see and share tasks from there. And you can easily create a task from an open message in the Gmail app by choosing Add to Tasks from the More menu. As with Apple’s Reminders app and iCloud accounts, your tasks show up in all the devices connected to your Google account so you are always up to date.\nBy J.D.

      Global travel may be restricted, but you can still journey in luxury with the Range Rover family
  </h1>, 'text': ""Some follow the rules while others break them. But, leaders – they set the rules. That is one lesson embodied by the Range Rover family, a series of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) that has become synonymous with luxury, refinement and incredible capability both on and off the road.\nThe original Range Rover was created more than 50 years ago to meet a very specific need – allowing landowners to travel at speed, while being cosseted in luxury, across any terrain.\xa0\nIt has racked up numerous technical milestones: At launch, it was the first SUV to feature a permanent 4WD system; in 1989 it became the world's first 4x4 vehicle to be fitted with an anti-lock braking system; in 1992 it was the first 4x4 vehicle with electronic traction control and automatic electronic air suspension.\nThe car’s technical prowess laid the foundation for other feats that appealed to the innate human need to push boundaries and venture into the unknown.\nHow far into the unknown? In 1972, a British Army team drove two Range Rovers crossed the Darien Gap, a stretch of wild forest in Panama so dense that no road network has been built there, even today.\nThe Range Rover family has continued pushing limits. In 2016 for instance, a Range Rover Sport took on the\xa0Inferno Challenge course – the oldest surviving downhill ski race in the world.\nIn 2018, a Range Rover Sport PHEV took on the Dragon Challenge, racing up the 11.3km Tianmen Mountain Road (with its 99 hairpin bends) in China. It was then driven up a 999-step path with a 45-degree gradient leading to Heaven’s Gate, the rock formation at its summit.\nThat stylish-yet-powerful DNA is also evident in the Range Rover Evoque’s chic-yet-muscular styling. Introduced in 2011, its coupe-like profile paired with a luxurious cabin provides a chic, contemporary taste of Range Rover ownership.\nThe most recent addition to the family, the Range Rover Velar helps to round out the range. It provides the groundbreaking, avant-garde face of SUV luxury, crafted for drivers with a discerning eye.\nWith a family of models built on the Range Rover’s unique DNA, it’s now possible to travel anywhere and everywhere in refined comfort.\nRANGE ROVER VELAR\nAn elegant and capable mid-sized SUV, the Range Rover Velar eschews boxy lines and overt ruggedness in favour of a sleek form and smooth shape. Design-wise, the attention to detail here is second-to-none; the door handles sit flush against the body to maintain its visual purity, for example.\nThe clean design is also expressed within the minimalist cabin, where high-quality materials, high-tech displays and an ultra-clean aesthetic create a haven from the rigours of modern life.\nThat much is true of the Range Rover Velar when it’s on the move as well. The Adaptive Dynamics system monitors body position 100 times a second and wheel position five times as quickly to create a soothing ride.\nThe Touch Pro Duo Infotainment System, with a gorgeous 12.3-inch Interactive Driver Display, works with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for seamless integration with your digital life. All the better to enjoy the audiophile sound system by Meridian – known for delivering immersive.\nRANGE ROVER SPORT\nEvery family has its athlete, and the Range Rover Sport embodies the dynamic and sporty side of the Range Rover lineup.\nIts dynamic personality comes through at a glance, thanks to sporty styling cues such as a broad, well-planted stance, slim front grille and the focused Matrix LED headlamps with their distinctive Daytime Running Lights.\nThe Range Rover Sport also has a stylish interior with the Touch Pro Duo infotainment system, which is CarPlay- and Android Auto-enabled. But the real source of entertainment is its engine. The twin-charged Ingenium 3.0L is a 400PS, six-cylinder masterpiece that propels the Range Rover Sport to 100kmh in only 5.9 seconds.\nIt's also efficient, thanks to Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology that captures rolling energy, storing it in a compact battery so it can be used to give the engine a boost.\nA key element of the Range Rover Sport’s dynamism is the Electronic Air Suspension that keeps it impeccably controlled at all times, and enables it to be agile yet comfortable. The system is perfectly tuned for an aluminium body that gives the Range Rover Sport strength and lightness. It all adds up to an SUV whose off-road capability and on-road sportiness are well known in the motoring world.\nIf the Range Rover Sport’s performance isn’t scintillating enough, the Range Rover Sport SVR takes performance and luxury to new heights, thanks in part to a 5-litre supercharged V8 engine, that gives it a 0-100kmh time of 4.5 seconds.\nRANGE ROVER\nThe Range Rover embodies comfort and luxury, with its iconic design the culmination of over 50 years of evolution.\nThe floating roof, continuous waistline and clamshell bonnet ensure its silhouette is recognised around the world, and its exterior beauty is paired with an interior that combines craftsmanship with the finest materials. In fact, every aspect of the cabin has been designed and engineered to deliver class-leading comfort for every occupant.\nIts wider seats have deeper cushioning and soft foam interlayers to provide sumptuous support, and are upholstered in semi-aniline leather, just one of the many premium materials chosen for the cabin.\nThe Touch Pro Duo system and Interactive Driver Display create an uncluttered console that pleases the eye. That is also achieved by the enhanced 10-colour Configurable Ambient Lighting system that adds a sense of calm within the interior.\nThe optional Executive Class rear seats recline and come with a footrest. But the driver is just as pampered, with a commanding view of the road ahead and a powerful six-cylinder engine underfoot for effortless performance.\nBut what if you want the ultimate expression of Land Rover’s vision of luxury? The Range Rover SVAutobiography represents the marque’s most luxurious specification to date, painstakingly crafted for discerning owners.\nThis fine attention to detail extends to the innovative Pixel headlights, which have 142 separate LEDs. They not only project precise beams, but also give the Range Rover an unmistakable presence and lighting signature.\nAs eye-catching as the new lamps are, they also symbolise an established truth of the motoring world: The Range Rover has always lit the path ahead for luxury SUVs and looks set to continue doing so.\nFind out more about how automotive luxury meets go-anywhere ruggedness, or visit the Land Rover Singapore Showroom at 45 Leng Kee Road, Singapore 159103, Tel: 6378 2626 / 2627.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     technology ', '     design ']}"

      Commentary: Self-driving buses and delivery robots welcomed but who do we blame if AI goes rogue in Singapore?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Earlier this year, Luda Lee, an AI (artificial intelligence)-powered chatbot, went “rogue”.\nCreated by Korean start-up Scatter Lab, Luda was designed to chat naturally with South Korean Facebook users (attracting more than 750,000 over just 20 days), and to improve based on user data.\nSoon after however, Luda Lee began making bigoted and offensive comments against women, minorities, foreigners and people with disabilities.\nShe even randomly shared the personal data of its users. Her creators apologised but now face lawsuits over the data leaks.\nWhile some consider this a relatively innocuous example, there are cases where more serious harms were caused by AI-made decisions.\nIn one high-profile example in 2018, a pedestrian was hit and killed by a self-driving Uber car whose sensors had failed to “see” and avoid her.\nConcerns over algorithmic high-frequency trading triggering widespread financial market crashes, such as the flash crash of 2010, have also been raised.\nThese come as Singapore is ramping up its use of AI in all areas of life. In November 2019, the Government announced its National AI Strategy, which spells out plans to deepen Singapore’s use of AI to transform our economy and society.\nJust this year, commuters could begin taking driverless buses at the Singapore Science Park and on Jurong Island, while on-demand delivery robots are being trialled in Punggol. Even robot dogs have been patrolling Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to ensure safe distancing among park-goers.\nWhile extensive pre-trials would have been conducted, alongside safety precautions taken during their roll-out, Moore’s Law dictates that we ask: In the unlikely event that serious harms, whether physical, emotional or financial occur, on whom (or what) does legal “blame” lie, and on what basis?\nFINDING THE SMOKING GUN\nThese questions were the focus of a recent law reform report published by the Singapore Academy of Law’s Law Reform Committee, as part of a series looking at the impact of robotics and AI on the law.\nAs this report notes, these questions sometimes have relatively straightforward answers. For instance, if a malicious individual deliberately programmes a delivery robot to break into someone’s house, or disrupts the signals to a driverless bus, causing it to veer off the road and crash, most would agree that individual should be held liable.\nIn addition, if somebody sustains serious injury or dies from the individual’s deliberate actions, some form of criminal punishment would not seem unfair. Indeed, criminal laws already exist to deal with such issues.\nSave for some tweaks, present laws could still tackle cases of intentional harm, even in an AI-powered world.\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN NO HUMAN INTENDED THE HARM?\nThings get trickier, however, in situations where a human did not intend the harm that arose. This is particularly so as AI systems become more autonomous, and humans’ roles in their operation and supervision diminish.\nAlready, driverless vehicles present such a conundrum today, given that they operate at speeds that may not leave users time to take control and prevent the harm. What then?\nAn instinctive response might be to say the entities responsible for the system should be punished. But which entities? There are usually multiple parties involved in the development and deployment of AI systems.\nShould the liable party be the one that built the system; programmed the system’s code; trained the system; put it on the market, or deployed the system?\nPutting aside challenges of identifying harmful intent, it can be tricky to pinpoint the blameworthy party in this chain. Pinning criminal liability on all of them would also likely have a counterproductive effect of discouraging innovation – the legal equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.\nThis same challenge besets the use of criminal negligence laws in situations where an offender (an individual or company) carelessly causes harm, even though no harm was intended.\nDoes this mean that serious harms could be inflicted by robots and AI systems, with no one being held criminally liable?\nSome take this view, preferring the use of regulatory penalties such as censures, improvement notices and fines to promote the safe and responsible use of AI systems. The argument goes that threatening criminal liability on those who create AI systems for harms they didn’t foresee deters the development of new, potentially game-changing technologies.\xa0\nOthers counter some cases of harm are so serious that criminal laws are needed to ensure that someone or something is held accountable for the damage done, to reflect society’s abhorrence at such harmful conduct and to set a strong deterrent.\nThese questions and trade-offs are matters that policymakers and society need to deeply consider.\nWEIGHING THE ALTERNATIVES\nOne possible approach could be to impose specific duties on designated entities to take all reasonable measures necessary, to ensure the AI system’s safety.\nThese entities would risk criminal penalties if they fail, much as worksite operators are required to ensure the safety of workers on those sites.\nAnother more radical solution could be to impose criminal liability on and “punish” the AI system itself, particularly with highly-advanced autonomous systems. After all, is it not the system that took the “decision” to act in a harmful way?\nThis approach is not unheard of: The European Parliament has suggested it be considered further, and even Saudi Arabia has recognised the robot Sophia as the world’s first “robot citizen” just a few years ago.\nHowever, such a solution does appear impractical in today’s legal systems, which are shaped primarily to regulate human behaviour, as well as at the present state of technology. After all, what purpose would it serve today if a driverless bus in Jurong Island or a delivery robot in Punggol were charged, convicted and sentenced to prison, fined, or even put to “death”?\nBut as AI systems become more and more sophisticated, these questions are no longer the preserve of science fiction.\nA silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution is unlikely. Different technologies and different contexts will likely require different approaches to whether, how and against whom to apply criminal law.\nPolicy and ethical balances will need to be struck. Whether from a legal, policy or broader societal perspective, these are not issues for tomorrow – but today.\nJosh Lee Kok Thong is a member of the Singapore Academy of Law’s Law Reform Committee’s Subcommittee on Robotics and AI. He is also the co-founder of LawTech.Asia and the founding chairperson of the Asia-Pacific Legal Innovation and Technology Association.

      How investing in tech-savvy millennials can pay off
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Over the past year, German audio firm Sennheiser has gone big on digital marketing.\nBe it advertisements on social media or engaging influencers to talk about its gadgets, online campaigns have become a staple in reaching a key market - the millennials.\nThis is the generation born between 1980 and 1999. Also called Generation Y, the group covers more than 2.3 billion people globally, making millennials the world\'s largest demographic cohort.\nBorn in the years separating the analog and digital era, many millennials are digital natives.\nThis is something that companies such as Sennheiser hope to tap on.\n""For the millennials, connectivity is a key essential of their daily life ... They are born into this generation of streaming, live streaming, social media, online platforms,"" said Mr Alex Lim, head of marketing at Sennheiser Asia.\n\nSennheiser is building brand awareness and product knowledge via videos and blogs to drive millennial spending. The company has increased its marketing budget for such platforms by between 20 and 30 per cent.\nSo far, the firm’s innovations on design, battery life and wireless technology have been a hit for this age group.\nMr Lim said: “At least five to eight hours a day, they will be constantly plugged in. They go online and they will find out exactly which are the products that suit them, suit their lifestyle. Millennials nowadays have a very strong financial capability as well. \xa0They know what to spend on, they know what is the right amount of money to be spent on very good quality products.”\nThe spending power of this generation is shaping business landscapes around the world.\nBy 2025, it is estimated that 75 per cent of the global workforce will be represented by millennials, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\nAs their earning power increases, their spending will rise by more than 15 per cent in the next five years.\n“It’s become the most powerful consumer force on the planet,"" said Mr David Guo, executive director, Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n""Whether you’re a corporate or an investor who’s focused on future growth, we think it certainly makes a lot of sense to align with millennials rather than some of the other generations,” he added.\nIn the past five years, Goldman Sachs Asset Management has formulated a portfolio strategy that draws inspiration from the lifestyle and spending patterns of millennials.\n\nAccording to Mr Guo, companies that are aligning their earnings with millennials have seen better growth and outperformed their peers.\n“We try to understand not just how these businesses will look like in the next one to two years, but really over the medium- to long-term, over the next five, six years. How large will that market be? What percentage of market share can that business have and what valuation should those businesses be trading?”\nAs of end-January, the Goldman Sachs Global Millennials Equity Portfolio had total fund assets of US$1.7 billion.\nThe fund’s annualised five-year net return stood at above 22 per cent.\nAmazon, Alphabet and Facebook are among the fund’s top 10 holdings, accounting for more than 35 per cent of the total portfolio.\n“It’s a demographic strategy. It’s not a sectorial strategy, so that means that we have the flexibility to invest across sectors and themes in search for the best growth at the best prices at any point in time,"" said Mr Guo.\n""At the same time, this theme will evolve as millennials progress through different stages of their lives and have different demands for different types of products. In the US alone, millennials are expected to inherit over US$68 trillion in wealth by 2030,” he added.\nIn the next 15 years, this could translate to millennial spend growing from US$1.2 trillion to US$2.1 trillion, according to Swiss financial services firm Pictet.\n\nUnderstanding the behaviour and social media habits of this age group will be crucial for firms wanting to cash in on the millennial effect.\n""The majority of millennials are now on Instagram. And because of that, they aspire to be a lot like the people that they follow,"" said Ms Althea Lim, group CEO and co-founder of Gushcloud International.\nGushcloud is a technology-driven digital talent and media company that provides influencer-driven solutions for companies.\nThe agency represents 250 influencers globally and works with brands in their digital campaigns.\nIt estimates that users in Singapore spend between 40 to 120 minutes on Instagram. In Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, usage ranges between 60 and 180 minutes a day.\nFrom just 2 per cent of annual budget in the past, firms now allocate between 7 and 10 per cent spend on influencer marketing, said Ms Lim.\nThis trend is likely to continue.\n\n“Brands will also become more strategic and more intelligent in the way that they choose their influencers to work with. When an influencer is on a social media platform, most of their audiences are now young millennials, if not Gen Z. We do think that live commerce and social commerce with influencers will be quite the way forward in the next decade,” she said.\nTo help retailers tap into the Asian millennial segment, fintech firms such as hoolah have come up with solutions such as instalment payment services.\nHoolah started in Singapore in 2018, and is available in more than 2,800 stores in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia.\nGeneral Manager Sean Tan explains how it works: “We allow consumers to buy upfront, have one payment and then have the rest of the payments split over a pre-defined period of time at no extra cost. There\'s no interest, no hidden fees, no transaction costs. On the merchant front, what we actually do for them is actually drive their business volume. We bring in new market segments that potentially they couldn\'t tap into.”\nOver the past year, the platform has seen tremendous growth in user base, transaction volumes and topline sales.\n“Our customers have seen a 20 to 40 per cent increase in their transactional volume, and also their cart sizes. If you look at millennials, we have seen a trend of them moving away from traditional credit financing to actually debit financing. They really want transparency and want to be in control both of their personal finances and also how they are spending,” said Mr Tan.\nHoolah said popular segments for millennials have shifted amid the pandemic. From fashion and fast moving consumer goods, they are now more into skincare, home decor, home electronics and sportswear.\nBut beyond the changing preferences, the spillover effect of millennial behaviours into other age groups will be important for businesses, industry insiders said.\n“The younger generation below the millennials exhibit a lot of the same behaviours as millennials, whether that’s the use of social media, gaming or how much they care about the environment,"" said Mr Guo.\n""So it really just demonstrates the power, the effect that they’ve had on the world, not only from a lifestyle perspective, but also economically just given how many different unique behaviours and technologies they’ve catalysed,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Money Mind ']}"

      New Mercedes-Benz S-Class ups the luxury stakes, driven by innovation
  </h1>, 'text': 'The S-Class is renowned for innovation, especially in the area of safety. For instance, the W116 generation, which was manufactured from 1972 to 1980, became the first mass-production car to offer anti-lock brakes in 1978.\nOther S-Class innovations include protective airbags (W126) and ESP Electronic Stability Program (W140). The W220 was produced from 1998 to 2005 and introduced innovations like the DISTRONIC proximity-controlled cruise control system the COMAND control and display system. In 1999, it introduced Active Body Control and the PRE-SAFE preventive occupant protection system in 2002.\nBut like every S-Class before it, the new Mercedes-Benz flagship brings something new to the table. Occupants can experience automotive luxury with all their senses – sight, touch, sound and smell – while benefitting from numerous innovations in the areas of driver assistance, protection and interaction.\nTHE S-CLASS, MADE MORE INTUITIVE\nThe S 450 L 4MATIC, the first new S-Class model to reach our shores, introduces the second-generation MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) system.\nMBUX is more than a way to control the many functions in an S-Class.\nVoice control works in tandem with touch controls on a bright new 12.8-inch central OLED display. Overhead cameras enable a new feature: MBUX Interior Assist. This uses machine learning to anticipate occupants’ needs and respond to hand and natural body movements.\nFor example, if the driver reaches over to an unoccupied front passenger seat in the dark, the new S-Class interprets this to mean that the driver might be looking for an item, and switches on an interior light automatically. Withdrawing the hand switches the light off again.\nAdjusting a wing mirror? By watching your head movements, the S-Class knows whether to select the left or right mirror for adjustment.\nEye-tracking cameras enable a new 3D driver display for the first time. At the touch of a button, the new assistance display generates a spatial 3D view of the car’s surroundings showing information like lane markings and other road users — minus those awkward 3D glasses.\nThe same system also enables “microsleep warning” by recognising signs of fatigue and severe inattentiveness. It then issues visual and audible warnings to help maintain driver alertness.\nSAFETY AND COMFORT, ELEVATED\nThe S-Class has always put occupant safety and comfort front and centre of its engineering, and the new model is no different.\nIt features the world’s first rear airbags, which help to reduce the load on the head and neck of rear passengers in a heavy frontal impact. And because clear visibility and safe driving are intertwined, it is now equipped with DIGITAL LIGHT – new high-resolution headlamps with 2.6 million pixels that adapt to other road users and surroundings – that provides the most precise illumination possible.\nAs before, the ENERGISING COMFORT programmes for front and rear occupants combine lighting, music, fragrance and massage chair settings for the ultimate in mood enhancement. On a sweltering day, for example, the Freshness programme delivers a short blast of cold air, engages the seat ventilation and activates a soothing massage while the cabin lighting switches to a cooling green-blue and the ioniser fills the cabin with refreshing clean air.\nThe massage function integrates the car’s Burmester 4D sound system. This includes structure-borne sound converters – which Burmester calls Exciters – integrated in the seat. This makes it possible for occupants to feel musical rhythms through their entire body, contributing to a soothing experience.\nInterior lighting has also been taken up by another notch – the car’s optional active ambient lighting feature adds another layer of light which is integrated into the driving assistance systems to reinforce alerts visually.\nClearly, the whole point of being in the new S-Class is to travel in comfort, not merely to travel.\nDRIVING WITH GUARDIAN ANGELS ON BOARD\nOne sure way to reduce stress is to prevent it in the first place. That’s why the S-Class has been engineered to be easy to drive, especially for a car its size. One example: Rear-axle steering provides up to 10 degrees of movement to make the S-Class more agile, especially in tight city traffic.\nActive Parking Assist with PARKTRONIC, in conjunction with a 360-degree camera, offers an expanded side view and is now able to slot itself smoothly into marked areas as well as parallel and end-on parking spaces.\nIn fact, reducing the driver’s workload to make things safer and more pleasant is something that seems to be a new S-Class specialty. That’s largely because its cameras and many sensors constantly monitor traffic conditions to keep an eye out for danger.\nFor example, the Active Blind Spot Assist system now looks out for obstructions so it can warn occupants before they exit the car. Evasive Steering Assist helps the driver take evasive action if the S-Class detects pedestrians in front of the car, after the driver initiates avoiding action.\nIts new steering wheel with capacitive hands-off detection works with the Driving Assistance package and has slick Touch Control buttons. Sensors detect whether the driver’s hands are actually holding the wheel, so it can engage driver-assist and safety systems if needed.\nThe PRE-SAFE Impulse Side system offers an added layer of protection. If it detects a potential side impact, air chambers in the side bolsters of the front seat backrest are inflated to offer the driver or front passenger additional protection.\nThese are just some of the abilities that can make it seem as if there are guardian angels onboard the new S-Class, watching for danger so they can alert you or even swoop in with an unseen, helping hand.\nOf course, it’s purely technological assistance that the new S-Class offers, no matter how otherworldly the rest of the car seems in its ability to pamper occupants.\nCombine that dedication to safety with comfort, outstanding agility and timeless elegance, and the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class makes one thing clear: One of the best cars in the world has just gotten better.\nFind out more about how the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class’ innovations protect drivers and passengers even as it cossets them in greater luxury.\nFor sales enquiries, please call Cycle & Carriage at 6298 1818 or visit the Mercedes-Benz Center for a test drive today.\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     technology ']}"

      US spy chiefs warn of 'unparalleled' China threat in return to Congress
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON: US\xa0spy agency leaders warned on Wednesday (Apr 14) of the ""unparalleled threat"" posed by China, citing Beijing\'s regional aggression, cyber capabilities and economic clout as they testified at a public congressional ""Worldwide Threats"" hearing for the first time in more than two years.\n""China increasingly is a near-peer competitor challenging the United States in multiple arenas, while pushing to revise global norms in ways that favour the authoritarian Chinese system,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n""(China) also has substantial cyber capabilities that if deployed, at a minimum, can cause localised, temporary disruptions to critical infrastructure inside the United States,"" Haines said.\nHaines\' opening statement also cited Russian efforts to undermine US influence, Iran\'s contribution to instability in the Middle East, global terrorism and potential North Korean efforts to ""drive wedges"" between Washington and its allies as significant threats.\nThe appearance by Haines and the other intelligence agency directors was the first public ""Worldwide Threats"" hearing on global threats to the United States since January 2019. They were not held during the last two years of the administration of former President Donald Trump, who often clashed with the nation\'s security agencies.\nDemocratic Senator Mark Warner, the committee\'s chairman, said he had been ""dismayed"" that there had been no hearing last year. The panel\'s top Republican, Senator Marco Rubio, also cited the importance of the hearing.\nWarner noted the effort Beijing had put into making the Chinese technology firm Huawei a leader of advanced 5G systems, and said he was concerned it might make similar efforts in other emerging technologies.\nNoting the dangers of international computer hacking like the recent SolarWinds attack, Warner said: ""We may also want to develop new international norms where certain types of attacks are prohibited, just as the use of chemical or bio-weapons is banned.""\n""Today\'s technology environment allows adversaries to wreak havoc,\' Rubio said.\nCentral Intelligence Agency Director William Burns, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director General Paul Nakasone and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lieutenant General Scott Berrier also testified.\nThe hearing took place a day after US intelligence agencies released a sweeping report on global threats. Disease, the rich-poor gap, climate change and conflicts within and among nations will pose greater challenges in coming decades, with the COVID-19 pandemic already worsening some of those problems, the report by the National Intelligence Council said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     United States ', '     China ', '     technology ']}"

      Japan's Toshiba president steps down amid acquisition talks
  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO: The president of Toshiba\xa0stepped down on Wednesday (Apr 14), a week after the the Japanese technology and manufacturing conglomerate said it was studying an acquisition proposal from a global fund where he previously worked.\nNobuaki Kurumatani tendered his resignation at a board meeting, and the board accepted, effective Wednesday, Tokyo-based Toshiba said in a statement.\nKurumatani headed the Japan operations of CVC Capital Partners, which proposed the acquisition last week, before taking his post as chief executive of Toshiba in 2018.\nSome questions had been raised, both within and outside the Tokyo-based company, about Kurumatani leading the board discussions on the acquisition.\nThe CVC deal is estimated to be worth 2 trillion yen (US$18 billion) and will turn Toshiba private. Toshiba said it was giving it “careful consideration"".\nTrading in the company’s shares was suspended when the news hit last week. Shares of Toshiba, whose sprawling business includes making elevators and railways, shot up on the CVC news, and have been trading at nearly 5,000 yen (US$46).\nCVC is a European private equity firm, based in Luxembourg, which has committed nearly US$162 billion in funds, managing more than 300 investors. It has declined to comment on the acquisition proposal or the president’s resignation.\nBut speculation has been growing other funds may offer better prices.\nKurumatani will be replaced as chief executive and president by his predecessor, Satoshi Tsunakawa, who remains on the board, first as COO and currently chairman, Toshiba said.\nTsunakawa oversaw some of the recent financial challenges at Toshiba. Before becoming CEO, in his previous stint from 2016, he had headed Toshiba\'s medical systems business, now a group company of Japanese camera and equipment maker Canon.\nToshiba, founded in 1875, was long revered as one of Japan’s respected brands, developing the nation’s first radar and microwaves, electric rice cookers and laptop computers.\nIt also invented flash memory, the ubiquitous computer chips that store and retain data for digital cameras, cell phones and other gadgets. Toshiba no longer makes laptops, and it has sold its computer chips division.\nThe company\'s fortunes began to crumble over its heavy investment in nuclear power. After the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, costs of the business ballooned because of growing safety concerns. Some nations are turning toward sustainable energy.\nToshiba also had massive losses from the nuclear power operations of US manufacturer Westinghouse, which Toshiba acquired in 2006 and which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017.\nIn Japan, Toshiba is decommissioning nuclear plants, including the one in Fukushima, where the tsunami 10 years ago set off multiple reactor meltdowns.\nIn 2015, Toshiba acknowledged it had been systematically falsifying its books since 2008, as managers tried to meet overly ambitious targets. An outside investigation found it had inflated profits and hid massive expenses.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Japan ']}"

      Dyson plans to hire 250 more engineers and scientists in Singapore over next 5 years
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: British technology firm Dyson will hire 250 more engineers and scientists in Singapore over the next five years, as it pushes deeper into areas such as robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nAnnouncing this on Wednesday (Apr 14), Dyson also said it will “shortly” move into its new global headquarters at the historic St James Power Station.\xa0\n“Here in Singapore, we are expanding in specific areas such as robots, machine learning, artificial intelligence and connectivity. And we are looking to hire experts in that field, which goes across all products,” said Dyson’s chief executive officer Roland Krueger.\nThe company will also establish a new global cybersecurity centre here.\nDyson previously said it will invest nearly S$5 billion in new technology to double its product portfolio and enter new fields “beyond the home” by 2025. The fresh investments, announced in November last year, will focus on Singapore, the United Kingdom and the Philippines.\nLOOKING FOR TECH TALENT\nDyson, founded by billionaire\xa0James Dyson\xa0and best known for its vacuum cleaners, currently employs about 1,400 people in Singapore. Nearly half are engineers and scientists.\nThe hiring of another 250 people will double its existing software and electronics engineering teams, the company said. Recruitment is already under way, based on job openings available on its website.\nSingapore has “a very good talent base” for the expertise Dyson hopes to venture deeper into, said Mr Krueger in an interview with CNA ahead of the announcement.\nBut as more companies look to expand in the same fields, Singapore, like many other markets in the world, is facing a technology talent crunch.\nAsked if Dyson finds it difficult to hire given the competition for the same talent pool, Mr Krueger replied: “We don't have the experience that you’ve just mentioned. We actually find some very, very good talent here, especially from universities.\n“We have to recognise that 26 per cent of the students in Singapore are choosing engineering or engineering-related subjects, which is great.”\nThe appliances brand has been working closely with all the local universities. For instance, it launched an engineering studio in the Nanyang Technological University in 2018 and more recently, it announced a new university research programme here to drive product development.\nCoupled with internship opportunities, all these efforts are “intended obviously to groom the next generation of engineers for Dyson”, said Mr Krueger who took on the top job at Dyson in end-March last year.\nOn whether the company has also tapped initiatives like the new Tech.Pass scheme to recruit talent from overseas, Mr Krueger said that while Dyson seeks to find the best talent globally, its efforts in Singapore are “definitely on Singaporean talent”.\nMOVE INTO NEW HEAD OFFICE\nDyson also confirmed that it will “shortly” begin to move into St James Power Station, a national monument.\nIt first announced in late-2019 that the colonial-era power station located in the Harbourfront vicinity is its top pick for a new global head office, months after shifting its head office to Singapore from Britain.\nRestoration works have been completed. Work to equip the building, which has a gross floor area of 110,000 sq ft, as its new global headquarters is under way, the company said in its press release.\nWhen ready, it will be home to Dyson’s robotics and other research laboratories, as well as other global functions such as sales, finance and administration, said Mr Krueger.\nThe company will hold on to its other premises in Singapore – an 88,000 sq ft space at the Science Park which currently serves as its main location for product development and testing, as well as an advanced manufacturing facility in Jurong that builds its patented digital motors.\nThe Singapore Technology Centre at Science Park will continue to house some of its laboratories, such as the hair science laboratories where the testing of its hair care products take place.\nBut with space being freed up when some of the laboratories move to St James Power Station, it is set to add a new Cyber Fusion Centre which will focus on research and development in frontier areas such as operational technologies and the Internet of Things.\n“As a company that's working on innovation and technology, we need to protect our IP (intellectual property) and as you know, cybersecurity is something that everybody is concerned about when you want to protect your IP,” said Mr Krueger, adding that Singapore is the “right place” to set up a cybersecurity centre given its strong intellectual property regime.\nAs for details of its new advanced manufacturing hub here, the company said it remains a “few months” away from coming to a decision.\n“The idea was that we could establish one particular hub where we can combine manufacturing and engineering to some extent, so engineers who are working on a particular product … would then also be in proximity of that factory and work together with the engineering and operation team.\n“We have announced that we are looking for a combined hub, but we have not made any concrete decision on where that will be,” said Mr Krueger.\nDyson’s sprawling new head office will be opening at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people work and define physical workplaces.\nOn whether it is also rethinking the need for physical office spaces, Mr Krueger said Dyson believes “strongly” in collaboration among all functions in the company as it holds the key to innovation.\n“I always say literally sitting around one table and finding solutions together, and that's kind of the Dyson way that we believe in. Therefore, it is necessary that we all come together in one place and work together.”\nBesides, product testing is something that cannot be done remotely, he added.\nFounder James Dyson, who is also chief engineer at his company, said: “Pioneering minds working in inspiring spaces will find technology-based solutions to big problems. We are anticipating, with great excitement, our expansion into the historic St James Power Station and I hope that this space will provide a backdrop to some great discoveries in Singapore.”\nMAKING MORE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS\nBut one thing that the pandemic has spurred change in is the company’s investments into digital marketing and e-commerce, as more consumers turn to shopping online.\nIt will “invest heavily” in these areas so as to establish a “direct” relationship with its customers.\nSaid Mr Krueger: “If you have established a relationship between the customer and the company in a direct way, that also gives you access to direct data and customer experience that will help the engineers to develop products.”\nDyson has been in Singapore for more than a decade, with the opening of its first facility at Science Park One in 2007.\nApart from the move of its corporate office, the company’s major announcements involving Singapore thus far include the unexpected plan to build its first electric car plant here. That, however, hit the brakes in October 2019 when Dyson abandoned the project as it was not commercially viable.\nAt the moment, apart from being its global head office, Singapore also serves as a hub for Dyson’s engineering, commercial, advanced manufacturing and supply chain operations.\nThis is also where its patented digital motors, which powers its cord-free vacuum cleaners and personal care machines, is made, with one such motor rolling off its manufacturing line in Jurong every 2.6 seconds.\nOn the type of innovative products that consumers can expect in the coming years and the role that Singapore plays, Mr Krueger pointed to the work going on in its robotics laboratory.\nWhen CNA visited one of these laboratories earlier this week, a vacuum robot was being tested in a real-home setting to see what it will do when it comes across different objects and home layouts. In another laboratory, the navigation systems of these vacuum robots are tested through a system of pulleys and obstacles suspended from the ceiling.\n“What we’re testing (at our robotics lab) is specifically (sensing) and software. In the future, all home appliance products will have a certain level of that (sensing), the software and the interaction between yourself as the owner and the product,” said Mr Krueger.\n“That is through connectivity, that is through apps and also through data collection that you can use to optimise the performance of your product. So, we are working in all those directions.”\nTests on existing products can also throw up other observations.\n“It's not dedicated to what you saw – a floor care robot that is cleaning the floor in your home. You can imagine that those technologies can also give benefits in other products because they measure, for example, the cleanliness of your environment,” he added.\n“With our purifiers, they can give you a data read on how clean your air is at home and these are all benefits that we believe in the future will go into other products too.”\nAnother key focus will be the commercialisation of its proprietary solid-state battery technology, a form of power storage touted as safer, longer-lasting and more energy efficient.\nSingapore is one of the markets where research on this is happening and when the company moves into the next stage of development, “there will be a larger and increased role for Singapore”, said the chief executive.\nIn its press release on Wednesday, Dyson also said it will be doubling the research team at its technology campus in the UK, which will be tasked with “creating the multiple new technologies” that will enable it to move into new fields of products.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     jobs ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Anthony Tan, the ‘unabashedly ambitious’ man behind Grab
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Two years after founding his Uber-like taxi service, Anthony Tan was already unabashedly ambitious.\xa0\n“If we get this right, we can literally go into the history books,” the Harvard Business School-educated entrepreneur proclaimed in 2014.\nSeven years later, the 39-year-old scion of one of Malaysia’s wealthiest families is poised to do exactly that.\nHis company, Grab, Southeast Asia’s most valuable start-up, is finalising the world’s biggest merger with a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company. It would value his business at about US$35 billion and list it on Nasdaq.\nThe eye-popping numbers give a sense that Tan is blazing a trail for the entire region, which is very much in character.\n“Anthony always wants to be number one. He is the guy in Seat 1A and the first one off the plane,” says a lawyer whose firm works for Grab.\nTenacious and driven, Tan also has a spiritual side: He cited Jesus Christ as one of his leadership heroes in a 2019 interview and became a “Christ centred disciple” after meeting Andy Mills at Harvard.\nThe former chief executive of Thomson Financial and Grab board member guided “me as a mentor, as a big brother in my work, in my faith in God,” Tan has said.\nOne year since the pandemic, why do users, riders and restaurants alike still have complaints about food delivery apps? A business professor and a ride-hailing app\xa0founder weigh in on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\xa0\nMAN ON A MISSION\nIndeed, Tan describes his job as a “mission” to serve Southeast Asians’ daily needs. Since 2012, his company has grown from a ride-hailing app into food and grocery delivery, insurance, payments, e-wallets and lending across eight countries in Southeast Asia, fuelled by a young, mobile population.\nThat means the company offers investors exposure to some of the world’s fastest growing economies in a fragmented and competitive market with divergent politics, currencies, regulators and consumer spending power.\nSupporters say it took someone like Tan to navigate Southeast Asia’s interlinked world of politics and business to expand the company, which was valued at US$16 billion in its last private fundraising, into the “super app” it is today.\xa0\nPre-COVID-19, he was often seen rubbing shoulders with the region’s heads of state at the World Economic Forum in Davos or visiting senior ministers in multiple Southeast Asian cities to make the case for legalising ride-hailing.\nBorn into the family behind Tan Chong Motor, one of Malaysia’s biggest auto groups, he attended the University of Chicago and Harvard to prepare for entry into the family business. But encounters with tech entrepreneurs including YouTube co-founder Steve Chen proved a powerful lure.\nHe and classmate Tan Hooi Ling came up with a plan to revamp the Malaysian taxi market that was named a runner up in Harvard’s annual new venture competition. They used the award, Anthony Tan’s savings and an investment from his mother to launch what was then called MyTeksi in June 2012.\xa0\nWhen Jixun Foo, a Beijing-based managing partner for global venture capital firm GGV, met Tan in a Starbucks in Singapore a year later he was dubious about backing the start-up.\xa0“He’s come back from Harvard, had a job lined up in the family business and a silver spoon in his mouth. I asked him what his motivation was,” Foo says.\nTan replied that his inspiration came from his grandfather being a taxi driver and then building up his own business.\nGGV backed Grab in 2014 and was followed soon after by Tiger Global, Hillhouse Capital and Japan’s SoftBank. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder, is “very supportive of Anthony”, Foo says and Tan calls the Japanese billionaire another one of his leadership heroes.\nLITTLE TIME FOR FUN\nBased in Singapore since he moved the company’s headquarters there from Kuala Lumpur in 2017, Tan can often be seen eating “cai fan” (a cheap rice dish) at Midview City, one of Singapore’s big shopping malls.\nHe is married to Chloe Tong, the daughter of the founder of Phileo Allied Bank, and they are expecting their fourth child.\nHe has little time for fun. In 2019, Tan called Hollywood movie Invictus an “inspiring” story of Nelson Mandela’s leadership – or at least its first 38 minutes. “I didn’t finish it … I don’t have time to watch movies.”\nBut he doesn’t mind. “I don’t need breaks because to me [the job] is a break,” he said.\nPeople who know Tan say tenacity and time management skills have helped him thrive. He is known to study business cases or take calls while running on a treadmill.\n“I learnt how to use a laptop on a treadmill from Anthony,” said Grab president Ming Maa, who took a pay cut to join the company in 2016.\nHis drive has fuelled one of Asia’s most prominent rivalries with Nadiem Makarim, a Harvard classmate who helped to found Indonesia’s Gojek, which also offers payments, delivery and other services.\nEach started in his home country – Gojek launched in 2010 as an app for booking motorcycle rides.\nBut the two super apps have burnt cash as they competed for Southeast Asian dominance. Shareholders encouraged them to start merger talks last year. Discussions stalled over how much control Tan would have.\nUber also found Tan a tough competitor during a fierce battle that ended in 2018. The US group sold out to Grab and quit the region.\n“Anthony is a street fighter,” says Gregory Van, a former Grab employee who now heads a Singapore-based digital wealth management platform.\nTan is likely to need those skills: Grab is coming to market just as institutional enthusiasm for SPACs is waning and short sellers are circling.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Grab ', '     technology ', '     IPO ', '     SPAC ']}"

      US sanctions Chinese computer makers in widening tech fight
  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING: China\'s government on Friday (Apr 9) criticised the Biden administration\'s curbs on access to US technology for its supercomputer developers and said sanctions ""only strengthen China\'s determination” to invent its own.\nThe sanctions announced onThursday are the latest sign President Joe Biden is sticking to the tough line taken by his predecessor Donald Trump towards Chinese tech industries seen by Washington as potential threats.\nThe step adds to conflict over the ruling Communist Party’s industrial plans, access to American technology and accusations of computer attacks and theft of business secrets.\nA foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, accused Washington of misusing phony security warnings to “maliciously suppress” Chinese industry.\n“Containment and suppression by the United States cannot stop the pace of China’s scientific and technological progress, but will only strengthen China’s determination and will to innovate independently,” Zhao said.\nZhao said Beijing would protect its companies, echoing Chinese warnings after previous US trade penalties that often are followed by no action.\nThe latest penalties block access to US technology for researchers and manufacturers the Commerce Department said build supercomputers used by the Chinese military in weapons development. They can be used to simulate nuclear explosions and the aerodynamics of high-speed or stealth aircraft and missiles.\nBiden has said he wants better relations with Beijing but has given no indication he will roll back sanctions imposed by Trump on Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei and other companies.\nThe Communist Party has responded by declaring that accelerating efforts to transform China into a self-reliant “technology power” will be this year’s top economic priority.\nChinese supercomputers have set speed records but use US-supplied processor chips and other hardware. They can support weapons development by simulating nuclear explosions and the aerodynamics of high-speed or stealth aircraft and missiles.\n“The United States has implemented a technical blockade of China in the supercomputer field for a long time, but China’s supercomputers still lead the world due to independent innovation,” Zhao said.\nThe US penalties apply to National Supercomputing Centers in the cities of Jinan, Shenzhen, Wuxi and Zhengzhou, Tianjin Phytium Information Technology, Shanghai High-Performance Integrated Circuit Design Center and Sunway Microelectronics.\nMeanwhile, American telecom regulators are in the process of stripping three Chinese phone carriers of the right to operate in the United States.\nTrump also tried to force the Chinese owner of video service TikTok to sell its US unit and issued an order barring Americans from investing in securities of companies deemed by the Pentagon to be linked to China’s military.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     US ', '     technology ']}"

      Singapore must ensure digital infrastructure is environmentally sustainable, says Desmond Lee
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As the digital economy continues to grow, it is important for Singapore to ensure that its digital infrastructure is “as environmentally sustainable as possible”, said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Tuesday (Apr 6).\nMr Lee was speaking at a virtual event held for the opening of Digital Realty’s third and largest data centre in Singapore.\xa0\nThe five-storey, 50-megawatt facility is also one of the US-based company’s most sustainable data centres in the region with a power usage effectiveness of 1.25. Digital Loyang II, or SIN12, has received the Building and Construction Authority’s Green Mark Platinum certification.\nThis is the highest certification that a data centre can attain under the local assessment scheme for data centres, said the minister, adding that the SIN12 is “over 30 per cent more energy efficient than the industry norm”.\nDigital Realty’s latest data centre was also built in a smart and resilient manner, Mr Lee added.\nFor instance, a “common data environment” was adopted during the construction process. This allowed the company’s consultants and its contractors to continue working on the building design despite pandemic-induced disruptions.\nThe new data centre also leveraged on design for manufacturing and assembly technology, with the use of pre-cast concrete and pre-fabricated mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. This enabled construction work to be moved off site and improved productivity by at least 30 per cent.\nIn addition, the pre-cast concrete components for the project were fully sourced locally.\n“Taken together, these allowed SIN12 to complete construction on time and not be as affected as many other firms by shortages in manpower and material due to COVID-19 border restrictions,” Mr Lee said.\n“Smart, resilient and sustainable buildings like SIN12 are what we are actively encouraging in Singapore in our ongoing efforts to transform our built environment sector.”\nMODERATE GROWTH OF DATA CENTRES\nThe opening comes as Singapore is mulling a more sustainable approach for the growth of data centres here.\nIn a written reply to a parliamentary question on Feb 1, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said the Government has “decided to moderate the growth” of data centres with a temporary pause on the release of state land for such purposes, as well as the development of data centres on existing state land.\nThe industry was informed of the decision in 2019 and has been consulted on ideas for a more sustainable growth, MTI added.\nData centres form an important part of the digital economy, but they are “intensive users” of water and electricity.\nMTI said the industry has seen a “rapid increase” over the last five years, with 14 data centres having a total IT capacity of 768 megawatts being approved to be constructed on industrial state land. This compared to the approval of 12 data centres with a total IT capacity of 307 megawatts in the five-year period before that.\n“We will thus need to manage the data centre ecosystem to ensure that it is environmentally sustainable, while supporting our business needs,” the ministry said in the written reply, adding that the Government is concluding its review and will share its plans with the industry “later this year”.\nAccording to previous media reports, Digital Realty announced the acquisition of the site in Loyang for SIN12 in January 2019.\nBALANCING GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY\nMr Mark Smith, Digital Realty’s managing director for Asia Pacific, said the company understands the need to balance digital growth with sustainability.\nThe company, which is one of the biggest data centre providers with 275 data centres in the world, said it has committed to the\xa0Science-Based Targets initiative, with goals that include bringing its carbon emissions in line with a 1.5-degree climate change scenario by 2030.\nIt has also issued US$5.6 billion in green bonds – the largest in the industry, according to Mr Smith.\n“This area of sustainability is something that is critical to us because quite simply, it is to our customers and increasingly, for governments where we operate. So this is something that is critically important for Digital Realty going forward,” he said.\nHowever, there are challenges.\xa0\nFor one, Singapore’s tropical climate means that 35 to 40 per cent of the energy consumed by a data centre here goes to cooling.\nLand constraints also pose “a significant constraint” to tapping renewable energy, given how “there’s only so much rooftop solar or floating PV (photovoltaic) that you can deploy in Singapore"",\xa0said Mr Smith at an online panel discussion held after the opening.\nBut the company has come up with ways to navigate these challenges.\nThis includes implementing a cooling system design in SIN12 to help minimise evaporation losses and improve water-use efficiency. It also uses turbine generators, instead of diesel engines, and a combination of uninterruptible power supply and lithium-ion batteries to facilitate sustainable management, it said.\nApart from sustainable features, the SIN12, which spans 34,000 sq m, also offers “next-generation” colocation services which allows enterprises to “scale their critical infrastructure on-demand within a connected data community with optimal proximity to carriers, networks and cloud service providers”.\nEnterprises will also be able to tap on its global data centre platform, which offers “productized solutions for network, control and data hub footprints”.\nSIN12 is located adjacently to Digital Realty’s existing data centre in Loyang, with which it is connected by diverse high-count fibre routes. Both facilities in Loyang are also interconnected with the company’s other data centre in Jurong.\nWithout specifying names, the company said its new data centre is already “substantially pre-leased” to a community of leading global cloud service providers, local and global financial services providers, as well as leading Southeast Asian firms.\nThe opening of the third data centre brings its\xa0total committed investment in Singapore to more than US$1 billion (about S$1.3 billion), it said.\n“Singapore is a well-established financial and business hub, and consistently ranks among the top data centre markets globally,” said Digital Realty’s chief executive officer William Stein.\n“Expanding our footprint in Singapore will enable us to better help our customers enhance their digital transformation efforts and scale their digital business models regionally as well as globally.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     sustainability ']}"

      NTU researchers develop smart device to harvest sunlight for underground use
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: What looks like a crystal ball in a transparent glass case could soon be used to light up underground spaces in a sustainable way.\xa0\nDrawing inspiration from the magnifying glass, several Singapore researchers have developed a smart device that can harvest\xa0daylight and transport it underground, reducing the need to rely on traditional sources such as LED bulbs.\nIt was designed and developed by a team of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) researchers, including Assistant Professor Yoo Seongwoo from the university\'s\xa0School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering as well as Dr Charu Goel, who is a principal research fellow at the NTU\'s “The Photonics Institute”.\nThe innovation was reported in scientific journal Solar Energy earlier this month.\nThe device is made from an off-the-shelf acrylic ball, a single plastic optical fibre and computer chip assisted motors.\n“In Singapore, authorities are looking at the feasibility of digging deeper underground to create new space for infrastructure, storage and utilities. Demand for round-the-clock underground lighting is therefore expected to rise in the future,” said the university in a press release on Wednesday (Mar 31).\nHOW IT WORKS\nJust like a magnifying glass, the acrylic ball acts as the solar concentrator, focusing rays of sunlight to form a sharp focus at its opposite side.\nThe focused sunlight is then collected into one end of the fibre cable, and transported to another end that is deployed underground.\nLight is then emitted via the\xa0end of the fibre cable.\nConcurrently, small motors - assisted by computer chips - automatically adjust the position of the fibre’s collecting end. This allows the device to optimise the amount of sunlight that can be received and transported as the sun moves.\xa0\nDuring rainy or overcast days, an LED bulb powered by electricity installed right next to the emitting end of the fibre cable\xa0will automatically light up. This ensures that the device can illuminate underground spaces throughout the day without interruption.\nThe device overcomes several limitations of current solar harvesting technology, said NTU.\n""In conventional solar concentrators, large, curved mirrors are moved by heavy-duty motors to align the mirror dish to the sun. The components in those systems are also exposed to environmental factors like moisture, increasing maintenance requirements,"" said the university.\n""The NTU device, however, is designed to use the round shape of the acrylic ball, ridding the system of heavy-duty motors to align with the sun, and making it compact.""\nThe prototype designed by the researchers is 50cm tall and weighs 10kg.\nTo protect the acrylic ball from environmental conditions, the researchers also built a 3mm-thick polycarbonate\xa0dome-shaped cover.\nResearchers believe the device is ideally\xa0suited to be mounted as a conventional lamp post above ground.\nThis would allow it\xa0to be used in two ways: To harvest sunlight in the day to light up underground spaces; and as a street lamp to illuminate the ground at night using electricity.\n\nA MORE EFFICIENT SOLUTION\nNTU researchers have found that the device boasts a higher luminous efficacy - the measure of how well a light source produces visible light using 1 watt of electrical power - compared with commercially available LED bulbs.\nIn experiments in a pitch-black storeroom used to simulate an underground environment, researchers found the device\'s\xa0luminous efficacy to be at 230 lumens per watt. Commercially available LED bulbs have a typical output of 90 lumens per watt.\nThe qualities of the light output of the NTU device is also “comparable” with current commercially available daylight harvesting systems that are more costly, said the university.\xa0\n“The luminous efficacy of our low-cost device proves that it is well-suited for low-level lighting applications, like car parks, lifts, and underground walkways in dense cities,” added Dr Charu.\n“It is also easily scalable. Since the light capturing capacity of the ball lens is proportional to its size, we can customise the device to a desired output optic power by replacing it with a bigger or smaller ball.”\xa0\nLighting company Technolite is exploring ways to potentially incorporate the smart device or its related concepts into industrial projects for “improved efficiency and sustainability”, revealed NTU.\nTechnolite was an industry collaborator in the research study.\n“Our innovation comprises commercially available off-the-shelf materials, making it potentially very easy to fabricate at scale. Due to space constraints in densely populated cities, we have intentionally designed the daylight harvesting system to be lightweight and compact,"" said\xa0Asst Prof Yoo.\n""This would make it convenient for our device to be incorporated into existing infrastructure in the urban environment.”\n\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     NTU ', '     Nanyang Technological University ', '     technology ']}"

      NTU scientists transform discarded durian husks into antibacterial gel bandages
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Discarded durian husks could soon have a second life – as antibacterial hydrogel bandages.\nThe bandages, created by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) scientists, were developed in line with Singapore's push towards zero waste, said\xa0Professor William Chen on Thursday (Mar 25).\nProf Chen, the director of NTU's Food Science and Technology Programme,\xa0is the scientist behind the durian husk project.\n“Twelve million durians are consumed every year. However, most of the durian fruit is discarded,” he said.\xa0\nThe husk, which comprises about 60 per cent of the durian, is usually discarded and incinerated, “posing an environmental issue”, said NTU in a media release.\nThe low-cost bandage is both biodegradable and non-toxic, which means it has a smaller environmental footprint than conventional synthetic bandages, the university said.\nMAKING THE BANDAGE\nProf Chen and his team created the bandages by extracting high-quality cellulose from the durian husks. They converted the husks into cellulose\xa0powder through slicing, freeze-drying and ball-milling, before removing impurities.\nThis is a “significant reduction” in cost compared to traditional methods of using enzymes, said Prof Chen. The traditional method costs about S$27,000 per kg, while Prof Chen’s method costs about S$120 per kg to extract the same amount of cellulose.\nAfter extracting the cellulose, researchers combined the extract with glycerol –\xa0a waste by-product from the biodiesel and soap industry –\xa0to make a soft gel. The gel, which is similar to silicon sheets, can be cut into bandages of various shapes and sizes.\xa0\nThe scientists then added organic molecules produced from baker’s yeast, making the bandages deadly to bacteria.\nThe bandages remain functional in extreme weather conditions, added Prof Chen.\nHe estimates that he can extract 200g of husk powder from a 3kg durian, of which 40g is pure cellulose. This 40g is enough to make 66 pieces of 7cm by 7cm hydrogel, which is enough material for about 1,600 plasters measuring 1cm by 2cm each.\nWHY HYDROGEL?\nThere are various applications for hydrogels, including wound dressing and wearable electronics, said Prof Chen.\xa0\nAbout 80 to 90 per cent of hydrogel\xa0is water, said Associate Professor Andrew Tan, who was invited to Thursday’s media briefing as an independent expert. He is vice dean (faculty) at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.\nIt is “well-established” in many clinical trials that hydrogel\xa0helps\xa0wounds to heal, added Assoc Prof Tan. For instance, the water keeps the wound area cool and moist, accelerating healing. Hydrogel also reduces\xa0scarring.\nWhile durians were not the only possible choice to make these bandages, Prof Chen said he chose the fruit as there was “sustainable supply” and it was high in fibre content.\nHowever, he noted that this was platform technology, and the method of extracting cellulose can be used on other materials.\nCHEAPER THAN CONVENTIONAL HYDROGEL PATCHES\nAccording to Prof Chen, conventional hydrogel patches on the market are made of synthetic materials. Those with antimicrobial properties use metallic compounds like silver or copper ions.\nThese materials make conventional hydrogel patches more costly than Prof Chen’s hydrogel, which is made from natural waste materials.\nA typical hurdle for university research to market is scalability and cost-reduction, said Prof Chen. So it was important to keep the process simple, low-cost and green, he added.\nThe durian husks are low in cost\xa0and Prof Chen’s extraction method\xa0–\xa0which uses environmentally friendly detergent – is simple, so the project could be scaled up for production, he said.\nAlthough currently just a proof of concept, if cellulose can be extracted in a sustainable\xa0and cost-effective\xa0way, then there is “great potential” for the durian husk-based hydrogel to replace current hydrogels already on the market, Prof Chen said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     science ', '     technology ', '     NTU ']}"

      Face verification can better secure ATM transactions, although new risks may emerge: Experts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Facial recognition technology being enabled at ATMs can help to speed up transactions and resolve long-standing issues such as the misuse of physical ATM cards, experts said.\nBut they also cautioned that the adoption of any new technology may come with its\xa0fair share of risks and that novel safeguards will be needed.\nOCBC, Singapore’s second-largest lender, said on Thursday (Mar 18) that it will be enabling face verification for bank transactions at its ATMs.\nThe new feature started\xa0on Thursday, allowing\xa0customers to\xa0check\xa0account balances at eight selected ATMs. It\xa0will be extended to cash withdrawals at all 550 OCBC ATMs in Singapore “progressively” from June.\nMore services, such as cash deposits, fund\xa0transfers to other banks, cash card top-ups and credit card bill payments, will be included from next year.\nOCBC said it is the first lender in Southeast Asia to introduce facial biometrics to its ATMs.\nIt added that this also means it is a step closer to eliminating a physical ATM card, which can be stolen or skimmed. The latter is the act of intercepting bank card details using a small device installed on ATMs.\nATMS NEED TO EVOLVE\nFacial recognition, which works by scanning someone’s face and matching it with a database image, is already widely used for purposes such as unlocking smartphones.\nBeing a part of verification at the ubiquitous cash dispensers is also not new, with such services being introduced\xa0by several Chinese banks from as early as 2015, according to local media reports.\nSpain’s CaixaBank has also been allowing customers to withdraw money from ATMs just by scanning their faces. It started off with 20 ATMs in early-2019 before embarking on a nationwide roll-out last June.\nSingapore is “well positioned” to have ATMs enabled with facial recognition technology due to the existence of a national biometric database and other factors, such as banks having their own risk management frameworks and strong law enforcement, said Mr Jeffrey Kok, vice-president of solution engineers for Asia Pacific and Japan at CyberArk.\nSingapore residents have also become more comfortable with biometric authentication methods, such as fingerprint and face recognition, which are emerging as “the new normal”, said Mr Kanv Pandit, group managing director\xa0for\xa0banking solutions\xa0in\xa0Asia Pacific\xa0at\xa0FIS.\n“This is unsurprising as consumers cement their preferences for a quicker, more convenient and contactless experience when it comes to banking or paying, especially during the pandemic,” he added.\nATMs\xa0must also keep up. A recent report by FIS found that cash remains one of the most popular payment methods for purchases in Singapore, accounting for more than\xa0a quarter of transactions in 2020.\nMr Pandit said: “As long as cash continues to fill consumers’ needs, ATMs remain a critical delivery channel in Singapore. While in no danger of disappearing, ATMs must evolve to address challenges such as fraud, principally, skimming.”\nBETTER SECURITY\nApart from quicker transactions, the key benefit of enabling face verification at ATMs is better security as it removes the need for a physical ATM card and\xa0PIN.\nThis reduces the likelihood of unauthorised transactions due to stolen cards or hacked PINs, experts said.\n“Biometric authentication such as fingerprint or face recognition relies on attributes of your identity that are a lot less likely to be compromised. This helps banks ensure that the authorised account holder is the one making the withdrawals,"" said Mr Pandit.\nEchoing that, Mr Kok noted that ATMs are “a great use case” for facial verification and recognition technology.\xa0\n“The technology increases usability, convenience and adopts a very modern approach to address a legacy problem,” he said, as scammers will find it harder to “copy” someone’s identity.\n“Facial verification removes many avenues of attack and improves security while also making for a better user experience for the end-user,” he added.\nNEW CONCERNS?\nThat said, new technology can bring about other risks, meaning that novel mitigation methods will be needed.\nFor one, criminals are stepping up efforts to manipulate and bypass facial recognition systems through the use of “deep fakes”, which rely on artificial intelligence to alter a person’s image, said Mr Pandit.\nThe technology on its own may not be foolproof either.\n“Studies have uncovered instances where a facial recognition system cannot accurately distinguish between similar-looking faces, such as in the case of twins or siblings,” Mr Pandit added.\nMr Kok said that all biometric technologies have “accuracy settings that impact the likelihood of false positives and false negatives”.\n“In the case for ATMs, settings would most likely be tuned to its highest accuracy which means low false positives but higher chance of false negatives.\n“This\xa0means that legitimate users will have a higher chance to fail the facial verification if there has\xa0been significant alteration to their faces, for example facial surgery,” he added.\nWhile such possibilities may impact consumer confidence, Mr Kok noted that these “should not be concerns” as banks have always taken a multi-layered approach to managing risks, such as falling back on other verification methods like mobile phone notifications and existing surveillance methods deployed at ATMs.\nBanks have also generally taken a “gradual” approach to allow more banking options enabled by new technologies as consumer confidence grows, he added.\nMr Pandit said banks can enhance security through the use of dual factor authentication, which includes one-time passwords. They can also combat fraud through alert systems such as notifying customers via SMS when a transaction has been made.\nWHAT BANKS ARE DOING\nOCBC\xa0said that it is tapping on the SingPass Face Verification technology developed by local authorities to verify customers for banking transactions at its ATMs.\nTo enable face verification at an OCBC ATM, account holders will first select their preferred ATM service before entering their NRIC number on the screen.\nThey will be prompted to position their faces within a frame on the screen. A web-enabled camera will then do a scan and verify it against the facial images and identities of 4\xa0million Singapore residents stored within the national biometric database.\nThe verification is done in real time as the bank’s ATM network is digitally linked to the database, OCBC said in its press release. Other security features are also in place to prevent fraud, such as liveness-detection technology to detect and block the use of photographs, videos, or masks during the verification process.\nOnly verified customers will be allowed to proceed with their ATM transactions.\nDBS said its customers have also been using the SingPass Face Verification feature to apply for digital bank accounts since July last year.\n“This has proven to be popular as our retail customers can apply for digibank access in less than three\xa0minutes while corporate customers can access their new corporate accounts online in about 20 minutes from the point of application,” said its Singapore country head Shee Tse Koon.\nTo date, more than 25,000 customers have used the SingPass Face Verification, with most of them using the feature to securely retrieve their digibank user credentials.\nDBS said it will continue to explore ways to expand the use of face verification and emerging technologies in its digital services and self-service machines.\nAs for UOB, there are no plans to roll out facial recognition at its ATMs at the moment.\n“Amid the prolonged pandemic, our customers’ safety is our priority. To use facial recognition at ATMs means that customers have to remove their mask in public to scan their face,” said the bank’s head of group channels and digitalisation Janet Young.\n“We will continue to study the needs and preferences of our customers to provide them with a safe, reliable and relevant banking experience always.”\nMs Young added that almost all of the bank’s ATMs are contactless at the moment.\nCustomers can make cash withdrawals without a physical ATM card by adding their bank cards to their mobile phones, and tap their devices on the ATMs before keying their PIN.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Goodbye ATM cards? OCBC to roll out face verification at ATMs
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Forgot to bring your OCBC\xa0ATM card? You will soon be able to check your bank account balances or withdraw cash\xa0by scanning your face at the bank’s ATMs.\nIn an announcement on Thursday (Mar 18), OCBC said it will be enabling face verification for bank transactions at its ATMs.\nThis roll-out of facial biometrics for ATM services will start off with account balance enquiries at eight selected ATMs from Friday.\nThey are located at:\n- OCBC Tampines Centre Two\n- Taman Jurong Shopping Centre\n- Great Eastern, Pickering Street\n- OCBC Tampines Centre One\n- HDB Hub Level 1\n- 103 Yishun Ring Road\n- OCBC Campus\n- Geylang Road 7-Eleven\nOCBC said it will extend face verification for cash withdrawals to all of its 550 ATMs in Singapore “progressively” from June.\nIt also has plans to do the same for other ATM transactions, including cash deposits, fund\xa0transfers to other banks, cash card top-ups and credit card bill payments, from next year.\nDespite the push in digital banking, OCBC said ATM usage remains high, with more than two million cash withdrawals monthly.\nAccount balance enquiries and cash withdrawals are the most popular ATM services, making up close to eight in 10 ATM transactions performed by its customers.\nFace verification will remove the need for customers to carry their ATMs cards around, and is also a “secure alternative” to physical ATM cards, the bank said in its media release.\nOCBC is tapping on the SingPass Face Verification technology developed by local authorities to verify customers for banking transactions at its ATMs.\nTo enable face verification at an OCBC ATM, account holders will first select their preferred ATM service before entering their NRIC number on the screen.\nThey will then be prompted to position their face within a frame on the screen, while a specially installed web-enabled camera will take a scan of their face.\nVerification is then done in real time against the national biometric database, which contains the facial images and identities of four million Singapore residents.\nOnce the facial scan is verified, customers will be able to proceed with their ATM transaction.\nSecurity features are also in place to prevent fraud, such as liveness-detection technology to detect and block the use of photographs, videos, or masks during the verification process, OCBC said.\nResponding to CNA’s query on whether removing one’s mask for the face verification is in line with current COVID-19 guidelines, the bank said an individual’s identity must be verified in order to perform a banking transaction securely.\n“In line with the national guidelines for mask wearing, customers may remove their masks momentarily in order for the bank to ascertain their identities, such as is done at our bank branches to verify a customer’s identity before a transaction is performed at our teller counters,” said Mr Sunny Quek, OCBC’s head of consumer financial services in Singapore.\nThis is not the bank’s first time leveraging\xa0the national digital identity infrastructure.\nIt did so last year when it allowed customers to use their SingPass to access digital banking services.\xa0\nWithin six months, more than one million logins to the bank’s digital banking platforms were performed using SingPass, in place of traditional access codes and PINs.\nIn July 2019, it also allowed customers to withdraw cash by scanning a QR code. Last year, the number of QR-code cash withdrawals rose 88 per cent from the same period a year ago.\nOverall, the bank saw growth in digital adoption among its customers last year, with more than 40 per cent more people signing up for PayNow. PayNow transactions also doubled compared to 2019.\n“Singapore consumers are keen digital adopters ... While cash is still a key mode of payment in Singapore, the digital overlay to get cash is very welcomed by consumers,” said Mr Quek.\n“With many customers already embracing QR cash withdrawals without having to use an ATM card, face verification will add a layer of convenience to more customers as they access our banking touchpoints.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Malaysia needs better EV infrastructure to avoid 'anxiety' on road trips, drivers say
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mr Koh Jie Meng has driven from Singapore to different parts of Malaysia more than 20 times in his electric Hyundai Kona SUV since he bought the car in 2019.\nHe described the journeys as “smooth and seamless” now, but he acknowledged that this was not always the case during his first few attempts at driving from his home near Yishun to Kuala Lumpur for business meetings.\n“At the start, I had some anxiety because I started driving too fast on the highways. I learnt that you have to watch your speed, travel only at 100 to 110kmh so I can get there easily,” said Mr Koh.\nHe is now more seasoned but he did learn some lessons the hard way.\nHe figured out that speeding would deplete the car’s battery life sooner and would leave him scrambling to find an electric charging point along the journey.\nHe also shared that putting the air conditioner at\xa0full blast while being stuck in traffic congestion at the Causeway would also drain the battery fast.\nMr Koh outlined that the most important factor in completing the journey safely was planning.\n“You need to know your car’s battery range. For my Kona, it is a long-range electric car so I can do a single charge run. This means I can drive straight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in one shot without the need to charge along the way,” said Mr Koh.\nDrivers like Mr Koh have learnt that driving an electric car in Malaysia can be challenging given that the country still lacks the infrastructure that supports electric vehicles usage en masse.\nThere are only around 300 electric charging points across the country, with most of them concentrated along the west coast and the Klang Valley.\nFurthermore, these drivers are also aware that there are not enough workshops or repair services specific for electric vehicles in Malaysia, in case urgent work is needed.\nHowever, they note that the situation has improved recently and there is optimism that travelling with an electric car for a road trip in Malaysia could be a more viable option in the future.\nMORE CHARGING POINTS IN KL, NORTH-SOUTH EXPRESSWAY\nMr Shahrol Halmi, president of the Malaysian Electric Vehicle Owners Club (MyEVOC), told CNA that the charging situation has improved vastly along\xa0the west coast from when he bought his car four years ago.\n“When I first got the car, it was kind of pathetic - the kind of DC rapid charging infrastructure outside of Kuala Lumpur. So you fast forward to this year, actually there are already a pair of 50kW DC chargers in operation in Ayer Keroh Rest Stop, both north and south bound,” said Mr Shahrol.\nDirect current (DC) charging points are fast charging, and typically takes an hour to charge a car fully. Alternating current (AC) charging points could take up to eight hours.\nMr Shahrol bought his electric car, a Tesla S 75, in 2017. He is based in Kuala Lumpur but has used the car to travel across various parts of Peninsular Malaysia.\nHe noted that of the estimated 300 charging points in the country, only a handful are DC points, and these are mainly concentrated on the west coast of the peninsula.\nHe lauded the move by local company JomCharge, which announced last October that DC chargers will be installed at various points along North-South Expressway to reduce range anxiety for electric car drivers travelling between major\xa0cities like Johor Bahru, Melaka, Kuala Lumpur and Penang.\nBesides the chargers at Ayer Keroh rest stop in Melaka, JomCharge is also set to install DC fast charging points at rest and relaxation (RnR) pitstops in Skudai, Johor as well as Bukit Gantang, near Ipoh, Perak.\nMr Shahrol said: “For Singaporeans who want to come to Malaysia for a road trip or holiday, there are charging points along the way for their electric cars. If they want to head to KL, Ayer Keroh is conveniently located mid-journey. There are absolutely no issues.”\nHe added that in Kuala Lumpur, there are currently three DC charging points, with two more set to be built soon.\nA Singaporean driver who made regular road trips to Malaysia,\xa0Lee Hon Sing,\xa0expressed surprise at how little money he had to spend charging his car during the trips.\n“In KL, the fast chargers are free to use. Even the chargers at my hotel, near Sunway Lagoon, were free as well,” he said.\nThe IT programmer owns two electric cars which he uses for these trips – a Hyundai Kona and a Renault Zoe.\nBefore the borders were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Lee drove his Hyundai Kona, which is a long-range car, to Kuala Lumpur.\nOn paper, his car had enough range to complete the journey without recharging but he was worried and decided to charge at Ayer Keroh just in case.\n“It is possible to drive the car from my house near Jurong area to Kuala Lumpur. But the first time I did it, I was a bit scared,” said Mr Lee.\xa0\n“I did a top-up at Ayer Keroh for 40 minutes. But when I reached KL, I did my calculations and figured out that even if I did not top up, I would have had 80km of distance to spare. So it’s actually quite safe, and the range balance is comfortable,” added the 57-year-old.\nMr Shahrol shared that the MyEVOC community has also extended advice and help to Singapore drivers who have planned road trips with their electric cars.\n“I remember in 2019 a Singaporean guy was driving a 20kW (Hyundai)\xa0Ioniq\xa0up to KL. He needed to charge along the way so we were guiding him. I think he eventually stopped in Seremban for a charge, some of us were ready to go there and help,” he said.\n“But fast forward to this year onwards, it\'s pretty easy for any electric car to come up to Kuala Lumpur\xa0by fast charging at Ayer Keroh,” added Mr Shahrol.\nROAD TRIPS TO THE EAST COAST “A BIT OF A GAMBLE”\nFor Singaporean electric car owners who want to drive to Johor Bahru over the weekend when the border reopens, Mr Koh said a two-hour to three-hour congestion at the Causeway would only reduce the battery life by around 3 per cent if the driver sets\xa0the air-conditioner at full blast.\xa0\nIf drivers need to charge their cars, he pointed out that there are AC charging stations located at IKEA Tebrau, a popular shopping destination for Singaporeans.\nMr Shahrol also noted that most of the hotels in Desaru Coast, a popular beach holiday destination, have charging points for electric cars.\nHowever,\xa0there needs to be more DC\xa0charging points across the country, especially on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, he added.\xa0\nRoad trips to the east coast could be risky as there are barely any charging points, he said.\n“For trips to the east coast like Terengganu and Kuantan (in Pahang), Kelantan, it’s still a bit of a gamble, because there are only a few AC charging stations at some of the hotels in that area. It does require a bit more work, a bit more planning,” said Mr Shahrol.\nMr Koh recalled that he once drove his Hyundai Kona from Singapore to Kuantan, a 340km journey on the east coast.\nHe knew that there were no DC chargers along the journey so he would not recommend that route for drivers.\n“My (Hyundai) Kona is a long-range car so it had enough to complete the journey, there was also enough charge to overtake trucks along the way,” said Mr Koh.\nHowever, he had to travel inland the following day to Subang, near Kuala Lumpur, to charge his car fully at a DC point before heading back home.\n“When I arrived in Kuantan, I charged the car at my friend\'s landed house for a bit. The next day, I drove to Subang for a fast charge,” he added.\nLACK OF REPAIR OPTIONS\nBesides charging points, another factor that triggers anxiety for electric car drivers is the lack of repair options if things go wrong.\nMr Shahrol, the MyEVOC president, said that in case of breakdown or repair, there are merely “one or two” workshops in Kuala Lumpur\xa0that\xa0are able to resolve EV repair issues.\n“For such services, it’s still quite early yet (for Malaysia). Only these workshops are good at repairing EVs and they know not to mess things up when they look at it,” he added.\nOver the last four years, Mr Shahrol has had to send his Tesla S 75 to Hong Kong twice for warranty repair claims, after encountering issues with his central screen.\nAlthough the costs were covered as his car was still under warranty, he maintained that it would be more convenient if Malaysia had a Tesla workshop, or other electric car specialised workshops.\n“It’s just the inconvenience of loading it up into a container, going over there, servicing it, repairing it and transporting it back,” said Mr Shahrol.\nHowever, both Singapore drivers Mr Koh and Mr Lee said they have been lucky so far, and not experienced any breakdown or issues with their cars while travelling in Malaysia.\nMr Koh said: ”One thing that Malaysia doesn’t have is workshops to repair the EVs. So if anything happens, you have to tow it back to Singapore on a flatbed.”\nMr Lee recalled that he was involved in an accident, when his Kona was rear-ended by a Malaysian vehicle\xa0at a traffic light in Johor Bahru.\n“When it happened, my first immediate thought was I now need to get a flatbed truck to tow it back to Singapore and it’s going to really cost me,” said Mr Lee.\nHe said that his car survived the hit, and only suffered a small dent. Thankfully, he could still drive the car to the police station to make a report and subsequently back to Singapore.\nAccording to a transport expert CNA spoke to, Malaysia does not have electric vehicle repair facilities because there is a lack of human capital to support the EV industry.\nAssociate Professor Muhammad Zaly Shah, director of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia’s Centre for Innovative Planning and Development told CNA: “We don’t have programmes to train mechanic and engineers to be efficient in maintaining electric vehicles. So owners have to send their car back to manufacturers overseas.""\n“Addressing the manpower with the right technological know-how is a critical issue to support the EV industry,” he added.\nMORE CAN BE DONE TO BOOST EV TAKE-UP\xa0\xa0\xa0\nAlthough purchasing an electric car would be more expensive that a petrol car, Mr Shahrol said a handful of Malaysians still prefer going electric because of the smoother driving experience.\n“The biggest difference (between EV and petrol) is there’s no engine vibration, and you couple that with the fact that the torque of the motor is maximum when you start from standstill,” said Mr Shahrol.\n“This means that when you push down the accelerator in heavy traffic, the car glides silently, so you can enjoy podcasts and music,” he added.\nBased on May 2019 data, there are 194 battery EVs registered in Malaysia. In\xa0comparison, there are\xa01,274 registered electric cars in\xa0Singapore as of Jan 31 this year, according to the Land Transport Authority.\xa0\nMr Shahrol\xa0said\xa0“more can be done” to make EVs a more viable choice for drivers in Malaysia, such as introducing tax incentives and making more infrastructure available.\nHe expressed concern that Malaysia is in danger of being left behind by neighbouring countries like Singapore and Thailand, which are staking out bold pledges to transition from internal combustion engine cars to electric.\n“Malaysia launched its electric mobility master plan in 2015, which set targets for 2020 and 2030 and we’ve fallen way short of that. We are trying to tell the government that our neighbours are progressing, not only in helping users but also manufacturing, while we seem to be taking a wait and see attitude,” said Mr Shahrol.\n“So enough of the waiting and seeing. Let’s get going,” he added.\nMr Shahrol said one positive sign is that Malaysia’s Ministry of Environment and Water is set to launch a low carbon mobility action plan in 2021.\n“We look forward to that, hopefully there’s some positive news in terms of charging stations, more tax incentives for buying electric vehicles – the usual stuff that we have seen by governments in the region and around the world,” he added.\nHowever, Assoc Prof Muhammad Zaly wondered if the Malaysia government would simply back the transition given that the electric vehicle industry could be seen as threatening the future of government-owned oil and gas company, Petronas.\nHe added that local car manufacturers Proton and Perodua have also yet to produce electric cars.\nHe observed that policymakers must be seen to support firms like Petronas, Proton and Perodua to ensure they remain competitive in the automotive industry.\n“If (policymakers) want these local companies to survive, they must maintain petrol cars as the main option for users. If they transition to EV, Proton and Perodua cars would no longer have an edge over other brands,” said Assoc Prof Muhammad Zaly.\nHe also maintained that Malaysia’s position as the second-largest oil and natural gas producer in Southeast Asia would mean that it could stand to lose if more countries transition to EV.\n“The cost of petrol or diesel is relatively cheap in Malaysia, so even users would hesitate to switch their diesel or petrol-powered vehicles to electric,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     electric vehicles ', '     environment ', '     Malaysia ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Why a bumper crop of Southeast Asian tech unicorns look set to IPO this year
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In less than two months into 2021, we have witnessed more than half a dozen tech companies in the region announcing their plans to go public.\nAmong these are established Southeast Asian unicorns like Grab, Gojek, Tokopedia and Traveloka who have made public concrete discussions to explore new growth opportunities.\xa0\nHowever, the initial public offering (IPO) ambitions of these tech unicorns, having transitioned from start-ups to the multi-billion dollar tech companies they are today, should be unsurprising.\nAfter all, their businesses have matured, they have gained significant market share and they are looking to shore up their balance sheets for the next phases of their growth.\nYet, the fever to go public is not exclusive to established unicorns. Smaller pre-unicorn scale-ups from the region have also started touting similar plans.\nTech pundits would readily cite Zilingo and Ruangguru as pre-unicorn scale-ups with serious ambitions to go public. Most recently, Carro which saw strong returns in 2020 made public their ambition to list within a two to three year time frame.\nWith investors having pumped billions into each of them, it comes as no surprise that pressure is mounting to deliver an exit.\nInvestments from venture capital funds into tech start-ups as early as 2013 are beginning to mature, so many principals might be banking on 2021 to be a blockbuster year with listings bringing healthy exits to their respective funds.\nAs early as 2019, companies such as Traveloka and Tokopedia were in serious talks with investment banks for a dual listing in the US and in the region, according to several media reports.\nHOW 2020 CHANGED MARKET CONDITIONS\nHowever, poor economic conditions, and weak market sentiments - no thanks to Uber Technologies\' belly flopped IPO and WeWork\'s disastrous attempt to list the moment it filed its prospectus -- meant that valuations and liquidity were not in favour of a listing.\nThen came the year that was 2020, as the pandemic ravaged the global economy, shut down businesses, and brought international travel to an abrupt and almost complete standstill.\nThe Southeast Asian tech companies were not spared. Smove, a car leasing company founded in Singapore, saw its revenue plummet 85 per cent, forcing it to liquidate its operational arm and sell its intellectual property.\nStoqo Teknologi Indonesia and Airy, both Indonesian start-ups, ceased operations in 2020. Tokopedia, Grab and Gojek all carried out staff and salary cuts, as Traveloka, being in the business of travel, also took a huge hit.\nDespite all of these setbacks, 2020 revealed the market\'s appetite for investing in the technology space, especially since the global economy was fraught with uncertainty, and traditional brick and mortar businesses revealed their vulnerability in the face of change.\nSEA Limited, probably one of the few publicly listed options to invest in technology in Southeast Asia, saw astronomical growth in 2020, with its share price rising by 400 per cent.\xa0\nIn February, to capitalise on the hot market for tech stocks, Softbank publicly urged its high-profile portfolio companies in its US$100 billion Vision Fund – such as China’s Bytedance and Didi Chuxing and Southeast Asia’s Grab - to accelerate plans to list.\xa0\nIf anything, 2020 was a year of reckoning for Southeast Asian tech companies.\xa0\nThose who survived, came out leaner and stronger. Grab saw its third quarter revenue bounce back to 95 per cent of pre-COVID levels, and closed a US$2 billion term loan facility in February 2021.\nGojek managed to secure a US$1.2 billion round in March 2020 and raised an additional US$525 million in June and November. It then went on to acquire a 22 per cent stake in Indonesia\'s Bank Jago in December.\xa0\nTraveloka\'s Vietnam business has surpassed pre-COVID-19 levels, is nearly back to normal levels in Thailand, and is at half of pre-COVID levels in Indonesia.\nRED HOT YEAR\nOn the back of such recovery, 2021 is shaping up to be a red hot year in the Southeast Asian tech scene creating enthusiasm for listings. The market is buzzing with murmurs of prospective plans.\nApart from the pressure to exit and strong market sentiments, a pent-up post pandemic appetite might account for some part of the strong impetus to go public.\nFor example, last year saw a surge of newly-listed special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in the US. \xa0\nSPACs are special purpose shell companies listed, without assets or business activities, in order to acquire a business.\xa0\nThe acquisition is typically funded with a combination of cash and shares, and because the valuation of the target is usually at least four to five times more than the SPAC, the owners of the target will usually end up being the majority shareholder of the listed SPAC due to the consideration paid in shares, hence why it’s known as a ""reverse merger"".\nInterest in SPACs among Southeast Asian unicorns has surfaced. Tokopedia was in talks with Richard Li and Peter Thiel\'s Bridgetown Holdings SPAC but the focus has now shifted to its possible merger with Gojek.\nThe emergence of SPACs could have played a part in re-energising these unicorns’ listing plans, adding enthusiasm to the 2021 IPO scene.\xa0\nUnlike a traditional IPO, SPACs offer a much faster and less cumbersome route to going public. The transaction risk is lower, and the time, effort and cost needed for a SPAC listing is far less than a traditional IPO.\xa0\nThese make SPACs a much more attractive option for listing for tech companies.\xa0\nAs they originate from US capital markets, SPACs also fit nicely into Southeast Asian tech companies\' IPO plans, enabling them to achieve the kind of valuation and liquidity more aligned with their expectations, than listing in Southeast Asia alone.\xa0\nFor the SPACs, Southeast Asia offers them an emerging and exciting opportunity, with potential for growth.\xa0\nThe tech companies of Southeast Asia are attractive as they are a part of the fast growing digital economy of the region.\nA\xa0report published by Temasek, Google and Bain &\xa0Company shows that with a population of over 650 million, Southeast Asia\'s digital economy is poised to grow to US$300 billion (S$415 billion) by 2025, three times its current annual size, given the region\'s relatively young population and increasing Internet access. It is therefore an attractive sector for investors seeking a high growth portfolio. \xa0\nSo is 2021 a good year for Southeast Asian tech companies to list?\nEven with the high levels of interest, the success of such plans and eventual IPOs will greatly depend on the global economy\'s speed of recovery, and whether these companies can turn their businesses profitable.\nInvestors are increasingly looking towards investments turning a profit, rather than for these companies to attract more investors.\nThe pandemic has given these companies a chance to trim excess fat, and turn towards a more profitable operating model. With vaccines rolling out all over the world, the economy looks on track for a strong recovery.\nGear up then as the next Southeast Asian tech listing shouldn’t be far away. \xa0\nJoel Shen is a Partner in the Corporate team at Withers KhattarWong.

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is working to form a new Singapore Together Alliance for Action (AfA) on tackling online harms, especially those targeted at women and girls, Senior Minister of State for Communications & Information\xa0Sim Ann said on Monday (Mar 8).\nMs Sim is leading discussions on the formation of the AfA, the first two sessions of which were attended by more than 60 participants.\nWith women making strides in many areas from education and the workplace to leadership, it was time to look at whether they can enjoy the same degree of confidence and freedom online as\xa0they\xa0have gained in real life, Ms Sim told reporters after\xa0an engagement session at the MCI Building on Monday, which is International Women\'s Day.\nThere were three broad categories of online harms raised during the discussions: The non-consensual publication of intimate images and footage online;\xa0unwelcome messages and interactions ranging from sexual harassment to online grooming; and\xa0websites or online businesses that are linked to vice, or encourage vice and harm to women and\xa0girls.\n""We\'re looking for would-be projects that are actionable, and which we can see representatives from the public, people and private sectors working on together. I think we\'re seeing the beginnings of that,"" Ms Sim said.\xa0""It is also my hope that we can eventually create and launch an Alliance for Action that is focused on this issue of online harms that are targeted at women and girls.""\nShe added that a few stakeholders are already conceptualising projects on the issue.\nThose who have taken part in the conversations include representatives from the IT sector, tech companies, parenting interest groups, students\xa0and women\'s groups. She emphasised that both men and women have been involved.\nTECHNOLOGY, RELATIONSHIPS\nFacebook\'s\xa0head of public policy in Singapore and ASEAN, Ms Clara Koh, who attended the session on Monday morning, said that the company is very committed to women\'s safety and sees itself being involved with the AfA on online harms.\n""This is really the start of many more conversations around how different stakeholders in Singapore can come together to\xa0work on these challenges that we are facing here,"" said Ms Koh, without giving more details.\xa0\nFacebook has tripled the number of people it hires around the world to deal with safety and security in the last few years to 35,000, she said.\xa0\n""The first thing is we invest in technology -\xa0artificial intelligence -\xa0to help us with proactive detection of content that violate (our)\xa0policy,"" she said.\xa0\n""Second is our users, you know, hoping that they will report to us more content that they find violates our standards on the platform. And finally, making sure we have human reviewers ... who are hired for different languages and cultural sensitivities.""\nAnother participant, Mr Tan Boon Siong, 51, a father of three girls and a boy, said that he thinks that developing the parent-child relationship\xa0is another thing to focus on.\nWhile more regulations or tech\xa0solutions\xa0can be introduced, perpetrators will always come up with new ways to reach their victims, said Mr Tan, who is in the manufacturing industry.\xa0\n""I think we want to create a relationship is close enough so that the girls or the son is able to share with (the parents)\xa0openly if they encounter any problems,"" he said.\nAlliances for Action or AfAs are cross-sector groups involving\xa0government agencies, industry and other organisations that are formed to explore and execute new ideas in specific areas. AfAs for industry groups, work-life harmony and digital inclusion are among those that have been formed.\nThe AfA on tackling online harms would support wider inter-agency conversations on women\'s development, said MCI. Singapore is currently doing a full review\xa0of women’s issues, which will culminate in a White Paper by the first half of this year.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Sim Ann ', '     MCI ', '     women ', '     technology ']}"

      Honda unveils its new level 3 technology, but how does it work?
  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO: Honda Motor unveiled on Thursday a limited batch of its flagship Legend sedan this week, becoming the world\'s first carmaker to sell a vehicle equipped with certified level 3 self-driving technology.\nLease sales of the level 3 Legend would be limited to 100 cars at a retail price of 11 million yen (US$102,000). But Japan\'s No.2 automaker is stepping up its game in self-driving technology as global competitors aim for fully autonomous vehicles.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS LEVEL 3?\nThere are different levels of automation, from levels 0 to 5, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers and most automakers.\nLevel 3, also known as conditional driving automation, involves automated features which allow drivers to engage in activities behind the wheel, such as watching movies or using smartphones - but under limited conditions - while their car navigates expressway traffic.\nBesides Honda, several automakers including Daimler AG\'s Mercedes-Benz have said they are ready to deploy Level 3 systems for highway driving.\nOTHER LEVELS OF AUTOMATED DRIVING\nLevels 0 to 2 involve driver support features such as automated braking systems and lane departure warnings that need to be supervised by a driver. Liability for vehicle behaviour rests with the car owner rather than the manufacturer.\nMost global automakers that develop autonomous driving technology such as General Motors, Volvo and Toyota Motor, currently offer vehicles equipped with a level 2 automation system. This means vehicles can accelerate, brake and steer without driver input, but drivers are required to remain engaged at all times.\nA level 5 vehicle, on the other hand, is fully autonomous and can navigate roads without any human attention in all conditions.\nHOW DOES HONDA\'S LEVEL 3 WORK?\nHonda\'s level 3 ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" system uses data from 3D high-definition maps and a global navigation satellite system for vehicle control, as well as a dozen of external sensors to detect the car\'s surroundings.\nThe system can alert the driver to respond when handing over the control, for example via vibration on the driver\'s seatbelt.\nAnd if the driver is unresponsive, the system will assist with an emergency stop by decelerating and stopping the vehicle while alerting surrounding cars with hazard lights and the horn.\nHonda simulated around 10 million patterns of possible real-world situations, and conducted a massive number of demonstration tests on highways to create safe-driving technology, said Hitoshi Aoki, the Legend\'s development manager.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     automotive ', '     Honda ']}"

      Waiver of licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides extended to December 2021
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Licence fees for hotels, travel agents and tour guides will continue to be waived through to the end of this year, as part of the Government’s efforts to nurse the recovery of the tourism sector.\nThese fees were earlier waived until the end of last year.\xa0\nHotel operators typically have to pay between S$300 and S$500 to renew their licences yearly, depending on the number of rooms they have, according to guidelines\xa0on the website of the Singapore Hotels Licensing Board.\nTravel Agencies have a two-year licence and the renewal fee is S$400, based on guidelines from the Singapore Tourism Board. Tour guides pay S$72 for a\xa0licence, which is typically valid for three years.\nIn announcing this during the Ministry of Trade and Industry’s Committee of Supply debate on Tuesday (Mar 2), Minister of State Alvin Tan said the hard-hit sector will likely continue to struggle given ongoing travel restrictions.\nHelp is already under way, with tourism businesses set to receive wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme for another six months until September this year. In 2020, the scheme aided more than 7,000 firms in the sector, said Mr Tan.\nWith international arrivals set to remain weak this year, the SingapoRediscovers campaign and vouchers scheme will continue to spur domestic demand which is “critical” for the sector.\nMr Tan noted that the Government is monitoring feedback and exploring ways to improve the scheme.\nWith COVID-19 changing the tourism landscape and travel norms, there are also efforts to help the sector transform and build up resilience against future disruptions.\nTechnology is one useful tool, according to Mr Tan, who cited how organisers of the Singapore Fintech Festival x Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology last year pivoted to a hybrid event with a 24-hour online platform.\nOther moves include the Singapore Tourism Board’s SingapoReimagine initiative to position the country as an attractive and safe destination, and a new platform set to be launched this year for industry stakeholders to create and test new solutions.\nTECH TALENT\nThe issue of tech talent was another focus of Mr Tan’s speech.\n“While tech is key in the transformation process but at its core, requires talent,” he said in Parliament.\n“Talent that can help us nurture a vibrant and competitive tech ecosystem that can hold our own against the world, and help Singapore remain relevant.”\nIn response to questions from Members of Parliament Jessica Tan (PAP-East Coast) and Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast) on plans to grow the local tech talent pipeline, Mr Tan said the Government, institutes of higher learning and the private sector play important roles.\nFor instance, the existing TechSkills Accelerator Programme equips individuals with skills in emerging tech and helps companies to upskill existing workers and hire professionals.\nThe local institutes of higher learning are also set to add 20,000 people to the local tech talent pool, while the Workforce Singapore and the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s place-and-train programmes will provide another 6,250 individuals in functions such as software engineering and cybersecurity.\nBut besides building up local talent, Mr Tan said Singapore must also “attract global talent to complement (its) local workforce and fill skill shortages”.\n“This is part of our strategy to develop a strong base of tech companies and talent to ensure that Singapore is competitive globally,” he added.\n“This will also create more opportunities for locals to work in globally competitive teams and dynamics teams, alongside top tech talent from all over the world.”\nOne way to do so is through the new Tech.Pass scheme.\nFirst announced in November last year, the scheme aims to attract “founders, leaders and technical experts with experience in established or fast-growing tech companies”. Five hundred slots will be made available from January 2021 when applications open, the Economic Development Board said in its press release then.\nIn response to another question from Ms Foo, Mr Tan said Tech.Pass has seen “keen interest” since applications opened in mid-January.\xa0\nThe Government continues to evaluate the scheme, he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2021 ', '     Ministry of Trade and Industry ', '     tourism ', '     technology ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SAN FRANCISCO:\xa0Lauren Foundos has excelled at just about everything she has put her mind to, from college sports and Wall Street trading to her Forte startup that takes workouts online.\nBeing a woman in the overwhelmingly male world of venture capital was still a barrier –\xa0but, like many other female entrepreneurs, she only worked harder to succeed.\n""In some cases, before I even spoke, they were asking me if I would step down as chief executive,"" Foundos said of encounters with venture capitalists.\n""This was a whole new level.""\nMen would speak past her in meetings, discussing whether she could emotionally handle the job as if she wasn\'t there, or wondering out loud who would take care of the books.\n""When that happens, I tell them I am right here,"" Foundos said. ""I am the finance guy; I worked at big banks for more than 10 years. I\'ve been the best at everything I have ever gone into.""\nStartups can only get by so long relying on friends, family or savings before eventually needing to find investors willing to put money into young companies in exchange for a stake in the business.\nMoney invested in startups in their earliest days, perhaps when they are no more than ideas or prototypes, is called ""seed"" funding.\nWhen it comes to getting backing for a startup it is about trust, and that seems to be lacking when it comes to women entrepreneurs, according to Foundos and others interviewed by AFP.\n""I don\'t think women need to be given things,"" Foundos said of venture capital backing. ""But I think they are not seeing the same amount of deals.""\nForte has grown quickly as the pandemic has gyms and fitness centres scrambling to provide online sessions for members.\nFoundos brought on a ""right-hand man"", a male partner with a British accent, to provide a more traditional face to potential investors and increase the odds of getting funding.\nShe has taken to asking venture capitalists she meets if they have invested in women-led companies before, and the answer has always been ""no"".\nSEX FOR FUNDING\nA paltry few per cent of venture capital money goes to female-led startups in the United States, according to Allyson Kapin, General Partner at the W Fund and founder of Women Who Tech (WWT).\nBeing sexually propositioned in return for funding, or even an introduction to venture capitalists, is common for women founders of startups, according to a recent WWT survey.\nAbout 44 per cent of female founders surveyed told of harassment such as sexual slurs or unwanted physical contact while seeking funding.\nAnd while last year set a record for venture capital funding, backing for women-led startups plunged despite data that such companies actually deliver better return-on-investment, according to Kapin.\n""This isn\'t about altruism or charity, this is about making a (load) of money,"" Kapin said of backing women-led startups.\nBAR SET HIGHER\nProspects for funding get even more dismal for women of colour.\nBlack entrepreneur Fonta Gilliam worked overseas with financial institutions for the US State Department before creating social banking startup Invest Sou Sou.\nGilliam took the idea of village savings circles she had seen thrive in places such as Africa and built it into a free mobile app, adding artificial intelligence and partnering with financial institutions.\nShe created a Sou Sou prototype and started bringing in revenue to show it could make money, but still found it tougher to get funding than male peers.\n""We always have to over-perform and overcompensate,"" Gilliam said. ""Where startups run by men would get believed, we\'d have to prove it 10 times over.""\nGilliam got insultingly low valuations for her startup, some so predatory that she walked away.\n""We are still lean and mean bootstrapping, but I think it is going to pay off in the end,"" Gilliam said.\n""One thing about women-owned, black-owned startups: Because there is such a high bar to get support our businesses tend to be scrappier, stronger and more resilient.""\nPRIVILEGED ""PIPELINE""\nWomen-led startups tend to be on the outside of the ""pipeline"" that unofficially funnels entrepreneurs to venture capitalists, according to Kapin and others.\nIn Silicon Valley, that channel is open to male, white tech entrepreneurs from select universities such as Stanford.\n""The pipeline becomes filled with people from the same universities; from similar backgrounds,"" Kapin said.\n""It is not representative of the world, which is problematic because you are trying to solve the world\'s problems through the lens of very few people –\xa0mostly white men.""\nInvestors competing for gems in the frothy tech startup scrum are missing out on a wealth of returns, and stability, to be had by investing in neglected women founders, according to Caroline Lewis, a managing partner in Rogue Women\'s Fund, which does just that.\n""At the end of the day, it is the right thing to do and it is a good thing to do,"" Lewis said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     women ', '     technology ']}"

      Mars rover's giant parachute carried secret message
  </h1>, 'text': 'CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida: The huge parachute used by NASA’s Perseverance rover to land on Mars contained a secret message, thanks to a puzzle lover on the spacecraft team.\nSystems engineer Ian Clark used a binary code to spell out “Dare Mighty Things” in the orange and white strips of the 21m parachute. He also included the GPS coordinates for the mission\'s headquarters at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nClark, a crossword hobbyist, came up with the idea two years ago. Engineers wanted an unusual pattern in the nylon fabric to know how the parachute was oriented during descent. Turning it into a secret message was “super fun,"" he said Tuesday (Feb 23).\nOnly about six people knew about the encoded message before Thursday’s landing, according to Clark. They waited until the parachute images came back before putting out a teaser during a televised news conference Monday.\nIt took just a few hours for space fans to figure it out, Clark said. Next time, he noted, “I’ll have to be a little bit more creative.”\n“Dare Mighty Things” — a line from President Theodore Roosevelt — is a mantra at JPL and adorns many of the center\'s walls. The trick was “trying to come up with a way of encoding it but not making it too obvious,"" Clark said.\nAs for the GPS coordinates, the spot is 3m from the entrance to JPL\'s visitor center.\nAnother added touch not widely known until touchdown: Perseverance bears a plaque depicting all five of NASA\'s Mars rovers in increasing size over the years — similar to the family car decals seen on Earth.\nDeputy project manager Matt Wallace promises more so-called hidden Easter eggs.

      NASA releases Mars landing video: 'Stuff of our dreams'
  </h1>, 'text': 'CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida:\xa0NASA on Monday (Feb 22) released the first high-quality video of a spacecraft landing on Mars, a three-minute trailer showing the enormous orange and white parachute hurtling open and the red dust kicking up as rocket engines lowered the rover to the surface.\nThe footage was so good — and the images so breathtaking — that members of the rover team said they felt like they were riding along.\n“It gives me goosebumps every time I see it, just amazing,” said Dave Gruel, head of the entry and descent camera team.\nThe Perseverance rover landed last Thursday near an ancient river delta in Jezero Crater to search for signs of ancient microscopic life. After spending the weekend binge-watching the descent and landing video, the team at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, shared the video at a news conference.\n“These videos and these images are the stuff of our dreams,"" said Al Chen, who was in charge of the landing team.\nSix off-the-shelf colour cameras were devoted to entry, descent and landing, looking up and down from different perspectives. All but one camera worked.\xa0\nThe lone microphone turned on for landing failed, but NASA got some snippets of sound after touchdown: The whirring of the rover’s systems and wind gusts.\nFlight controllers were thrilled with the thousands of images beamed back — and also with the remarkably good condition of NASA\'s biggest and most capable rover yet.\xa0\nIt will spend the next two years exploring the dry river delta and drilling into rocks that may hold evidence of life 3 billion to 4 billion years ago. The core samples will be set aside for return to Earth in a decade.\nNASA added 25 cameras to the US$3 billion mission — the most ever sent to Mars.\xa0\nThe space agency\'s previous rover, 2012\'s Curiosity, managed only jerky, grainy stop-motion images, mostly of terrain. Curiosity is still working. So is NASA\'s InSight lander, although it\'s hampered by dusty solar panels.\nThey may have company in late spring, when China attempts to land its own rover, which went into orbit around Mars two weeks ago.\nDeputy project manager Matt Wallace said he was inspired several years ago to film Perseverance\'s harrowing descent when his young gymnast daughter wore a camera while performing a backflip.\nSome of the spacecraft systems — like the sky crane used to lower the rover onto the Martian surface — could not be tested on Earth.\n“So this is the first time we’ve had a chance as engineers to actually see what we designed,” Wallace told reporters.\nThomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s science mission chief, said the video and also the panoramic views following touchdown “are the closest you can get to landing on Mars without putting on a pressure suit”.\nThe images will help NASA prepare for astronaut flights to Mars in the decades ahead, according to the engineers.\nThere is\xa0a more immediate benefit.\n“I know it\'s been a tough year for everybody,” said imaging scientist Justin Maki, “and we\'re hoping that maybe these images will help brighten people\'s days.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     space ', '     technology ', '     NASA ']}"

      America has sent 5 rovers to Mars - when will humans follow?
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON: With its impeccable landing on Thursday (Feb 18), NASA\'s Perseverance became the fifth rover to reach Mars - so when can we finally expect the long-held goal of a crewed expedition to materialise?\nNASA\'s current Artemis program is billed as a ""moon to Mars"" mission, and acting administrator Steve Jurczyk has reiterated his aspiration of ""the mid-to-end of the 2030s"" for American boots on the Red Planet.\nBut while the trip is technologically almost within grasp, experts say it\'s probably still decades out because of funding uncertainties.\nMARS IS HARD\nWernher von Braun, the architect of the Apollo program, started work on a Mars mission right after the moon landing in 1969, but the plan, like many after it, never got off the drawing board.\nWhat makes it so hard? For a start, the sheer distance.\nAstronauts bound for Mars will have to travel about 225 million km, depending on where the two planets are relative to each other.\nThat means a trip that\'s many months long, where astronauts will face two major health risks: Radiation and microgravity.\nThe former raises the lifetime chances of developing cancer while the latter decreases bone density and muscle mass.\nIf things go wrong, any problems will have to be solved on the planet itself.\n""IT\'S THE DETAILS""\nThat said, scientists have learned plenty of lessons from astronauts\' missions to the moon and to space stations.\n""We have demonstrated on Earth orbiting spacecraft the ability for astronauts to survive for a year and a half,"" said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\nThe general ideas of how to execute a Mars mission are in place, but ""it\'s the details"" that are lacking, he added.\nOne way to reduce the radiation exposure on the journey is getting there faster, said Laura Forczyk, the founder of space consulting firm Astralytical and a planetary scientist.\nThis could involve using nuclear thermal propulsion, which produces far more thrust than the energy produced by traditional chemical rockets.\nAnother could be building a spacecraft with water containers strapped to it that absorb space radiation, said McDowell.\nOnce there, we\'ll need to find ways to breathe in the 95 per\xa0cent carbon dioxide atmosphere. Perseverance has an instrument on board to convert carbon dioxide to oxygen, as a technical demonstration.\nOther solutions involve breaking down the ice at the planet\'s poles into oxygen and hydrogen, which will also fuel rockets.\nRadiation will also be challenging on the planet, because of its ultra thin atmosphere and lack of a protective magnetosphere, so shelters will need to be well shielded, or even underground.\nRISK TOLERANCE\nThe feasibility also comes down to how much risk we are willing to tolerate, said G\xa0Scott Hubbard, NASA\'s first Mars program director who\'s now at Stanford.\nDuring the Shuttle era, said Hubbard, ""the demand was that the astronauts face no more than 3 per cent increased risk in death"".\n""They have now raised that -\xa0deep space missions are somewhere between 10 and 30 per cent, depending on the mission, so NASA\'s taking a more aggressive or open posture,"" he added.\nThat could involve raising the permissible level of total radiation astronauts can be exposed to over their lifetimes, which NASA is also considering, said Forczyk.\nPOLITICAL WILL\nThe experts agreed the biggest hurdle is getting buy-in from the US president and Congress.\n""If humanity as a species, specifically the American taxpayer, decides to put large amounts of money into it, we could be there by the 2030s,"" said McDowell.\nHe doesn\'t think that\'s on the cards, but said he would be surprised if it happened later than the 2040s, a conclusion shared by Forczyk.\nPresident Joe Biden hasn\'t yet outlined his Mars vision, though his spokeswoman Jen Psaki\xa0said this month the Artemis program had the administration\'s ""support"".\nStill, the agency is facing budget constraints and is not expected to meet its goal of returning astronauts to the moon by 2024, which would also push back Mars.\nSPACEX WILDCARD\nCould NASA be beaten to it by SpaceX, the company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, who is targeting a first human mission in 2026?\nMusk has been developing the next-generation Starship rocket for the purpose - though two prototypes blew up in spectacular fashion on their recent test runs.\nThese might look bad, but the risks SpaceX is able to take, and NASA as a government agency can\'t, gives it valuable data, argued Hubbard.\nThat could eventually give SpaceX an edge over NASA\'s chosen rocket, the troubled Space Launch System which is beset by delays and cost overrun.\nBut not even one of the richest people in the world can foot the entire bill for Mars themselves.\nHubbard sees a public-private partnership as more likely, with SpaceX providing the transport and NASA solving the many other problems.\n', 'related_topics': ['     space ', '     technology ', '     NASA ']}"

      Commentary: A Gojek-Tokopedia merger has ramifications for regional unicorns including Grab and Sea
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: One of Jakarta’s best kept secrets is that it hosts the largest Jazz festival in the Southern Hemisphere.\nI recall, with fondness, attending Java Jazz in the late noughties, on my regular work commutes to Indonesia as a young solicitor.\xa0\nBack then, prized festival tickets were bought over-the-counter at tour agencies, who only accepted cash payments - foreign credit cards were regarded by counter staff with deep suspicion.\nOn my way to the festival, I would negotiate the city’s notorious traffic jams in a hired car I had booked through the hotel.\xa0\nAt the festival grounds, the only lunch and dinner options were Indonesian street food offered by the hawkers that congregated outside - my favourite being the very tasty but less than healthy chicken noodles or ""mie ayam"" sold by an elderly hawker from a blue\xa0kaki lima\xa0(push cart).\nThings have changed significantly in the last decade. Today, I buy my Java Jazz tickets online, via an e-commerce marketplace like Tokopedia or ticketing platform Go-Tix, and pay for my purchase using a digital wallet like Ovo.\xa0\nI travel to the festival using a ride-hailing app like Grab or Gojek, both of which also offer online food delivery services that will convey comestibles to concert-goers from the farthest reaches of Greater Jakarta.\nAll this is made possible by the rise of digitally-enabled businesses. Indonesia’s digital economy, valued at just US$8 billion in 2015 had quintupled to US$44 billion in 2020.\xa0\nIt is expected to triple again to US$124 billion by 2025 according \xa0to the 2020 South-east Asia e-Conomy report by Google, Temasek and Bain & Co.\nThe meteoric growth of Indonesia’s digital economy has also given rise to its first crop of technology unicorns – household names such as Gojek, Tokopedia, Ovo, Traveloka and Bukalapak; founded by a generation of Indonesian technopreneurs who themselves are champions for the country’s digital transformation, and poster boys for the new economy.\nGRAB-AND-GO\nAs these tech unicorns mature, they begin to assiduously pursue strategic partnerships, mergers and consolidations, in a bid to deliver lucrative exits for their founders and investors.\nFor most of 2020, speculation was rife as to whether a merger between aspiring super-app operators Grab and Gojek, regarded by many as the most intuitive match between Southeast Asia’s tech darlings and cleverly labelled the Grab-and-Go merger, would materialise.\nObservers cited deal economics, regulatory challenges, strategic differences – whether Grab and Gojek should merge in Indonesia only or across all Southeast Asian markets - and egos in the boardroom as key impediments to the merger.\nThe potential antitrust ramifications of a Grab-and-Go merger prompted statements from regional competition watchdogs that they were keeping a close eye on merger discussions, and the fear of massive job losses that may result from a Grab-and-Go merger, also drove Indonesian motorcycle driver unions to threaten country-wide protests.\nWhen news finally broke, just two weeks ago, that Grab-and-Go had abandoned their merger plans, the industry’s attention shifted to the parallel merger discussion between Indonesian powerhouses Gojek and Tokopedia (G&T).\nPARTNERS MADE IN TECH HEAVEN\nAt first blush, a G&T merger appears to make a lot of sense.\xa0\nThe merged entity would be worth an estimated US$18 billion, and create the most complete technology ecosystem in Indonesia, a super-app operating on a scale hitherto undreamt of, even by the ambitious Grab.\xa0\nSuch an entity would be able to expand its market share and pursue profitability by offering complementary services within a single ecosystem. Visitors to Java Jazz may finally be able to have all their needs met on one platform.\nG&T would have the critical mass necessary to quickly access public markets, and sustain the expensive subsidies that it has had to offer in its customer acquisition strategy, while its unlisted competitors continue to rely heavily on external funding.\nThe natural synergies between G&T would also allow the technology giants to cross-sell into each other’s respective pools of customers and increase user stickiness.\xa0\nImagine Tokopedia’s e-commerce business working with Gojek’s last-mile delivery solutions, or Tokopedia’s “buy-now-pay-later” schemes integrated with the services of Go-Pay and Gojek affiliate Bank Jago.\xa0\nFinally, with the notable exception of digital payments, Gojek and Tokopedia operate in different verticals, which means that a G&T merger would be less objectionable from an antitrust standpoint, and attract less opposition from regulators, consumers and private hire drivers than would a Grab-and-Go merger.\nCHALLENGES DO REMAIN\nUpon closer scrutiny, however, the challenges of a G&T merger become apparent. G&T would run the risk of spreading themselves too thin across too many battle fronts, and would have to compete with well-funded rivals across almost all their key verticals.\nG&T are also dyed-in-the-wool Indonesian companies, with either no ambition to expand beyond Indonesia, as is the case with Tokopedia, or an inconsistent overseas track record, as is the case with Gojek.\xa0\nIn order for the merger to succeed, G&T would also have to develop and implement a cohesive regionalisation strategy, but may have difficulty convincing international investors that they would be able to successfully execute such a strategy.\nFinally, notwithstanding the fact that Gojek and Tokopedia predominantly operate in different sectors, there is one important vertical in which they currently compete – digital payments.\xa0\nGojek and Tokopedia respectively control Go-Pay and Ovo, two of Indonesia’s largest e-wallets. This sets the stage for what might possibly be the most exciting battle in the unfolding Grab-Gojek-Tokopedia love triangle.\nSOMEONE TO WATCH OVO ME\nPerhaps the single greatest impediment to a G&T merger is the Indonesian central bank‘s (Bank Indonesia) “single presence policy” that prohibits a party from owning a controlling interest in more than one licensed e-money issuer such as Ovo and Go-Pay.\nThis would mean that G&T would not be able to merge their respective digital payment units, without a specific waiver from Bank Indonesia (BI).\nThis is not to say that such a waiver would be beyond the reach of G&T. Gojek and Tokopedia are funded by influential backers, who have access to the highest levels of government in Indonesia - including Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim, who is the youngest Minister of Education in Indonesia’s history.\xa0\nIt is therefore not inconceivable that BI might be persuaded to allow a merger between Ovo and Go-Pay, or at least permit a merged G&T to continue holding controlling interests in both payments companies, especially in the interest of creating a homegrown technology major.\nWhat happens, however, if BI does not approve the merger? Some say that Tokopedia will sell its stake in Ovo. Should this happen, it is likely that Grab, whose financial unit recently raised US$300 million, and who will likely have a right of first refusal on the proposed sale, will make a bid for Tokopedia’s stake in the payments company.\nSuch a move will, at least in theory, allow Grab to further entrench itself in the lucrative payments space in Indonesia.\xa0\nThis amid rumours of a possible merger between Ovo and Ant Group-backed e-wallet Dana, and barely three months after Grab invested in Indonesian state-owned e-wallet operator LinkAja. Such a move will also narrow the gap between Grab’s payments business and Gojek’s.\nBETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA\nIn his 1946 standard The Best Man, the inimitable Nat King\xa0Cole sings of how a talented and eligible suitor lost the girl of his dreams when he was blindsided by a rival whom he considered inferior.\nBy the same token, keen observers of the evolving romance between Grab, Gojek and Tokopedia over the years might have been surprised when Tokopedia, the erstwhile undisputed king of the Indonesian e-commerce sector, was recently dethroned by Sea, a quiet game developer whose market capitalisation on Nasdaq quintupled to US$140 billion during the pandemic.\nTo add insult to injury, Sea’s digital payments arm ShopeePay has risen through the ranks to become one of the leading e-wallet operators in Indonesia today.\nFor all the talk of the drama of a Grab-and-Go breakup, or a G&T merger, the enemy isn’t Grab, Gojek, or Tokopedia – the enemy is Sea. A G&T merger, if done right, would build a compelling narrative: Two household names joining forces to form Indonesiaʼs first Big Tech company.\nWill G&T prove to be a worthy adversary against the mighty Sea? It remains to be seen. Sea has a large war chest, having raised more than US$6 billion last year, and the distinct advantage of a profitable gaming business.\nG&T on the other hand, operate in notoriously unprofitable verticals and have yet to articulate a growth strategy beyond Indonesia. But never \xa0underestimate Indonesian businesses which have demonstrated, time and again, their tremendous tenacity, adaptability, and capacity for innovation.\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT\nRecent reports are that G&T might be close to finalising the terms of their merger, and that the ink may be drying on the merger agreements by the end of the month, subject only to approval by BI and competition regulators.\nThis will be followed by a complex integration process and the long road to an IPO.\nWhere will G&T list? The smart money is that they will pursue a dual-listing on Nasdaq and the Indonesian Stock Exchange, driven by tax considerations, and a desire to capitalise on nationalistic sentiments of patriotic retail investors at home.\nAn international listing will also demonstrate that Southeast Asia is not a one-hit wonder, and pave the way for other exits across the region.\nHow much credit does F&B in Singapore deserve for getting through COVID-19 thus far?

      Application installed on students' devices does not track personal information: MOE
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A device management application (DMA) installed on students\' devices does\xa0not track personal information such as their location, identification numbers or passwords, said the Ministry of Education (MOE).\nIn response to queries from CNA, the ministry said the application will, however, capture data on students\' online activities such as web search history\xa0to ""restrict access to objectionable material"". It will also capture device information such as the operating system\xa0to ""facilitate troubleshooting"".\xa0\n""The data will be stored in secure servers managed by appointed DMA vendors with stringent access controls. This is in line with the Government’s personal data laws and policies to safeguard sensitive data collected by public agencies,"" said\xa0Mr Aaron Loh, who is MOE\'s divisional director of educational technology.\nThe response\xa0comes after an online petition by a student seeking to stop MOE from installing the DMA. The petition said students were\xa0unhappy that they had to have the application installed on their devices,\xa0citing a ""need to defend our privacy"".\xa0\n""This may also put many students information and data at risk to hackers, as they can easily access the data if such program is breached,"" said the petition, which has\xa0garnered more than 6,000 signatures over a week.\nIn March last year, it was announced that\xa0all Secondary 1\xa0students will own a school-prescribed personal learning device by 2024 under a new national digital literacy programme. Other secondary school students will have such a device by\xa02028.\nAfter\xa0the\xa0COVID-19 outbreak when students shifted to online learning from home during Singapore\'s ""circuit breaker"" period, these plans were brought forward. All secondary school students will be issued with a personal laptop or tablet by this year.\nMOE\'s Mr Loh noted that during a 2019 pilot of personal learning devices in selected secondary schools, the DMA\xa0was installed in those devices.\xa0\n""Parents and teachers then affirmed the benefits and the need for the DMA. In particular, the DMA allowed teachers to have appropriate controls in place to manage students’ device usage in classrooms,"" he said.\xa0\n""Parents were also assured that the DMA could address their concerns about access to undesirable content online ...\xa0pornography, gambling ...\xa0and excessive screen time.""\nFollowing this feedback, MOE implemented the DMA in the nationwide roll-out of personal learning devices, Mr Loh said.\nThe application has clear benefits in the school environment, he added. This includes ""effective classroom management"" as teachers can make use of the DMA to focus students\' attention. It will also enhance cybersecurity\xa0as the devices are connected to the school’s IT network, Mr Loh said.\nAll personal learning devices\xa0purchased under MOE’s device bulk tender will have the application installed before they are issued to students. While\xa0existing home digital devices can be used by students,\xa0such devices will have to meet the ""necessary school specifications"" and have the DMA installed without charge, he added.\nMOE will bear the full subscription cost of the DMA for all devices and the school will also uninstall the application from the students’ devices upon their graduation.\nMr Loh noted that\xa0feedback has been expressed by some students and parents on having ""greater flexibility"" over the use of the devices.\n""We will engage them and see what arrangements can be worked out,"" he said.

      EZ-Link launches account-based cards that allow top-ups through mobile app
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: EZ-Link on Thursday (Jan 28) rolled out new account-based cards that will allow commuters to make top-ups through a mobile application.\nCommuters can also choose to update their existing cards and charms to the account-based ticketing system at various ticketing machines and TransitLink Offices islandwide, according\xa0to EZ-Link.\nThe new cards have a\xa0sticker on the back, indicating that the card is to be used with the EZ-Link app.\nExisting cards that have been updated to the new system will not receive a sticker but the change will be automatically reflected in the\xa0app if the card is linked.\nThe account-based system saves commuters the hassle of queuing to top up at ticketing machines, or having insufficient value on their travel cards with no machines nearby, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in a separate news release.\nCommuters can continue to use their existing EZ-Link cards, but the existing card-based ticketing system will be phased out ""after commuters have become familiar with the new system"", said LTA.\nFEATURES\nThe new\xa0account-based system allows commuters to top up their own accounts as well as their family members\' through the EZ-Link app.\nUsers will also be able to track their spending and receive notifications for every transaction made or when the balance\xa0in their account is\xa0low.\nIf they misplace their cards, users can block further transactions via the mobile app.\nWith the new system, card balance and trip fares will not be displayed on bus readers and MRT fare gates. This is because transactions are carried out through the backend and a longer time is required to retrieve data and reflect the transactions on the fare gates and bus readers, said LTA.\nCommuters can check their transactions at ticketing machines. Alternatively, they can also view up to the last 180 days of fare transaction history and\xa0access other ticketing services such as claims submission using the TransitLink\xa0SimplyGo app, said LTA.\nThe updated cards will also not be able to be used for motoring payments such as Electronic Road Pricing and car park charges, as they are not ""currently compatible"" with existing in-vehicle units, said EZ-Link.\n""Motorists can continue using their existing EZ-Link cards without updating, and are encouraged to link their cards to the EZ-Link app to enjoy greater benefits and digital services\xa0for their motoring needs.""\nPILOT TRIALS\nThe launch of the new cards come after a pilot trial was carried out for about\xa03,000 EZ-Link mobile app users in September last year.\nMore than 80 per cent of them reported having a ""positive"" experience using the card, said EZ-Link.\n""The ease of performing top-ups for family members and oneself anytime and anywhere, without the need for the physical card via the EZ-Link mobile app, was cited as the most liked feature of the new account-based EZ-Link card.\n""Commuters also liked that they were able to track transport spending, receive low balance notifications and earn rewards for all transactions made.""\nA pilot for concession cards that supports account-based ticketing will start later this year, said LTA.\nGATHERING FEEDBACK\nIn the past,\xa0public transport in Singapore only had a card-based ticketing system.\nA\xa0separate account-based ticketing system was set up in 2019,\xa0enabling\xa0commuters to pay for public transport fares using bank cards and mobile wallets. It currently supports contactless bank cards from Mastercard, Visa and NETS, as well as mobile wallets such as GooglePay.\nLTA said it will continue to engage different groups of commuters through focus group discussions to gather feedback for improvement.\n""For example, some participants shared that they would like a convenient means to view their transaction details at public transport nodes. To cater to this need, value-checking machines will be placed at some MRT stations and bus interchanges with high commuter traffic,"" said LTA.\n""We will also continue to explore additional means to make it more convenient for commuters to view their transaction details, including for those who might not have access to mobile applications.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     transport ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Has Razer found a new way to reach profitability?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: If you thought a computer mouse was just a moulded-plastic handheld pointing device connected to a computer to move a cursor around a visual display unit, then you probably aren’t an ardent fan of computer games.\xa0\nSerious gamers take the choosing of their gaming mouse, very seriously.\xa0\nThese gadgets are judiciously selected by gamers for their responsiveness, their weight and feel, their ergonomic design, and for the types of games they are used to play.\xa0\nUsing the right mouse could mean the difference between driving home a killer-streak and going home empty-handed.\nIt is not only the right mouse that can give professional video gamers a competitive edge. Gaming keyboards and specialty headsets can help elevate the entire gaming experience to a new level, too.\xa0\nBut these peripherals don’t come cheap. Together they can add up to hundreds of dollars, and that doesn’t even include the cost of the computer or the games itself.\xa0\nA MASSIVE INDUSTRY\nIt is little wonder that the gaming mouse and keyboard market together was worth nearly US$1.4 billion in 2020.\xa0\nIt is also projected to grow around 8.3 per cent a year to reach US$2.2 billion by 2026, which underlines the potential growth of the computer gaming industry.\xa0\nThis was worth US$151.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach US$257 billion by 2025.\xa0\nWhat is more remarkable is that the global computer games industry is bigger than both the film and music industries put together.\xa0\nIn 2018, the global box office industry was worth U$41.7 billion, whilst global music revenues reached US$19.1 billion in 2018.\xa0\nConsequently, there could be rich pickings for companies that can design the right gadgets in this multi-billion-dollar games market.\nThe key players in the lucrative peripherals market include Singapore-based Razer, America’s Corsair Gaming, Taiwan’s A4TECH, and Swiss-American peripheral maker, Logitech. But unlike many of its peers, Razer, which is listed in Hong Kong, has its fingers in other pies, too.\xa0\nMARGIN COMPRESSION\nRazer’s main business, though, is still the manufacture of hardware accessories and the development of software for the global e-sports and gaming markets.\xa0\nIts electronic gizmos are often highly rated by product reviewers for their good value for money.\xa0\nIn 2019, Razer’s peripherals and systems segment, which makes gaming laptops, keyboards, mice, and audio sets, accounted for 87 per cent of its total annual revenue of US$820 million.\xa0\nThis segment has grown at a compound rate of 22 per cent a year for Razer from US$319 million in 2015 to US$713 million in 2019, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.\xa0\nHowever, the company’s gross profit has only increased from US$100.3 million to US$143.9 million, which equates to a compound growth rate of 9 per cent a year.\xa0\nThis would imply that margins have been squeezed. In 2015, gross profit margin for laptops, mice, keyboards, and mouse mats was 31.4 per cent. By 2019, it had contracted to 20.2 per cent.\nThe margin compression is partly due to the change in Razer’s product mix. It makes significantly less profit for every dollar of sales from laptops compared to its mice, keyboards, and audio sets.\xa0\nIn 2019, the margin was 26 per cent for peripherals. It was only 10 per cent for laptops.\xa0\nBut sales of those lower-margin portable personal computers has grown from 2 per cent of revenue in 2014 to a third of total turnover in 2019.\xa0\nSOFTWARE TO THE RESCUE\xa0\nThe slow erosion of margin could be a problem for Razer, if not for its rapidly-growing software and services platform which has attracted around 80 million registered users in 2019.\xa0\nEight out of 10 of those users are under the age of 35. This segment, which includes gaming software and payment services, has been growing faster than for peripherals.\xa0\nOver the last four years, revenue has increased sevenfold from US$37 million to US$269 million.\nThis part of Razer’s business includes its Razer Fintech that provides virtual credits and payment-related services.\xa0\nIt is understandable why Razer would have liked to have built on its success in financial services through one of Singapore’s virtual banking licences. It could have opened a new business channel for the company.\xa0\nUnfortunately, it was not successful with its application.\nWHERE NEXT?\xa0\nThat said, Razer has not been deterred.\xa0\nIt intends to roll out Razer Youth Bank in other countries in the region where digital banking application processes are expected to commence soon.\nIt is also eyeing Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America where regulators are supportive of innovations to better serve the unbanked and underserved segments of the economy.\nRazer has also joined forces with Tencent to collaborate on hardware, software, and services for the e-sport and general gaming user base.\xa0\nThey will work to produce more gaming content that makes better use of Razer’s existing range of peripherals and accessories.\nThis segment could be beneficial\xa0when cloud gaming becomes more popular - wherein a person plays a game remotely from a cloud as opposed to traditional gaming, in which the game runs locally on a user\'s gaming console or personal device.\xa0\nAs with other games producers, Razer is upbeat on cloud gaming and believes\xa0it could be a ""fourth vertical"" for the company.\nCurrently, cloud gaming or gaming-as-a-service is still in its infancy primarily because of the delay between a user’s inputs and when it actually happens in the game.\xa0\nWhile\xa0existing cable speeds can meet downstream requirements for the home, cloud gaming needs high upstream performance, too.\nIn fast-paced video games, this latency could detract from a player’s enjoyment. But 5G could change all that.\xa0\nAccording to Deloitte, cloud gaming could take a larger share of game delivery market with 5G unleashing the demand by bringing speed\xa0as good as cable or fibre. It found that four out of 10\xa0youngsters said 5G would change how they use augmented and virtual reality.\nThat “fourth vertical” could be Razer’s path to bottom-line profitability, which has eluded the company since it was formed.\xa0\nThere is no urgency for Razer to be profitable though, given that it has more than US$500 million in cash.\nBut Razer is neither a start-up nor a company waiting to be listed, which would provide a payday for its early investors.\xa0\nIt is already a quoted company\xa0answerable to shareholders who will judge its performance on traditional metrics such as return on equity, return on capital and price to earnings ratio -\xa0all of which are based on its ability to generate consistent bottom-line profits.\xa0\nA debt-free and profitable Razer could be a formidable player in a fast-growing industry that shows little sign of slowing down.\xa0\nAdmittedly, some tech firms have deprioritised profit in search of growth. But growth and profitability are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to achieve both.\xa0\nWhat’s more, not every company can keep asking shareholders for more cash to fund unprofitable growth.\nDavid Kuo is the co-founder of The Smart Investor and previously the CEO of the Motley Fool Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Singapore needs a new Smart Nation vision that doesn't leave any citizen behind
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In a special edition of the World Economic Forum annual report released on Dec 16, Singapore was listed as one of the digitally advanced countries well-placed to manage the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe country was ranked sixth in the world for information and communications technology adoption and digital skills, and third in digital legal frameworks.\nThis bodes well for Singapore’s progression towards becoming a Smart Nation. The pandemic has sped up efforts in the rollout of digital government services and the implementation of hardware solutions.\nMore recent measures like the Seniors Go Digital and Hawkers Go Digital programmes rolled out in 2020 focus on providing those who need more support with better access to the digital space.\nHowever, becoming a Smart Nation requires going beyond providing hardware access. There are also “software” challenges impeding full participation and enjoyment of the benefits of a rapidly digitalising Smart Nation.\nAs recent debates on the use of TraceTogether data for serious crimes demonstrate, factors such as users’ trust in, and comfort level with technology, affect their adoption of digital services as well. \xa0\nAs Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted at the Smart Nation Summit in 2019: “Being a smart nation is not about flaunting glitzy technology, but … applying technology to solve real problems that will make a difference to people’s lives, and across the whole of society.”\nIn order to realise the vision of a Smart Nation for all, the next phase of Singapore’s Smart Nation must pivot and focus on securing impact on citizens in three ways — strengthening our digital psyche, closing the participation gap, and scaling up partnerships.\nSTRENGTHENING OUR DIGITAL PSYCHE\nThe rapid pace of technological change has led to citizens being bombarded with digital scams and misinformation, which they may not recognise on first sight.\nIn our recent study on false information, conducted with over 2,000 Singaporeans and permanent residents, seniors, and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, were found to be more susceptible to false information.\nEven people we would consider informationally savvy, such as younger Singaporeans with tertiary education, are equally vulnerable. About 47 per cent of respondents from this group failed to recognise a manipulated article, indicating that nobody is immune to false information.\nPeople with high confirmation bias and low knowledge of the digital media landscape were more vulnerable. They were more likely to believe falsehoods aligned with their existing beliefs and were unaware of how and where information online originated from.\nThese findings highlight key areas of improvement in strengthening Singaporeans’ digital psyche. In particular, public education encouraging residents to be introspective about individual biases when navigating the online space can be ramped up to build national resilience against misinformation that exploit such vulnerabilities.\nAnother is to equip people with more knowledge on the digital media and tech landscape, so they can better appreciate and assess the credibility of the online information they receive.\nThere are instructive overseas examples. Digital literacy programmes like MediaWise for Seniors in the US have been successful in encouraging seniors to adopt the habits of professional fact-checkers when assessing information online. Seniors are encouraged to ask questions like “who is behind the information?”, “what is the evidence?”\xa0and “what do other sources say?”\nAbout 85 per cent of seniors who completed the course could accurately identify disinformation, a 22 percentage point increase from before they started.\nSuch interventions are resources we can turn to when enhancing digital literacy programmes here by adapting what works for our local context.\nCLOSING THE PARTICIPATION GAP\nA second thrust of our national Smart Nation strategy should focus on closing the participatory gaps formed along age, income, and occupational lines.\nThe success of our Smart Nation ambitions depends on whether every Singaporean can fully leverage the affordances of technology.\nYet, a survey conducted by non-profit organisation Image Mission that helps underprivileged women secure employment found that almost half do not have a desktop or laptop to access the Internet.\nTheir lack of access hinders their online job searches and ability to attend online job training and interviews. If left unaddressed, such scenarios where some are unable to use technology fully could further widen social and economic inequality.\nA first step to closing these disparities is to establish a national framework that maps out key digital skills all Singaporeans should possess to fully participate in today’s digital world.\nCountries that have established such guidelines setting minimal standards residents should work towards have seen their efforts bear fruit.\nThe UK government launched an Essential Digital Skills Framework in 2018 that defined a ladder of skillsets needed for all to benefit from and contribute to the digital economy.\nThese include digital foundational skills that underpin all other digital skills, such as knowing how to connect to the Internet and maintain online login information.\nThe framework also outlines digital communication skills, such as communicating with others via email or instant messaging apps and using word processors to create and share documents like a personal resume.\nYet another group of skills looked at those needed for online transaction skills, like being able to access digital financial services and fill in request forms for public goods and services.\nEstablishing a similar framework for Singapore will help map out basic but critical digital literacies and identify the digital skills gap for different segments of society. This will aid the design of targeted interventions whether by the Government, self-help groups or non-profits to plug existing participation gaps.\nSCALING UP PARTNERSHIPS\nIn Singapore, there has been a growing number of initiatives attempting to tackle digital inequality. In the area of increasing digital access, the Government launched the aforementioned Seniors Go Digital programme and is speeding up the rollout of the National Digital Literacy Programme.\nThe private sector has been also been bolstering public sector efforts in meeting the needs of targeted segments. Organisations such as the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Singapore Airlines and Temasek Foundation donated and distributed mobile phones to various communities during the pandemic, in addition to face masks, hand sanitisers.\nThe people sector has also stepped up to provide ground-up solutioning to help fill existing gaps. Initiatives like Engineering Good collected and donated laptops to low-income students. Others, like SG Bono and Readable Asia, have conducted classes for children on how to access the Internet safely.\nTo combat the ongoing “infodemic”, where falsehoods relating to the pandemic were widely circulated, individuals and ground-up groups have developed information dashboards to help spread advisories and accurate information.\nOthers helped make fact-checking accessible to the public by producing videos in vernacular languages and creating parodies to debunk fake news. These are critical to boost people’s digital psyche.\nWhile people, organisations and agencies should have the flexibility and autonomy to respond to problems and gaps in digital psyche and digital participation, there could be overlaps and duplications of efforts. While the Government has been leading Smart Nation efforts, the people and private sector have shown they can play meaningful ways in fulfilling these needs.\nThe Government could look into how to catalyse action by these actors. One way is to develop a one-stop digital platform for the sharing and bridging of efforts would help foster partnerships across different segments of society.\nIn so doing, those whose work helps grow digital inclusion will be able to minimise overlaps, optimise resources and scale up their efforts.\nSingapore has come far in its Smart Nation efforts, even taking a huge leap during this pandemic year to help businesses and residents adopt digital technology. Moving forward, it could afford to focus on inclusivity in ensuring that no citizens are left behind.\nCarol Soon is Senior Research Fellow and Head of the Society and Culture department at the Institute of Policy Studies.

      While Bitcoin price surges, ramped up cryptocurrency mining takes heavy toll on the planet
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: During good times, mining for Bitcoin is an around the clock job.\nIn Nonthaburi, a province outside Bangkok, through the day and night one facility’s thousands of machines are on the hunt. An ordinary factory from the outside, inside row upon row of machinery sits quietly at work in the dim light, in an enormous 16,000 sqm\xa0space.\nThis mining operation is said to be the biggest in Southeast Asia and the bounty it is looking to unlock has become more valuable than ever before.\xa0\nBehind the fluctuating rise of Bitcoin lies the cold, constant reality of how it is accessed. The nature of its software means each Bitcoin transaction requires a large amount of electricity and leaves a carbon footprint that is worsening the onset of climate change.\xa0\nJust like in 2017 when the price for Bitcoin dramatically spiked, the latest run has seen budding investors flock to cryptocurrency markets in search of a quick fortune. For those in Thailand, turning to mining services like ZMINE\xa0are a gateway into the crypto game - by lending their computer equipment to the “farm”, they get back a share of the spoils.\nIn March last year, the price for the digital currency sat just above US$5,000. Nine months later it peaked at more than US$40,000 on Jan 8. It was the latest surge in a highly speculative market.\nFor mining farms like ZMINE, the past few weeks have been\xa0the welcome return of a boom period, following years of struggling to profit.\n“We had some difficult times when\xa0we had to shut down our mining farm because it’s not worth it. In the last six months, we just got back to operating. It wasn’t a 100 per cent shutdown but we could do it only in the night time because of the electricity cost,” said ZMINE\xa0CEO, Kasamapat Vithanwattana.\n“We’ve had a bad time, but we’ve passed that time,” he said.\nWhile it may offer relative anonymity, secrecy and freedom from government interference, Bitcoin is still leaving a hefty trail in its wake.\nMining involves solving complex algorithms with specialised computers. Using their own hardware, miners help add to Bitcoin’s blockchain platform by verifying and recording financial transactions.\nThe more machines a miner operates, the more rewards are\xa0likely to be received in the form of unlocking new currency. But these mathematical calculations are - by design - getting more difficult, increasing the need for more and more powerful computers.\nIt is estimated by analysts of global cryptocurrency mining that a single transaction uses an amount of electricity that could power an American household for one month or a user watching YouTube for five and a half years. One Bitcoin transaction uses the same electricity as more than 650,000 Visa transactions.\xa0\nThe pure size of ZMINE’s facility means it is a major consumer of electricity. It is running around\xa011,000 graphics card units, the device of choice for miners wanting to perform multiple calculations at the same time to solve the coin puzzle. As a result, Kasamapat says his operation’s monthly energy bill ranges from US$130,000 to US$230,000.\n“Some say it’s proof of waste. Proof of work is proof of waste. But we are fundamentally about the blockchain community that was born with Bitcoin,” he said.\nStill, there are climate consequences of tapping so much power and it has become a pressing global issue. And not all electricity used by Bitcoin mining is made equal.\n\n\nA SERIOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY\nAnalysis\xa0has shown\xa0that the vast majority of electricity powering Bitcoin mining comes from fossil fuels. The activity is most common in China, and increasingly in countries that can provide a cheap, steady supply of power, making Iran and Kazakhstan popular set-up locations.\xa0\nAlex de Vries, a financial economics expert and founder of Digiconomist, “a platform that is dedicated to exposing the unintended consequences of digital trends”, says there is ample proof that coal is fuelling Bitcoin.\nHe estimates that Bitcoin is already consuming potentially up to one per cent of global energy, a number that could continue to rise alongside the currency’s price.\n“Right now you can see that with the amount of money that these miners are earning, this network could increase in size to consume as much electricity as a country like Sweden, which is almost double where my Bitcoin index shows where it stands today,” he said, noting that Bitcoin makes up only about half of the cryptocurrency mining using the proof of work mechanism.\n“The Bitcoin price action is usually a lot faster than the energy action but that doesn’t mean that the energy isn’t going to catch up with the price.\n“If the number goes up like this, probably within this year, this network is going to be consuming more electricity than all the data centres worldwide - that run the Internet, cloud servers, financial systems, anything. That’s getting into a very serious amount of energy,” he said.\nMining across Southeast Asia appears to be picking up, as operators relocate away from tightening regulations in China.\xa0\nLikewise, interest from new investors and miners alike has grown in Thailand due to the high prices, just like in 2017, says Rit Bencharit, the co-founder of Bitcoin Addict Thailand, one of the largest cryptocurrency communities in the country.\nBillboards around Bangkok advertising local coin exchanges and investment opportunities attest to the current wave of excitement surrounding Bitcoin.\n“There are some similarities and differences to 2017. The (phenomenon of) newbies trying to get in is the same. The same FOMO to try and buy Bitcoin. I get five phone calls every day from people asking me what Bitcoin is,” he said.\nHe estimates that there are about one million trading accounts open in the country, but the number of advanced traders is just a fraction of that, with many more beginners just looking to make fast money without understanding how cryptocurrencies work.\n“They don’t know the risks, they just want the reward. That’s the scary part of the crypto market in Thailand right now.”\n\n\nDIRTY ROOTS\nIn Thailand, like much of Southeast Asia, the vast majority of electricity is generated from dirty sources, like coal power plants and natural gas. A faster shift to clean renewables would naturally reduce the impact of crypto mining.\xa0\n“In some places, electricity use doesn\'t have so many consequences. But if you’re talking about a place like China where most of the electricity comes from carbon, then the impact of electricity is not the same,” said Camilo Mora, an associate professor of geography at the University of Hawaii, Manoa.\nA report co-authored by Mora in 2018, following the first Bitcoin price spike, presented the bleak prospects of a fast incorporation of the technology that powers crypto mining. The report found that Bitcoin alone could produce enough emissions to raise global temperatures by two degrees Celsius as soon as 2033.\nYet, rather than helping to expedite that transition, there are many examples of the allure of Bitcoin helping fossil fuel power generation to hold on even longer.\nIn the United States, a natural gas power plant is using its own energy generation to enable Bitcoin mining on a massive scale instead of selling electricity to the public, which it now only serves during peak demand periods.\nMeantime in Russia’s Siberia, one of the world’s biggest gas producers is situating mining centres nearby to its oil drilling sites to provide cut-price electricity and increase cost viability for crypto operators.\n“Normally, competition was putting these generators out of business, which we might think is okay, as a humanity. There are some times where we just have to let go,” Mora said.\n“Now these electricity companies who are struggling to sell their power at a viable price are starting to mine Bitcoin. It will prolong the existence of these technologies.”\nFor ZMINE, environmental impact is of little concern, according to Kasamapat. Right now, the cheap and readily available energy in Thailand is conducive to doing business, as long as the market price is right.\n“It’s not a big consideration but at some point, maybe, because other countries have lower electricity costs. In the future, electricity like from a solar cell must be cheaper so maybe renewables could be a consideration,” he said.\nHe acknowledges that the price of electricity could become a factor in the future, depending on the country’s energy mix and policies. At present though, he says, the government is happy to take his sizeable business.\n“They sell, we pay, that’s it. If we take electricity from you we pay. They’re happy, we’re happy. That’s it.”\xa0\nMora says that attitude just does not cut it given the pressing urgency of climate change action. He believes crypto miners globally need to take more responsibility for their carbon impact.\xa0\n“It’s sad when you analyse it. I can see people losing their mind to this ambition,” he said.\n“When people have the rights to capitalise on this, they also have societal responsibilities to fulfill. They should balance these tradeoffs a little more by having some environmental responsibility as well.”\xa0\n""EVERYONE IS GREEDY""\nWhile Thailand has some of the more advanced frameworks for the domestic cryptocurrency ecosystem in the ASEAN region, like many nations it does not regulate mining centres.\nIndeed, finding solutions to this vast amount of energy waste will be difficult, de Vries, the financial economics expert, explains. “Globally we could decide we’re not going to allow these facilities anymore. But if only one country does it, they’ll go to the next country,” he said.\n“The best thing you can do from an external point of view, is not driving the price of bitcoin any higher. The higher the price goes, the more these miners will earn and the more they will spend on wasting resources. It’s that simple.”\n\n\nNot all cryptocurrency works the same. Another popularly traded coin and large-scale competitor to Bitcoin - Ethereum - is considering shifting its software away from mining altogether. But these platforms are not easily reformed.\n“The part that consumes a lot of energy - the mining - is only part of the software. The community could agree to change that. That’s not a very likely thing to happen right now,” de Vries said.\n“It is possible to do it but the problem is the community mindset. Bitcoin miners typically don’t like change.""\xa0\nRit of Bitcoin Addict Thailand says that market forces are likely to determine where the technology goes and where the money flows. He does not see the demise or alteration of mining anytime soon.\n“I think the proof of work that Bitcoin is using is still going to last until it’s not worth it anymore. It depends on the price,” he said.\n“Everyone is greedy. When they see Bitcoin rise, of course the mining also becomes profitable. Everyone loves the words passive income.”\n“They all have some small greed in their heart.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     Bitcoin ', '     Thailand ', '     technology ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Live streaming: How businesses turn viewership into revenue
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From any online device anywhere in the world – you can watch pandas laze the day away at their home in Chengdu, or check out rare artifacts in a museum overseas.\nThis is thanks to live streaming – or the broadcasting of live video in real time.\nLive streaming has been around since the early days of the Internet. But increasingly, businesses around the world are now catching on to the potential of such video streams to promote and sell their products.\nOne of the pioneers was the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Taobao Live was launched in 2016.\nIn 2020, like many other online platforms, it saw growth during the pandemic. From February 2020, the number of businesses that adopted live streaming for the first time on the platform has jumped by 700 per cent, said Ms Bonnie Zhao, head of Taobao Live Product at Alibaba Group.\n""When offline retail was not able to proceed in the normal way, through live streaming, we provided for entrepreneurs and this gave them a new lifeline,"" said Ms Zhao.\nSHOPPERTAINMENT\nIt is estimated that about 560 million people use live streaming in China. That is about 62 per cent of the country’s total number of Internet users.\nThis user base has spawned a new concept – “shoppertainment” - or the integration of entertainment and commerce.\nChina’s live streaming e-commerce sector was worth an estimated US$60 billion in 2019, and is expected to double by the end of this year.\nSuch growth has been helped by rapid advances in technology.\nMobile phone screens have increased in size, and the network in China has moved rapidly from 2G to 5G.\nThe rest of the world is increasingly catching up too.\nLUXURY LIVE STREAMING\nLouis Vuitton recently became the first major international luxury brand to join the live streaming model. Its Summer 2020 collection was live streamed in collaboration with a Chinese retail app.\nAnd here in Southeast Asia, Pomelo recently debuted an in-app live stream technology.\nMr David Jou, CEO of Pomelo, noted the differences between the markets in the region.\nThe biggest adoption has been in Thailand, he said. In Indonesia, engagement levels have been high, but actual conversions have lagged behind. As for the Singapore market, Mr Jou says it is already an advanced one, and so live streaming may be more for content than for commerce.\nIndustry leaders know that building on this content can help to establish a stronger fan base for their products.\nMs Zhao said: “Live streaming is not just about satisfying your wants. It’s about creating more wants in your life. It is more than just a simple business transaction. It has evolved, and it is now about getting fans, personalising the experience, and gaining loyalty from consumers.”\nBoy band BTS has shown what a big hit this business model can be.\nMore than 750,000 fans from over 100 countries tuned in for the group’s virtual concert in June. It was a new world record, but it didn’t last long. In October, BTS broke their own record, attracting an even bigger virtual audience – 993,000 across 191 countries and regions.\nFans had to log in via the group’s own tech platform. It is a business ecosystem that doesn’t just sell concert tickets, but also builds up long-term engagement with the brand.\nAnd that opens up growth possibilities for entrepreneurs across many sectors.\n\nFor those looking to jump on the live streaming bandwagon, experts agree that engaging the audience is key.\xa0\nHormese Tharakan is commercial director at tech consultancy ThoughtWorks.\nHe said live streaming is here to stay, and so businesses need to start making it part of their business strategy.\n“The key difference is going to be, who can get it right. And to get it right, it’s content which drives data, data drives insight and these insights help you create more personalised experiences for the users.\n""These personalised experiences are now going to drive your sales. But driving the sales is not the last mile. What you would also need to do is set up a whole cycle which leads to building trust and loyalty.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     technology ', '     e-commerce ', '     retail ']}"

      Commentary: On the contrary, low-skilled jobs aren’t going anywhere
  </h1>, 'text': ""TURIN: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the role of low-skilled labour in the economy was assumed to be in decline.\nIn digitally disrupted labour markets, where fancy STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) professions enjoy pride of place, only highly qualified professionals can thrive.\nThose whose jobs are threatened by new technologies are condemned to precariousness, redundancy, downward mobility and declining standards of living.\nThe pandemic has partly debunked this narrative, by revealing which workers truly are essential. It turns out that there still are no good technological substitutes for the street cleaners, shopkeepers, utility workers, food deliverers, truckers, or bus drivers who have kept the economy running through the darkest days of the crisis.\nIn many cases, these workers perform tasks that require situational adaptability and physical abilities of a kind that cannot easily be coded into software and replicated by a robot.\nLOW-SKILLED JOBS THE BY-PRODUCTS OF TECH ADVANCES\nThe fact that these least-skilled workers are resilient to new technologies should not come as a surprise.\nPrevious industrial revolutions followed a similar pattern. At a minimum, human workers are usually still needed to supervise, maintain or complement the machines.\nAnd in many cases, they play a key role in the new disruptive business models of any given era. The challenge has always been to close the gap between the social value these workers create and the wages they receive.\nLow-skilled jobs are usually regarded as those that new technologies will co-opt over time. But most of these jobs are themselves by-products of technological progress.\nMechanics, electricians, plumbers, and telecommunications installers all owe their occupations to past technological breakthroughs, and it is these workers who now ensure the proper functioning of the world’s machinery, power grids, water systems and the Internet.\nPYRAMID STRUCTURE OF WORK LARGELY THE SAME\nInnovation does not alter the traditional pyramid structure of work, whereby a few highly qualified positions at the top oversee a hierarchy of lower-skilled occupations.\nRather, what technology changes is the composition of the pyramid, by continuously replenishing it with new and more sophisticated tasks, while removing the most routine ones through automation.\nThere are still assembly lines today; but a job in a factory that is fully controlled by software and populated by intelligent robots is completely different from a job in a state-of-the-art factory in the 1950s.\nBehind their sleek digital facades, most of today’s Big Tech companies rely heavily on low-skilled workers. In 2018, the median salary of an Amazon employee was less than US$30,000, reflecting what most of its employees do: Manage inventories and fulfill orders in warehouses.\nThe same is true of the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla, where the median salary was about US$56,000 in 2018: Around one-third of its employees work in its assembly plants.\nAnd while Facebook’s median salary in 2018 was US$228,000, this figure does not account for the tens of thousands of low-wage contract workers that the company relies on for content moderation.\nThese patterns are especially evident in the gig economy, where software and algorithms provide the platform (a two-sided market) to sell specific services performed by real workers.\nNo matter how sophisticated Uber’s ride-hailing and delivery apps are, the company simply would not exist without its cab drivers and delivery workers.\nSECOND-CLASS LABOUR\nBut all too often, the people working at the end of the platform-economy value chain are treated as second-class labour, not even rising to the level of staff.\nUnlike the engineers and the programmers designing and updating the apps, they are employed as contractors with scant workplace protection.\nLikewise, artificial intelligence, widely seen as the main source of technological unemployment in the future, would not exist without the contributions of millions of digital blue-collar workers – particularly in the developing world – toiling away on the assembly lines of the data economy.\nMost machine-learning algorithms need to be trained on voluminous data sets that are manually “cleansed” and “tagged” by human annotators who categorise content. For an algorithm to determine that an image of a car is in fact a car, someone generally needs to have tagged the picture accordingly.\nFORGING A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT\nGiven the realities of the digital economy, there is no excuse for treating low-qualification jobs as synonymous with low-quality jobs.\nToday’s “low-skilled” workers may not have advanced academic degrees, but many are in fact skilled technicians who have mastered certain knowledge domains and techniques. Acknowledging this will be crucial for re-establishing these workers’ negotiating power and forging a new social contract.\nTo that end, trade unions have an opportunity to regain influence and push for fairer treatment of the least qualified, including the gig workers who tend to fall off their radar screens.\nBut large corporations (not just in the tech sector) also need to rethink how they assess and reward the contributions of low-skilled workers. It will take pressure from above and below to close the gap (in terms of both salaries and benefits) between those at the top and the bottom of the pyramid.\nFinally, governments must do more to support the educational needs of skilled technicians, because even the most basic tasks will evolve over time.\nKeeping pace with innovation requires continuous upgrading of skills to remain competitive in the labour market.\nIn terms of overall resources, investment in this segment of human capital should be similar to that for skilled professionals, though the two educational paths would of course be structured differently.\nWorkers with fewer formal qualifications will remain a central and indispensable part of the digital economy. It is political and business decisions – not new technologies – that threaten to push them to the margins.\nEdoardo Campanella is a fellow at the Center for the Governance of Change at IE University in Madrid.\nListen to economists debate the Progressive Wage Model and discuss how to raise wages for Singapore's poorest earners:\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     jobs ', '     Big Tech ', '     labour ']}"

      Commentary: Elon Musk's recent trial spacecraft may have exploded, but we are one step closer to Mars
  </h1>, 'text': 'CAMBRIDGE: Private company SpaceX launched SN8, a prototype of its Starship spacecraft, designed to go to the Moon and Mars, on Dec 10. Its short flight attracted a great deal of attention for its final few seconds before landing – when it exploded.\nBut consider the near perfect totality of its six-and-a-half-minute flight. Look at the groundbreaking technology and manoeuvres involved. It is reasonable to view this as a hugely successful test.\nOrdinary spacecraft return to Earth by using the “aerodynamic drag” in the atmosphere to slow their re-entry. Decelerating from 20,000 miles per hour dissipates a lot of heat which is why they carry heat shields, and the final touchdown is controlled by parachutes.\nThe actual rocket engines don’t make a safe landing – they burn up and crash into the sea.\nThis is a real waste of resources. SpaceX’s founder and CEO Elon Musk is instead trying to reuse as much of the spacecraft as possible.\nIf your ultimate destination is the Moon and onward to Mars, this makes a lot of sense because you can much more easily refuel at judicious locations along the way than build a new rocket.\nA FULLY REUSABLE ROCKET\nStarship is a fully reusable rocket system designed to carry 100 tonnes of cargo into Earth orbit and beyond.\nIt has a “booster” first stage which propels it into orbit and separates. The booster stage is designed to land safely and to be reused.\nSpaceX figured out how to do this with the Falcon rocket, but that’s only two thirds of the system. With Starship, the third of the system that helps propel the spacecraft further than Earth orbit is never ejected.\nLanding the first stage booster is “easy” because it is ejected two minutes after launch and therefore returns to Earth from a relatively low altitude – never reaching super high speeds.\nNASA defines “high” hypersonic speed as a “Mach number” from 10 to 25. The booster only reaches about Mach 6.\nStarship itself will be returning from orbit, reaching Mach 25. At this speed, the heat of reentry will melt the engines off.\nYou therefore need a substantial heat shield which dissipates 99 per cent of the energy – protecting the cargo and those all-important rockets that you need for landing.\nNASA’s partially reusable Space Shuttle had huge wings used to glide the vehicle onto a runway. But wings are heavy and they reduce the potential payload capacity.\nAlso, they won’t work on Mars or the Moon because there’s a lack of atmosphere – and runways.\nBELLY-FLOP DYNAMICS\nThe ingenuity of Starship is that it just “belly-flops” all the way down – a type of free fall in which the atmosphere gradually slows down its speed.\nAs it nears the ground, it should be slow enough for a short flip-and-landing burn to touch down softly on the pad.\nNo other vehicle flies like this on purpose. Planes are designed to keep the air flow attached to the wings to provide lift. If you lose that air flow, you fall out of the sky – a condition called stall.\nStarship enters the atmosphere at a 90 degree angle. That means it is fully stalled. Just as a leaf flutters to the ground this is an inherently unstable configuration and the aerodynamics are impossible to predict.\nThis is where active control comes in. Starship has four flaps and they’re used just as a skydiver uses their four arms to control free fall.\nWith the SN8 test flight, Space X has shown that it’s possible to control a belly-flop. The drop from 12.5km gave SpaceX the conditions of the last half of a return back from orbit.\nSpaceX will have gathered flight data that allows it to know how the aerodynamics of a belly-flop work. In particular, it will know how well the flaps work and how precisely to keep the craft stable and land it on target.\nWe can see on the videos released by SpaceX that the flaps are under good control. This looks like great news for SpaceX.\nENORMOUS AMOUNT OF FUEL NEEDED FOR LANDING\nBeing fully reusable, Starship should work out far cheaper than conventional single use craft. But it’s a tricky business to work out exactly how much fuel you need to carry.\nConventional aircraft always take off with a bit of fuel to spare, but they can always make an emergency landing if they miscalculate.\nRockets need to launch with an enormous amount of fuel just to be sure you have enough for the landing. It’s like going on a 14-day camping trip and spending 13 days carrying the water for your last day.\nIt’s likely that the tank for SN8 was almost completely empty when it came in to land.\nThe amount of fuel you need is given by “the rocket equation”. This shows that if you want to launch 100 tonnes of payload to the Moon at a speed of 12,000 metres per second you need a staggering 2,000 tonnes of fuel.\nWhen it comes to the type of fuel, it’s interesting that kerosene and hydrogen (as used by Apollo 11) are still the most popular rocket fuels around. The laws of physics and chemistry haven’t changed very much in fifty years.\nBut Starship is actually pioneering the use of methane as a fuel. Despite being harder to work with, it gives a bit more thrust.\nAnd perhaps more importantly there’s plenty of methane on Mars, which is obviously the ultimate destination for SpaceX.\nSo why did SN8 crash?\nYou can see in the video some green flashes just before landing. The engines are made with copper, which burns with a characteristic green flame.\nSpaceX says there was a problem with fuel pressure just at the last moment, meaning the rocket couldn’t slow down. The resulting excess oxygen started burning up the engines themselves.\nIf it weren’t for the last few seconds then the landing could have been perfect. Engineers will now be looking to fix that problem for SN9.\nHugh Hunt is Reader in Engineering Dynamics and Vibration at the University of Cambridge.

      IN FOCUS: Thailand poised to be regional leader in electric vehicle revolution, and all it needs is a spark
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: It was\xa0a postcard picture day off the coast of Phuket as a sleek, modern ferry embarked\xa0on its maiden voyage. The battery-powered vessel slipped\xa0from the dock in near silence and jetted\xa0towards the limestone karsts on the horizon.\nThis was\xa0the launch of a vessel\xa0that its backers hope will revolutionise sea travel and tourism around Thailand’s picturesque islands and beaches, normally a magnet for millions of visitors every year.\nThe e-Ferry is powered by 625 kWh lithium-ion batteries sourced from Singaporean battery maker Durapower. It allows the vessel to cruise at 17 knots, taking tourists to some of the most awe-inspiring sights in the kingdom’s south, without producing any emissions to damage the environment.\nUsing just this single e-ferry for one year will reduce emissions\xa0equivalent to\xa0planting 8,700 trees, according to project collaborator Banpu Next, the innovation-focused subsidiary of powerful parent energy company, Banpu, whose core business has long been coal and gas.\n“When the world is calling for lower carbon emissions, we are foreseeing this same challenge and are now transitioning to cleaner and smarter assets in our strategy,” said the group’s CEO Somruedee Chaimongkol.\nThe environmental impacts of vessels like this could be enormous; around the Andaman Sea area there are approximately 2,000 marine tourism boats.\nIt is also symbolic of the start of a greater movement that is pressing to transform the future of Thailand’s transportation sector and make an impact on its damaging environmental footprint.\nVehicles powered by electricity instead of conventional fuels are slowly starting to emerge on Thailand’s roads, rails and waterways. The world is looking to enact solutions to tackle the climate crisis and the mobilisation of electric vehicle (EV) fleets is becoming an increasingly viable way to reduce carbon footprints.\xa0\nThailand is at a critical juncture. It has work to do to meet its climate targets under the Paris Agreement, while Bangkok continues to endure prolonged periods of elevated air pollution, much of which is caused by vehicles.\nThe country’s central role in global auto production though has it strategically placed to take advantage of new innovation\xa0and companies are already positioning\xa0themselves.\nPIVOT\xa0TOWARDS\xa0ELECTRIC VEHICLES\nA place long known as the Land of Smiles has for decades also been the land of automobiles. Away from the country’s iconic shimmering seas and ancient temples, in the grey industrial estates that sprawl outside Bangkok, the cars of the world have been assembled for decades.\nThe automotive sector is one of Thailand’s most important. The country is the eleventh biggest car manufacturer in the world and the fourth in Asia, only behind the powerhouse nations of China, Japan and South Korea.\xa0\nThailand’s legacy assets and skills, all set up to produce conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, face being wiped out by the electric wave. Already the industry has taken a major hit during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut within five years, the Thai government wants the country to become a hub for something new.\xa0\nA national roadmap will aim to promote EV manufacturing to the extent that it makes up 30 per cent of total annual car production, or about 750,000 units, by the end of the decade. Tax incentives are being rolled out to encourage big players to build their EV fleets in Thailand.\nIt is mobilising state agencies to power a fast transition, starting with public transportation and infrastructure, like charging stations and battery swapping facilities.\xa0\nThe police force is leasing a fleet of electric Tesla Model 3s for patrols, Bangkok City Hall is replacing diesel ferries with electric models to link the Chao Phraya river and train services, and battery-powered public buses are in a testing phase in anticipation of a widespread rollout.\xa0\n“The government set a goal that by 2037, there should be around 2.5 million EV cars. And in order to get to that point, the government must support the building of infrastructure, the change of mindsets and making people trust that if they use EVs, it will be safe,” said Somchai Chokmaviroj, the director of the Research and Innovation Division of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT).\nThe big questions are whether Thailand will be able to compete in a globally charged industry where technology is changing rapidly on a massive scale and if consumers will make the jump, when EVs remain exclusive, expensive and limited.\nGRIT AND STEEL\nAware of the opportunities, local companies have begun to position themselves in terms of innovation and investments.\nSakun C’s new assembly plant is an expansive space, its size exaggerated by its emptiness. Soft afternoon light filters through high windows onto a working floor, where aluminum chassis of various vehicle prototypes are being inspected by workers.\xa0\nSoon, it is anticipated that advanced robots will be assembling thousands of buses every year here, as well as electric trains and boats of various designs, including the e-Ferry, which the company designed, assembled and put on the water in Phuket, alongside Banpu Next.\nIt is an ambitious push by the Thai company to revive domestic innovation and ensure locally-made technology is viable, in the face of a surge of EV development overseas.\nSakun C is a subsidiary of Choknomchai Group, the largest car producer in Southeast Asia with an extensive domestic network of parts suppliers. It has been making cars for the likes of Honda, Toyota and Nissan for two decades.\nBut according to Sakun C’s CEO Weeraphon Techaphasuksanti, continuing to simply manufacture vehicles for others will not be enough in the looming age of the electric vehicle.\nHe wants to stimulate a tenuous industry and create new jobs by creating a strong local brand. It does not mean picking a fight with the Japanese companies that have sent their business to Thailand for years, rather finding lower volume gaps in the sector and the types of vehicles that the country really needs.\n“It’s really good timing for us now to have our own brand. Everyone is on the same level. Everyone has to restart. It’s a good opportunity for Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines; everyone is very excited about this opportunity. They all want to produce,” Weeraphon said.\nBut Thailand’s advantage over its ASEAN neighbours is its long-built expertise and technology.\n“Definitely in my opinion Thailand is in a good position. Because before electric cars, normally we’re building cars for the world under many brands. We have these skills already. So when the new technology comes, it’s not that complicated and we have our knowledge base,” he told CNA.\n“Body and engine technology means we haven’t been able to have Thai brands. But we’re very lucky because now the engine’s gone. We have dye making, eco-design engineering, part producing. We’ve built our assembly plant to build the body. With the engine gone, it means the parts we need are just on the shelf.”\nSakun C is focused on light, resilient aluminum bodies that will suit an EV platform, rather than steel, traditionally used in Japanese carmaking. Aluminum is three times lighter than steel and can be assembled much more quickly.\nIts minibuses and city buses are road ready, accelerated by research assistance from the National Science and Technology Development Agency, a government agency that has invested in the company.\nWeeraphon is hopeful the partnership means Thai-made buses could soon replace their pollution-spewing diesel predecessors on the streets of Bangkok, and in tourism-centric regions of the country.\xa0\n“The world is calling for this kind of vehicle. I think it’s going to come much earlier than we expected. If we have our own brand a form of innovation is going to happen,” he said.\n“If we don’t do these projects, it means we’re ignoring the needs of the country. If we have this technology, that means we wait for Chinese or other people to take Thai industry away. We would have no choice if the big players come and acquire everything in Thailand. We’re going to lose everything if we do nothing.”\nHis company is not alone. There is a raft of private newcomers to the automaking scene who are ready to ascend Elon Musk-style to the pinnacle of a fast growing industry and others looking to carve out niche pathways to decongest Bangkok.\nBORN IN THE GARAGE: EMISSION FREE TUK\xa0TUKS\nIt is a common theme that some of the world’s most successful start-ups began in a garage. For many of Thailand’s budding auto start-ups, the same is true.\nWith little government support and few incentives within reach, most small players in the electric vehicle industry in Thailand are on a long and solitary road. And while cooperation exists between\xa0the startups, there is also competition.\nOn the outskirts of the capital, Chayoot Sripian proudly steps through the warehouse-cum-showroom of his fledgling company, Power Up TukTuk. His fleet right now comprises just a handful of the iconic Thai vehicles, but his ambitions are overflowing.\xa0\nThe concept is to build a platform for emission-free tuk tuks that can be accessed by all. The idea was inspired by his elderly grandmother who before her death found it difficult to get around Bangkok.\n“My grandma went to Lumpini Park every day for her whole life. One day when it became difficult for her to walk at the age of 93, we decided she needed to use a wheelchair,” Chayoot recounted.\n“After that, when I asked my grandma if she wanted to go to Lumpini Park, she would say ‘no, I don’t want to go’. But I know that actually she does want to go but she doesn't want to be a burden. So she stayed home. I think a lot of elderly think like that and stay like that.\xa0\n“When I’m thinking about my grandma, I’m thinking of all the other people who couldn’t afford a car that can take a wheelchair. There are so many elderly left at home because it’s too difficult to travel. Taxi drivers have to carry them, have to trust them, and the roadside taxis won’t pick them up,” he said.\nPower Up has re-engineered a conventional tuk tuk, removing the drivetrain and installing a centrally positioned battery. The result is a lower, more accessible vehicle that can accommodate a wheelchair or less mobile passenger.\nChayoot is still trying to scale up his concept and bring it to market.\xa0“I’m not Elon Musk. I don’t have that much money. I’m not a public company,” he conceded.\n“For these companies, it’s very challenging. You need to have very good resources, enough capital and human resources. You have to compete with the giant corporate companies who have the technology and the human resources,” said Dr Yossapong Laoonual, a leading academic, founding head of the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand (EVAT) and member of the National Electric Vehicle Policy Committee.\n“This is very difficult for a country like Thailand,” he said.\n\n\nTHE SCENT OF MUSK\nWhile they may not have the money, what inspires many budding EV entrepreneurs is clear - one man - Elon Musk of Tesla.\nThe imprint on this industry of a pioneer of the global electric vehicle industry is profound. It has small companies dreaming of loftier heights.\xa0\nFor self-professed “nerd and gear head”, Nataphat Lertviriyasawat, Tesla was the perfect business case study to model his electric motorcycle start-up on.\xa0\n“Tesla is the first company that can say to the market that we don’t need to rely on gasoline alone anymore. You have a choice and it can work,” he said.\nHe even - coincidentally he claims - named his company after Thomas Edison, a bitter rival of engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla. The two men fought a war over whose electric currents would power the world in the 1880s. Far from competing now though, Nataphat simply wants a fragment of the success of the American EV and technology behemoth.\xa0\nAfter already being dubbed the “Tesla on two wheels” during participation in an innovation competition in China, he believes his company is primed to make an impact.\nIt is a sector where EV innovation has been painfully slow to reach consumers: the exception being China where bans on ICE vehicles in big cities has seen hundreds of millions of two and three wheelers hit its roads.\xa0\nDespite the lack of EV adoption so far, the size of the potential market in the ASEAN region cannot be ignored. Motorcycles far outweigh cars on Southeast Asian roads. In Thailand alone, there are about 21 million registered motorcycles, double the number of sedans, yet there are less than 10,000 electric or hybrid motorcycles in operation.\n“We never saw e-bikes on the road. That’s why we started to try and figure out what the problem was. Why can’t the e-bike enter the market? We narrowed it down to four main problems at that time - low performance compared to a gasoline bike, the range is too short, the charging time is too long and the serviceability is crap,” Nataphat said.\nWith a nod to the Tesla business model, Edison embarked on designing a “platform” with aesthetics, speed and reliability, regardless of price.\xa0\n“It’s a similar strategy to Tesla, who launched a sports car first for the top end to adopt. That’s the way we’re going right now, into a niche market or early adopters,” he said.\nEnvironmental benefits are a non-factor in Edison’s approach to encouraging riders to switch to electric, even though motorcycles typically produce more damaging greenhouse gases than cars.\xa0\n“We have to look at the whole ecosystem of electric vehicles. We need to attract people to the industry. Otherwise, it is meaningless. You can build it and say it is\xa0environmentally friendly but people still need to adopt it,” Nataphat said.\n“Never once have I said that electric vehicles will save the planet. We want to focus on the fact that this is an EV that actually works. And then the process of changing the world, changing the carbon footprint, comes later.”\nYet, the environmental impacts of removing combustion engines from the roads are clear. The benefits of doing so just have not been fully realised in Thailand yet.\nGREEN ATTITUDES\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, seeing commuters wearing a face mask in Bangkok was already a fairly regular sight. Like many growing cities, air pollution can periodically stifle the Thai capital, forcing people to try and protect their lungs.\nWith zero tailpipe emissions and better efficiency than conventional vehicles, electric vehicles are a logical solution to easing some of Bangkok’s PM2.5 issues.\xa0\n“The problem of the rising pollution will be a driving force for any government. Electric vehicles are a solution. That solution can be used straight away. It’s not only an emissions issue, it’s a climate change issue - a global issue,” said Yossapong of EVAT.\n“The source of the PM2.5 is the exhaust from automobiles. If we’re not solving it by using a better technology, the problem will stay with us for another ten years.”\nAnalysis backs up his claims. The International Energy Agency stated this year that EVs, “are a key technology to reduce air pollution in densely populated areas and a promising option to contribute to energy diversification and greenhouse gas emissions reduction objectives”.\nAnd transport needs to be cleaned up in Asia. More than 30 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases from transport and buildings is produced on the continent, based on analysis by international consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute.\xa0\nHowever, the true climate gains will only be realised once deeper changes are made to Thailand’s energy mix.\nPresently, the majority of Thailand’s power generation is from dirty sources - coal and natural gas. The wind and solar energy industries are in early development stages, hampered by the country’s significant national power surplus. State energy agency EGAT has shown reluctance to disrupt its fossil fuel-driven strategy.\nIt means the electricity powering Thailand’s growing EV fleet is not as clean as it could be. That might not matter much to the government, according to energy economics expert Puree Sirasoothorn from Thammasat University.\n“They don’t have a green attitude. Whatever policy they put in place, they will look at the numbers. It’s got to push the economy, help employment and it will be calculated in terms of money. It’s hard for them to see the benefits that EVs can have,” she said.\n“We have very low targets for everything. Low targets for EVs and low targets for renewable energy. It’s going to be a very, very slow transition. It’s because of the state enterprises.\n“Definitely they’re going to phase out oil and gas, sooner or later, but later would be the answer for the government, that’s for sure.”\nThe government gains about one-third of its excise tax from petrol, a large amount of revenue that electricity cannot provide. It is one of the reasons, Puree said, that the mass rollout of consumer EVs may be slow.\nPrices for private electric vehicles remain restrictively high, mainly due to import taxes. The government has proposed a trade-in incentive, where buyers could receive a THB100,000 (US$3350) payment when switching their older car for a new EV. But it has yet to be clarified and approved, and is a rare purchase subsidy, the likes of which are common in many other countries.\n“In Thailand we rely very much on what kind of support from the government will accelerate the use of the electric vehicles,” said Banpu’s Somruedee.\nEV prices are forecast to drop, however, as economies of scale are reached. Already battery prices, a major cost component, have decreased globally by more than 85 per cent since 2010. In that time, the number of electric cars on the road has rocketed from 17,000 to 7.2 million, mostly in China.\nEV car registrations in Thailand increased by 380 per cent from 2018 to 2019, and despite the economic downturn experienced in 2020, the number of new registrations this year have surpassed last year, according to EVAT’s president Krisda Utamote. That number is only about 2,000 units, however.\n“We see some movement in terms of buyer behaviour. The young generation is more interested in clean energy and what type of fuel the vehicle will emit,” he said.\n“People are more active in considering buying an electric vehicle as their first purchase and we’re seeing more models coming into the market as well.”\xa0\nInevitably, it means electric infrastructure is popping up around the country. More demand will breed more solutions and support. But the first EV people might experience, may not be one that they own.\n\n\nA BETTER FUTURE\nIt was when Supapong Kitiwattanasak and his friends had children that they decided on a business idea fiercely focused on the environment and society.\n“Why do we live in a city where we can’t commute easily? We thought that we needed to do something to fix this problem,” he said.\nFriends became co-founders and today, Urban Mobility Tech - the start-up they began - has more than 100 electric tuk-tuks in its fleet and a small army of drivers on the payroll.\nThe concept of their platform - MuvMi - is to give commuters a sustainable transport option for the first and last mile of their journey. Without options, reaching public transport can be difficult, encouraging people to use their own private vehicles instead.\nOn a mobile application that works similarly to other ride sharing software, MuvMi is transporting passengers emission-free on a daily basis. Even though charging stations, batteries and vehicle conversions have added significant challenges to the business, it was important from the company’s perspective not to add any burden to Bangkok’s issues.\n“If we want to solve the traffic problem by bringing more vehicles into the load, we should not make another impact in terms of pollution, or solving one problem by causing another, so we have to go to EV,” Supapong said.\n“Our plan is to have a thousand cars on the street. It would be unacceptable for the business in the long run. Every component we use, we think about how it affects the environment.”\xa0\nKrit Vichaiwatanapanich is also adding vehicles to Bangkok’s congested roads. Yet, climate change is one of his primary concerns.\xa0\nThe CEO of Haupcar, Thailand’s first car sharing service, wants to change the notions of mobility in Bangkok by making EVs accessible to more people at a low cost.\nThe company has the support of Banpu, which assisted with the purchase of 100 Thai-made Fomm vehicles, the world’s smallest class four-seater EV. They are parked in specific locations and can be hired to self-drive for as short time as an hour.\xa0\n“To have an electric fleet on the platform is my intention from the very beginning. Back then we weren't as ready due to the charging infrastructure but for now it’s become a key for us to expand,” Krit said.\n“As we expand electric charging stations, it helps other players as well to be able to sell more electric vehicles in the market. We’re not only helping people who use our service but other car manufacturers to introduce other vehicles on the platform as well.”\xa0\nWhile he admits that driving an EV in Thailand is still “very inconvenient”, that may not be the case for much longer. Cooperation and coordination means more pieces are in place to seize a cleaner future.\xa0\nThe country is just waiting to flick the switch.\nAdditional reporting by Ryn Jirenuwat.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     electric vehicles ', '     environment ', '     Tesla ', '     technology ', '     In Focus ']}"

      Engineer, innovator, aerial dancer: NUS scientist flies through the air on silk as a hobby
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When physicist Isaac Newton discovered gravity, his eureka moment came as he was sitting in a garden, observing an apple fall.\nIn the case of National University of Singapore scientist Duong Hai Minh, it came after he was suspended in mid-air, doing swirls.\nDuong led the research team who found a solution to the world’s plastic pollution problem — by turning plastic waste into aerogel, the lightest solid known to man and a material that insulates people against fire and cleans oil spills.\nAnd he had this stroke of inspiration after flying through the air on aerial silks, a form of acrobatic dance performed while one is hanging from silk fabric.\n“At the aerial silk (studio), I see people drink a lot of water after the exercise. And when I threw away my plastic bottle, I saw a lot of plastic bottles in the bin,” recalls the 46-year-old innovator.\n“So I just wondered, can we recycle them into high-value material?\nThe result: The reinvention of aerogel, which had mostly been produced commercially from silica and commonly used for heat and sound insulation in buildings. Now it can be made into jackets that are more fire-resistant than conventional fire-fighting suits.\nBut what was this associate professor from the department of mechanical engineering doing on aerial silks in the first place?\n“I tried different kinds of sports. I went to the gym, running, dancing, yoga, but I got bored … I like aerial silks because it’s a combination of various sports,” he tells the series Wizards Of Tech.\n“It helps me to improve upper body strength, also (my) flexibility and my abs … Sometimes in the middle of the air, a eureka moment pops up in my mind.”\nHe started practising in 2013 and has been inspired by his weekend hobby ever since.\nWATCH: Why aerial silk dance inspires this engineering innovator (3:44)\nPHYSICS AND DANCE COMBINED\nIf you ask Duong, aerial silks are “in between an art and a science”. He says: “As long as you know about the science in the aerial silk tricks, you can master (them) more easily.”\nAnd the first thing science helped him to understand was how to “defeat” gravity.\n“When you (invert yourself) … you need to apply a force with your hand higher than the force of gravity to lift up your body. Then you can do the inversion,” he cites.\nThe second thing that is needed is momentum.\n“When you rotate your body in the air, when you pull in your legs and your arms … rotational kinetic energy will be increased,” he says. “The spin of your body will be faster.\n“When you extend your legs and arms back to the original (position), you can reduce the speed.”\nLast but not least is friction, especially between the hands and the silk. In fact, it is “very important”, which is why some aerial dancers apply a drying lotion to “get a better grip on the fabric”.\n“You can hang your body better in the air,” Duong adds.\nHowever, he loves his art form not only because of the physics of it but also because he must “adapt to the music”.\n“That means you can be a dancer,” he says. “This is the artiste; you need … some creativity as well. So that also helped me to become a (better) scientist.\n“When you’re a scientist, (you) need to get creative in your technology or … research method to do it (your) own way. You don’t follow other people’s ways.”\nAerial silks have also helped to train his focus as an engineer because up in the air, he has to focus on what he is doing and the technique. “Otherwise, (you) will injure yourself,” he adds.\n“That also helps me when I go to work, because I need to focus on what I’m good at.”\nON A ROLL\nThe kind of innovation Duong is good at, which he gets ideas about during or usually after his aerial silk exercise, has to do with recycling waste into new material “to enhance human life”.\nConverting plastic bottles into aerogel is but one of these breakthroughs. Since his team published their research on this in 2018, they have figured out how to make the world’s first aerogels from rubber tyres.\nThey filed a patent last year for their rubber aerogels, which could solve another environmental problem: Globally, about a billion car tyres are discarded every year — only 40 per cent are recycled, and the bulk are burnt, releasing toxic gases.\nNext up is agricultural waste such as pineapple leaves. “Every kilogramme of pineapple ... will generate about three kilogrammes of pineapple leaf waste,” says Duong. “We can use it for baby diapers ... and food preservation.”\nPineapple aerogel treated with active carbon powder, for example, can keep fruits and vegetables from rotting for at least two weeks. “This can be used for preserving vegetables and fruits during transportation,” he points out.\nThere seems to be no stopping him on his aerogel roll. His team have also used soya bean residue, known as okara, to create another eco-aerogel that is in the process of commercialisation.\nWhat has “surprised” his colleagues, however, is his aerial silk hobby, which they found out recently.\n“They feel that I’m a little bit weird because I’m a professor working at the university,” he says with a laugh. “And they said, ‘We couldn’t believe that you can do this well.’”\nHis students found out about it too. “They gossiped about it,” he grins. “They came up to me and said, ‘Prof, I saw your aerial silk (video) on YouTube. And we like it.’ I said, ‘Oh, thank you.’”\nWatch this episode of Wizards Of Tech here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Commentary: Singapore's hunt for global tech talent will benefit Singaporeans too
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 crisis has crushed global economic growth and battered the Singapore economy. Singapore’s Growth Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecast for 2020 is expected to come in at “-6.5 to-6 per cent”, announced by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Nov 23.\nThe gloomy economic outlook, coupled with global economic uncertainties, not only paints a bleak picture for the local labour market but also tests Singapore’s openness to global talent.\nTo encourage employers to hire more Singaporean workers, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) raised the minimum salary required for new Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass (SP) applicants in early August.\nTo qualify for EPs for foreign workers, the job must pay at least S$4,500 per month, which is $600 higher than it was before. That figure is S$5,000 for the financial services from Dec 1 onwards.\nNOT CLOSED TO TALENT\nThat does not mean Singapore has closed its doors to foreign talent. Indeed, Singapore’s continued success, as a global business hub, is conditional on access to both global capital and talent.\nTackling these concerns in September, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: “We must be careful not to give the wrong impression that we are now closing up, and no longer welcoming foreigners. Such a reputation would do us great harm.”\nIn fact, if anything else, Singapore’s foreign talent policy has focused on attracting top-tier talent to seize new opportunities in an increasingly digital world.\nSingapore has opened up doors to a special type of talent. In mid-November, the Economic Development Board (EDB) launched Tech.Pass in January 2021.\nThe scheme aims to attract “founders, leaders and technical experts with experience in established or fast-growing tech companies”.\nIn Prime Minister Lee’s words, these are the “the movers and shakers of the tech world” who can contribute their capital, networks and knowledge.\nBut the implications of such a shift go beyond hiring of more foreign talent. Tech.Pass, together with the new salary criteria for EP and SP applicants, will have profound impact on Singapore’s labour market.\nSTRENGTHENING THE SINGAPOREAN CORE\nFor one, the changes may see Singaporeans taking up more leadership and specialist roles in the future across different sectors, especially in banking and finance services as well as information and communications technology.\nAlready, with the tightening of criteria for EP and SP applicants over the years, growth of these pass holders has slowed from an annual average of 13,000 in the first half of the last decade to less than 3,000 in the second half, according to an Aug 27 MOM statement. This was during a period of economic expansion.\nWith COVID-19, competition for job vacancies have intensified. New measures tightening work pass requirements will push employers to hire more Singaporeans.\nInterestingly, for the first time, MOM has set a higher qualifying salary bar for a specific sector – the financial services sector. That may lead to finance firms hiring more Singaporeans as middle managers and specialists.\nUnder a talent development programme supported by the Monetary Authroity of Singapore (MAS), 50 financial institutes will hire 900 Singaporeans in the next three years. They will be groomed for leadership and specialist roles.\nBetween 2015 and 2019, three out of four jobs created in the finance sector went to locals. With the growing industry and the higher minimum EP salary, more mid-level jobs will be created and available to locals.\nBesides the higher bar for EP and SP applications, the Government also launched Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to help companies to retain their local employees in this economic downturn.\nBut employers’ attitudes are also important. In a parliamentary debate on the salary revision for work pass holders, Member of Parliament Mr Patrick Tay, Assistant Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), encouraged employers to change their mindsets about hiring locals.\nThis requires departing from the practice of hiring more Singaporeans at junior levels just to boost the proportion of locals among all employees.\nTHE RACE TO ATTRACT TALENT\nWhile strengthening the Singaporean core, the Government is still in the race for attracting talent.\nEarlier in 2018, Singapore set out its vision as a Global-Asia Node of Technology, Innovation, and Enterprise. New knowledge, advanced technology and skill sets are needed to support this vision.\nAdapting our labour force to the fast growing fields, such as data science, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and fintech is imperative.\nTraining, up-skilling and developing our labour force cannot be accomplished in one stroke and will require time to improve our overall labour productivity and competitiveness.\nFurthermore, demand for high-skilled tech workers is higher than the local supply in the short run.\nAccording to recruitment consultancy Michael Page, the demand for technology jobs in Singapore rose by 20 per cent over 2018 to 2019, especially in the field of e-commerce, digital marketing and data science. But a shortage of jobseekers pushed up the salary of a typical specialist to $9,600 per month.\nIn light of these factors, remaining open to global high-skilled workers complements the training of the local workforce in accelerating economic recovery.\nTHE RISE OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disruptive effects on many sectors, such as air transport, tourism-related sectors, food and beverages, externally oriented manufacturing, and real estate.\nHowever, there are some “bright spots” – namely, high-tech companies.\nAccording to an Aug 2 report from The Washington Post, the largest US technology companies such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet have seen their earnings surge due to the increased dependence on their products and services.\nVideo conferencing firm, Zoom seems to be the biggest winner, as its share price soared eight-fold from about US$70 in February to about US$560 in October.\nThe stock market rally confirms what we already know: That tech companies are not only performing well but also have the potential for future gains.\nA McKinsey survey of executives worldwide found companies have sped up the digitisation of their operations by three to four years. Innovation brought about by widespread technology adoption can be expected to drive the post-pandemic era.\nWINNING THE COMPETITION FOR GLOBAL TECH TALENT\nGiven Singapore’s stable political environment, clear rule of law and supportive infrastructures, the key to developing its “digital economy” is talent.\nAt the Singapore Tech Forum on Nov 17, Prime Minister Lee acknowledged that even as the local tech talent pool grows, Singapore has to bring in foreign professionals at mid-to-senior levels to mentor young talent and build world-class teams.\nAttracting global top-tier tech talent will quickly bring in their capital, advanced technology, networks and know-how. This will build up industries and enterprise capabilities, as well as create more opportunities for Singaporeans.\nFor example, British technology company Dyson announced on Nov 27 its plan for a new advanced manufacturing hub in Singapore, as part of its S$4.93 billion investment to expand operations in Singapore, United Kingdom and the Philippines.\nDyson had already signalled its intent to make Singapore a base of its operations, with its global head office at St James Power Station opening in 2021.\nIt is expected to expand research and development facilities in Singapore to study areas like machine learning and robotics. This will lead to the creation of more engineering and research scientist jobs, and the need for global tech talents and middle managers to plug gaps in the field.\nMeanwhile, Dyson intends to establish research projects with Singaporean universities to develop new products. Such programmes could go towards cultivating local students as future engineers and entrepreneurs.\nTalent acquisition is an undoubtedly compelling strategy that can help Singapore remain competitive globally over the long term.\nIt’s worth noting that countries like Thailand, China and France have already launched their special visa programme to lure tech talent to work there.\nThe countries who win the best tech talent will gain a strategic position in the global business landscape. Singapore cannot afford to be left behind.\nXu Le is a lecturer in the Department of Strategy and Policy at National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.

      Commentary: Shanghai and Shenzhen, vital cities in China's next phase of growth
  </h1>, 'text': 'SHANGHAI: On Oct 14, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the southern city of Shenzhen, where he delivered a speech celebrating 40 years of progress since the special economic zone (SEZ) was established there and set a path for the future.\nA month later, Xi headed to Shanghai’s Pudong district – which was designated China’s first “new area” 30 years earlier – for the same purpose.\xa0\nThe centrality of Shenzhen and Shanghai to China’s future development could not be clearer.\nWhen China first created the Shenzhen SEZ, some questioned its judgment.\nFor example, as a postgraduate student at the University of Cambridge in the 1980s, James Kai-sing Kung, now of the University of Hong Kong, asked why the government would choose an unknown village like Shenzhen, rather than an economic centre\xa0like Shanghai or Tianjin, to serve as an incubator for Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening up” strategy.\nThe decision must, Kung concluded, be politically motivated; China’s government must have been preparing for the return of neighbouring Hong Kong, which was already a global financial centre.\nURBAN PILEUP\nBut, while it is true that sovereignty over Hong Kong was formally transferred back to China in 1997, Hong Kong’s impact on Shenzhen’s development was rooted less in sovereignty than in proximity.\nIf presented with an aerial view of Shenzhen’s Futian District and Hong Kong’s New Territories today, the latter areas, south of the Shenzhen River, would appear desolate. Meanwhile, Shenzhen, with its bustling ports and glittering skyline, is clearly populated and prosperous.\nThis is not to say that other areas of Hong Kong aren’t flourishing. In fact, that is the point.\nShenzhen’s development along the border with Hong Kong reflects the so-called urban pileup effect: The accumulation of densely urbanised clusters along the frontier with a more developed area, enabling the less developed region to seize cross-border spillover opportunities.\nThe same phenomenon can be seen along the border between Mexico and Texas.\xa0\nAn aerial view of the region would reveal sprawling suburbs on the wealthier American side – making it appear almost barren – and dynamic, populous cities on the Mexican side, where local workers flock to jobs at American-owned manufacturing plants, among other opportunities.\nAs Deng predicted, Hong Kong, with its developed financial system and economic dynamism, has had similarly powerful spillover effects on Shenzhen.\nThe result is a thriving metropolis, where annual economic output will soon reach 3 trillion yuan (US$456 billion) – one-third of the Guangdong province’s total.\nMAJOR GROWTH ENGINES\nShenzhen is thus a major engine of the Greater Bay Area, which covers nine cities around the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, plus Hong Kong and Macau. The region already accounts for about 13 per cent of mainland China’s GDP, and its share is growing.\nShanghai’s geographical location – on China’s east coast, near the mouth of the Yangtze River – has been similarly crucial to its success.\nYet, far from piggybacking on the dynamism of a neighbour, Shanghai has always led the development of the Yangtze River Delta region, and has been the beating heart of the Yangtze River Economic Belt – which covers nine provinces and two megacities – since the belt’s launch in 2016.\nIn the last 30 years, growth in the Pudong new area has reinforced Shanghai’s regional primacy, while also driving development in an increasingly integrated Yangtze River Delta.\nToday, the Yangtze River Economic Belt accounts for more than 46 per cent of China’s total output. This region, together with the Greater Bay Area, constitutes about 60 per cent of China’s total output.\nUNIQUE ROLES OF SHANGHAI AND SHENZHEN\nSo, Shanghai and Shenzhen are both vital to China’s economic future. But neither is more important than the other; each has a unique role to play.\nAs the more mature and developed player, Shanghai has long been a leader in equipment manufacturing. Yet its economic structure is far from stationary: The city is now being transformed into a research and development hub and a center of trade, finance, and modern services.\nShenzhen, for its part, is on track to become China’s Silicon Valley. In the last 20 years, this young, dynamic city has outpaced Shanghai in hard-technology development, with dozens of world-renowned companies – including Huawei, Tencent, Ping An, DJI, BYD, and SF Express – concentrating there.\nTo be sure, in terms of overall technological prowess, Shanghai still ranks first. But, rather than replacing Shanghai in the areas where it leads, Shenzhen is becoming a kind of laboratory for experimentation, not only with technology, but also with policies that incentivise and facilitate innovation.\nShanghai cannot play that role, because it must continue to serve as a predictable environment for global trade and finance.\nGuiding the development of an economy as large and diverse as China will always be a difficult challenge.\nBut, by recognising and investing in the strengths of pioneering cities and regions, China has developed a powerful mechanism for organising and advancing its economic transformation.\nJudging by the tremendous success of Shenzhen and Shanghai, it seems clear that China will continue to reap the rewards of this approach for decades to come.\nZhang Jun is Dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University and Director of the China Center for Economic Studies, a Shanghai-based think tank.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     Shanghai ', '     finance ', '     technology ']}"

      China launches mission to bring back material from moon
  </h1>, 'text': 'WENCHANG, Hainan: China launched an ambitious mission on Tuesday (Nov 24) to bring back rocks and debris from the moon\'s surface for the first time in more than 40 years - an undertaking that could boost human understanding of the moon and of the solar system more generally.\nChang\'e 5 - named for the Chinese moon goddess - is the country\'s boldest lunar mission yet. If successful, it would be a major advance for China\'s space programme, and some experts say it could pave the way for bringing samples back from Mars or even a crewed lunar mission.\nThe four modules of the Chang\'e 5 spacecraft blasted off at just after 4.30am on Tuesday\xa0atop a massive Long March-5Y rocket from the Wenchang launch centre along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan.\nMinutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket\'s first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit. About an hour later, Chang\'e 5 opened its solar panels to provide its independent power source.\nSpacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.\nThe launch was carried live by national broadcaster CCTV, which then switched to computer animation to show its progress into outer space.\nThe mission\'s key task is to drill 2m beneath the moon\'s surface and scoop up about 2kg of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe Chang\'e 5 lander\'s time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon\'s freezing nights.\nThe lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what is called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.\nThe technical complexity of Chang\'e 5, with its four components, makes it ""remarkable in many ways"", said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the US Naval War College.\n""China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programmes, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,"" she said.\nIn particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China\'s experience, he said.\nWhile the mission is ""indeed challenging"", McDowell said China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang\'e 3 and Chang\'e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang\'e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule. All that is\xa0left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon.\n""As a result of this, I\'m pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,"" he said.\nThe mission is among China\'s boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the US and Russia.\nChang\'e 5 and future lunar missions aim to ""provide better technical support for future scientific and exploration activities"", Pei Zhaoyu, mission spokesperson and deputy director of the Chinese National Space Administration\'s (CNSA) Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Centre told reporters at a Monday briefing.\n""Scientific needs and technical and economic conditions"" would determine whether China decides to send a crewed mission to the moon, said Pei, whose comments were embargoed until after the launch. ""I think future exploration activities on the moon are most likely to be carried out in a human-machine combination.""\nWhile many of China\'s crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a spacewalk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.\nChang\'e 4 - which made the first soft landing on the moon\'s relatively unexplored far side almost two years ago - is currently collecting full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.\nChina in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China\'s case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the red planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.\nChina has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang\'e 5.\nUS law, however, still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programmes that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India, among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.\nChina\'s space programme has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The rocket being used for the current launch failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang\'e 4.\n""China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,"" Freese-Johnson said. China\'s one-party authoritarian system also allows for ""prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies"", she said.\nWhile the US has followed China\'s successes closely, it is unlikely to expand cooperation with China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.\n""A change in US policy regarding space cooperation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,"" Johnson-Freese said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     space ', '     rocket ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: The new Xbox and Playstation are looking very different
  </h1>, 'text': 'BRISBANE: In the latest salvo of an almost two-decade console war between Microsoft and Sony, both Sony’s Playstation 5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series S/X were launched last week.\nWith increased spending on videogames due to ongoing quarantine and travel restrictions, the launches have been described as historically significant.\nAs is typical for a “next-generation” launch, both consoles sport significant boosts to computing power, support 4K graphics and offer faster performance and loading times.\nBut unlike previous launches, they present starkly different visions for the future of video gaming.\nSony continues to focus on providing exclusive content.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft\xa0launched its Project xCloud game streaming service in Australia – the most recent step in a wider trend towards embracing a subscription-based business model.\nSONY’S FOCUS ON EXCLUSIVITY\nFor a long time, new consoles had been primarily marketed around “platform exclusive” titles available only for that console.\nSony and Microsoft have in the past paid millions to developers for exclusivity deals. In 2010, Microsoft paid Rockstar Games US$75,000,000 to stop Grand Theft Auto IV from becoming a Playstation 3 exclusive.\nSony’s recent PS5 launch carries on this tradition. The console is marketed in terms of first-party exclusives, such as those developed by Naughty Dog (Uncharted, The Last of Us) and Sony Computer Entertainment’s Santa Monica Studio (God of War).\nSony has also had great success selling hardware peripherals that make its consoles more attractive, evident in recent quarterly revenues. The PlayStation virtual reality headset sold more than 5 million units worldwide during the last generation.\nIn contrast, Microsoft quickly abandoned the Kinect. This motion-sensing device bundled with the Xbox One never won over its audience.\nRISE OF SUBSCRIPTION GAMING\nThat said, although Sony vastly outsold Microsoft with the PS4 last generation, it seems in 2020 Microsoft has shifted the goalposts of success.\nMicrosoft’s aim is no longer to sell the most consoles, but to accumulate the most players, irrespective of where they’re playing. The console itself is now almost secondary.\nFor instance, Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service, launched in 2017, provides access to Xbox titles across both Xbox consoles and PC. Game Pass follows a similar model to Netflix, wherein users pay a monthly fee to access a library of content.\nAnd although having a Game Pass membership isn’t mandatory, Microsoft reports 70 per cent of X/S console users do.\nOn the surface, subscription gaming seems to offer better value for money in terms of access to content, as gamers don’t have to buy the games outright.\nBut as has been the case with competing television and film streaming services, should subscription gaming become more common, paying for a range of subscriptions may become costly – especially if certain games are exclusive to certain services.\nFORAY INTO CLOUD GAMING\nThe Game Pass service uses “cloud gaming” technology. Whereas consoles provide the local computing hardware needed to play games, cloud gaming involves streaming games over the internet, from a host’s remote servers to the user’s device.\nIn the past, this hasn’t worked well due to “high latency”. This refers to the delay between making an input (such as shooting a character) and seeing the result (the character being shot).\nHowever, with improved computing power, internet speeds and clever design tricks, cloud gaming is becoming a crowded market, with big tech companies including Google and Amazon joining in, too.\nSony began experimenting with cloud gaming in 2014 with PS Now. This service allows the streaming of older titles, such as PS3 games.\nAnd while Sony continues to offer PS Now for the PS5, and at a cheaper price point than Microsoft’s Game Pass, the PS Now is still focused on old games.\nOn the other hand, Microsoft is aggressively pushing its new Project xCloud. This service, which comes bundled with the GamePass, allows users to stream certain newer Xbox games directly to their smartphone or tablet, without even needing to own an Xbox console.\nClearly, Micosoft’s focus is on players, not consoles. Considering the massive impact smartphones are having on who plays games (and how often), Microsoft may be setting itself up to engage a much larger audience than ever before.\nAN EVOLVING MARKET\nThe 2020 console war looks quite different to those of the past, when a single winner often took it all (or at least the majority of it).\nThink Nintendo in 1990s North America, or Sony’s domination last generation with the PS4.\nIn light of Microsoft’s shifting approach, we’re now in a situation where two winners will likely take large chunks of different markets, by doing different things.\nOn one hand, this might help diversify the market and provide greater variety for consumers. On the other, Sony and Microsoft’s divergence might have gamers spending more than ever.\nBen Egliston is Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Digital Media Research Centre, Queensland University of Technology.

  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Singapore needs more technology talent and a newly announced work pass hopes to help the country attract “highly accomplished” individuals in this field, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday (Nov 17) night.\nDelivering a keynote speech at the Singapore Tech Forum 2020, Mr Lee said the Tech.Pass, launched last week by the Economic Development Board, is targeted at “the movers and shakers of the tech world”.\nHe described these as individuals who usually play different roles at once – founder, investor, employee, consultant and academic – and can contribute to multiple parts of the ecosystem with their capital, networks and knowledge.\xa0\nUnlike the Employment Pass that is tied to a particular job or employer, the new work pass “will be personal to the holder”, giving them flexibility to move between roles and employers, he added.\xa0\nFive hundred passes will be made available from January 2021 when applications open.\n“This will be something I hope to make people sit up and take notice, and will help us to attract talent to Singapore,” said the Prime Minister.\nMr Lee, who delivered his speech via a Facebook livestream, said talent is key as Singapore develops its technology ecosystem.\nThe country already has an environment that supports science and technology, with a tech-literate population and the presence of good infrastructure such as a high-speed nationwide broadband network.\nThe Government is building up its own IT engineering capabilities through the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), while developing the entire tech eco-system and digital industry.\n“Many major tech companies are now based here and they are doing engineering work, not just sales and marketing,” he said, citing tech giants like Google, Facebook and Amazon. This has created a vibrant industry cluster and good jobs for Singaporeans, he added.\n“So the pieces are all gradually coming into place but the key thing which makes it all work is talent,” said Mr Lee.\n“We need more tech talent to grow the industry and to tackle the urgent problems that we have and that tech can help us to solve.”\xa0\nThe Prime Minister\xa0noted a growing pipeline of talent in the local universities and polytechnics. Companies also bring in foreign talent, including experienced professionals at the mid-to senior-levels which Singapore lacks.\xa0\nBut he acknowledged the possibility of social issues arising when there are “large numbers of foreign professionals” in an industry. In particular, Singaporeans in the same field may feel a sense of competition and discomfort.\nSuch anxieties also tend to “rise up to the surface” during economic downturns when people are worried about their jobs, he added.\xa0\nThis is not unique to Singapore but the country acknowledges these issues “candidly” and does its best to address them, said Mr Lee.\n“It requires both sides to work at it. The non-Singaporeans have to make the effort to fit in, both at work and socially, when they are in Singapore.\xa0\n“And the Singaporeans on their part have to be able to understand that this is how new jobs and more jobs will be created in Singapore, and have to feel assured that they will be fairly treated and not be discriminated against,” he said.\nFurther, Singaporeans must see the tech companies as bringing in expertise and experience, as well as building up the industry and capabilities.\xa0\n“So that our own people can learn from them, upgrade themselves and eventually build up our own talent pool,” he added.\n“And this is how our policies work. This is how we work our work passes in Singapore.”\nSINGAPORE’S VALUE PROPOSITION\nMr Lee was asked about Singapore’s value proposition to talents from around the world during a question-and-answer segment\xa0after his keynote speech.\nThe moderator – Ms Karen Tay,\xa0Smart Nation director in the Prime Minister’s Office – named several factors that talents look out for when deciding on a job, namely the breadth of opportunities and livability of a city, as well as the culture of a city and company.\xa0\nShe added that some have said Singapore may be different from other major tech hubs in terms of its\xa0sociopolitical culture, stance on\xa0lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ)\xa0issues, as well as a workplace culture that remains hierarchical.\nIn his reply, Mr Lee noted that Singapore presents plenty of challenges, such as bringing Government systems up to speed given how it encompasses engineering, organisational and social difficulties.\nMeanwhile, a range of tech companies are growing and doing engineering work here. “Really, the constraint is a chicken and egg problem. If there’s more talent, then they'll be able to do more of these engineering work but they are looking to do it in Singapore,” he said.\nOn workplace culture, Mr Lee said this depends on individual companies. Existing organisations may find it difficult to change, although some have set up “skunk works” teams to develop new styles of working, he said.\xa0Such teams typically operate\xa0outside the company's normal procedures so they can help develop new ideas and products.\nSingapore also wants to develop new organisations with “fresh cultures” and these are under way.\nTurning to other cultural aspects, he said Singapore used to be called a “cultural desert” but it has become a vibrant city for arts, music, dance and theatre.\nMr Lee also noted that Singapore has been open to the LGBTQ community.\n“We welcome them, we really appreciate their contributions,” he said. “And it's no reason why if you’re a member of this community, you should not fit in in Singapore.”\xa0\nHe pointed out that while Singapore may not have the same “extremely liberal” social norms as San Francisco,\xa0which is home to Silicon Valley,\xa0there are differences even within the United States.\nIn multi-racial and multi-religious Southeast Asia, issues like homosexuality “will be sensitive for a long time” but attitudes “are not fixed in stone”. The younger generation, for instance, have more liberal views than their older counterparts.\n“So these things shift but we have to give them time to shift and I think it is unwise to force it because there will be a push back and you will end up with polarisation,” said Mr Lee.\nTECH CRUCIAL IN SINGAPORE’S COVID-19 RESPONSE\nIn his keynote speech, the Prime Minister also touched on the role of technology in the country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe situation in Singapore is now “stable” with “better defences” in testing, contact tracing and safe distancing measures in place. These have allowed a gradual resumption of economic and social activities, including some overseas travel, as it awaits the confirmation of a safe and effective vaccine.\nTechnology has been “a crucial part” of this journey, said Mr Lee.\nFor one, biomedical science has played a big part in analysing the genome of the novel coronavirus, understanding disease patterns and trends, as well as developing tests and treatments.\xa0\nInfotech has also been crucial in various ways. These include the tracking of the status, well-being and location of large numbers of cases, the collecting and analysing of COVID-19 data for locating hotspots, patterns and trends, as well as ensuring compliance with stay-home notices.\nWhen it comes to contact tracing, technology enabled the development of various solutions such as Bluetooth-based tool TraceTogether, national check-in system SafeEntry and databases like VISION, which integrates existing databases to speed up contact tracing and issue quarantine orders promptly.\nThis is in contrast to how contract tracing was a “manual and labour-intensive business” in 2003 during the SARS outbreak, said Mr Lee.\nBut Singapore’s response “was not flawless” and many blind spots were discovered.\nFor instance, not all of the Government’s IT systems were using up-to-date techniques like APIs or cloud systems, and working seamlessly together.\n“And when cases are multiplying, all these delays and inefficiencies make a difference,” said Mr Lee.\nAs a result, new products like VISION\xa0had to be developed “in a hurry”.\n“(They are) more than minimum viable products, but they are far from polished versions and still work in progress. But they showed we had some in-house capability… Most importantly through building them, we learned … the importance of ‘Ops-tech’,” he said.\n“That means the operations have to be enmeshed with the technology requirements right from the start and the tech people have to be involved early and have to work closely with the (operations) people to understand the operating conditions, to understand the requirements (and) to be able to meet the requirements.”\nGoing beyond COVID-19, technology is a “command function” in a lot of Government activities, from healthcare to public housing, Mr Lee said, adding: “Without tech, you are stuck.”\nSenior leaders will have to understand that tech is “central to their role (in) governing Singapore and doing public administration”.\nMore will need to understand and appreciate technology, and there must be enough public service leaders who can provide technical leadership on complex engineering projects while taking into account the social and policy aspects, added the Prime Minister.\xa0\nRCEP “A MAJOR STEP FORWARD”\nAmong the other topics raised during the question-and-answer segment, Mr Lee was asked how the newly signed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)\xa0will\xa0affect the tech scene in Singapore and the opportunities it has for start-ups.\xa0\nLaunched in 2012, RCEP is a trade pact between the 10-member ASEAN bloc, along with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Dubbed the world’s biggest trade agreement, it was signed over the weekend after eight years of wrangling over details.\nIn his response Mr Lee said the RCEP is a “major step forward on economic cooperation in Asia”.\nFor Singapore, it is also a “significant improvement” that will benefit a “whole range of traders” including those in the IT, manufacturing and services industries.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     Smart Nation ', '     technology ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: ‘You may be hacked’ and other things doctors should tell you
  </h1>, 'text': 'OXFORD: On Sep 9, a woman died during a cyberattack on a hospital in Dusseldorf, Germany. The woman was in a critical condition and about to be treated when hackers disabled the computer systems of the hospital.\nUnable to avert the attack, medical staff had to transfer the woman to another hospital, but the help came too late and the woman died.\nThis incident was the first reported case of death after a cyberattack and shows that such attacks are not just a threat to our data anymore, but also to our lives.\nIn fact, the situation is urgent. We know that cyberattacks on medical devices and hospital networks are a growing threat. During the current pandemic, some types of cyberattacks have increased by 600 per cent.\nAnd it’s not just old computer systems that are vulnerable. Even the very best artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine can be compromised.\nAcademic research continually reveals new ways in which state-of-the-art AI can be attacked. Such attacks can block life-saving interventions, undermine diagnostic accuracy, administer lethal drug doses, or sabotage critical moves in an operation.\nINHERENT RISKS\nDoctors need to do everything they can to keep patients safe, but as a matter of general medical disclosure, should they have to tell patients about the risk of a cyberattack, at least when their healthcare critically relies on computers?\nAfter all, patients have to give their informed consent to medical procedures and doctors are required to warn patients about potentially harmful consequences.\nIn some US legal cases, judges have argued that doctors need to disclose a risk only if it is “inherent” in a medical procedure, that is, a risk that “exists in and is inseparable from the procedure itself”.\nRelying on such a view, one may argue that the risk of cyberattacks is not an “inherent” risk and so does not require disclosure. Many equate “inherent” risks with “medical” risks and thereby rule out the “criminal” risk of a cyberattack.\nThis view against disclosure raises an important point. There is indeed a connection between the requirement of disclosure and the expertise of a doctor as a medical professional.\nDoctors need to disclose inherent medical risks because they are, unlike laypeople, especially well placed to know about them. But doctors cannot be expected to predict whether certain people will target their patients through cyberattacks.\nAfter all, doctors are not criminologists. So they are not really able, let alone obliged, to disclose those risks.\nNEED FOR DISCLOSURE\nOn the other hand, this view against disclosure underestimates several important aspects.\nTo begin with, the growing digitalisation and use of computer systems in medicine will render the risk of cyberattacks ubiquitous in healthcare.\nEven though it may not be an “inherent” risk, it will certainly be an inevitable part of future clinical reality, and if we want patients to make well-informed decisions, they should know about such a risk.\nAlso, even though doctors don’t need to disclose general criminal risks, they are required to disclose the risks that their medical equipment poses to patients.\nAfter all, being subject to medical procedures leaves people vulnerable in important ways, and if certain computer-based procedures introduce new vulnerabilities, an informed patient will need to know about them.\nMORE SOPHISTICATED CYBERATTACKS\nFinally, unlike traditional cyberattacks, the risk of some new cyberattacks may become “inherent”, as defined above.\nConsider the case of medical AI. In so-called “input attacks” on medical AI, an attacker can change the pixel value of an MRI scan so that the AI system will categorise tissue as falsely malignant with a confidence rate of over 99 per cent when it would correctly categorise it as benign with the same confidence rate in absence of the attack.\nThe human eye is unable to detect such changes. The attacker would only have to scatter some well-placed digital dust over the image.\nThe only way to detect an attack is to detect the intrusion in another computer system where the medical images have been stored.\nBut even here, we may not know whether, in addition to the intrusion into the database and the potential theft of medical data, attackers made any changes to medical images at all, what their motives might have been, and what consequences could await patients as a result.\nSo, unlike other cyberattacks, input attacks no longer compromise their target system. The AI system itself, its algorithm, and how it works can be left completely untouched.\nIn other words, the AI system would still work normally, not be affected by any bug or interference, and the doctor performing or supervising the procedure would act as professionally as possible.\nTherefore, no such AI-based procedures can avoid the vulnerability to input attacks. But if this is so, then the risk of input attacks does become “inherent” to certain medical procedures, as defined earlier.\nPREPARING FOR MEDICINE’S DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\nThere are sound reasons to require the disclosure of cyber-risks to patients, at least in certain high-stakes medical procedures.\nHowever, cyber-risks are only one new type of risk that patients may face in the future.\nWhen algorithms play an increasingly large role, we also need to think about whether doctors should disclose the risk that these algorithms are systematically biased or the risk that, because of the opacity of certain AI systems, doctors may no longer be able to understand and double-check the AI’s decisions.\nIn any case, the growing reliance on computer systems and AI demands that we think afresh about medical disclosure and which risks to disclose to patients.\nOtherwise, our clinical practice will be unprepared for the major transformations that await it.\nMaximilian Kiener is\xa0Research Fellow in Philosophy at the\xa0University of Oxford.

      Commentary: Singapore's new growth strategy for tomorrow involves luring 500 global tech leaders today
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Even in the midst of a political climate where the narrative of foreign talent displacing locals has been a longstanding contentious issue revived by a challenging job market in a global pandemic, Singapore seems to be at it again.\xa0\nThe country’s Economic Development Board (EDB) just announced that a new scheme, dubbed the “Tech.Pass”, will be launched next January where talent with significant leadership experience in tech companies or product development will be welcome to locate in Singapore.\nBut this time around, the strategy in global talent attraction is a fundamental shift from the past, where foreign managerial manpower and specialists in a wide range of domains were brought in under the Employment Pass scheme.\nThe minimal qualifying salary for that programme is S$4,500 (and S$5,000 for financial services).\nIn comparison, the bar for Tech.Pass is many times higher. It seems targeted at C-suite tech leaders and developers creating applications and technologies of the future.\nCandidates must fulfil two of the following criteria: Draw at least a S$20,000 fixed monthly salary, have five cumulative years in a leading role of a tech company with at least a valuation of US$500 million (S$674 million) or US$30 million in funding, or have five cumulative years of experience in developing a tech product with 100,000 monthly active users or at least US$100 million revenue.\xa0\nEven then, the pass is not an entry that lasts in perpetuity. It is good for two years and will have to be extended after. Only 500 will be picked.\nThere are two substantive aspects of the new talent scheme that merit further examination – tech and timing.\nTHE FOCUS ON HIGH GROWTH HIGH TECH\nUnlike existing work pass schemes under the Ministry of Manpower or even the EDB’s Global Investor Programme which are “horizontal” in catchment and directed at investors who can help identify plum choices for the next investment, the Tech.Pass is a “vertical” approach that pinpointedly targets high potential companies in high tech domains that are seeing exponential growth.\nTech.Pass is a class of its own attracting a highly select and skilled clientele that is globally mobile and fiercely sought by many top capitals of the world.\nThe capabilities sought will involve expertise in cutting-edge technologies including the oft-touted “ABCD” – artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing and data analytics – areas birthing unicorns and companies at the pre-unicorn stage.\nThe world is also now seeing, particularly arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented focus on applications of deep technologies in hot areas like medtech, edutech and the veritable fintech like never before.\nAnd cutting across all applications will be the need for high-end cybersecurity, and the projected pervasive use of enabling technologies like 5G.\nStart-ups in these areas with a demonstrable path to growth and profit that satisfy investors hold the key to unlocking the next stage of Singapore’s growth in an increasingly digital global economy but they don’t appear every day.\nInvestors are hungry for options. The money is here but where are the investments and founders?\nSingapore’s Temasek Holdings is in active discussions for its first direct investments in healthcare and education start-ups in Southeast Asia.\nThis is a serious bet on the burgeoning digital economy, slated to triple to more than US$300 billion by 2025 in Southeast Asia, according to Google and Bain and\xa0Co.\nThe fintech sector too has huge potential, looking at the rapid growth it has enjoyed in China, notwithstanding the recent curbs on Alibaba’s Ant initial public offerings in Hong Kong and Shanghai.\nFintech investors from across the world will be redoing their sums again to optimise their investment portfolios across possible locations.\nSoutheast Asia, including Singapore, may potentially be part of the new equation, particularly when one considers DBS’s reported plans to establish a digital exchange which will allow cryptocurrencies and other digital securities to be traded against the Singapore dollar and a few other currencies.\nThis move by digitally savvy DBS, awarded the world’s best bank by eminent publications Euromoney and Global Finance, will spawn even more demand for fintech talent across the economy.\nInterestingly, a recent report by The Business Times pointed to a severe talent gap in cybersecurity in Singapore. This will dangerously leave many firms exposed to cyber and data privacy threats.\nEven more significant is that the Asia-Pacific region has an estimated whopping 2.6 million cybersecurity workforce gap, accordingly to the International Information System Security Certification Consortium.\nThe upshot is that there will be many areas of needs for high tech in Singapore.\nTransformational leaders of the fields will be required to answer the market’s siren call, but the country will face tough competition as cities around the world will fight tooth-and-nail to lure this crème de la crème of the talent pyramid.\nTHE FOCUS ON TIMING\nCOVID-19 has presented even more opportunities for high tech. Tech companies with the right offerings have found the sweet spot of good timing during the crisis to make momentous gains.\nThe obvious example is Zoom Video Communications which had people and companies zooming in and out of virtual meetings during the pandemic.\nWith its valuation now topping Boeing and 3M, it has become such an indispensable tool as the world made the overnight digital\xa0work-from-home leap, that for many businesses to continue to survive, it is “zoom or doom”.\nThe pandemic presents a short time window where there will be great demand for game-changing talent leaders. There are few of these talents around the world, but many locations who want them.\nSingapore is not alone in using incentives to draw tech talents onshore. Established economies like Australia, France and United Kingdom have similar talent schemes, some of which are more aggressive than Singapore’s.\nAustralia’s Distinguished Talent Visa offers permanent residency. France’s Tech Visa programme does not require local options be exhausted before a position is filed by a foreigner. And the United Kingdom’s Global Talent Visa, with its five-year term, can be extended to immediate family members.\nStill, Singapore is well-placed to attract foreign talent. In the list of most competitive places for talent released just this month by the Institute for Management Development, Singapore is ranked top in Asia and within the top ten in the world.\nNotably, it is ranked above Australia, France and United Kingdom.\nWhile the pandemic is still ravaging parts of the world especially North America, Western Europe and South Asia, it is natural that globally mobile tech talent may want to look around to see where they can leverage their time more fruitfully.\nFrom a practical angle, tech talent may wish to pivot to localities that have done well in combating the coronavirus outbreak and keeping infection numbers under control.\nTo them time is also money. Innovation nodes, with fresh pots of money and ecosystems offering business opportunities that allow them to take their innovation to market faster, can look like good options. Tech innovators cannot wait – there is always a risk someone will beat them.\nReceiving countries also cannot afford to wait. They seek talent that can be purpose-fit right away on arrival and be ready to plug and play from day one.\nTiming will be the final arbiter in this ferocious location competition. Countries have to double down urgently on attracting tech talent now.\nFor Singapore, the timing is perfect as its economy needs value boosters.\nThe planned 500-odd Tech.Pass holders will be queen bees to create jobs and multiply opportunities for economic growth.\nLawrence Loh is director of Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations at NUS Business School where he is also associate professor of strategy and policy\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Ant Group will be back, but its path may not be as smooth-sailing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: China’s Ant Group is in a strange fix. The financial technology (fintech) firm went within days from being on the cusp of the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO) to those plans being thwarted through new regulations from its own government.\nThis sudden development has not only disappointed investors but also raised concerns on its impact on Ant and its future trajectory.\nThe Alibaba-linked company was supposed to raise US$37 billion through listings in Shanghai and Hong Kong on Nov 5 – eclipsing the US$26 billion IPO of Saudi Aramco last December.\nIn the lead up to the much-anticipated listing, the group faced great pressure from the Donald Trump administration in the US to derail these plans.\xa0Last month, the US State Department had proposed to add Ant Group to a trade blacklist in its effort to prevent US investors from participating in the Chinese company’s IPO. \xa0\nWhile Ant was cautious of any action from the Trump administration, it got blindsided by a move from the Chinese government instead.\nOn Nov 3, the country’s financial regulator introduced new rules on online lending – among which is requiring online and micro-lenders like Ant to provide at least 30 per cent of the funding when it offers loans with other banks.\xa0\nThis is more than the 2 per cent currently, while loans to individuals are to be capped at 300,000 yuan (US$45,347) or a maximum of one-third of the borrower’s average income in the last three years. \xa0\nLEVELLING THE PLAYING FIELD\nWith the new rules announced, the Shanghai stock exchange suspended Ant’s IPO on the same day, prompting the company to also pull out of its listing in Hong Kong.\nAnt is one of the world’s most integrated fintech platforms providing services including payment, consumer lending, asset management and insurance services among others.\nAnt’s online lending business has been a big hit – accounting for almost 40 per cent of its revenue – as it provides easier access to credit for young Chinese through simple online platforms. Many of these borrowers have little income or credit history.\nSuch penetration of the lending sector has seen Ant underwrite about 1.7 trillion yuan (US$259 billion) worth of consumer loans and 422 billion yuan in small business loans for about 100 banks and financial institutions, according to media reports.\nAs a result of these developments, Chinese state-owned big banks have had to compete with Ant for customers. The new regulations could hence be targeted at levelling the playing field between the major fintech players like Ant and the big banks, which have been calling for the government to regulate the growth of fintech giants for years.\nEven as early as 2014, Yang Kaisheng, a former president of the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China and then an adviser to the China Banking Regulatory Commission, urged that it was time “to step up regulation for the industry’s own good”.\n“The emergence of Internet financing is inevitable in China because it serves the grassroots better, but whoever is engaging in financial services, no matter online or off-line, must comply with regulations.”\nThe new regulations thus force the likes of Ant to take on more risk and set aside more capital like the bigger banks do.\nDON’T WRITE OFF ANT YET\nDespite the setback of the IPO being suspended, the prospects remain bright for Ant. \xa0\nFor one, the company still intends to list, even though it has not confirmed if that will yet be in Shanghai – industry professionals say more Chinese companies could look to list in the US as president-elect Joe Biden may bring more stability in the regulatory regime. \xa0\nAccording to the prospectus filed to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Ant aims to invest the IPO funds in three major items:\xa0R&D in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, the internet of things, and other cutting-edge technology; upgrading its infrastructure for cross-border payments; and innovating and digitalising services, focused on upgrading data infrastructure and developing services empowered by data-driven technology.\nMoreover, digital data is pivotal to Ant’s strategies, including technology development and internationalisation of its businesses. So despite the new regulations increasing operational costs for the group, the centrality of data in its operations and strategy is a game-changer.\nAlipay, part of Ant, currently serves over 80 million businesses, 1 billion users and 2 million mobile apps. The data generated by these users form the basis of Ant’s comparative advantage as it uses massive digital data to increase operational efficiencies, reduce costs and control risks.\nA recent news report suggested that Ant uses over 100,000 indices, more than 100 prediction models and over 3,000 risk management strategies to assess SMEs’ collateral-free loan applications.\xa0\nWith that, more inclusive financial services are provided especially for those people or businesses which used have difficulties to access traditional banking services. So borrowers may still find Ant’s loan offerings an attractive proposition.\nMoreover it is not just in China, but data and the deployment of AI-related technology are also supporting Ant’s penetration into the overseas markets.\xa0\nIn recent years, Ant invested in fintech-related companies in Asia including Paytm in India, Ascend Money in Thailand, GCash in Philippine and Kakao pay in Korea. Enabled by big data, Ant provides data analytics to support those payment companies in other countries.\nTherefore, Ant’s market power is likely to increase with the IPO with the amount it is set to raise not only eclipsing the loss of profit it would suffer under the new financial rules, it would also increase the group’s competitiveness.\xa0\nSpecifically, while big data and AI-enabled technology can improve the accessibility of financial services, they also give the incumbent platforms more market power, compared to other financial services providers.\nFUTURE REGULATORY CHALLENGES\nDespite the inherent strengths in Ant’s operational capabilities, which will be accentuated through its IPO, it is likely that there are future regulatory changes in terms of data governance.\nDigital platforms such as Ant have so-called network effects, referring to the situation in which an increasing number of users on a given platform will improve the value of services or goods provided by the same platform.\nFor example, the value of Facebook is likely to increase with the number of users. In addition, the values of mobile apps developed for Facebook are also likely to increase with the number of users on the platform.\nWith network effects, digital platforms like Ant benefit more from accessing additional data, compared to other firms. Further, it might also be costly for users to switch platforms.\nIn many cases, to keep users, the AI-based data analytics supported by big data are used to accommodate their demands. Moreover, when switching platforms, users might have concerns on data privacy - about how the platform collecting their personal data will use the data.\nAs such, the Chinese government may consider further regulating how companies like Ant collect, share and use data.\xa0\nA recent report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) suggests that well-designed regulation of digital platforms regarding data sharing, data privacy and data flow could support market competition.\nOne interesting proposal is to support data portability. With data portability, a user is able to transfer their data elsewhere from the platform which collects the data. Data portability might be supported by open format data through “application programming interfaces” (APIs).\nData privacy has also been addressed to some extent in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

      Trackers to mask detectors: India bets on COVID-19 tech amid privacy fears
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW DELHI:\xa0From a tracker that can tell where someone sleeps at night to a device detecting whether they have a mask on or not, India\'s government is betting on high-tech solutions to fight COVID-19, despite growing privacy concerns.\nOfficials have called on local firms to develop technology powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.\nMore than 8.5 million people in India have been infected by the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins University\'s tracker, making it the worst-affected country after the United States.\nWith nationwide lockdown restrictions lifted, people are starting to go back to work and travel again, prompting public and private players to turn to data-driven tech to track their movements, check temperatures and enforce social distancing.\n""The world is getting back on its feet and a new sense of normal is coming back. Now is the time to put these solutions in place so people feel safe,"" said Akshata Kari, co-founder of Pixuate, an AI-based video analytics firm in tech hub Bengaluru.\nPixuate was one of six companies selected in May by the government\'s Technology Development Board (TDB) to develop ""a low-cost solution to identify persons with abnormal body temperature in a crowd"" and alert authorities.\nPixuate\'s product, which uses thermal cameras, has features such as facial recognition, and the ability to track a person – even if they are wearing a mask – and predict their age, gender and race, the TDB said in a statement.\nSuch data-driven technologies are gaining momentum across the world as countries look for ways to slow the virus\' spread, but their merit and effectiveness are debatable, warn privacy rights advocates.\nUrvashi Aneja, founding director of policy and advocacy collective Tandem Research, which has been reviewing tech tools being used during the pandemic, described some as ""alarming"".\n""When you create a society where you have extensive monitoring of citizens all the time, you also create a situation where people start self-sanctioning or self-censoring. And that is fundamentally not good for a democracy,"" said Aneja.\nPixuate is set to install its new product by the end of the year in ""some very large businesses and also government entities"", Kari said, without naming them.\nLast week, authorities fitted the device at a popular shopping hub in southern Bengaluru city as part of a clean air project aimed at making the area pedestrian-only on weekends, Kari added.\n""There are behavioural changes that are happening, and the checks, like temperature, wearing masks, social distance protocols or the way we greet each other ... have changed for good,"" she said.\n""In the post-COVID world, this will be the new normal, especially if we want to prevent another contagion.""\n""PROBLEMATIC""\nAt least 88 tech tools have been rolled out to support India\'s public health response to the pandemic, said Aneja, a speaker at the Thomson Reuters Foundation\'s annual Trust Conference on Wednesday (Nov 4).\nIn April, the federal government launched the contact-tracing mobile app Aarogya Setu, or Health Bridge, which gathers users\' GPS location data via Bluetooth to build a centralised database.\nWhile use of the app is generally voluntary, it has been made mandatory for food delivery workers, government and some private sector employees.\nAlso earlier this year, municipal workers in northern Chandigarh city were told they had to wear GPS watches that tracked their efficiency, triggering backlash from employees, campaigners and tech experts over privacy concerns.\nAuthorities say certain measures are needed to keep people safe.\n""Technology should be used for improving access to and quality of healthcare,"" said Praveen Gedam, deputy CEO of the National Health Authority, in emailed comments.\n""Advances in digital health must be accompanied by necessary safeguards and protections of the privacy of individuals, and due process must be followed.""\nIn April, government tenders seeking a ""personnel tracking GPS solution"" and a ""COVID-19 patient tracking tool"" raised red flags among digital rights groups, who warned they went beyond healthcare and ventured into mass surveillance.\nBroadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited (BECIL), under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said it wanted the first device to be wearable, like a wristwatch, so it can track the locations of medical workers during work hours.\nThe patient tracking tool, BECIL said, should detect ""where the suspect has spent most of his or her time and who all he or she has met"" as well as where they order food from, go for walks and sleep at night.\nThis prompted the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), a New Delhi-based digital rights group, to file a legal notice to BECIL to stop the procurement process.\nDevdutta Mukhopadhyay, a lawyer with the IFF, said BECIL has not yet responded to the organisation\'s legal notice and it was unclear whether the government enterprise had acquired the devices.\nBECIL did not respond to several requests for comment.\nMukhopadhyay noted that as long as India has no data protection law or independent data protection authority, there are few safeguards and no recourse if users\' data is abused or their digital privacy rights are violated.\nThe personal data protection Bill currently under review by a parliamentary panel does not cover surveillance activities.\nThe Bill does have provisions to allow the government to bypass protection standards and consent in certain circumstances, such as national security or the investigation of an offence, said Mukhopadhyay.\n""That\'s hugely problematic because it\'s a blanket exemption being granted to the government,"" she said.\nNeither the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting nor the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology were available to comment.\nSUNSET CLAUSE\nThe minister for electronics and information technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, has vowed that India will have a strong personal data protection law that will address citizens\' concerns over data privacy.\n""Data must belong to the sovereign nation concerned to protect the privacy of its people,"" he said in a virtual G20 meeting in July.\nBut with the flurry of tech measures launched in response to the coronavirus, campaigners warn against ""function creep"" – the use of data for purposes other than those for which it was collected – after the pandemic is over.\nA ""sunset clause"" – or expiration date – on tech tools, which would include the deletion of data after the pandemic, could be a solution, said Aneja of Tandem Research.\n""Otherwise, you will just see these technologies being repurposed into something else and that\'s dangerous,"" she said.\nMukhopadhyay at the IFF added that companies should give access to and allow independent third parties to publicly audit their technologies to build trust.\nShe also called on the government to introduce digital literacy and awareness lessons in school, to teach children about issues like cyber security, data privacy and fake news.\n""This is something that needs to be taught from a young age, because we need everyone to care about this,""

      NTU researchers lead development of AI-powered 'electronic nose' to sniff out meat freshness, reduce food waste
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have led an international team to invent\xa0an ""electronic nose"" that assesses the freshness of meat with 98.5 per cent accuracy.\nThe invention could help to reduce food wastage by confirming whether meat is fit for consumption more accurately than a ""best before"" label can, the research team said in a news release on Tuesday (Nov 10).\nThe electronic nose comprises two elements that mimic the way a mammal\'s nose recognises fresh or rotting meat.\nA\xa0coloured ""barcode"" made of chitosan, a type of natural sugar,\xa0is\xa0loaded with different dyes and acts as a set of receptors for the gases produced by decaying meat.\nThe dyes change colour in response to the different types and concentrations of gases, producing\xa0a unique combination of colours that serves as a ""scent fingerprint""\xa0for the state of any meat, said NTU.\nFor example, a yellow dye in the barcode changes to blue as it reacts to bioamines\xa0produced by decaying meat. Its colour intensity changes with an increasing concentration of bioamines as the meat decays further, the university explained.\nThe research team\xa0developed a classification system\xa0– fresh, less fresh or spoiled\xa0– using an international standard that determines meat freshness, NTU\xa0said.\nThe second part of the electronic nose is a barcode ""reader"", which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to interpret the combination of colours on the barcode.\nTo make the electronic nose portable, the reader is integrated into a smartphone application that can yield results in 30 seconds, NTU said.\nThe NTU research team, which collaborated with scientists from China\'s Jiangnan University and Australia\'s Monash University,\xa0trained the AI algorithm to pick out patterns using more than 3,400 images of barcodes glued to the packaging film of chicken, fish and beef.\xa0\nSubsequent tests of the electronic nose revealed an overall 98.5 per cent accuracy rate – 100 per cent accuracy in identifying spoiled meats, and 96 to 99 per cent accuracy for fresh and less fresh meats.\nWhile electronic noses have been extensively researched, there have been bottlenecks to commercialisation due to issues with accurately detecting and identifying odour, said director of NTU\'s Innovative Centre for Flexible Devices Professor Chen Xiaodong.\nThe NTU invention offered ""both a robust sensor setup and a data analysis method that can accurately predict scent fingerprints"", he said.\n""Our proof-of-concept artificial olfactory system, which we tested in real-life scenarios, can be easily integrated into packaging materials and yields results in a short time without the bulky wiring used for electrical signal collection in some e-noses that were developed recently,"" said Prof Chen.\n""These barcodes help consumers to save money by ensuring that they do not discard products that are still fit for consumption, which also helps the environment.\n""The biodegradable and non-toxic nature of the barcodes also means they could be safely applied in all parts of the food supply chain to ensure food freshness.""\nA patent has been filed for the invention\xa0and the team is working with a Singapore agribusiness company to extend the concept\xa0to\xa0other types of perishables, NTU said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Nanyang Technological University ', '     food ', '     technology ', '     science ']}"

      Can robots help to save the ailing F&amp;B industry?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Over the years, restaurant owner Jerry Singh has been constantly “fighting with other (food and beverage operators) to find bartenders”.\nIt takes him between two and six months to hire a bartender. And even when he finds one, the turnover rate is high.\n“We’re reliant on people who treat (bartending) as a career, but sad to say, not many Singaporeans treat this as a career,” he lamented.\n“We’ve offered all kinds of bonuses, such as commitment bonuses in months four and seven. We dangle the carrots, and it still doesn’t offer any guarantee that the guy will stay.”\nThis is why, for his new restaurant in Seletar Aerospace Park, he is leveraging a robot bartender system called Ratio — developed by Singaporean company Ross Digital — to alleviate that manpower crunch.\nThis bartender can make a cocktail in under two minutes: The robotic arm picks up a glass or a shaker, fills it up with alcohol from the bottles hanging from the ceiling, mixes it and slides it to the customer.\nRatio is a collaborative robot, or cobot, which is designed to work alongside humans in shared spaces.\nAnd with the coming of this new incarnation of robots, some F&B players are hoping there are ways it could help their ailing industry.\nROBOTS TO PRESERVE KOPITIAM-STYLE COFFEE?\nRatio was created in 2018 by Singaporean Gavin Pathross, chief executive officer of Ross Digital, as he saw a push for automation in the F&B industry. The company officially launched the Ratio Robotic Cafe and Lounge at The Centrepoint yesterday (Nov 2).\nRobots, he noted, can be programmed to do the repetitive and what some people consider the dirty work that “nobody really wants to do”, including washing dishes and flipping burgers.\nSome robots, like Ratio, can do more complex jobs, like making coffee and cocktails, he said.\nHe even thinks robots may potentially help to preserve kopitiam-style coffee-making when nobody else wants to earn a living making the S$1 cups of coffee that the old “tao chiew” (coffee brewers) now sell.\nTo create that authentic style of coffee, he had engineers work with several skilled brewers to understand their craft so that Ratio would be able to replicate what they do.\n“Through trial and error … we’ve managed to almost perfect it,” he said.\nAfter a tasting session, Ebenezer Coffee Manufacturer managing director Andrew Sim said the brew made by Ratio almost matched the taste of traditionally brewed coffee.\nIt was enough for him to believe that such robots can take over the “tao chiew” role in future. “(The) robot-made coffee will be very consistent (while the) ‘tao chiew’ coffee will be quite inconsistent,” he said.\nEarlier this year, local start-up Hawkermatic also launched a machine that can make a consistent cup of kopitiam-style coffee after its founder, Jason Thai, could not find a skilled brewer for his canteen-style coffee shop at Infinite Studios in one-north.\nThen there is Ella, a state-of-the-art robotic barista created by Crown Group's technology arm, Crown Digital. The company is now seeking to expand Ella’s market presence in Singapore and beyond.\nIntroducing kopitiam-style coffee (Nanyang-style coffee) to international markets is also something Pathross hopes to do.\n“We’ll take that technology overseas to Europe and the United States, where we can serve homesick Singaporeans (and) expose the Americans and Europeans to Nanyang coffee,” he said.\nMORE EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE\nAccording to him, the use of robots can also help to mitigate some of the costs in the F&B industry, which has been greatly challenged by rentals, wages and the cost of ingredients.\nThe cost of leasing Ratio is between S$2,500 and S$3,500 a month, which is comparable to the average salary of F&B service staff, including bartenders.\n“But what you get is about three to four times the efficiency, depending on how long you want the robot to work,” said Pathross, adding that a robot can work 24/7, has almost no downtime and “typically … doesn’t fall sick”.\n“Robots are generally quite good in not wasting or making wrong drinks, which means (they) can reduce the cost of ingredients.”\nA well-trained barista can make up to 60 cups of latte an hour, but a robot probably doubles that, he reckoned.\nSingh, whose monthly lease on Ratio includes kitchen equipment such as ice machines, chillers and coffee equipment, agrees that the robot will be more efficient and reliable.\nHe met Pathross about a year ago in Shanghai, at a pop-up cafe-bar with this robotic bartender, and was convinced that this technology would be able to serve the F&B industry, since “we’re cursed by manpower crunch issues”.\n“There’s always that issue of unreliable staff and high turnover. The only way to eradicate it will be (automation),” said Singh. “It’s almost impossible to find good, reliable bartenders to stay with you too. They’d want to move around.”\nA CROWD-PULLER?\nTo test the robot’s speed, CNA Insider set up a friendly 'contest' between Ratio and bartender Sylvia Yee.\nTo make a Tom Yum Martini, both robot and human took one and a half minutes, which impressed Yee. But she was not worried about losing her job to robotics.\n“The human bartender will still be the one to come up with a cocktail recipe … or come up with a new cocktail trend,” she said. “(Robots) still need to work … together with a very experienced bartender.”\nIn fact, that is what Singh has planned for when his new restaurant, The Singapura Aerospace Club, opens this month: A bartender to attend to his customers while Ratio makes the cocktails in the background.\n“It’s still a people business. We aren’t going to become a faceless business … The human touch will still be there — it’ll never be taken away,” said Singh, who also runs The Singapura Club restaurants on Haji Lane and Dunlop Street.\nBut he hopes the robot bartender can help to bring in the crowd too, at a time when footfall in F&B establishments is declining because of COVID-19.\n“It’ll be a cool novelty for them to … see how a robot bartender works. This innovation will appeal to the young and the old,” he said. “Not many have seen this kind of technology.”\nLawrence Loh, an associate professor of strategy and policy at the National University of Singapore Business School, thinks the concept’s novelty value can draw people to such establishments, at least initially.\n“But it may not be indicative of a sustained demand,” he said. “In the long run, (the F&B outlet) must still have a value proposition and a unique selling point.”\nEditor's note: An\xa0earlier version of this story compared the time it took for the robot and a human to make a cup of tea. The company has since clarified that this was not an accurate comparison as each performed different variations of the process.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      As COVID-19 speeds up automation, what does the future hold for non-tech job seekers?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Technology - it is\xa0one of the few sectors still hiring despite the COVID-19 economic fallout; it is\xa0what has enabled many employees to work from home amid the pandemic; it could also displace many jobs over the next few years.\xa0\nAccording to the\xa0World Economic Forum in its latest Future of Jobs report released in October, half of the businesses surveyed plan to accelerate the automation of jobs in their companies.\nForty-three per cent indicated that they are set to reduce their workforce over the next few years due to technology integration, while 34 per cent said they\xa0plan to expand their workforce for the same reason.\n""By 2025, the time spent on current tasks at work by humans and machines will be equal,"" said the WEF report.\xa0\nTechnology-based jobs populate the top 20 in a\xa0list of emerging jobs, from data analysts to robotics engineers. Those that are increasingly redundant include accountants, human resource specialists and\xa0relationship managers.\xa0\nThe report is based on a survey of senior management leaders from nearly 300 companies worldwide - including 29 with operations in Singapore. Data was collected between January and September this year.\xa0\nSo in a future where technology dominates work processes, what do employment prospects look like for people who cannot tell the difference between Python and Java?\xa0\nIt is not necessary for most people to master coding or learn to build software, tech industry players and recruitment experts told CNA, although they noted that it is important to be able to\xa0use the latest technological tools that relate to an employee\'s job function.\nEven in a technology firm, non-tech roles like public relations and product design executives will still be necessary in the future - and employees are required to have strong communication skills or a good eye, said Mr Alex\xa0Teo, the people experience and government relations lead at online cashback platform ShopBack. It\xa0has 150 employees in Singapore and about 500 in nine territories.\nEven then, some basic level of coding or data analysis might be required of most of its employees going forward, he said. For example,\xa0his finance and marketing teams need to know programming language to\xa0enable\xa0them to pull out information about transactions or create email newsletters.\n“So knowledge of those coding languages … I think going forward. That may be the expectation for (most people),” Mr Teo said.\xa0\nSimilarly, co-founder of digital wealth manager Stashaway Michele Ferrario\xa0said many roles in the company do not need technical know-how, such as those in marketing, compliance and client engagement.\xa0\nDigital tools these departments use, like customer relationship management systems, have also become more user-friendly and\xa0intuitive over the years, he added.\nNonetheless, there are business development or strategy positions where data analysis is required and “being able to code will make you faster”, he said.\nStashaway currently has around 130 employees across five territories,\xa0with more than half of them in Singapore. Headcount is likely to increase to 200 plus or more than 300 in the next few years, Mr Ferrario said.\nRather than focus on becoming a computing expert, workers should put their energy into finding out how technology will affect their roles and learn to use the latest digital tools, industry players said.\xa0\n“Tech jobs do not always mean coding or software development. There is a range of jobs in tech, such as product management, digital marketing, data analytics, user experience design (and more),” said Ms Aziza Sheerin, the Asia senior regional director of\xa0General Assembly, an educational organisation that runs classes in technology.\xa0\n“What is important is for\xa0people to understand how to leverage tech in their roles now,” she said.\n“I think tech is an enabler, but it doesn\'t really mean that you have to be a\xa0hardcore technical person …\xa0the key message is the ability to adapt and change,” said Mr Eric Heung, a manager of supply chain and\xa0procurement at recruitment firm Robert Walters. He cited the example of marketing executives who were\xa0used to print advertising strategies having to now grasp the idea of social media campaigns.\xa0\n“If they are not interested in tech, they should still think about how is technology going to change their function, what they\'re doing, or their industry,” he said.\xa0\nMs Feon Ang, LinkedIn’s Asia Pacific vice-president of talent and learning solutions, said the best way to future-proof yourself is to pick up both technical skills\xa0and “soft skills” - interpersonal skills related to traits like creativity and\xa0persuasiveness.\n“Most jobs today require professionals today to possess basic digital skills and we know there will also be demand for professionals with deeper technical skills as businesses adapt to the changing environment,” she said, referring to\xa0how COVID-19 has led to a working environment heavily reliant on technology.\xa0\nData collected by LinkedIn from its users found that between June and August, software engineers were most in demand in Singapore, based on the proportion of hires with this job title. And among the top three most important skills was\xa0the ability to use coding languages JavaScript or\xa0Java.\xa0\nTo support such roles, Ms Ang said there will be\xa0a need for professionals who are able to conduct collaboration\xa0and manage teams across a digital space, which is where the “soft skills” come\xa0in.\xa0\nLEARNING NEW SKILLS\nEven before the pandemic hit, some\xa0in Singapore have\xa0jumped on the coding bandwagon.\nMr Koh Han Seng enrolled in SG Code Campus in March to learn how to use Python and is now in the next level of classes diving into data analytics.\xa0\nApart from using his programming expertise to invest in the stock market, the 52-year-old said he took up the courses as he plans to work as a business consultant. The potential new role, he believes, will\xa0require him to scrutinise and sort through data.\xa0\nMs Siti Herda Nuryani Nasir, a former\xa0customer service officer with Singapore Airlines, got herself into General Assembly’s software engineering course in March last year as a way of switching careers.\xa0\nLike Mr Koh, Ms Nuryani said it was a steep learning curve, jumping into studying something so technical and completely new to her.\nWhat helped to keep them going, they said, was the motivation to learn.\xa0\n“I have always been interested in programming, (so) I enjoyed all the time I put into practising and learning more about it,” said Ms Nuryani, who is now a junior software engineer at start-up\xa0Online Pajak.\xa0“I think being able to enjoy what you are going to do most of your time is also really important.”\nRepresentatives from the schools said it is possible for anyone to become a coder or software developer.\xa0\nAlthough having a science, engineering or mathematics background does give students a leg up in the classroom, General Assembly’s Ms Sheerin pointed out that she has\xa0seen students from non-technical backgrounds graduate and\xa0find a job after that.\xa0\nOne of them was a cabin crew member who studied software engineering and is now a developer at a bank; another moved from being an architect to a user experience designer.\xa0\nFounder of SG Code Campus Ian Choo agreed that while being more math or science-inclined is helpful in some areas of technology, like machine learning or data science, the outcomes of its three-month boot camps in other aspects like mobile or Web programming is proof that it is possible for anyone to make the switch.\n“Both competency and interest can definitely be nurtured,” said Ms Sheerin. What her five years at General Assembly have\xa0shown is that students need to have enough motivation to see through their training long enough to gain\xa0competency, she added.\nThere is no “cookie-cutter approach” to developing an interest in technology, but taking a broader view of hobbies helps, she said, noting that some people who were very much into playing video games decided they want to build games themselves, while\xa0others who were active in community service wanted to figure out how to apply technology to their work.\xa0\n“I see interest as (something that can be developed)\xa0because it’s something that’s within the control of the instructor,” said Mr Choo. “I think it really boils down to -\xa0are you convinced that it is useful. And then if you are convinced that it is useful, is it worth your\xa0time?\xa0And in the process of learning it, do you find it fun?”\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     technology ', '     jobs ', '     World Economic Forum ']}"

      Bring Singaporeans back home, grow local talent for Smart Nation efforts: Vivian Balakrishnan
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Having people well versed in digital skills is key to Singapore’s Smart Nation drive, and the country hopes to attract Singaporeans based overseas to return home to work on such projects, said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative Vivian Balakrishnan.\xa0\nThis is on top of continued efforts to grow the local talent pool, he added.\xa0\nDr Balakrishnan noted that with the global shortage of tech talent, there are “hundreds” of Singaporeans who are working abroad in places\xa0such as the Silicon Valley in the United States, China and Southeast Asia.\xa0\n“So the first thing is wherever possible, bring our people back home … The second source is (to) grow our own people,” he said during an interview conducted as part of the CNA Leadership Summit 2020.\xa0\nProgress has been made in growing the local talent pool, Dr Balakrishnan added, with the intake for infocomm courses at Singapore’s universities and polytechnics having trebled over the last five to six years for example.\nBut this may not be enough, which is why foreign talent is needed to complement the local workforce, he said.\n“So the third element has been (to) carefully and judiciously … complement our own local workforce by bringing in people from overseas who … truly have the skills that we need, who complement us, who have the networks, who have that extra ideas and verve to help us with the start-up scene in order to grow a bigger ecosystem,” he said during the interview that was broadcast on Tuesday night (Oct 27).\xa0\nDr Balakrishnan was responding to a question from CNA Digital’s Chief Editor Jaime Ho about the people needed for Singapore’s Smart Nation vision, as well as how he would describe the “balance” for such talent required by the public and private sectors as COVID-19 accelerates the Government’s push towards digitalisation.\nOn whether the Government is “taking up too much of the local talent”, he replied: “When I meet a Singaporean overseas, my first pitch to them is there are … lots of opportunities in Singapore for you to do meaningful work.\n“I hope you will consider the Government, you will consider the local companies and you will consider the multinational digital companies … All the tech giants are here and in fact, it’s no secret (that) more and more of them are coming here.”\nThe Government needs to have “enough talent” as it envisions and creates the necessary digital infrastructure and software, but it plays a “complementary role”, said Dr Balakrishnan.\n“We need to be able to generate some of our own apps, but not all. We need to be able to be familiar enough with the technology so that even when we outsource, we outsource in a smart way.”\nAdding that many of the Government’s initiatives are open-source, he added: “We in fact want the private sector to take the ideas and the services here, license it to them either for free or for very minimal rates and let them run with it.”\nHe cited the example of the national digital check-in system SafeEntry, which was developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech).\n“We've made this platform technology available to the private sector so that they will develop the machines or the services which will ride on it,” said Dr Balakrishnan who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n“So I see very much a complementary role between what the government engineers are doing and the opportunities for the private sector. That is, I think, healthy and will put us in good stead for the future.”\n“MORE PREPARED” FOR COVID-19\nThe ramping up of engineering talent, be it getting Singaporeans abroad to return home or recruitment within the civil service, is just one of the efforts under way since the country outlined its Smart Nation vision in 2014.\xa0\nMuch focus has also been put on laying out the infrastructure – for instance, having broadband network in every home and office – and ensuring digital inclusion.\n“So if you think about these three factors – the infrastructure, the talent and digital inclusion – fortunately (these were) already in place by the time COVID-19 broke out,” said Dr Balakrishnan.\nHe noted how the coronavirus pandemic has prompted a nationwide shift to home-based learning for students and working from home for adults.\nThe distribution of face masks and provision of information would also not have been possible if Singapore did not have pervasive broadband and wireless connectivity, he said.\xa0\n“We were in a sense much more prepared than many other places have been,” said the minister, adding that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 was also a “preparatory event”.\nBut Dr Balakrishnan acknowledged that there were still “gaps exposed”.\nFor one, there was the challenge of disseminating credible information in an accurate and timely manner given the hyper-connected world.\n“In fact, the issue was not just publicising accurate information but also dealing with the fact that there are so many competing narratives,” he told CNA. “Getting above that pebble noise was a challenge.”\nAnother challenge was the use of digital tools in enhancing contact tracing efforts, which raised privacy concerns in the early stages.\xa0\n“It illustrated that we need to explain, re-explain, reassure, and I think what was helpful in our case was that we were able to do so in an open and timely fashion,” the minister said.\nThe country’s contact tracing tools, both software and hardware, were open-sourced and this allowed “people to come take a look … check that it was indeed what we said it was”, he added.\xa0\nNoting how it has been about 10 months since the COVID-19 outbreak began, Dr Balakrishnan added: “So my overall take (is) number one, we were prepared. Number two, there were gaps that we were able to respond to.\n“Number three, now we have to start thinking (about) the new normal. What has changed permanently? What are the short-term changes and which parts of the old we've got to maintain and in fact, re-affirm?”\nON CHANGE NEEDED AND TRUST\nThese include how Singapore has to transition from being digital consumers into digital producers.\n“If you move forward to where the future is, it’s not enough for us to just be consumers because ultimately our market is small,” Dr Balakrishnan told CNA.\n“In order for Singapore to find that niche for the future, we do need to be able to make, to create, to innovate, to synthesise or in digital speak, they will say to mesh.\n“The individual components may be open-sourced, may be commoditised, but it’s the way you mesh your services together therein lies the future.”\nHe pointed to the local jobs market which, despite rising unemployment, continues to see some sectors with labour shortages as the pandemic quickens digital transformation.\n“In order to get the restructuring done, we need people with skills,” he added, likening it to how the Government began recruiting engineers “in a big way” six years ago.\nWithout these engineers, apps such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether, or even having official government communication channels on Telegram and WhatsApp would not have been possible.\n“That requires people with the ability to create, to make, to fix, to find new insights and offer new services. This is, I believe, crucial for our future,” said the minister.\nDr Balakrishnan raised another example of the gaming industry, which has grown to be bigger than the movie industry.\n“We want to be more than just gamers or distributing games. Although that’s still a very big part of the overall game, we need to get people who can make those games, improve those games, repackage, resynthesise new value propositions.”\nThe minister was also asked about the importance of building trust and lessons learnt from the pandemic.\n“We've always known that trust is absolutely essential … and equally important in this crisis, you need public trust because without that trust, you’re not going to get full compliance and without full compliance, many of the scientifically and correct things to do can’t be executed,” he said.\nReferring to past instances of data leaks, he added: “The fact that we dive deeply into the causes, we sorted out what we needed to do (and) in fact are still doing in order to strengthen our networks, and that we did so in an open way where we were at fault we just said ‘Yes, this was a failing’ – the fact that we did all that also put us in good stead.”\nIn 2018, Singapore saw its most serious breach of personal data when 1.5 million SingHealth\xa0patients’ records\xa0were stolen. About 160,000 of them had their dispensed medicines’ records taken.\xa0\nA Committee of Inquiry set up to investigate the cyberattack later put out 16 recommendations as a “necessary and vital first step” to combat cybersecurity threats.\nDr Balakrishnan added: “Now in a crisis when we are in fact collecting more data than we would otherwise do, but at least we have the confidence that questions of encryption, data security, network security, rules of accountability, what you can share, what you can’t share … all those frameworks have been thought of and that we’re implementing and we’re working according to those rules.”\n“A DRESS REHEARSAL”\nMoving forward, Singapore will have to prepare for the likelihood of another outbreak that can be as contagious as COVID-19 but with a higher mortality rate like the 1918 flu pandemic, said the minister.\xa0\n“With that in mind, what it means is that everything that we're facing now, the adjustments that we are making, the way that we are applying technology and the way we are restructuring even our workforce and our work habits, this is a dress rehearsal,” he added.\n“This is not the National Day Parade, this is the preview parade.”\nA return to the old normal will not be possible and would be dangerous if one tries to, added Dr Balakrishnan.\n“So that makes it all the more vital that we learn the right lessons and we prepare ourselves for the future,” he said, noting that Singapore has to “envisage a new normal”.\n“A new normal where we’re not paralysed by fear and confined at home, or unable to work. But a new normal where we can do all the things that we need to do.\n“And I don’t mean just to survive, but to thrive and to grow and to expand our economy, our society and make it more vibrant, but do so with all these precautions,” he added.\nThe CNA Leadership Summit 2020: Navigating the Post-Pandemic World will discuss through a series of TV programmes and webinars how businesses and organisations\xa0have reacted to the pandemic\xa0and applied innovative practices.\nMore details are available at:\xa0cna.asia/leadership-summit.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Smart Nation ', '     technology ']}"

      Singapore’s foray into space: Boldly going where no little red dot has gone before
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Over the past four years, Singapore-based start-up Transcelestial has made a device called Centauri, about the size of a shoe box. Its aim: To provide internet connectivity that is around 1,000 times faster, or more, than now.\nIt just needs to connect to a satellite using laser communications — no, make that a global satellite network the company wants to put into space.\nWorking from home at the speed of light, however, “isn’t even scratching the surface of the capability” of laser-linked satellites, says Transcelestial co-founder Rohit Jha.\nHe is looking into connecting “roughly three and a half billion people” — about half the world who have no internet connectivity or have “very basic 2G-level phone services”.\n“All you have to do is position a satellite above (them), drop a laser link, and you can power high-bandwidth internet to everyone,” he tells the programme Why It Matters.\nTranscelestial is still doing research and development for its global space network, and eyeing a roll-out by the end of 2024.\nThe start-up is not alone in aiming high. There are more than 30 firms and over 1,000 people in Singapore’s budding space industry.\nAnd the effort they are putting into space technology is giving the nation a larger stake in the space race than many people may think.\nSince 2004, investors have put US$135 billion (S$183 billion) into the global space sector. Singapore, though a little red dot, accounts for 7 per cent of the global share.\nBy 2040, the global space industry could generate revenue of US$1.1 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. It is a race for big money, even as Singapore’s foray into space could help to solve world problems too.\nWATCH: Singapore’s ‘space force’: Entrepreneurs blasting their way into outer space (3:58)\n‘LOW-HANGING FRUIT’\nFor space superpowers and private companies with deep pockets, going into space also means attempting missions to the Moon and beyond.\nBut that is not the kind of breakthrough that Singapore Space and Technology Association president Jonathan Hung thinks the Republic needs.\nSize is a consideration here — the Kennedy Space Centre, where such missions blast off in the United States, occupies a site that is 80 per cent of Singapore’s land area.\n“We’ve got to pick and choose what we want to do. Right now, Singapore’s play is very much within the satellite domain. Now, satellites can do quite a lot. Specifically, we cover telecommunications. We also cover advanced navigation,” says Hung.\nThese are some of the “low-hanging fruit” he believes should not be underestimated. “There are good jobs. We can create … advanced manufacturing activities. All these things will help regenerate and spur the economy on.”\nWithout satellites providing location tracking, smartphone apps that people take for granted, like ride-hailing services and Google Maps, would stop working. There are now more than 2,500 satellites orbiting the earth, and experts say there will be more.\nThese go as far as 35,000 kilometres away, which is the orbital altitude of geosynchronous satellites transmitting television and other signals to the ground. There are also satellites orbiting at lower levels.\nTranscelestial, for example, plans to put its satellites at around 1,000 km above ground, which is a reason its signals would be faster — taking “less than five milliseconds” instead of a delay of “almost a second”, says Jha.\nAnother benefit of its satellite technology, especially to a city like Singapore, could be the cheaper and thus faster roll-out of 5G.\n“If you’re building fibre networks, a kilometre of fibre is roughly around US$100,000 to US$150,000 … Our device usually comes in at one-tenth of that price,” cites Jha.\nEYE IN THE SKY\nSatellite products and services are driving more than half of space-related commercial activities worldwide. In Singapore, the first commercial remote sensing satellite built here — called TeLEOS-1 — was launched in 2015 by Singapore Technologies (ST) Electronics.\nThe satellite gave the Republic an eye in the sky to see what was going in the region, with geospatial analysts studying its pictures to provide insights for organisations willing to pay for them.\nFor example, satellite imagery can give “a picture of how the oil volumes change in the various oil storage tanks around the world”, cites geospatial solutions architect Leow Hua Sheng from ST Engineering Geo-Insights.\nWithin Singapore, TeLEOS-1 can capture images of Pulau Bukom’s oil storage facilities, which have tanks with floating roofs that move up and down depending on the volume of oil.\nSuch information can be fed into a model to “make a more accurate prediction” about oil prices, says Leow.\nThe satellite has also been tasked with capturing images of vessels in Singapore’s Western Anchorage, as “we know that certain vessels would participate in illegal activities, like illegal oil bunkering, illegal ship-to-ship transhipments, human trafficking or illegal smuggling of goods”.\nThen there was the earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu, Indonesia, in 2018. The satellite’s images revealed the extent of the damage.\n“If there were any road networks that were affected, if there were any buildings that collapsed, we were able to identify (them),” recalls Leow. “We could … tell (the authorities) where they should assign their search and rescue.”\nThere are just two problems with TeLEOS-1: It cannot see through clouds, and is blind at night.\nSo engineers are putting together something with a more powerful vision: TeLEOS-2, which is now undergoing testing. It will carry radar that can capture images day or night, and no matter what the weather condition.\nBut it may be a couple of years before the satellite is launched.\nA team of 70 engineers took five years to develop TeLEOS-1, considering the space environment a satellite must operate in “compared to our everyday electronics”, as systems engineer Tan Chek Wu puts it.\nFor example, it alternates between heat and cold “14 to 15 times a day” in orbit, cites Tan, who is with ST Engineering’s satellite systems. It also travels at “more than 7 km per second” — even airplane speeds do not come close.\nAnd to ensure that a satellite can “survive the vibrations of the journey” on a rocket launched into space, his team must “put it on a big shaker” first.\nNANOSATELLITES AND 18-METRE ROCKETS\nWhile the TeLEOS-1 is a 400-kg satellite, former defence engineer Ng Zhen Ning thinks the start-up he co-founded in 2017, NuSpace, has a winning edge with satellites weighing less than 10 kg.\nThese nanosatellites can do almost anything conventional satellites can, like monitoring weather conditions or tracking internet data.\n“It’s all thanks to miniaturisation of technology,” says Ng, citing the mobile phone as an example. “That has shrunk to the size of an iPhone. The same thing has happened for nanosatellites.”\nThere may be a vast expanse of space, but budgets are limited. “Building such satellites is roughly 50 times cheaper,” points out the 30-year-old, who expects the cost to go down further, together with the mass manufacturing of satellites.\n“We’re working with contract manufacturers to figure out how we can streamline the entire assembly process. And hopefully by 2024, we should be able to have this assembly line here in Singapore.”\nSmall satellites have some downsides, however. Big satellites get priority on rockets because they take up most of the space. So if their production schedules are delayed, then everyone else must wait.\nRocket makers are now coming up with smaller spacecraft so small satellites can have a dedicated ride to space. In Singapore, 29-year-old Simon Gwozdz is looking into this, starting with a research rocket as a prototype for something more powerful.\nHis dream rocket would be 18 metres high, or six storeys. This would still be six times smaller than some of the largest rockets ever made, as high as 110 metres.\nHis grander plan, however, is to launch rockets from locations nearer to Singapore.\n“Being close to the equator is very, very helpful in launching a rocket. It can go into any kind of orbit. (It) means you can get into any kind of market niche,” says the founder of Equatorial Space Systems.\nWATCH: Inside Singapore's quest to outer space — the full episode (22:36)\nCompared with the polar regions, an equatorial launch would also save fuel, as the surface at the equator moves faster, giving a rocket an extra push.\n“We don't have much land in Singapore … but there’s a lot of sea. And sea launching has also been done for a number of years,” notes Gwozdz.\n“All you have to do is take a barge, retrofit it a little bit, install some extra equipment, and you can use it.”\nThe ideal location to him would be the Indian Ocean, “because we won’t be overflying anybody’s territory”. He is also looking at the South China Sea, “not very far from the coastline of Johor”.\n“We’re currently exploring the possibility of conducting launch operations from that site,” he says, while noting that co-ordination with Malaysia and also Indonesia is “absolutely necessary” in any rocket launch.\nHe thinks it is worth investing in sending a rocket to space, because “in 20 years’ time, a country with no sovereign launch capability will be … like a country that doesn’t have its own airline”.\n“Why should we invest in pretty (much) anything, in Changi Airport in the first place?” he adds. “Space is becoming a ground for doing business, on top of the exploration of more lofty ideas of course.”\nWatch more episodes of Why It Matters here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Commentary: Looks like China has its own '+1' strategy and Southeast Asia is it
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: There is a concept among the business community known as the “China Plus One (+1)” strategy where China remains the main supply source or consumer market for a company but a business diversifies certain operations to other countries.\nCompanies with a stake in the lucrative Chinese market may find it imperative to diversify their supply chains for a variety of reasons: Rising business costs in China, uncertainties stemming from the US-China trade spat and, more recently, border closures owing to COVID-19.\n""It is worth emphasising that China appears ahead of the global curve when it comes to restarting the economy following months of lockdown, and many of the reasons why companies are in China in the first place still hold true today,"" Alan Beebe, President of AmCham China, was quoted in an Apr 17 press release detailing a joint survey with PwC of 25 US companies in China.\n""As a result, we expect to see companies adopting a \'China + 1\' strategy as a way to diversify supply chain risks while tapping into China market opportunities.""\nCHINA’S + 1\nHowever, recent trends point to China adopting its own “+1” strategy. Southeast Asia appears to be at the heart of that approach, particularly for China tech behemoths.\nChinese business ventures are not new to the region as large tech giants such as Huawei and Alibaba, have a considerable presence in the region’s markets directly or through affiliates.\nFurther, data compiled by the AidData Research Lab, affiliated to the College of William & Mary in the US, titled China’s Public Diplomacy in East Asia and the Pacific 1.0, shows China has contributed to a steady flow of infrastructure investment projects in Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam between 2001 and 2016.\nBut the presence of Chinese investments here has intensified within the last two years.\nFor instance, just in the first seven months of last year alone, as the trade war with China gained speed, Chinese companies invested approximately US$1.78 billion (S$2.44 billion) into tech start-ups in the region, including Malaysia’s Easy Parcel, Singapore’s livestreaming company Bigo and Indonesia’s Tokopedia by Chinese companies.\nAccording to fintech firm Refinitiv, this was eight times higher than the same period in 2018.\xa0\nOverall, Chinese investment in the region has almost tripled in value from US$3.5 billion in 2010 US$10.2 billion in 2018, data provided by ASEANstats shows.\xa0\nRecently, Chinese tech companies such as Bytedance, Alibaba and Tencent have been investing in business initiatives in Singapore.\nBytedance, the company that owns TikTok, announced plans to invest billions of dollars and recruit hundreds of employees in Singapore over the next three years.\xa0\nSimilarly, Tencent will be opening its regional hub in Singapore while Alibaba intends to invest US$3 billion in Southeast Asian-focused ride-hailing company Grab.\xa0\nWhat has sparked this increased interest in the region? To comprehend this, it’s worth looking at the business ambitions of Chinese tech companies and the constraints they face.\xa0\nAMBITION AND CHALLENGES OF CHINESE TECH COMPANIES \nFirst, all of them want to access new markets for revenue growth as domestic competition within China has gotten more aggressive. Many of these firms also have aspirations to be global companies.\nSecond, to stay ahead of the competition, Chinese tech companies need to acquire strategic resources such as new technologies, talent with the relevant expertise and a larger ecosystem network to elevate them to the next level.\nDespite having such strong ambitions, these Chinese tech companies have faced strong headwinds. In particular, the push back from the US through its trade war and decoupling with China.\nTikTok and Tencent’s WeChat are some of the Chinese tech companies facing a strong backlash in the US market.\nTrust towards Chinese companies in general has deteriorated lately due to China’s perceived lack of transparency in handling COVID-19 outbreak, according to a study by the Brunswick Group.\nLOSING HONG KONG AS A GATEWAY\nHong Kong has lost its lustre as the preferred gateway for China to the world. It was the centre where global MNCs and Chinese tech companies collaborated and closed deals until frequent hostile street protests and stronger mainland government intervention disrupted this.\nBusiness travel between China and Hong Kong had been further inhibited. The city was not in the list of countries granted green lane access to the mainland.\nA survey by the American Chamber of Commerce reported that almost 40 per cent of its members had plans to leave Hong Kong. CEO of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce George Leung Siu-kay noted in a radio programme in Hong Kong that the city is no longer a business paradise for enterprises.\nHaving to move out of the US and Hong Kong, China tech firms’ access to capital markets on Nasdaq and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be constrained.\xa0\nThis is not healthy when they need funds to fuel global expansion. They will need a new location where they can gain access to more private or public investors.\nHOW CHINESE TECH COMPANIES CAN FULFILL THEIR AMBITIONS\nChinese companies are also trying to evolve their status and establish themselves as international brand to shed negative views that come with being seen as a Chinese firm.\nSetting up global operations in a politically neutral country that provide access to talent, financial markets and business networks for growth can help achieve that.\nChinese tech firms also want to access companies they can invest in or acquire to bolster their technology capabilities, regional networks and access to new markets.\nFor instance, Alibaba’s recent investment in Grab could give it entry into markets in the region where ride-hailing company already established a strong presence.\nWHY SOUTHEAST ASIA?\nAs of November 2019, Chinese companies had already expanded into almost 130 countries in the world. Research by both the Pew Research Centre and The Brunswick Group has demonstrated that emerging markets eager to attract investments are overwhelmingly welcoming to Chinese businesses.\nSimilarly, developed countries also present equally attractive opportunities for Chinese tech companies.\xa0\xa0\nBringing in financial and technological investments to local companies, opening up sales channels into China, creating job opportunities and attracting Chinese tourism money are some of the prime appeal for welcoming Chinese businesses into their shores.\nBy 2030, ASEAN is projected to be the fourth-largest single market economy in the market.\xa0\nIt is thus unsurprising that Chinese investments into the region are projected to reach US$500 billion by 2035 as reported by the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office.\nThis shows that Chinese companies are aggressively looking for ways to deepen their roots in the Southeast Asian market as the US becomes a more hostile destination.\nWith attractive benefits from the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), Chinese tech companies will be keen to increase their presence in regional markets and form a new ecosystem.\xa0\nThis may attract even more global FDI to the region, especially from western MNCs that are forced to withdraw from China and Hong Kong due to recent geopolitical tensions.\nThat is why Southeast Asia is seeing strong interest from Chinese companies as they find the region an appealing alternative to compensate for their loss in market growth elsewhere.\nThe spat between US and China may see more investments shift towards the ASEAN region, driving growth and job creation.\nFor Chinese companies being hindered from expanding into the US markets, they now have a new lease of life for internationalisation.\nIndeed, there is a silver lining for everyone.\nDr Lau Kong Cheen and Dr Vanessa Liu are senior lecturers, Marketing Programme at the School of Business in the Singapore University of Social Sciences. \n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     US ', '     business ', '     Southeast Asia ', '     ASEAN ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Singapore's Sea is world's best performing stock. And it can do better
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When we think of unicorn start-ups in the region, many people will immediately think of Grab, valued at around US$14 billion (S$19.05 billion) based on its latest round of financing.\xa0\nBut there is another successful start-up in Singapore that leaves Grab in its wake in some aspects.\nSea Limited is probably Singapore’s largest company. Yet many Singaporeans may never even have heard of it unless they happen to be an avid gamer or online shopper.\xa0\nBut even then, the name might not be quite as familiar as Grab whose logo is emblazoned across its livery of private-hire cars, food-delivery riders and payment services through its mobile app.\nThe understated Sea Limited was founded by Forrest Li in Singapore in 2009 originally as Garena, which is an online games portal. Instead of listing on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) in its hometown of Singapore, the company chose to be floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 2017.\nThat strategy has worked well for Sea Limited. The company’s stock has soared more than 1,000 per cent since the beginning of 2018 and nearly 300 per cent this year alone, giving it a current market value of S$92.7 billion and making it the company that has gained the most market value this year on the Nasdaq.\nIn terms of market value, Sea Limited’s lofty price tag makes it nearly twice as big as Singapore’s largest listed company, DBS Group; three times larger than Singtel, and almost eight times bigger than Singapore’s largest real estate investment trust, Ascendas REIT.\nA STASH OF CASH\nThe staggering valuation of Sea Limited is even more amazing, given that it has not made a cent in profit either at the operating level or on the bottom line for the last six years. But as they say in the stock market, it is better to travel than to arrive, especially if you can afford to pay for the ride.\nAnd Sea Limited has plenty of cash in the tank. Not only does its balance sheet boasts S$4.75 billion of cash in the bank, it also has a visionary investor, Tencent Holdings, which has very deep pockets. The Chinese internet conglomerate owns 22.9 per cent of Sea Limited’s outstanding shares.\nTencent’s interest in Sea Limited probably stems from the Singapore company’s success in tapping into the growing video gaming market in Southeast Asia.\xa0\nFor some perspective, the size of the global video-gaming market is estimated to be worth US$174 billion by 2021. The Asia-Pacific region is especially significant, with revenue of US$72 billion in 2019, which is more than double of the North American market.\nEMERGING GROWTH\nThe key markets in Asia Pacific for Sea Limited are China, Japan, and South Korea. But beyond those top three countries, there are opportunities aplenty in Southeast Asia’s emerging growth market, which is where Sea Limited plans to dominate, through its Garena games platform.\nIn 2019, revenue from its Digital Entertainment division of S$1.5 billion was more than double that of S$630 million a year ago. It accounted for almost half of the group’s total revenue of S$2.9 billion. What’s more, it has been growing quickly. It is three times more than at the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2017.\nThe secret of Garena’s growth has been through its popular video game Free Fire, which was developed by 111 Dots Studio and published by Garena.\xa0\nThe success of Free Fire has been attributed to its ability to run on almost every device, especially on low-end handsets that tend to be more prevalent in some of the less developed regions of Southeast Asia. These include Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand where Sea Limited operates.\nThe rising demand for Free Fire has propelled it to become the most downloaded video game in 2019. In 2020, Garena said the video game hit a peak record of 80 million daily active users, which surpassed its previous record of 60 million daily active users.\nFLAMES OF SUCCESS\nEven though Free Fire has been a massive success for Sea Limited, gamers are typically on the lookout for the next best thing and might consequently choose to move on.\nThis is where Sea Limited’s strategic partnership with Tencent could be a win-win for both companies.\xa0\nA good example is the collaboration between China’s Tencent, Singapore’s Sea Limited and America’s Activision Blizzard to offer the Call of Duty: Mobile game in Southeast Asia. It has allowed Garena to expand beyond its own developed games.\nThere is another reason why the collaboration could be mutually beneficial. In 2018 China’s regulators took active steps to crack down on gaming addiction amongst minors. The State Administration of Press and Publication (SAPP) applied stricter regulation to limit the number of games entering the market each year.\nThere are signs that some of the restrictions have been eased by the SAPP since the start of this year. But a collaboration between the two companies could provide a convenient alternative route to market for Tencent’s video games, which could also be beneficial for Sea Limited.\nCollaboration is key – it makes little sense for Tencent to reinvent the wheel when there are established platforms and alliances that it can tap into overseas.\xa0\nThe company said that Tencent Games aims to have as many users overseas as it has in China. For instance, Tencent is examining an expansion of its partnership with Nintendo to build console games for American gamers.\xa0\nMeanwhile, Sea Limited could be its door to growth in Southeast Asia. \xa0\nBEYOND THE SEA\nBeyond gaming, Sea Limited is also active in e-commerce through its Shopee platform, which has grown faster than Digital Entertainment. In 2017, e-commerce registered revenue of S$24.08 million. By 2019, it had ballooned nearly 50-fold to S$1.12 billion. That said, e-commerce is still unprofitable for Sea Limited.\nIt recorded an operating loss of S$1.52 billion on those sales in 2019. It is unclear when Shopee would be profitable, given greater competition in this area, most of which, like its biggest rival Lazada, are backed by Chinese Internet titan, Alibaba.\nBut clearly COVID-19 has benefitted e-commerce companies as millions of people have been forced to stay at home.\nIn June 2020, Sea Limited said gross orders accelerated 150 per cent year-on-year, whilst adjusted revenue was up 187 per cent over the same period.\xa0\nIt also said that in Indonesia, where Shopee is the largest e-commerce platform, a daily average of more than 2.8 million orders was 130 per cent higher than last year.\xa0\nIt added that Shopee continued to rank number one in the Shopping category by active monthly users in Southeast Asia and in Taiwan.\nA VIRTUOUS CIRCLE\nBeing number one is important. Apart from attracting more customers to the site, it also draws in more vendors to sell their merchandise on the platform, which in turn attracts more customers.\xa0\nThe network can be a virtuous circle that could allow Shopee to invest in more efficient ways to fulfil customer orders by plane, boat, and road.\nThe key is to operate at lower cost than the competition, which can be achieved through investments in efficient fulfilment.\nThere is a third string to Sea Limited’s bow, which is Digital Financial Services through its SeaMoney digital payment and digital wallet. This is by far Sea Limited’s smallest divisions which accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of total revenue.\nBut it is early days, yet. The service was only introduced in the fourth quarter of 2019 with the idea that it could provide payment processing and e-wallet services by integrating it with Shopee.\nThere are indications that it is working. In the second quarter of 2020, more than 45 per cent of Shopee’s gross orders in Indonesia were paid using the mobile wallet.\nSea Limited has aspirations for SeaMoney beyond an integration with its e-commerce platform. It recently applied for a digital banking licence in Singapore and it is one of the top contenders. A licence would allow it to take deposits and provide banking services to both retail and non-retail customers.\nWith gaming, e-commerce, and now digital payments in its suite of offerings, the future of Sea Limited is in its own hands. Its destiny will be determined by how quickly it can transform a business, which has turned cash flow positive, into one that is profitable at the bottom line.\nFrom an investor’s perspective, the financial numbers in an improving profit-loss account, a healthy balance sheet and a strong cash flow statement speak volumes.\nSea Limited can make the right kind of waves by delivering the things that shareholders want – rising earnings. And if it can continue to see progress on that front, Sea Limited could remain Singapore’s most valuable company even in the future.\nDavid Kuo is the co-founder of The Smart Investor and previously the CEO of the Motley Fool Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Singapore ', '     Shopee ']}"

      Commentary: Are the best days of Big Tech over?
  </h1>, 'text': ""LAUSANNE: Even though ByteDance is closing in on its TikTok deal with Oracle and Walmart, the global technology industry is getting more confusing than ever.\nThe forced sale of TikTok and America’s threat to shut down WeChat last week represents an unprecedented attack on global connectivity, which has delivered wonders for the human race in recent decades.\xa0\nBut the seemingly unstoppable growth of Big Tech is in fact in danger of being pared back by interventionist politicians in many parts of the world.\xa0\nTHE TIKTOK SAGA\nThis has been illustrated throughout the TikTok saga. US president Donald Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in America, citing national security concerns, unless its US operations were majority owned by an American company.\xa0\nBut Beijing banned the sale of TikTok to American firms, even though the ban risked killing the short video app in the US.\nSo Oracle struck a deal with TikTok to become its “trusted technology provider”.\xa0\nThis deal is essentially a joint venture, allowing Oracle to review TikTok’s source code and software to ensure there are no backdoors that allow the Chinese government to access the data of US citizens, which is locally stored in the US and backed up in Singapore.\nThe outcome of the deal is uncertain and is being reviewed by the US administration. Beijing also holds the right to a veto.\xa0\nThe TikTok crisis is a warning that the past few decades of rapid global technology growth might be over, to the determinant of everyone.\nThe rise of the Internet has been the foundation for all recent technological breakthroughs, allowing an exchange of ideas and opening up of commercial opportunities across the world.\xa0\nThe spread of knowledge and ideas, for the first time in human history, is emancipated from libraries and archives.\nTech companies are able to invest precisely because people are connected. Inside corporate laboratories, researchers from US, Japan, China and India are all sharing the same source codes on open platforms. Exponential technologies don’t come without exponential collaboration.\nThe TikTok mess underscores how tech companies now need to spend more of their energy on not just building the best product, but on navigating political minefields.\nThis is what TikTok has had to do to avoid becoming a casualty in the new Cold War between Washington and Beijing, including ramping up investment in data storage outside of China in a failed attempt to appease America’s national security concerns.\nTHE ECONOMICS OF IT\nYet, that is not all that poses a threat to the growth of technology. With digital walls going up in many places, the global Internet is quickly becoming fragmented.\nThe tech sector’s economics however don’t compute for the balkanisation of broadband networks. With limited scale, investments in content production will shrink, services that were free will become expensive to provide and consume and access to the world will shrivel to limited local spaces.\nIn a geographically fragmented digital world, a market of billions of users will only be possible where there are billions of people — in China and India.\xa0\nFor the past few decades, per-capita income has been high enough in many economies for people to buy expensive technology - phones for US$1,000 or more and a wide range of accessories and services.\nHowever, this can no longer be taken for granted by Big Tech. Rising unemployment and inequality in the pandemic recession depletes the spending power of large and, increasingly former, middle-class segments in the West and in China.\xa0\nAdvertising revenues have also declined as companies struggle to stay afloat from the disruption caused by the pandemic.\nThe rising use of technological solutions and artificial intelligence (AI) will further increase pressure on the labour market. If workers are being replaced their incomes will fall. The technological utopia without access, scale and income looks like dystopic suburbia.\xa0\nBLACKLISTING IS THE WRONG APPROACH\nBlacklisting enterprises, like the US has threatened to do with TikTok and WeChat, could become a debilitating plague that spreads around the world. A year ago the US government was drawing up its trade blacklists.\nMost noticeable is the blocking of Huawei's access to semiconductor chips. Yet, such a ban has not only strengthened China’s determination to become technologically independent, US companies, like telecommunications products manufacturer Qualcomm, are standing to lose some US$11 billion in sales. \xa0\nViewing from the corporate boardrooms, blacklisting is lose-lose for everyone.\nTorn between its American ally and a rising China, Europe will be drawn into this cold war soon. Europe and the UK are still making up their minds about what to do with Huawei, but it seems likely that there will be another avalanche of requests to terminate business with other companies caught up in trade spats.\nThis will ultimately increase red tape everywhere, further curbing the global ambitions of Big Tech and putting a straitjacket on innovation.\nOur dream of a technological utopia risks being dashed by a new era of political intervention.\nHoward Yu is LEGO Professor of Management and Innovation as well as the director of IMD's signature programme, the Advanced Management Programme.

      Commentary: Investing in markets? Why future gains lie in tech stocks
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Investors got a scare recently when tech stocks on Wall Street tumbled sharply.\nOver a period of about three weeks starting from Sep 2, the benchmark NASDAQ Composite index fell by about 11 per cent, leading many to wonder if the party is over for tech stocks and if they are poised for more downside.\nThe big tech titans led the recent declines. Apple fell 18 per cent while Microsoft and Alphabet slipped 12 per cent and 16 per cent respectively.\xa0\nRecent tech darlings like Salesforce.com fell 13 per cent while Tesla dropped about 33 per cent initially before staging a 29 per cent rebound to regain much lost ground.\nREMINDER NOT TO BE COMPLACENT\nThe tech sell-off is a good reminder to investors not be complacent.\nThe S&P 500 index had surged to new highs before the recent correction but these gains were driven by a narrow base of stocks, namely the mega-cap tech giants – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft – which account for almost 25 per cent of the index based on market capitalisation.\nOther growth stocks have joined the party, including Salesforce.com, Tesla Inc and other predominantly tech companies leveraged to secular growth trends, not influenced by short-term cyclical or seasonal factors, like cloud computing, 5G and the like.\nTECH SELL-OFF NOT TOTALLY UNEXPECTED\nThe tech sell-off was not totally unexpected, especially on the heels of a massive rally in August. Despite economic, political and earnings uncertainties, the S&P 500 index soared further, driven by strong investor sentiment.\nFactors such as Apple and Tesla’s stock splits had also supercharged the recent tech-driven rally.\nSome market consolidation is indeed warranted - healthy even - a reminder as well that the market can also move in another direction. What goes up can as easily come down.\nTECH SHOULD BE A CORE LONG-TERM HOLDING\nDespite the recent correction in tech stocks, we are not negative on the sector. In fact, we think that it should remain a core-long term holding for those with a good appetite for risk.\nFrom a longer-term perspective, the upside for tech stocks is not over. In fact, it is more likely that the bull is simply taking a much-needed breather.\nThe longer-term picture remains conducive for risk assets, including tech stocks, on the account of a normalising business environment, a moderate economic recovery and ultra-loose monetary policy.\xa0\nAs such, bouts of volatility can offer investment opportunities to buy incrementally at more favourable price levels.\nNevertheless, given the sharp rally in tech stocks, the recent sell-off may be a signal that investors and traders are getting nervous about the sector at least in the short-term.\xa0\nConsequently, we could see some funds switching out of tech stocks and into cyclicals and value stocks which have underperformed.\nThis is not to suggest that investors will or should abandon tech stocks. On the contrary, the sector will remain a strategic component of investors’ portfolios as there are several factors that may drive this optimism in the sector.\nFirst, it is given that technology is poised to drive major and transformational changes in the way individuals and businesses operate in the coming years and decades.\nEven when COVID-19 comes to pass, information and communications technology may bring about significant and permanent changes in the way individuals and businesses function.\nIt has already been a big enabler in keeping people connected during COVID-19 and allowing them to purchase goods and services online despite lockdowns.\xa0\nCompanies which offer the requisite technology or embrace technology to facilitate connectivity and deliver goods and services online to consumers and businesses, stand to benefit.\xa0\nCOVID-19 has clearly given e-commerce a big boost and there may be no turning back as more activities go online.\nCompanies that offer cybersecurity services also stand to benefit as online activity could pick up sharply after COVID-19.\nSecond, technology is clearly a multi-year theme and unlike the dotcom bubble that burst in 2000, the tech rally this time around has a much stronger fundamental basis – since tech companies now are backed by real underlying technologies and businesses with good and real growth potential - for those with a strong risk appetite and a long-term investment horizon.\nThird the potential for mergers and acquisitions is another factor that could drive tech stocks in the years ahead.\xa0\nCash-rich giant tech companies are constantly on the prowl for existing players looking for synergies and growth, especially those with proprietary technology and a strong business proposition.\nGoogle, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have all made a large number of deals so far this year, in what has labelled by some as the fastest pace of acquisitions and strategic investments since 2015.\nVALUATION SEEMS HIGH BUT IS NOT EXCESSIVE\nOn a forward price-to-earnings (PE) basis, the NASDAQ composite index is trading more than three standard deviations above its seven-year historical average.\xa0\nTypically, when PE valuations are more than one or two standard deviations above the five or seven-year historical average, this is deemed as expensive.\nIn this respect, NASDAQ’s PE valuations based on next year’s arguably normalised earnings forecast - assuming COVID-19 comes to pass and earnings recover fully from the pandemic-led drawdown - look rather extended after the sizeable price gains in recent months.\nBut when it comes to valuations, it is important to draw a distinction between the short term and the long term.\nValuations may not seem cheap in the short term, but the tech sector offers significant growth potential in the long term and tech stocks have the potential to be multi-baggers - which are stocks that deliver returns of more than 100 per cent - as we have seen in the past.\nFor such high growth stocks, valuations tend to be higher to reflect the long term and exceptional growth potential.\nOne could therefore argue a more accurate way to assess the valuation of high growth stocks like tech stocks would be to look at the PEG ratio, determined by dividing the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio by the earnings per share growth rate (G).\nIn theory a PEG ratio below one would be favourable while a ratio above one would be unfavourable.\nBased on data from Bloomberg, the NASDAQ Composite index’s PE ratio based on estimated earnings in the current year is about 37 times. This may seem high, but the estimated earnings growth of the index is also high at 67 per cent for the current year. This translates to a favourable PEG ratio of less than one.\nHowever, going forward such high PE ratios can only be justified if earnings growth remains high.\nClearly this may not be the case in each year, but over a say five- to ten-year period, the average earnings growth can be high.\nLooking ahead, there will be hits and misses in the sector as far as earnings are concerned and that means investors must be ready for sharp volatility, given its diversity.\nBE CAREFUL NOT TO OVER-INVEST IN THE TECH SECTOR\nFor those with the risk appetite, there are good reasons not to give up on tech stocks, but at the same time, do not throw all your eggs into one basket either.\nThe tech sector has been the darling of stock markets so far this year, but do not ignore non-tech stocks that have underperformed either.\nHistory tells us that it is unwise to over-invest in one sector or theme and it is important to have a diversified portfolio to hedge against the uncertainties ahead. So, investors ought to consider a mix of tech and non-tech stocks and even bonds, as well as gold in their portfolios.\nThe exact mix is something an investor can work out with a financial advisor and it will depend among other things on one’s risk appetite, time horizon and financial objectives.\nAt the same time, keep some dry powder even though interest rates are very low right now and it may make little sense to hold too much cash. Nevertheless, have some cash on standby to capitalise on the market volatility in the run-up to the US elections in November.\xa0\nEven after the US elections, volatility in the tech sector can be high as the US slugs it out with China in the tech space for dominance.\nGet ready for a choppy ride. Just don’t give up on tech stocks yet – it’s still early days.\nVasu Menon is Executive Director of Investment Strategy at OCBC Bank.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Stocks ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Recent reports about Alibaba’s US$3 billion investment into Grab has raised speculation about the terms of the investment as well as the merits and the challenges of this potential major tie-up.\nThe Alibaba Group has long desired to become a global brand.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2015, Jack Ma made publicly known that the Group’s goal is to serve two billion consumers, and detailed its intentions of becoming a global company to achieve that aim. \xa0\nALIBABA’s INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS\nArmed with technology, experience and capital as well as a strong track-record, Alibaba, Ant - previously known as Ant Financial - and other affiliate companies have made multiple attempts to build up their presence in markets, including Southeast Asia and India.\nAliExpress, its business-to-consumer (B2C) cross-border ecommerce platform, has been successful globally, with most of its customers in countries like Russia, France, Spain and Poland.\nWith operations in more than 200 countries and regions, AliExpress is the most visible Alibaba company outside of China.\nMany other bigger business arms have fallen short of expectations. Alibaba Cloud has not become a viable competitor to Amazon Web Systems (AWS).\xa0\nFor the financial quarter ended December 2019, Alibaba Cloud earned revenue of US$1.5 billion, placing fourth in the market, behind Google, Microsoft and leader AWS, which reported just under US$10 billion for the period.\nPaytm, the Indian mobile payment and financial services company, which counts Alibaba and Ant as major shareholders, is fast losing market share. Its multiple bids into e-commerce in India have all failed.\nIn Southeast Asia, Alibaba’s acquisition of Lazada in 2016 was hailed as a start of many great things to come. The group also invested billions into Indonesia’s leading consumer ecommerce platform Tokopedia, dubbed “Indonesia’s own Taobao” by Chinese media. \xa0\nAnt also came in aggressively, building mobile wallet joint ventures across the region, acquiring merchants to accept Alipay payment from Chinese tourists and investing in the region’s major fintech ventures with Chinese founders.\xa0\nIndonesia-focused Akulaku and Thailand-based Bluepay are two such examples.\nHowever, Ant has also seen a fair share of frustration with its partners. This was the case in its joint venture in Indonesia with Emtek backing digital payments firm Dana. The two partners reportedly differed on how much control Ant should have.\nAlmost all of Alibaba’s ventures in the region have fallen short of expectations in 2020, in part due to missing Chinese tourists from Southeast Asia’s cities and beaches owing to travel restrictions.\xa0\nEven Wall Street is waking up to the fact that Lazada is falling behind Shopee, owned by Tencent-backed Sea Group. Consequently, Sea Group’s share prices have surged 800 per cent year in one and a half years.\xa0\nA YEAR OF MULTIPLE ASSAULTS IN CHINA\nLet’s also not forget what’s happening in China when looking at Alibaba’s global strategy. Domestic developments sometimes offer a preview of what is to come in other emerging markets.\xa0\nMoreover, the Group’s priority has always been to defend its dominance in the Chinese ecommerce market.\nFirst, long-time rival JD.com, has shaken off its strategic missteps and sexual assault allegations against its founder Richard Liu in the US. Its share price has doubled this year.\nPinduoduo, an upstart competitor, has continued its meteoric surge to take market share from the lower end of the e-commerce market, namely Alibaba’s Taobao.\nAlthough people remains stumped by how Pinduoduo achieved a US$15 billion gross market valuation in two years when it took Alibaba five, the market is rewarding it. Its share price more than doubled this year and its potential tie-up with Indonesia-born J&T Express in China has bridged a key gap in its e-commerce play - logistics.\nA bigger threat however, seems to be Meituan, which started as a group buy deals site but has over the years emerged to become the biggest food delivery company in China and has now expanded to groceries, retail, shared power banks and payments.\nIts relentless drive for optimisation made the company, which recently posted a surprise second quarter profit of 2.21 billion yuan, a formidable player in the local space, beating Alibaba-owned ele.me. Alibaba’s Hema Fresh and Tmall Supermarket are also threatened by Meituan’s fast delivery capabilities.\nGRAB IS IMPORTANT TO ALIBABA\nWith competition intensifying within China, Alibaba’s success in Southeast Asia has become even more important as the Group looks globally to diversify its income sources.\nTo stay relevant in Southeast Asia, Alibaba needs to re-assess its strategy and make big adjustments in both operations and investment.\nGrab, in business model and trajectory, resembles Meituan in its earlier days. The company started with ride-hailing, a sector it still dominates across the Southeast Asian region.\nIts food delivery and on-demand express deliveries are leading in most of the markets in the region. And it has a head start in the payments and financial services spaces.\nWhat Grab has to offer complements Alibaba’s areas of focus – in e-commerce and fintech businesses - and neatly fits into what Alibaba would like to have, namely on-demand logistics infrastructure, regional know-how and established partner networks in each country in Southeast Asia.\nSo strategically it makes a lot of sense for Alibaba to take a stake in Grab – never mind that Softbank is a significant shareholder of both and may be driving some form of consolidation behind the scenes.\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GRAB?\nAs for Grab, with its “super app” ambitions, the Alibaba investment could open up new opportunities.\xa0\nGrab does not have a strong exposure to e-commerce. Partnering with Lazada through Alibaba will enable it to grow its logistics network.\nIn the short term, any significant cash infusion will strengthen Grab's position, especially facing Delivery Hero in food delivery and GoJek in ride-hailing in the region.\nThe former has been running aggressive promotions in multiple markets in Southeast Asia through subsidiaries Foodpanda and Baemin while the latter competes against Grab in Indonesia, although it trails behind in the payments space. With new funding from Alibaba, Grab can focus on building its services while keeping the company on the path of profitability.\nThe removal of various Ant-backed wallets as competition would also make it easier for Grab to scale up financial services to the wider region. There have been multiple reports of a potential merger between OVO and Dana, two major wallets and payment systems backed by Grab and Ant respectively in Indonesia. More such talks might follow.\nPOTENTIAL CHALLENGES\nUltimately, all these synergies will only translate into real benefits if both parties execute their partnership well.\nA particular challenge is Alibaba’s tendency to exercise great control of its portfolio companies despite having lesser understanding of the Southeast Asian market. Many say this explains Lazada’s and ele.me’s underwhelming performances.\n“Some Alibaba executives sent to Lazada have the natural tendency of pushing things the Alibaba way because it proved right in China,” I said in a news report in March explaining how Alibaba’s control of Lazada was creating unhappiness among the ecommerce company’s staff.\xa0\nThere will be tensions since Grab is also unlikely to cede control to Alibaba, given its deep roots in the region and the presence of founders who have remained in the company since day one.\nPeople often cite Tencent, which backed the Sea Group very early on, as a good example of a strategic investor who gives unconditional support and leaves portfolio companies to run their own businesses.\nIt is worth noting that Tencent was not always like this - it learnt its lesson and changed its stance after its epic battle with Chinese Internet security company Qihoo360 a decade ago when both parties accused each other of anti-competitive practices and took each other to court.\nAfter the Chinese government stepped in to resolve the issue and both companies made public apologies, Tencent’s founder Pony Ma publicly reflected on the incident, the lessons the group learnt and acknowledged it might have overreached. \xa0\nAnother potential challenge is the larger effort needed to align Grab’s vision and expectations as more stakeholders are brought into the picture.\nEither way, a new chapter of Southeast Asia’s tech development will commence if this tie-up materialises.\nLi Jianggan is founder and CEO of Momentum Works, a Singapore-based venture outfit. He was also previously MD Singapore of Foodpanda, co-founder and Regional MD of Easy Taxi.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Alibaba ', '     Grab ', '     technology ', '     China ', '     Singapore ', '     Southeast Asia ']}"

      NUS researchers develop smart suit for athletes powered by a mobile phone
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a wireless smart suit for athletes that is powered by electromagnetic signals from a smartphone.\nThe battery-free suit is lightweight and can be used outdoors, making it possible to track athletic performance with real-time physiological data from multiple sensors.\nIt took about two years for the team from the NUS Institute of Health Innovation and Technology\xa0to develop the suit, said the university in a press release on Monday (Sep 21).\nIn research findings published\xa0earlier this year, the team proved that it was possible to relay a smartphone\'s near-field communication signals to different locations on the body using specially designed inductive patterns.\nThe team designed a\xa0pattern of\xa0web-like threads on the suit to\xa0relay these signals from a nearby smartphone to sensors on the body from as far as 1m away, providing power and data connectivity.\nCurrent technology for monitoring athletic performance ranges from wearable fitness trackers, which only collect data from a single point,\xa0to ""bulky"" clinical monitoring equipment, said NUS.\nHowever, the ""ideal system"" would collect data from multiple sensors\xa0on the athlete\'s body in an outdoor environment, while keeping ""bulk, weight and wires"" to a\xa0minimum,\xa0said the university.\n""Our smart suit works with most modern smartphones, which act as both the source of power as well as the display to view the sensor data.

      Commentary: Are our neighbourhood chat groups starting to be a pain?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: An acquaintance of mine recently told me about his experience with his online neighbourhood chat group.\xa0\nHe was only two days into joining this community on WhatsApp when a frantic neighbour started accusing others in the chat group of stealing her plants and threatened to call the police on them.\nThe next day there was another storm in the chat group when another member took offence at the neighbourhood committee chairperson sending notice of a regular online chat session with the local Member of Parliament.\xa0\nHis grievance: This chat should be apolitical. After being reprimanded by other members for over-reacting and not understanding the intent of the message, he exited the group in a huff.\nSuch stories – bad and good - are not uncommon these days. In recent years, there has been a growing number of Instant Messaging (IM) groups within residential communities – whether on WhatsApp, Telegram or Facebook Messenger, among others.\xa0\nThese groups are not limited to high-density residential communities in HDB and private condominium estates but are found in landed estates as well.\nIM groups enable people to get to know their neighbours better beyond a nod of the head and a “hello” in the elevator.\nFor instance, a group of Punggol residents, who first came together to save on shipping costs for overseas purchases, eventually started meeting for meals, with kids and the elderly in tow. In Boon Lay, some residents have organised gatherings for bird enthusiasts in the estate.\nThese chat groups bring residents with similar interests together – to brainstorm ideas for reducing waste or saving costs in the estate, for example.\nIn doing so, they have also become a way for people to participate in community life. Some members of these groups attest to how such chat groups bring back the kampung spirit. Members become more involved in the community’s welfare, even flagging suspicious activity or faulty public amenities to one another.\nResearch on the impact of online communities goes back to pre-social media days and show that interactions among like-minded people have several benefits. Proponents of online communities such as Howard Rheingold talked about a new kind of social organisation — one that is based on free expression, a non-hierarchical structure, many-to-many access and volunteer effort.\nPeople gather online and participate in communal activities such as exchanging information, offering advice and providing assistance to one another.\nHowever, as with all group interactions, neighbourhood chat groups have their pitfalls and pains. Neighbours sometimes bicker online over communal matters - shoe spreading in the common corridor and dog poop in walkways, for example. And a loquacious few spam chat groups with irrelevant information and fake news.\xa0\nI have heard that, during the circuit breaker, some residents who flouted social distancing rules were named and shamed in their community IM groups, creating discord.\nThis damage to affective ties in a chat group can spill over to the real world and disrupt relationships between neighbours.\nSo, while digital platforms such as IM apps can bring communities together, the opposite can also be true. Measures are needed, therefore, to ensure these groups work effectively, without harming the social fabric of the neighbourhood.\nThese measures should take into account three fundamental features of computer-mediated communication – the social psychology of media use, its frictionless nature and the importance of moderation.\nSOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF MEDIA USE\nEver wondered why people online always seem livelier, more spontaneous and have more to say than their real selves?\nAsynchronicity and seeming invisibility are key features of the online medium. They exert a disinhibitive effect and encourage excessive responses. This means we end up saying a lot more online than we would face-to-face with another person.\nWhen we communicate online, we also lack the social cues that we are accustomed to receiving in the real world. Online communication is characterised by economic expressions, abbreviations and emoticons.\nIn the real world, we read facial expressions, body language, change in pitch and tone. A raise of an eyebrow or a shift of the eyes can clue us into how people are responding to our repartee, prompting us to change the direction of the conversation, clarify our intentions or even apologise before further damage is done.\nSo, before jumping into a conversation or posting a comment in a chat, we should pause and ask if we would say the same thing in person. We would all benefit from recognising the social psychological forces at play whenever we engage in online communication.\nFRICTIONLESS NATURE OF MEDIA USE\nThe term “frictionless” gained widespread notoriety after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used it to describe changes to the platform’s technical infrastructure.\nA frictionless experience is one that enables users to interact with content and with one another with minimal effort. In such an environment, immediate reactions are given greater premium over reflection.\nIn the past, sharing things online required a lot more effort. Before clicking the “send” button, we had to first copy the URL or an entire chunk of text, open up an email or a message box, and then paste the URL or text.\nToday, the “forward” and “share” options make information-sharing a breeze, and this lack of “friction’’ is a key contributor to the spread of undesirable content, such as hate speech and false information.\nSuch seemingly “thought-less” behaviour can have its pitfalls as we may inadvertently forward messages that may offend or alienate others for the composition of such neighbourhood groups are rarely homogenous.\nResearch, such as the one published by Natalie Dixon of Goldsmiths College in 2017, shows that while neighbours join such groups for security and neighbourliness, it can often be a double-edged sword. “A WhatsApp group chat offers a sense of rootedness among the flows of people and things in a neighbourhood.\xa0\nThis sense can be understood to hold, even stabilise, a community through feelings of collective presence and being in this together.”\nShe added that this very process can however also alienate others.\nIt is no wonder that the likes of Instagram and Twitter are beginning to recognise the pitfalls of frictionless environments.\xa0\nLate last year, leveraging on artificial intelligence to detect bullying on its platform, Instagram rolled out in selected countries a hate-speech filter that warns users of the potential offensiveness of their content before they post.\nAnd in June this year, Twitter said it will begin testing a new feature that will prompt users to think before they tweet articles that they have not read to “promote informed discussion”.\nTo introduce friction in neighbourhood chat groups, bots can be used to send reminders and mini interventions to users to prompt reflection and suppress their instinct to respond immediately.\xa0\nFor instance, Telegram users who start chats and channels can either develop their own bots or consider options, some of which are free, from a growing market of bot developers.\nMODERATION IS KEY\nIn addition to leveraging technical tools to increase friction, the third integral ingredient for civil group communication is moderation. In a face-to-face group chat, an individual, either designated or self-designated, plays the role of a moderator. This person ensures everyone has a say, minimises domination by any individuals or groups, and upholds decorum.\nIn the context of neighbourhood chat groups, it is usually easier to start than sustain online communities. Usually, there are no ground rules when a community chat group is started, simply because they tend to be intimate groups of a few people.\xa0\nHowever, these groups can grow quickly in size. So, ground rules should be set up early and moderators appointed. Moderators should be active and consistent in ensuring compliance with the desired etiquette, deal with problematic users, and intervene when discussions get heated.\nWhat could also work is when all members assume the responsibility for protecting the space and making it safe for all.\nMoving ahead, one thing is clear. In order for people to reap the benefits of an instant community in a neighbourhood chat group, time and effort are needed to ensure an inclusive space for all, just as in the real world.\nCarol Soon is Senior Research Fellow and Head of the Society & Culture department at the Institute of Policy Studies.

      Commentary: No winners in a US–China technology divide
  </h1>, 'text': 'WASHINGTON DC: TikTok and WeChat, two hugely successful Chinese social media applications that have gained global popularity, abruptly find their access to the US consumer market at risk.\nIn August, US President Donald Trump ordered TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to sell its product to a US company within 90 days. He simultaneously banned Tencent, the owner of WeChat, from most of its operations in the United States.\nThe administration has targeted these two apps, but with somewhat different purposes in mind. TikTok has a global following that already numbers 800 million users, and has ample allure to potential American bidders with an estimated market value of US$20 billion to US$30 billion.\nWeChat is an all-purpose app within China and abroad, encompassing gossip, sanctioned and unsanctioned news reporting, online payment systems, and contact between Chinese living abroad and their families and friends at home.\nTIT-FOR-TAT MOVES\nThe Trump administration sees malicious uses underlying dependence on both apps. According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, utilising Chinese social media tools leaves massive amounts of personal data vulnerable to exploitation by Chinese intelligence, though both parent companies deny these allegations.\nThe US claims that dangers to US national security justify efforts to disconnect Chinese carriers from America’s telecommunications networks. Few non-government analysts can properly evaluate these allegations, and the government has disclosed little information to substantiate its claims.\nChinese officials view these pending restraints as part of a larger effort to deny Chinese firms access to the US market, thereby impeding their continued advance and circumscribing future commercial opportunities.\nIn response, Beijing is threatening to block the sale of TikTok’s assets by withholding approval of Chinese export licenses for sale of China’s commercial technologies to US firms.\nChina’s Ministry of Commerce has also announced new restrictions on the export of technologies that can be used for analysing personal information. In the competitive world of social media and e-commerce, Chinese companies grasp that turnabout is fair play, and that they are not without leverage.\nAN INTENSIFIED DIVIDE\nThese moves reveal an intensifying US-China technological divide, with both countries proposing separate models of global digital governance.\nThe Trump administration has enunciated plans for a clean network, and all measures exclusively target China. In response, China has unveiled its own proposal for data security standards, based on cyber sovereignty.\nThis would enable individual countries to regulate and control their uses of the internet.\nThe US’s threat-driven narrative of China now goes well beyond Trump’s long-standing obsession with trade imbalances, though these remain a core part of his message.\xa0\nAfter protracted negotiations, the two countries signed a phase one trade agreement in January 2020, obligating China to make large-scale purchases of US agricultural products and manufactured goods.\nTrump saw the agreement as vindicating his belief in managed trade, but — partly because of the COVID-19 pandemic — the accord has done little to narrow the trade imbalance.\xa0\nMoreover, his unilateral imposition of new tariffs, initiated in 2018, failed to recognise that China would impose retaliatory tariffs of its own. Trump remains unwilling or unable to grasp that tariffs are a tax on US consumers and US companies, representing a dual liability to the United States.\nSOBERING OUTLOOK\nThe expectation that increasing integration between the world’s two largest economies would provide much needed ballast for the bilateral relationship does not apply in an administration dominated by economic nationalists hostile to interdependence.\nIn the longer run, the administration seems intent on strategic separation and economic decoupling from China, especially in high technology areas. This includes Huawei, a leader in telecommunications gear and already well advanced in its 5G ambitions.\nThe United States is pressuring its closest allies to sever or at least sharply curtail their links with Huawei, which it deems a major national security threat and commercial challenger.\nNew US regulations prohibiting the sale of US chips to Huawei for smartphone manufacturing will deny Huawei the ability to compete once its existing inventory of chips is exhausted.\nBut it provides a powerful impetus for China to devote major resources to the indigenous development of advanced chips.\nPunitive sanctions are an additional weapon in the administration’s arsenal. These are aimed at senior Chinese officials held responsible for policies that the United States deems objectionable or illegal, at commercial entities accused of technology theft, and at firms with substantial assets in the United States.\nSuch measures are expected to inflict pain on China, though it seems likely to spur Beijing to pursue closer ties with major trade partners other than the United States.\nIt is also unclear how the administration expects these actions to induce longer-term Chinese behaviour that would address US grievances.\nTrump and his advisers seem to believe that punitive policies will slow China’s advance, and that characterising China as the preeminent threat to the United States will benefit Trump’s re-election prospects.\nBut the administration has given minimal consideration to the implications of an adversarial relationship with Beijing, or to the consequences of an increasingly fractionated global economy as China increasingly goes its own way.\nChina’s experiences with the Trump administration have been deeply sobering to leaders in Beijing.\nNo matter who is elected in November, China will seek to reduce its dependence on the United States and accelerate the development of indigenous technologies to protect the country from US unpredictability and hostility.\nThe next administration will need to ponder carefully whether a lasting US–China technology divide will be in anyone’s long-term interest.\nJonathan D Pollack is a non-resident senior fellow at the John L Thornton China Center and the Center for East Asia Policy, the Brookings Institution.

      APT41: The China-based hacking operation spanning the world
  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING: A global hacking collective known as APT41 has been accused by US authorities of targeting company servers for ransom, compromising government networks and spying on Hong Kong activists.\nSeven members of the group - including five Chinese nationals - were charged by the US Justice Department on Wednesday (Sep 16).\nSome experts say they are tied to the Chinese state, while others speculate money was their only motive. What do we really know about APT41?\nWHO ARE THEY?\nFive members of the group were expert hackers and current or former employees of Chengdu 404 Network Technology, a company that claimed to provide legitimate ""white hat"" hacking services to detect vulnerabilities in clients\' computer networks.\nBut the firm\'s work also included malicious attacks on non-client organisations, according to Justice Department documents.\nChengdu 404 says its partners include a government tech security assessor and Chinese universities.\nThe other two hackers charged are Malaysian executives at SEA Gamer Mall, a Malaysia-based firm that sells video game currency, power-ups and other in-game items.\nWHAT ARE THEY ACCUSED OF?\nThe team allegedly hacked the computers of hundreds of companies and organisations around the world, including healthcare firms, software developers and telecoms and pharmaceutical providers.\nThe breaches were used to collect identities, hijack systems for ransom, and remotely use thousands of computers to mine for cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.\nOne target was an anti-poverty non-profit, with the hackers taking over one of its computers and holding the contents hostage using encryption software and demanding payment to unlock it.\nThe group is also suspected of compromising government networks in India and Vietnam.\nIn addition it is accused of breaching video game companies to steal in-game items to sell back to gamers, the Justice Department court filings said.\nHOW DID THEY OPERATE?\nTheir arsenal ran the gamut from old-fashioned phishing emails to more sophisticated attacks on software development companies to modify their code, which then allowed them access to clients\' computers.\nIn one case documented by security company FireEye, APT41 sent emails containing malicious software to human resources employees of a target company just three days after the firm recovered from a previous attack by the group.\nWong Ong Hua and Ling Yang Ching, the two Malaysian businessmen, ordered their employees to create thousands of fake video game accounts in order to receive the virtual objects stolen by APT41 before selling them on, the court documents allege.\nIS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT BEHIND THEM?\nFireEye says the group\'s targeting of industries including healthcare, telecoms and news media is ""consistent with Chinese national policy priorities"".\nAPT41 collected information on pro-democracy figures in Hong Kong and a Buddhist monk from Tibet - two places where Beijing has faced political unrest.\nOne of the hackers, Jiang Lizhi, who worked under the alias ""Blackfox"", had previously worked for a hacking group that served government agencies and boasted of close connections with China\'s Ministry of State Security.\nBut many of the group\'s activities appear to be motivated by financial gain and personal interest - with one hacker laughing in chat messages about mass-blackmailing wealthy victims - and the US indictments did not identify a strong official connection.\nWHERE ARE THEY NOW?\nThe five Chinese hackers remain at large but the two businessmen were arrested in Malaysia on Monday after a sweeping operation by the FBI and private companies including Microsoft to block the hackers from using their online accounts.\nThe United States is seeking their extradition.\nNone of the men charged are known to have lived in the US, where some of their targets were located.\nThey picked targets outside Malaysia and China because they believed law enforcement would not be able to track them down across borders, the court documents said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Will China’s new data security initiative define global norms?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Data security and trade in data have become a major bone of contention between the United States (US) and China in a conflict that started as a trade tussle but is rapidly sliding towards a new cold war.\xa0\nConcerns over access to data by the Chinese government has led the US to impose measures on companies that use US technologies to supply Huawei, a leading Chinese telecoms company.\xa0\nIt has also leaned on countries around the world to exclude Huawei from its 5G network for reasons of data security risks.\xa0\nIn August, the Trump Administration announced that for national security concerns, it would ban the popular video networking TikTok app.\xa0\nA similar move was announced for WeChat, the popular app that allows users to perform multiple tasks, from communications to ecommerce to payments.\xa0\nThe argument was that both apps could divert data of US citizens to the Chinese government.\xa0\xa0\nThe purge of the two apps was part of the US’ “Clean Network” initiative, which, according to statements by the US State Department, has already signed up more than 30 countries though these remain as of yet unidentified.\xa0\nDATA PROTECTION IS ON THE RISE\nChina itself tightly controls and censors its cyberspace through the Great Firewall, and has banned access of major US firms such as Twitter, Facebook and Google.\xa0\nIts 2017 Cybersecurity law raised concerns about the protection of personal data, as the law requires companies in China to hand over data if requested by the authorities.\xa0\xa0\nThe establishment of the Social Credit Schemes aimed at providing individuals with incentives for good behaviour, and which relies on large data collection efforts, has further raised concerns regarding the protection of personal data in China.\xa0\xa0\nThe EU Chamber of Commerce\xa0recently raised issues with China’s overall cybersecurity legal framework.\xa0 It therefore came as a bit of a surprise that on Sep 8 Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced an initiative to establish global standards on data security.\xa0\nWang Yi said that China wanted to promote multilateralism in the area at a time when individual countries were “bullying others and hunting companies”.\n“Global data security rules that reflect the wishes of all countries and respect the interests of all parties should be reached on the basis of universal participation by all parties,” Wang said.\xa0\nChina’s initiative calls for participating countries to refrain from large-scale surveillance of other countries or illegally acquire information of foreign citizens through information technology.\xa0\nIt also calls for technology firms to prevent the creation of so-called backdoors in their products and services that could allow data to be obtained illegally, as well as for participants to respect the sovereignty, jurisdiction and data management rights of other countries.\xa0\nWang Yi also said that China’s government “has not and will not require Chinese companies to provide overseas data to the Chinese government in violation of the laws of other countries,” thereby countering one of the biggest arguments the US and others have used to taint data handling by Chinese companies.\nWHY WE NEED INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS\nThere is a clear need to agree on international standards in data security.\xa0 Data is becoming increasingly important for economic activity, and China is at the forefront of the digital economy, most notably ecommerce and digital finance.\xa0\nAt the same time, there is growing demand, even in China, for protection of personal data and information.\xa0\nAnd there are growing concerns from governments how data, if in the wrong hands, could endanger national security. Even trickier is the movement of data across borders.\xa0 This is essential for modern trade in services and innovation in manufacturing, which relies on information from users.\xa0\nKeeping data strictly national or localised would impede trade and innovation.\xa0\nCountries around the world have taken legal or regulatory steps to protect personal data. On last count, about 140 countries have some form of law or regulation on data protection.\xa0\nThe EU’s General Data Protection Regulation is one of the better known, and strictest, frameworks - increasingly becoming a model for other countries to follow.\xa0 China enacted its cybersecurity law in 2018, which was skewed towards national security rather that personal data protection.\xa0\nSince then, though, the country has also made efforts on protecting personal information security and data security, and a draft Data Security Law was released for comments in July.\xa0 The first civil code in China, released in 2020, also specifies data privacy as a personal right.\nThe data security standards embedded in these laws vary considerable from country to country, as different societies have different attitudes on data protection vis-à-vis other societal goals such as development or community interest.\xa0\nThe debate on tracing apps to contain the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates this diverse attitude: Countries such as Singapore, Korea and China rapidly adopted or mandated tracing apps to easily find people that may have had contact with COVID-19 infected people.\nIn many European countries and in the US, such apps were seen to infringe on personal freedom and personal information, and they found much less widespread use.\xa0\nBILATERAL AGREEMENTS COULD BE COSTLY\nThe digital economy is transnational in nature, and allowing data transfers from one country to another can maximise the potential and minimise costs.\xa0\nAt the same time, transferring data from one country to another could undermine protections granted to data subjects under national law. Therefore, data protection regimes would normally include rules on data transfer to other countries.\xa0 Such rules can obviously have trade implications.\nThese regulations could be used to protect one’s own industry, and could become a barrier against international trade and investment. The WTO’s General Agreement in Trade in Services (GATS) contains some rules on data protection and data transfer, though these were largely formulated before the digital revolution took off in earnest.\nA new multilateral agreements on data security and transfer would therefore be highly desirable, but in today’s atmosphere seems further off than ever.\xa0\nBilateral trade agreements have started to fill the gap, and the recent Singapore-Australia Digital Economy Agreement is a case in point. It aims to set “new global benchmarks for trade rules, and a range of practical cooperation initiatives, to reduce barriers to digital trade.”\nAt the same time, a bilateral approach to the complex issues of data protection and data transferability risks a multitude of norms and standards across jurisdictions, which could create high compliance costs for business, especially small and medium enterprises.\nGETTING SUPPORT MAY BE TOUGH\nIt is in this context that China’s initiative proposes global standards on data security.\xa0\nSuch standards, once agreed on by a plurality of countries could guide individual countries in developing their own legal framework, and become a benchmark for bilateral or multilateral agreements on the topic.\xa0\nWang Yi had foreshadowed the initiative at an online G20 meeting the week before the announcement, as it seeks more support for the initiative particularly from G20 members.\xa0\nChina’s multilateral approach is going head to head with the US’ Clean Network Initiative.\xa0\nThe US initiative seems largely targeted at China: “The Clean Network program is the Trump Administration’s comprehensive approach to guarding our citizens’ privacy and our companies’ most sensitive information from aggressive intrusions by malign actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),” a US State Department announcement on the initiative reads.\nThis August, the Internet Society, an industry group with members including Google, COMCAST, AT&T and Eriksson, sharply criticised the Clean Network Initiative.\xa0\n“Policies like these only increase the global momentum towards a “Splinternet” — a fractured network, rather than the Internet we have built over the last four decades and need now more than ever,” the society wrote in a statement on their website.\xa0\nIrrespective, little support for China’s initiative can be expected from the US at this point in time.\xa0 Other countries have yet to express their views, but it seems unlikely that all G20 members would agree to discuss China’s initiative at this stage.\xa0\nNevertheless, China’s initiative could entice other countries to develop their own proposals and principles that may be supported by a broad set of countries.\xa0 The superpowers could then decide whether they want to get on board with those principles in due course.\xa0\nBert Hofman is Director of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     US ', '     data ', '     technology ', '     law ']}"

      What sets this S$7,000 hearing aid apart from existing devices in the market?
  </h1>, 'text': 'According to a 2018 report, approximately 300,000 people in Singapore are living with hearing loss. While several types of hearing aids exist in the market to help people cope with hearing loss, most are not ideal\xa0for\xa0replicating clear, natural sounds.\nA 2019 report by MarkeTrak stated\xa0that\xa093 per cent of people using hearing aids report having trouble in noisy environments, and 55 per cent get confused about where sound comes from.\nThis is because the outer ear is designed\xa0to work like an acoustic antenna, helping the brain to localise and tune in to a particular sound. Take, for example, the ability to listen\xa0to a specific voice in a crowded cafe, when background noises are drawn out.\nHowever, existing hearing aids, the vast majority of which are receiver-in-ear and behind-the-ear models, capture sound from microphones that sit behind the ear, and then approximate the effect of the ear.\xa0\nThis results in an average and incomplete reproduction of sound, making it hard for the brain to achieve its natural localisation and noise-cancelling function.\nEnter ReSound One, a new hearing aid that places an\xa0additional microphone inside the ear canal. According to a press release by the brand, ReSound One is described as a “revolutionary new hearing aid” that allows “people relying on hearing aids to experience the world with their own ears”.\nReSound One features a world-first Microphone & Receiver-In-Ear design (M&RIE) that uses the unique shape of an individual’s ear to collect sound. It picks up sound directly inside the ear, giving the brain everything it needs to tune in to individual voices, as well as significantly reducing background noise.\nAccording to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the cost of a\xa0hearing aid can range\xa0from S$650 to S$7,000. The ReSound One however is priced at the far end of this spectrum, with prices starting from S$7,000. Is the price tag worth it?\xa0\nSharing his thoughts on the technology, Rodney Tan, Founder and and Managing Director of Amazing Hearing Centre, said: “ReSound One is a groundbreaking innovation. It will make a genuine different in how people relying on hearing aids experience conversations and sounds around them, so they can enjoy life with superior sound and connect with others in a way that’s individual to them.”\nAdditionally, ReSound One features All Access Directionality and user-activated Ultra Focus settings. These functions improve speech recognition, while preserving spatial perception in complex sound and noise situations, such as a crowded cafe.\nFor those convinced by the technology, the device is available in rechargeable and non-rechargeable models, and features “extensive connectivity options” to both iOS and Android smartphones for streaming, and hearing aid control.\nFind out more about ReSound One here. The device will be available in clinics in Singapore in October\n', 'related_topics': ['     Tech ', '     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

Amazon comes in second with a market value of US$1.56 trillion dollars and Microsoft is third with a value of US$1.54 trillion dollars.\nThe Apple event was teased with a cryptic invitation reading ""Time Flies"".

      Commentary: China awakens to digital privacy concerns
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK CITY: At the US House Judiciary Committee hearing on Jul 29, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google CEOs sent a clear message: Don’t regulate us or we can’t compete with China.\nWhen Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in early 2018 on Facebook’s data practices, he warned that regulating the platform’s use of personal data would cause the United States to fall behind China when it comes to data-intensive innovation, such as artificial intelligence (AI).\nZuckerberg’s argument reflects the conventional wisdom that the Chinese Internet industry has accumulated a tremendous amount of user data for AI research thanks to China’s lax regulation on data collection.\nIn other words, so the argument goes, Chinese companies have an edge if US companies like Facebook are constrained by data protection regulation.\nTo some extent, Zuckerberg is correct. But personal information and data breaches are becoming hot-button issues in China.\nThe critical advantage China has in AI research is its data resources, as the density of people is proportional to the density of data.\xa0\nWith over 900 million Internet users, along with the widespread adoption of mobile applications during the mobile economy boom, there has been a surge in data growth in China’s consumer market.\nIn this “mobile first” and “mobile only” environment, people use their mobile phones heavily to shop for consumer goods, order meal deliveries, buy tickets and pay for almost all daily activities, leaving vast amounts of data on digital platforms.\nTHE AWAKENING\n2018 could be hailed as the year when the Chinese public started awakening to privacy concerns.\xa0\nAs if echoing Zuckerberg’s testimony, China’s leading search engine Baidu’s founder Robin Li commented in a 2018 interview that if Chinese people “are able to exchange privacy for safety, convenience or efficiency, in many cases they are willing to do that, then we can make more use of that data”.\nIronically, Li’s remark was not accepted by the Chinese public. Baidu was sued that year by a consumer rights protection group in Jiangsu province for collecting user data without consent.\nThe lawsuit was later withdrawn after Baidu removed the function to monitor users’ contacts and activities.\nChinese consumers are increasingly standing up to Internet giants for their digital privacy in an unprecedented way. China is in the early stages of setting up a data protection regulatory system.\nThe Cyber Security Law, effective Jun 1, 2017, included for the first time a set of data protection provisions in the form of national-level legislation. The 2018 e-Commerce Law incorporated data privacy protections for consumers such as the “right to be forgotten”, similar to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.\nA KEY STEP TOWARDS DATA GOVERNANCE\nChina passed a new Civil Code in May\xa0and it will take effect in January 2021. It marks a key step forward in developing a legal framework governing individual data privacy.\xa0\nAmong a sweeping package of numerous civil laws, for the first time, privacy is defined statutorily as a personality right.\nThe Code devotes an entire chapter to addressing personality rights – covering people’s rights to control the commercial use of their name, title, portrait, reputation and privacy, while adding new articles on protecting personal information.\nThere are also compromises in the Code’s efforts to protect privacy. Although the Code protects personal information under personality rights, it does not recognise personal information as an inherent right for everyone.\nThis implies that an individual will only have an economic interest in their personal information rather than a personality right, which probably reflects resistance from the e-commerce industry.\xa0\nSome provisions lack details such as how long data collectors can keep people’s information and under what circumstances they must delete it.\nREGULARISING PATCHWORK LAWS\nThe ongoing pandemic creates novel data and privacy controversies. For epidemic control and prevention efforts, governments collect a vast amount of individual information to keep close tabs on population health and location data.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, sensitive patient-linked medical records should be kept private, but during the extraordinary crisis governments must constantly collect such data, often through private internet platforms, raising concerns about data breach, loss or unauthorised use.\nChina’s forthcoming Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law is expected to address these complex issues in more detail. The drafters face tough challenges in balancing the considerations of individuals’ personal privacy, enterprises’ business development, and national and public security.\nSince these two laws are already in the process of formulation in the National People’s Congress, they may become effective as early as 2021 – a major step towards regularising this patchwork affair of personal information protection into an integrated, comprehensive framework.\nContrary to Zuckerberg’s characterisation, China no longer provides him with a convenient counterargument against privacy rules.\nWinston Wenyan Ma CFA is a tech investor and Adjunct Professor at the New York University School of Law.

      Commentary: Why aren't tech unicorns listing on the SGX?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has been a keen champion of dual listings over the years even though secondary listings on the stock exchange have been a mixed bag.\xa0\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic and political trends are reversing decades of globalisation and increasing friction in the cross-border flow of capital, and the dual listing could be making a comeback.\xa0\nFor SGX, the next few years will present a crucial test of whether it can fix the ails of dual listings and create a sustainable pillar of growth for the Singapore stock market.\nEarly industry hopes that Singapore might be able to win over some primary start-up initial public offerings (IPOs) from Nasdaq have given way to a more realistic acknowledgement that US capital markets are, by far, still the most attractive listing destination for tech start-ups by virtue of their depth, sophistication and liquidity.\nOn the liquidity front, it is also tough for Singapore to beat rival Hong Kong.\nSGX’s SECONDARY LISTING STRATEGY\nThe dual listing has therefore emerged as a key strategy for SGX to try and capture some of the tech listings. Go ahead and do your primary listing in New York, SGX pitches to start-ups, but do a secondary listing as well in Singapore so you have a capital raising option in Asia.\nIn 2014, SGX changed its secondary listing regulatory framework so that issuers from a shortlist of approved exchanges could simply abide by the rules of their home exchange without facing additional requirements from SGX.\nIn 2017, SGX entered into a tie-up with Nasdaq to develop ways for concurrent or sequential listings on both markets. Both parties followed up in July this year with a streamlined listing path that allows a dual listing on SGX to rely on Nasdaq regulatory documentation.\nIn 2018, SGX and The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) inked a partnership to encourage capital raising across both markets, including listing on both exchanges. Earlier this month, SGX and TASE announced that they would exchange regulatory information on dual-listed stocks to enhance investor protection.\nDespite all the work and innovation, SGX has yet to secure a dual listing with Nasdaq or TASE, although industry sources indicate that there are potential issuers moving through the pipeline.\nA MIXED BAG SO FAR\nThe fact is that dual listings have always been a bit of a mixed bag for SGX. It might be tempting to look at the 30 secondary listings currently on SGX and conclude that the secondary listings have brought mostly winners to the market.\nAfter all, that list of 30 includes prominent index stocks such as Dairy Farm International Holdings, Hongkong Land Holdings, Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings.\xa0\nBut there is a survivorship bias at play, with only companies for which the secondary listing is working out likely to maintain the secondary listing.\nIndeed, a number of companies in recent years have also pulled the plug on their secondary listings on SGX. The most recent is Alibaba Pictures Group, which has taken steps to delist its shares from SGX by December this year to retain only its primary Hong Kong listing.\xa0\nBefore Alibaba Pictures, companies that had given up on their secondary listing in Singapore include Ausnet Services, Weiye Holdings and Hengxin Technology.\nOne common thread among those companies was the lack of trading in their respective stocks in Singapore. In other words, from the perspective of those issuers, the cost of the secondary listing in Singapore outweighed any benefits to liquidity.\nSGX will have to tilt the analysis if it wants to get more dual-listed tech companies, or any company for that matter.\nGAINING FROM CAPITAL CONTROLS\nThe good news is that the balance has been shifting in SGX’s favour.\nOne of the biggest arguments against dual listings over the past couple of decades was the increasing ease of moving capital across borders. With the rise of online trading, it is fairly trivial these days for an investor in Asia to trade a stock in New York.\nThe use case for a secondary listing was therefore diminished.\nBut wariness has returned about moving capital across borders. In politics, that friction comes from anti-capitalist sentiment and a broad trend toward tightened borders.\nAmerican regulators are making it harder for Chinese companies to list on US exchanges. From a mobility perspective, the pandemic has sharply limited the ways in which issuers and brokers can market and target capital overseas.\nSGX can benefit as a hedge in these times for issuers. A Chinese company that is listed on Nasdaq, for example, might want to have a secondary listing in Singapore, which enjoys a reputation as a neutral and business-friendly location, in case the US channel becomes too difficult to access.\nOn Jul 16, when Bursa Malaysia experienced technical issues that shut down trading, investors in Singapore were able to continue trading shares of Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer Top Glove.\nRIDING ON THE TECH WAVE\nAnother development helping SGX is the cyclical development of the region’s start-up sector.\xa0\nThe current wave of tech start-ups began about a decade ago. This means that if they can get past the pandemic, the likes of Grab, Gojek and Tokopedia are at the size and stage where IPOs are attainable and early investors are keen to exit.\nThese Southeast Asian brands will be familiar to domestic investors, and that familiarity could generate enough liquidity to make a dual listing in Singapore worthwhile.\xa0\nIn fact, Singapore’s original tech start-up poster child, Creative Technologies, used to maintain listing status in Singapore and New York, and eventually chose to retain just its Singapore spot.\nBut capitalising on the potential is a different matter.\nALL ABOUT LIQUIDITY\nPerhaps the biggest obstacle that SGX faces is the persistent perception of poor liquidity in Singapore.\nThat no doubt contributed to home-grown tech businesses like Sea, Razer and PropertyGuru not taking the option to have SGX as their secondary listing destinations, even if PropertyGuru eventually scrapped its plan to IPO in Australia.\nIt will take substantial effort to overcome those hurdles. SGX, underwriters and stockbrokers may need to invest extra resources to educate and interest investors in Singapore about foreign companies where brand name recognition is not as strong.\nBut issuers also need to play their part. A company cannot do a secondary listing in Singapore and then have only the bare minimum of engagement with local investors. That path will not lead to better liquidity.\nThe window of opportunity for dual listings has perhaps opened the widest in years. To catch that wind, however, more work must be done.\nKenneth Lim is a writer who has been covering capital markets in Singapore and the United States since 2003.\n', 'related_topics': ['     SGX ', '     technology ', '     Stocks ', '     finance ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SEOUL:\xa0Apple\'s South Korean unit has proposed measures to address antitrust concerns and offered to provide 100 billion won (US$84.02 million) worth of support programmes for small businesses, consumers and others, the country\'s competition watchdog said on Monday (Aug 24).\nApple Korea has been under investigation by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over allegations it abused its dominant position by forcing mobile carriers to pay for advertising and warranty repairs, the commission has said.\nApple has agreed to fix ""unfair"" terms with mobile carriers as part of its proposal, the KFTC said in a briefing. For example, Apple will discuss how to share advertising costs with telecoms firms, which will help reduce burdens to carriers, the KFTC said.\nApple Korea was not immediately available for comment.\nOut of the 100 billion won, Apple pledged to offer 40 billion won to build a centre to support research and development for Korea\'s small manufacturers and 25 billion won to establish an ""academy"" to provide education to developers. Another 25 billion won will be used to give consumer discounts on warranty repair costs and other benefits.\nThe regulator will close the case without concluding whether Apple did anything illegal if it finds the proposed remedies reasonable after collecting public opinion.\nIn 2019, Apple held an 18 per cent\xa0share in South Korea\'s mobile phone market, the home turf of Samsung Electronics, which controlled 65 per\xa0cent of the market, according to data from researcher Counterpoint.\nApple faces antitrust pressure in other countries. In March, French regulators fined Apple 1.1 billion euros (US$1.23 billion), saying the iPhone maker was guilty of anti-competitive behaviour toward its distribution and retail network. Apple said at that time that it would appeal to the decision.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Apple ', '     technology ', '     South Korea ']}"

      Founder of Trek 2000, firm that invented thumbdrive, fined S$80,000 for not disclosing S$14 million of transactions
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A man who founded mainboard-listed tech company\xa0Trek 2000 International, the firm behind the invention of the thumbdrive,\xa0was fined S$80,000 on Monday (Aug 24) for failing to disclose US$10.5 million (S$14.4 million) worth of transactions.\nThese transactions were between the Trek 2000 group\xa0and another firm Tan was the sole shareholder for, as well as a firm his son held majority shares in.\nHenry Tan, 63, also known as Henn Tan, pleaded guilty to two charges under the Securities and Futures Act, with four other charges taken into consideration.\nThe well-known figure in Singapore\'s tech innovation scene faces several other pending charges, mostly for falsification of accounts relating to Trek 2000\'s financial statements.\nThe court heard that Tan was the chairman and chief executive officer of Trek 2000\xa0and was an executive director as well as its largest shareholder.\nTrek 2000 was incorporated as a private limited company in 1999 and converted into a public company the following year before listing on the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System, and being transferred to the main board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited in 2002.\nTrek 2000 was an investment holding company with a portfolio of technology-related intellectual properties, including the thumbdrive or USB flash drive, which it invented in or around 2000.\nUnder the Securities and Futures Act, the firm was required to disclose certain transactions by interested persons. The company was required to immediately announce the latest transaction and all future transactions it entered into with an interested person during a financial year if the aggregate value of such transactions amounted to 3 per cent or more of the group\'s latest audited net tangible assets.\nTan\'s son, Wayne Tan Joon Yong, held 80 per cent of the shares in T-Data Systems, between September 2012 and March 2014.\xa0\nThe net tangible assets for Trek 2000 and its subsidiaries for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2012 was US$35.1 million (S$48.2 million)\xa0and 3 per cent of this was US$1.05 million.\nTrek 2000 and its subsidiaries entered into various transactions with T-Data between January 2013 and February 2013, with a value exceeding US$1.05 million after a sale of more than 208,000 pieces of wafer components to T-Data.\nTrek 2000 was required to make an immediate announcement of this transaction and every subsequent transaction with T-Data of S$100,000 and above in the financial year, but failed to do so.\nIn total, Tan\'s company and its subsidiaries entered into US$12.3 million worth of transactions of wafer, USB and other components with T-Data in the financial year of 2013.\nTAN ARRANGED FOR SON TO GET SHARES\nInvestigations showed that Tan knew that his son held shares in T-Data, and had in fact arranged for T-Data to be incorporated in 2007 with the wife of co-accused Poo Teng Pin, an executive director of Trek 2000 and the research and development director of the firm and its subsidiaries.\nTan instructed Poo\'s wife to transfer 80 per cent of T-Data\'s shares to Wayne\xa0and this was done in September 2012.\nTan also attended meetings where the topic of interested person transactions was discussed, but did not reveal his son\'s shareholding in T-Data.\nTan incorporated another firm, S-Com Solutions (Hong Kong) Co Limited, in October 2005\xa0and was its sole shareholder.\nTrek 2000 and its subsidiaries entered into various transactions with S-Com HK in 2010, with a value exceeding US$1,1149,119 or the threshold of 3 per cent of the group\'s audited net tangible assets.\nIn total, there were six transactions made with a total value of US$882,256 between the group and S-Com HK in the financial year of 2010.\xa0\nHowever, Tan did not disclose these transactions to the group. The offences were discovered during investigations by the Commercial Affairs Department into separate offences committed by the management of T2000.\nPoo was fined S$20,000 in June for his role in the offences.\nTAN MORE CULPABLE: PROSECUTOR\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Tan Ee Kuan asked for a fine of at least S$90,000, saying that Tan was more culpable than his co-accused Poo\xa0as he attended meetings where the issue of whether Trek 2000 had entered into any interested person transactions was raised and discussed.\nHe also saw statements where the phrase ""no IPTs for the period under review"" was included in meeting minutes and circulated to him, but did not disclose his son\'s shareholding.\nDefence lawyer Daniel Cai of Drew & Napier asked instead for a fine of S$40,000, saying that his client\'s charges were ""under the least culpable limbs"" of the act.\nHe said Tan should receive ""identical sentences"" as his co-accused Poo\xa0because\xa0they were both senior executives.\nHe added that Tan had entered a ""timely plea of guilt"" and did not have any personal gain from the transactions, which had been entered into ""for the company\'s benefit"".\nTan had also taken steps to immediately remedy procedures afterwards\xa0and has no prior convictions.\nThe judge agreed with prosecutors that Tan could be sentenced on a scale higher than that for Poo, noting that he faces more charges and has a higher degree of culpability.\nTan will return to court next month for other charges, mostly for falsification of accounts by making false entries in the company\'s financial statements.\nHe could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined up to S$250,000 or both for each charge of failing to disclose transactions by interested persons under the Securities and Futures Act.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     technology ']}"

      Airplane mode and prepaid SIMs: Some Israelis dodge COVID-19 tracking
  </h1>, 'text': 'JERUSALEM: Israel\'s cellphone surveillance for coronavirus contact-tracing may have overcome challenges by privacy watchdogs, but the state tracking policy is hard put to deal with low-tech evasion methods seemingly lifted from TV cop shows.\nSome Israelis, fearing a quarantine order after unwittingly being near a coronavirus carrier, are rendering themselves untraceable while in public by switching their cellphones to ""airplane mode"" or using prepaid ""burner"" SIM cards instead.\nSuch actions are not illegal and, although there is only anecdotal evidence for their prevalence, they drew remonstration from Communication Minister Yoaz Hendel on Sunday.\n""This is a problem,"" he told Ynet TV. ""Ultimately, we are not a police state. We will not manage to compel the citizens of the State of Israel to keep to the health regulations.""\nThe surveillance, initially instituted without parliamentary oversight by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been anchored in legislation at the behest of Israel\'s Supreme Court after it heard challenges by civil liberties groups who worry the mass-surveillance is ripe for abuse.\nModeled on a counter-terrorism technology and in force since March, the system back-tracks movements of people who have tested positive for the virus to determine who came within 2m of them for more than 15 minutes while they were infectious.\nHaving been identified by their own cellphone locations, these potential new carriers are then ordered over SMS to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the moment of exposure.\nAround 80,000 people per week have received such notifications since Jul\xa01, according to officials - an economic drag for a country of 9 million.\nOfficials say the surveillance has detected some 30 per cent of coronavirus cases in Israel. They also acknowledge a false-positive rate of around 16 per cent, sometimes due to a vertical blind-spot in the technology which risks flagging people above or below a coronavirus carrier in a multi-storey building.\nSuch instances may be overturned on appeal - a process that can take several days, during which the quarantine is in force.\nIsrael offers a voluntary coronavirus app, HaMagen, whose latest upgrade includes Bluetooth contact-tracing for greater precision. But with users complaining about battery drainage, its market penetration has been far below the 60per cent required for the state surveillance technology to be dropped, officials say.\nIsrael has recorded 102,380 coronavirus cases and 834 deaths.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Israel ', '     technology ']}"

      More than a quarter of Singapore residents suffered at least 1 cybersecurity lapse in past year: CSA survey
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The cyber hygiene of Singapore residents still has some room for improvement, says the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA).\nIn the Cybersecurity Public Awareness Survey 2019 released on Friday (Aug 21), about a quarter, or 28 per cent of respondents, had experienced at least one cyber incident in the past 12 months.\nFourteen per cent of these were unauthorised attempts to access online accounts\xa0and 10 per cent of these were the usage of online accounts to contact others without consent - the two most encountered type of cyber incidents.\nFor those who were victims, 68 per cent indicated they changed their passwords while 46 per cent said they reported the incident to the relevant organisation. Thirty per cent said they installed antivirus software as protection, while eight per cent said they did not take any action.\nWhile many respondents were concerned about cybersecurity incidents, a proportion did not think they would fall victim to an online scam or fraud.\nFor instance, 82 per cent said they were concerned about their computer being controlled by hackers illegally, but only 32 per cent felt this is likely to happen to them.\xa0\nSimilarly, 82 per cent were concerned over their financial information being obtained by others without consent, but just 35 per cent felt they were likely victims.\nThe online survey polled 1,000 respondents aged 15 and above between Dec 17 and Dec 23 last year. This is the such fourth survey since 2016.\nMinister for Communications and Information S Iswaran cautioned Singaporeans in a Facebook post on Friday to not let their guard down.\xa0\n""Be vigilant and practise good cyber hygiene at all times. That way, we can stay safe even as we increasingly go digital in our daily lives!"" he said.\nDIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING PHISHING EMAILS\nAs phishing remained a popular way for cyber attackers to target victims, the 2019 survey attempted to study respondents\' understanding of phishing in a new section.\nAlthough two-thirds\xa0of respondents (66 per cent) knew what phishing was, only\xa0four\xa0per cent could identify all the phishing emails correctly.\nThe majority of the respondents (86 per cent) were able to identify phishing emails promising attractive rewards, but only 57 per cent were able to identify emails with suspicious attachments.\nEmails using urgent or threatening language were only identified by 55 per cent of the respondents, and emails requesting for confidential information by 53 per cent of the respondents.\nMOBILE TRANSACTIONS UP, ANTIVIRUS USE STILL LOW\nThe survey also found that the proportion of respondents who use their personal mobile devices for online transactions have trended up, from 73 per cent in 2018 to 80 per cent last year.\nThe proportion of those who installed security applications in their mobile devices saw only a slight increase from 45 per cent in 2018 to 47 per cent in 2019, it added.\nThis is despite 85 per cent of them indicating they understood the risks of not having these security apps, and 64 per cent saying they knew how to use them.\n“With our increasing reliance on technology, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic, opportunistic cyber criminals now have a bigger hunting ground,” CSA chief executive David Koh said.\n“It is important for us to shake off the ‘it will not happen to me’ mindset, stay vigilant, and take steps to protect ourselves online so that we do not become the next victim.”\nIn the midst the COVID-19 pandemic, CSA said it will be focusing on virtual, print and broadcast platforms to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote the adoption of cybersecurity measures.\nThese include television programmes in vernacular languages and dialects, as well as virtual talks and videos targeted at the various audiences.\xa0\nCSA will also launch a Safer Cyberspace Masterplan later this year, which lays out a blueprint to better protect Singaporeans and enterprises in the digital domain.\n', 'related_topics': ['     cybersecurity ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: India’s latest digital tax complicates its relations with the US
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A broader digital tax that India announced in its national budget in February and rolled out in April has created fresh challenges as it works towards a limited bilateral trade deal with the US before the impending US Presidential elections.\nThe tax is also likely to have implications for future US tech investments in India.\xa0\nIndia began taxing online advertisement revenues earned by foreign businesses from 2016 through an “equalisation levy”.\xa0\nProposed as withholding tax at the rate of 6 per cent, it was imposed on online advertisement revenues by foreign e-commerce firms obtained from Indian sources.\xa0\nThe tax was applied on revenues exceeding 100,000 rupees (US$1335) in a year on business-to-business (B2B) transactions.\nThe tax was essentially on payments made by Indian businesses to foreign e-commerce platforms for advertising their products and services.\xa0\nThe tax is being collected through a withholding mechanism, which implies Indian businesses withholding or retaining 6 per cent of their payments, if these exceed the threshold of 100,000 rupees, as taxes to be paid to Indian authorities.\nSeveral start-ups and local firms, advertising on Google and other digital platforms, have been unhappy about the burden, as a result.\nINDIA’S NEW TAX\nThe tax is described as an “equalisation levy”, underscoring its intention to create a level playing field between domestic and foreign e-commerce service providers.\nThe 2016 national budget clarified the tax to be on non-residents without “permanent establishment” in India. This was also India’s effort to overcome the current insufficiency in global tax governance in taxing earnings by offshore businesses.\nSince Apr 1, apart from the equalisation levy of 6 per cent, India has imposed a tax of another 2 per cent on all online sales of goods and services by foreign e-commerce operators, as well as those facilitated by them through online platforms.\nThe current measure brings a very wide range of e-commerce transactions within the ambit of the tax.\nRevenues from the sale of advertisements targeting Indian consumers, data collected from Indian consumers and from sale of goods and services using such data, including from those accessing advertisements through internet protocol (IP) addresses located in India, are now being taxed.\nThe thrust of the tax remains on foreign e-commerce businesses.\nThis is evident from domestic e-commerce entities with permanent establishments in India being exempted. Furthermore, the additional 2 per cent tax is on foreign e-commerce businesses with annual turnovers of more than 20 million rupees (US$267,000).\xa0\nINDIA ISN’T ALONE\nSeveral countries are taxing online advertisement revenues earned remotely by large e-commerce businesses.\nPopularly christened the “Google Tax”, these taxes are expanding in scope to include revenues from most digital sales of goods and services by foreign firms.\xa0\nThe taxes are being imposed notwithstanding the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working with several countries in determining global rules for their imposition.\nThe taxes have led to tensions between imposing countries and the US. The US has launched investigations against a group of countries to determine if the taxes are discriminatory to US technology firms.\nThe countries being investigated include India and Indonesia from Asia, as well as Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\xa0\nTaxes on earnings from the e-commerce sales of goods and services, provided remotely, are new complexities in global tax governance.\nCountries tax foreign businesses on the basis of “permanent establishment” in different locations. Global firms are taxed by national governments if they have significant physical presence within national territories.\xa0\nThey are also taxed on profits repatriated to home countries. The scope of such double taxation is often minimised through bilateral tax treaties.\nOnline e-commerce sales, by global giants like Amazon, Alibaba, Walmart, Shopify or eBay, to consumers across the world, and revenues earned from such sales, can’t be taxed by national governments through the existing principle of “permanent establishment” as their physical presence in these countries is zero or insignificant.\nCountries, nonetheless, are taxing the remotely earned revenues, which are significant, given the huge increase in global e-commerce transactions in recent years.\xa0\nThe taxes are being levied on the basis of the digital presence of e-commerce companies in different countries.\nTHE INDIA-US ASPECT\nIn India’s case, in response to the tax, the US Trade Representative’s (USTR) office had started a probe against India accusing it of targeting American tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon.\nMedia reports reveal that India recently responded to the investigation by confirming that the tax was not targeted at a particular country nor its companies and that the decision will therefore not be reversed.\xa0\nThe US tech industry has been distinctly unhappy with India and some other countries unilaterally imposing taxes on their digital sales from other locations, notwithstanding ongoing work on fixing a global framework for such taxes.\nThe latter are seen to adversely affect business interests of major American tech firms such as Google, Facebook, Netflix and Amazon.\xa0\nThe USTR’s investigations on India and other countries is focusing on the impact on US tech firms, including whether they are penalising successful firms, and whether their extra-territorial nature deviates from prevalent practices of international tax systems.\nThe results of the investigation might lead to the imposition of trade tariffs by the US on India, as it had threatened France with a 25 per cent import tariffs on a list of goods including handbags, cheese and wines..\xa0\nMore tariffs would mean the beginning of a fresh round of tit-for-tat trade actions between India and the US.\nThe prospects of finalising a bilateral trade deal would thus become even more difficult.\xa0\nIndia’s equalisation levy also has implications for future US tech investments in India.\nThere might be a tendency on the part of these investors to obtain a more local presence to qualify for the criteria of “permanent establishment” of avoiding the tax.\xa0\nThis might be necessary as the current bilateral tax treaty doesn’t include this equalisation levy and thus US businesses face the prospect of double taxation.\nTHE LONG-TERM VIEW\nIndia’s “Google Tax” has been expanded at a time when it is trying to protect the interests of domestic tech firms in an aggressive fashion. This is evident from the specific targeting of foreign e-commerce businesses by the tax.\nIndia is certainly not the only country trying to tax revenues earned by foreign e-commerce providers.\nIt is noteworthy that India announced the equalisation levy in 2016 soon after the announcement of its “Make in India” initiative for making India a global industrial hub.\nBy taxing foreign ecommerce businesses, while exempting domestic ones, the “Google Tax” resonates with India’s strong pitch for a self-reliant India that emphasises reducing dependence on imports, as well as foreign suppliers of digital services.\nSuch priorities, along with security concerns, have already resulted in India regulating Chinese content in the domestic digital space by blocking several prominent Chinese apps like TikTok.\nWhether the priorities would also lead to other foreign investments, particularly from the US, localising in India remains to be seen.\nDr Amitendu Palit is a Senior Research Fellow and Research Lead (Trade and Economic Policy) at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS), an autonomous research institute at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     tax ', '     India ', '     US ']}"

      Commentary: How Tencent became world’s most valuable social media company – and then everything changed
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Tencent, China’s Shenzhen-based digital platform giant, recently surpassed Facebook as the most valuable social media company in the world – at least, temporarily.\xa0\nAt the end of July, 2020, Tencent reached US$665 billion in market capitalisation to Facebook’s US$656 billion.\nTo many, this was validation of how China’s massive digital landscape, combined with innovative business models by its BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) companies, had produced another world-beating digital platform.\xa0\nIn the run-up to its valuation zenith, Tencent enjoyed a 70 per cent surge in value over a four-month period, in large part, due to China’s COVID-19 lock-down situation, which resulted in skyrocketing revenues from Tencent’s gaming apps, social-commerce and other online apps.\nBut that all suddenly changed less than two weeks later.\nHOW EVERYTHING CHANGED\nIn early August, US president Donald Trump signed an executive order that effectively banned US companies from doing business with WeChat, Tencent’s social messaging platform, which is utilised by more than 1 billion customers.\xa0\nIn a two-day timeframe, Tencent’s market cap lost more than US$66 billion - its worst slide since 2011.\nBeyond the financial loss, however, Tencent faces the same long term mega-challenge as other Chinese tech companies: The US-China technology Cold War. As relations continue to deteriorate, this latest development points to a more ominous shift in Sino-US techno-nationalist decoupling.\nRISING TECHNO-NATIONALISM\nA growing trend of techno-nationalism is driving a broader paradigm shift away from the open market, laissez-faire economic model, toward an increasingly state-activist world.\nCountries are increasingly viewing tech innovation and capabilities as directly impacting national security, economic prosperity and social stability and taking action to shore up their positions in those areas.\nIn recent years, Beijing has doubled down on techno-mercantilist initiatives such as the Made in China 2025 initiative, the Digital Belt and Road (BRI)\xa0and China Standards 2035, which aims for Chinese companies to set global standards for emerging technologies like 5G and the Internet of Things.\nThese actions have sparked a race to the bottom – at least, from a free markets perspective- for the world’s free-trading nations. Governments are increasingly intervening in commerce by blocking technology transfers and transactions, as Washington’s recent choking off of vital US semiconductor technology to Huawei demonstrates.\nThe Dutch government continues to withhold critical export licenses for sales to China by ASML, a Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment company. Similarly, Germany has blocked the sale of advanced technology to China and recently announced the establishment of a new state-owned investment fund designed to buy stakes in local companies targeted by non-European Union states for strategic tech acquisitions.\nThe US has rolled out its own version of “chequebook diplomacy,” designed to counter Beijing’s cheap credit programmes that promote the sales of Chinese telecommunications equipment from companies like ZTE and Huawei, along the Digital BRI and beyond.\nOne of Washington’s recent initiatives has been to allocate US$60 billion to the US International Finance and Development Corporation in 2019, to steer foreign telcos and governments away from Chinese companies.\nAustralia and EU have rolled out similar countermeasures. The EU signed a deal with Japan to build infrastructure between Europe and Asia in 2019, as a counter to China’s massive BRI investments. Australia, meanwhile, announced a US$1.5 billion Pacific Fund to counter China’s growing infrastructure footprint throughout the Pacific islands in 2018.\nTECHNO-NATIONALISM TURBOCHARGED BY THE CLASH OF IDEOLOGIES\nThe economic dimensions of techno-nationalism will increase but it is the ideological underpinnings of techno-nationalism that has accelerated Sino-US decoupling faster than anything else.\nLiberal democratic values associated with safeguarding data privacy and fighting censorship and surveillance are now tethered to export restrictions on hard technologies, such as semiconductors, and, most recently, to the ban on Chinese digital platforms.\nThe Trump administration justified the recent executive order against WeChat on the basis that WeChat’s collection of data on the activities of overseas Chinese citizens and its propagation of disinformation that advances Beijing’s political narratives are inimical to these sacred values.\nAdditionally, one of Mr Trump’s recent executive orders cites WeChat as complicit in Beijing’s censorship of alleged human rights violations against the Uighur and other Muslim populations in China’s far Western province of Xinjiang.\nTencent has also come under scrutiny in Washington for the role it allegedly plays in building surveillance technology and related infrastructure for the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing’s imposition of its controversial security law in Hong Kong, for example, has increased the likelihood that Tencent could be held complicit in what Washington describes as Beijing’s denial of basic rights of the people of Hong Kong.\nDATA AS A STRATEGIC COMMODITY\nThe reality also is that data has increasingly become a strategic commodity in the techno-nationalist landscape and increasingly linked to national security.\nIn addition to telecommunication equipment manufacturers such as Huawei, Chinese digital platform companies have come under suspicion regarding data privacy breaches linked to browsing, search and location functions within apps.\xa0\nMaking this a virtual no-win situation for Chinese companies are two Chinese laws: The National Intelligence Law and the Cybersecurity Law, both passed in 2017. Both require Chinese entities to turn over data, encryption codes and any other requested information to the Communist Party\xa0when asked.\nThe implications for Tencent are potentially far-reaching. Should Washington choose to put Tencent on a restricted entity list, it could suffer a fate similar to Huawei.\xa0\nLike Huawei, Tencent is dependent on US semiconductor technology for microchips – in this case, for its servers and hard infrastructure. And, like Huawei, loss of access to microchips could cripple the company. In both cases, third parties like Taiwan’s TSMC, are restricted from selling microchips made with US manufacturing equipment and intellectual property.\nEven if no restrictions on semiconductors are enacted, concerns about data privacy and security could result in a ban on Tencent’s cloud computing services. A similar ban could hit Alibaba.\nTHE RING-FENCING OF THE INTERNET\nThe Trump administration announced two weeks ago it is looking to implement a Clean Networks programme, which would ban any Chinese technology from US telecoms carriers, apps, digital cloud and 5G or 6G networks - effectively ring-fencing the American internet.\xa0\nBeyond US shores, the US is pressuring its allies and strategic partners to also ban Chinese technology. US techno-nationalist diplomacy has had a global effect whose footprint may only grow in the days ahead. The UK recently banned Huawei from its 5G infrastructure, and India just announced that ZTE and Huawei would not be part of its latest round of national 5G trials.\nAll of this creates an existential crisis for Chinese tech companies. Even without the challenges of this technology Cold War, Chinese digital companies will face greater scrutiny and suspicion as they venture outside of the protected confines of China‘s digital landscape, which has already been relatively closed to most foreign competitors predating this US-China rivalry.\nA FRAGMENTED FUTURE\nUnfortunately, as has been the case with previous US technology bans, sanctioning Tencent may see many American companies become collateral damage.\xa0\nBlacklisting Huawei has cost the US semiconductor industry billions of dollars in lost revenue. Blacklisting Tencent would affect Apple, which hosts WeChat and its sister app, Weixin, on its iPhones and put in jeopardy its US$44 billion dollar market share in China to local competitors such as Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Huawei.\nTencent has a stake in a number of American companies such as Warner Music, Reddit, Lyft, Snap and a host of American gaming apps. All may have to decouple.\nWhich begs the question: Can the US and China work out some kind of modus vivendi that would permit trade and collaboration, in general, while strategically decoupling in other areas?\xa0\nCan there be limits placed, with the recognition that trade and collaboration benefits both sides? Or is the world heading for a broad, accelerating techno-nationalist decoupling?\nWhat happens to Tencent in the coming weeks and months could provide the answer.\nAlex Capri is Visiting Senior Fellow with the Department of Analytics & Operations at NUS Business School.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Tencent ', '     China ', '     United States ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: It's payback time for the way China handled the Internet all these years
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: The White House's approach to managing the potential security threats posed by TikTok, WeChat and other Chinese-owned apps is hardly a model of procedural justice.\nWithout a clear legal or regulatory framework, the Trump administration has issued executive orders banning transactions with the apps’ respective parent companies - Bytedance and Tencent.\nChina’s leaders have not minced words in expressing their displeasure with US actions, referring to those against TikTok as a “smash and grab” in a China Daily editorial, vowing retaliation and even going so far as to suggest that Beijing could block a future sale.\nCYBER SOVEREIGNTY\nYet despite its displeasure, Beijing seems to be witnessing the global adoption of a norm for which it has long advocated. Ironically, it may do them more harm than good.\nFor years, China has promoted the concept of “cyber sovereignty.”\nAlthough somewhat nebulous in definition, the term has been used to legitimise censorship, surveillance and localised control of data that make up what is often referred to as China’s “Great Firewall.”\nBroadly put, it is the notion that the government of a sovereign nation should have the right to exercise control over the internet within its own borders, including political, economic, cultural and technological activities.\nBeijing’s advocacy of the norm of cyber sovereignty has only grown more pronounced over time.\nIts annual World Internet Conference, which has drawn attendees such as Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai as recently as 2017, has consistently offered a venue through which Chinese officials could lobby the movers and shakers of the tech world to see the value in this approach.\nChina has also sought to advance this notion through international bodies such as the United Nations.\nFor the Chinese Communist Party, cyber sovereignty has proved beneficial in a number of ways.\nWhile enabling the party to both moderate and gauge public discourse and sentiment, the technological barriers also provided space to develop into some of the world’s largest companies, while impeding the entry and success of foreign internet platforms in China.\nTHE TABLES HAVE TURNED\nChina’s model has worked out so well that other countries have begun adopting elements of it. And it is now Chinese companies who seem to be suffering most.\nSpurred by a recent escalation of border tensions, India has been purging Chinese apps from the country’s internet.\xa0\nIn addition to its pressure on TikTok, the Trump administration has recently announced the Clean Network programme, a comprehensive tech stack that, if fully implemented, would almost entirely exclude Chinese technology firms.\nThe adoption of cyber sovereignty as a global norm could now prove to be one of the greatest impediments to China’s peace, prosperity and development.\nAs China has few allies and worsening relations with the majority of the world’s most prosperous nations, its firms are finding a shrinking list of attractive overseas markets in which they are welcome.\nCHINA LACKING OPTIONS\nWhat’s more, China’s robust application of the cyber sovereignty principle over the past decade and a half has left it with few options through which to take reciprocal action when their firms are excluded from other nations’ digital spheres.\xa0\nAfter all, they cannot go about banning apps which they already banned years ago.\nThis reality is already being acknowledged by leaders in China’s technology industry.\xa0\nIn an article on Sina.com that was later deleted, James Liang, co-founder of the online travel agency Ctrip, advocated for his country to adopt a more open approach to its domestic Internet in order to counter what he views as US diplomatic aggression.\n“If we simply adopt a tit-for-tat strategy and implement the same xenophobic barriers, we will leave matters in the hands of the US,” Liang wrote, adding “our countermeasures should be to open up further… The United States wants to block WeChat and TikTok, so we can do the opposite.”\nWhether or not Liang’s prescription is correct, such an opening up would be a dramatic reversal of the direction that China and its digital sphere have been heading in, and starkly clash with what appears to be Xi Jinping’s vision for the Chinese internet.\nWhat does seem clear is that after years of lobbying the world to accept the notion of cyber sovereignty, China has gotten its wish. To which the axiom applies: Be careful what you wish for – you just might get it.\nElliott Zaagman is a writer, speaker, and executive coach who focuses on how China and its organisations engage the world.\xa0This commentary first appeared on Lowy Institute's blog The Interpreter.

      In lawsuit, Fortnite maker to test idea of iPhone as market unto itself
  </h1>, 'text': 'CARY, North Carolina:\xa0Fortnite\xa0maker Epic Games has launched the most significant effort yet to advance the legal theory that Apple\'s iPhone ecosystem has become so ""sticky"" that it is a distinct software market over which Apple exercises monopoly power.\nOn Thursday (Aug 13) Epic filed a lawsuit in federal court after Apple pulled Fortnite\xa0from its App Store to punish Epic for implementing a payment mechanism that bypassed Apple\'s practice of taking a 30 per cent commission on in-app purchases.\nThe suit seeks a court order ending Apple\'s commission structure and forcing Apple to allow users to install software on iPhones outside the confines of the App Store. Epic also sued Alphabet Inc\'s Google, but the case is different because Android phones allow app installs outside its Play Store.\nEpic is not the first to sue over the App Store. Consumers have filed suit alleging Apple\'s practices raise software prices. Developers in another suit have argued that software for iOS, the iPhone\'s operating system, is its own market but also made extensive alternative arguments.\nEpic\'s lawsuit relies almost completely on the one argument that Apple\'s iOS app distribution and in-app payment systems are their own markets. It also goes further to argue that Apple purposely created those markets by building an ""ecosystem"" of devices and services meant to favor Apple products.\n""A customer choosing to purchase or switch to a non-Apple device loses access to these services, leading to increased costs a customer must face when choosing to leave Apple’s ecosystem,"" Epic wrote.\nApple on Friday declined to comment on Epic\'s suit.\nIts primary defense in the past when confronted with allegations of anticompetitive practices is that it does not have a majority share of the global smartphone market.\n""Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook told the US\xa0House Judiciary Committee during a hearing on competition in digital markets in July.\nThe defense is factually accurate. iPhones and Macs have much lower global market share than Android and Windows devices, and Apple executives often say that consumers can access whatever software they desire on those competing devices or via the web browser on iPhones.\nBut if a federal court accepts the argument that the iOS app distribution and in-app payment markets are distinct, the implications could be profound, said John M Newman, an associate professor at the University of Miami School of Law.\nThe relevant market would not be ""apps for smartphones"" where Apple has a small global share compared to Android, but rather ""apps for iPhones"" where Apple has much more power.\nA landmark case against Microsoft Corp in the 1990s established that taking actions that make it harder for consumers to get applications from developers - even if consumers can still ultimately access the applications with extra work - could be grounds for an antitrust claim, he said.\nIf a court agrees that Apple controls the market for iOS app distribution, that could make Apple vulnerable to Epic\'s claims of illegal ""tying"" of two products together by requiring the use of Apple\'s in-app payment system to be allowed in the App Store.\n""It sounds like the weirdest and most arcane part of the case, but it actually may be the simplest from a legal perspective,"" Newman said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Apple ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Will the TikTok saga in the US lead to the break-up of the Internet industry?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The rise of TikTok, a Chinese-owned video-sharing social networking app to global popularity has been amazingly phenomenal.\nUnfortunately, it has recently been caught in the political spat between the US and China.\nUnder the guise of being a national security threat, the US has given TikTok an ultimatum to be banned from the country, leaving behind approximately 80 million active American users, or face a forced acquisition of its local operations.\nSince then, American software giant Microsoft Corp has indicated that it is willing to carve out TikTok from its Chinese-owner ByteDance with the Donald Trump administration giving them until Sep 15 to show a blueprint of how it may do so while taking data security of Americans into account.\nWILL WE SEE A NEW PRECEDENCE?\nIf this scenario pulls through, will other tech companies of similar nature suffer a fate parallel to this?\nThe anxiety of this fear is understandable.\xa0\nThis precedence could potentially spark a series of coerced acquisition of promising foreign-owned social networking apps in countries that are either worried about their impact on national security or intend to practise trade protectionism.\nSome countries may use such draconian efforts to rob these brands from their technology and pass them on to their local enterprises as “copy cats”. \xa0\nWhat is even more worrying is that this could discourage future “TikToks” from emerging – stifling innovation and growth for the future. Are such fears justifiable?\nFor any business acquisition attempt, even considering one that is forced, there must be value derived from it to be monetised. What is the value that is worth acquiring?\xa0\nFor a successful technology-based business, their strategic value is a combination of three major components that encompasses its brand, technology and customer data.\nTheir brand contributes value in terms of their trademark and equity that is the source of its seductive appeal.\nTechnology is the engine that drives the experience offered by the app. This is where the essence of the intellectual property lies.\nValue derived from customer data cannot be underestimated. It provides valuable insights of customer consumption patterns, preferences and behaviour where new products and services can be developed.\xa0\nIn fact, one of the strongest appeals of TikTok to potential acquirers is the customer data it possess.\nMITIGATING THE THREAT OF FORCED ACQUISITION\nWith this understanding, technology businesses could consider a couple of options.\xa0\nFirst, they could opt to register their business and their global headquarters in politically stable and open countries such as Singapore. This would minimise their disruption to policy changes.\xa0\nSecond, they could formulate a strategy to protect their business by structuring and segregating the ownership of their three key value components into different entities while setting up operations in countries.\nIn the event of a forced acquisition, only the customer database could be divested with the technology and brand ownership components left intact.\nGiven this, the acquisition will be far less attractive and could drive buyers away. Even if the acquisition succeeds, the damage to the business is minimised as they could still operate in other markets.\nIn the case of TikTok, the situation they face in the US is a bigger setback for them than it has to be because their value components are overly integrated.\nThird, a technology company could structure its business with multiple brands catering to key geographical markets along sensitive political lines under one corporate brand.\nFor instance, a low profile corporation, representing the parent brand which then owns individually operated product brands for markets such as the US, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, South East Asia and China, among others.\xa0\nAs such, each market will be perceived to be operating independently, signalling the assurance of locally managed data.\xa0\nWith this approach, the perceived risk to national security can also be better managed.\xa0\xa0\nEven if a politically instigated hostile acquisition is imposed in a particular country, the parent company could sell their product brands that are independently operated and make a hefty profit without any impact on their global operations.\nEMPHASIS ON THE PROTECTION OF USER PRIVACY\nHowever, the application of risk management strategies is defensive play.\nTechnology companies must also learn to be politically engaging with governments, especially appeal to their national security concerns in general and safeguarding of personal data in particular. \xa0\nTikTok’s setback was that they drew scepticism in their ability to protect customer data. The US government used this as a major point of contention putting them in their current scenario.\nTikTok did not do enough to win the trust of foreign governments that are highly suspicious of Chinese companies like its parent company ByteDance.\nFor instance, TikTok only launched a new app feature in April 2020 for reporting deceptive information after independent auditors advised them a month ago of inadequacies in their data protection practices.\nTo earn credibility on data security, astute public relations campaigns emphasising serious personal data protection practices as a core value of the brand will be crucial for tech companies of the future.\nUnderlining these outreach initiatives, tech companies with the intention of expanding overseas should reengineer their software development and reform their data privacy protection policies to enhance data transparency and security.\nThere are many ways to do it, such as open-sourcing the algorithms on which what data users see are determined, and conducting periodic audits of data collection and content moderation policies.\nHOW REALISTIC IS THIS THREAT?\nLet’s examine two different scenarios.\nFor innovations from developed economies such as US and China, venturing into developing countries, the threat of being banned or forced acquisition should be minimal.\nForced acquisition may be too expensive an option. Even if affordable, the technological infrastructure and brand equity in developing countries may not be ready to leapfrog ahead.\nFor innovations from developing countries venturing into developed economies, tech companies would have to address worries over censorship and control. Effective remedies on data privacy risks should mitigate the threat of being banned or acquired by pressure as discussed earlier.\xa0\nClearly, the main motivation behind the TikTok saga is a political attempt to alleviate China’s global technology power and, if so, similar threats are unlikely to exist in countries that are not rivals or competitors.\nMore importantly, such action will inhibit trading activities and prevent global or regional economies to flourish when a state of protectionism is practised by every country and could worsen the trade war that has already caused an unwarranted global economic impact.\nNot many economic powers are like the US and China. Few can afford to establish a massive national firewall, offering a domestic market with purchasing power that is sizeable enough for domestically developed innovations to be self-sufficient.\xa0\nTherefore, many countries cannot afford taking similar hostile decisions and effect their international relations.\nWhile the acquisition by Microsoft may be a solution for TikTok, it may not be a good enough business model for other tech companies who plan to penetrate overseas markets.\nEntering into joint ventures with domestic companies still may not be able to address the root concerns associated with privacy and security risks imposed by foreign authorities.\nThe TikTok saga also has little impact on stifling innovation. Before TikTok triggered data security concerns in the US, Facebook already attempted to launch an app highly similar to TikTok called Lasso in 2018.\nThe app was closed down in mid-July earlier due to low active usage. In other words, regardless of techno-nationalism intervention, copycat apps will boom if the products demonstrate proven success. For instance, Instagram recently launched Reels - a TikTok-like short-looped video service.\nFurthermore, some apps may be conceived initially as copycats. This does not hinder continuous improvement over existing innovations.\nConsider the China market. Many domestic apps flourished behind the great firewall. Initially as a copycat to WhatsApp, WeChat has ended being a comprehensive online platform supporting multiple novel functions through its ongoing technological upgrades.\nInnovation often thrives in adversity, the TikTok saga will not deprive us from more exciting apps in the future.\nDr Lau Kong Cheen and Dr Vanessa Liu are senior lecturers, Marketing Programme at the School of Business in the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\n', 'related_topics': ['     TikTok ', '     ByteDance ', '     Internet ', '     technology ', '     US ', '     data ']}"

      Fortnite maker sues Apple after removal of game from App Store
  </h1>, 'text': 'CUPERTINO, California: Apple Inc on Thursday (Aug 14) removed popular video game Fortnite\xa0from its App Store for violating the company\'s in-app payment guidelines, prompting developer Epic Games to sue the iPhone maker seeking to end its in-app payment practices.\nApple cited a direct payment feature rolled out on the Fortnite app earlier on Thursday as the violation.\nEpic filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking no money from Apple but rather an injunction that would end many of the company\'s practices related to the App Store, which is the only way to distribute native software onto most iPhones.\n""Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation. Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear,"" Epic said in its lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California.\nEpic also attacked Apple on social media, launching a campaign with the hashtag #FreeFortnite, urging players to seek refunds from Apple if they lose access to the game, and creating a parody\xa0of Apple\'s famous ""1984"" television ad.\nIn the parody, which quickly garnered hundreds of thousands of views, a female Fortnite fighter hurls a unicorn-shaped club to smash a screen on which an Apple-headed character speaks of ""the anniversary of the platform unification directives.""\nAPP PAYMENT MODEL\nApple takes a cut of between 15 per cent and 30 per cent for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple. Analysts believe games are the biggest contributor to spending inside the App Store, which is in turn the largest component of Apple\'s US$46.3 billion-per-year services segment.\nIn a statement, Apple said Fortnite had been removed because Epic had launched the payment feature with the ""express intent of violating the App Store guidelines"" after having had apps in the store for a decade.\n""The fact that their (Epic) business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users,"" Apple said in a statement.\nApple was among the major American technology companies to come under anti-competition scrutiny in a hearing before lawmakers last month. During the hearing, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook argued that Apple is not anti-competitive because it does not have majority market share in any markets where it operates, including mobile phones, where devices powered by Alphabet Inc\'s Android have greater market share.\nEpic\'s lawsuit, however, argues that app distribution and in-app payments for Apple devices constitute their own distinct market for anti-competition purposes because Apple users rarely leave its ""sticky"" ecosystem, according to Epic\'s filing.\nEpic\'s free-to-play battle-royal video game Fortnite\xa0has reached massive popularity among young gamers since its launch in 2017, and competes with Tencent Holdings\' ""PlayerUnknown\'s Battlegrounds"". The title\'s removal from the App Store means that new players will not be able to download it and that exiting players cannot receive updates, but the game should continue to work on devices where it is already installed.\nEpic Games does not disclose how many iOS users Fortnite\xa0has. Many fans play the game primarily on PCs or gaming consoles while using their mobile phones as a backup, but iPhone users generate far more revenue for Epic.\nIn both Apple\'s App Store and Google\'s Play Store, Fornite had about 2 million downloads in Jul 2020, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower. But Apple users spent about US$34 million while Android users spent only US$2 million, according to SensorTower data.\nIn a statement, Spotify Technology SA, a streaming music rival to Apple that has filed an antitrust complaint against the iPhone maker in Europe, applauded Epic\'s move.\n""Apple\'s unfair practices have disadvantaged competitors and deprived consumers for far too long,"" Spotify said.

Other stuff, too, but the star of the show right around this time is the Galaxy Note.\n\nNo thanks to the pandemic, Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event on Wednesday (Aug 5) was livestreamed for the first time from Korea, where the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra were unveiled.\xa0\n\n\nAlso announced were new tablets, the latest smartwatch, wireless earbuds and a teaser for their next foldable phone.\nFROM NOTE 10 TO NOTE 20\nBut first up, the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. Essentially, beefed up sequels to last year’s Note 10 and Note 10+, both supporting 5G networks.\xa0\nPre-orders begin Thursday (Aug 6) and both will be available in Singapore from Aug 21, with the Note 20 priced at S$1,398 and S$1,548 (for the 5G version) and the Note 20 Ultra 5G at S$1,898.\n\n\nYou’ve got the same range of hefty storage space options\xa0(and an expandable microSD card slot of up to 1TB for the Note 20 Ultra); a few “Mystic” colour variants from black and bronze to green, grey and white the models. The black and white ones will be in glass while the rest of the cases are metal, with some brushed.\nIn terms of screen size, both have got just slightly bigger ones compared to their predecessors (Note 20’s 6.7” to Note 10’s 6.3”, Note 20 Ultra’s 6.9” to Note 10+’s 6.8”), with the same Infinity-O display with those super thin bezels (the bigger phone has a curved glass edge, while the smaller one is a flatscreen). Expect higher resolution as well, particularly on the bigger version, with its 3088x1440 pixels.\nBattery-wise, they’re both more souped up: The Note 20 Ultra has got 4,500 mAh while the smaller one has 4,300mAh – which is the same as last year’s Note 10+, actually. And you’ve got the usual Powershare feature, too, if you want to charge other people\'s devices.\nCAMERA SPECS AND MORE\nOn the front you’ve got a 10MP selfie-camera, which comes with dual pixel autofocus and an in-display fingerprint sensor. Round the back, it’s a triple camera setup (ultra-wide, wide and telephoto) with the Note 20 Ultra’s 108MP wide-angle lens of note.\nFor those who love to fiddle with video for their social media accounts, the main camera records 8K videos and comes with omnidirectional and hybrid laser autofocus, making for super-smooth videos even when filming fast-moving objects.\nOther features to note for wannabe videographers are the Zoom Speed Control, which allows videographers to zoom in clearly – whether slowly or quickly – while filming; and Audio Capture, which lets users view audio input levels of the phone’s three built-in mics in real-time, adjust the configuration of the sounds collected from each mic, and even focus on recording sounds from a specific direction.\nPairing the phone with the Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds (more on this later) via Bluetooth enables clear recording of a specific voice even when there’s plenty of ambient or background noise.\nAI-based hardware and software improvements include a colour-picking portrait function, personalised filters, and auto-suggestions about which optimal short clips and background music to use, all features\xa0designed to make mobile video production easier and faster, while delivering slicker results.\nA SMARTER STYLUS, USEFUL NOTES APP\nAnd then there’s the S-Pen – the trademark stylus that hardcore Note users like to wave around proudly like a conductor. The ones that come with the new series is said to be more responsive (a 40 per cent improvement from the old one, says Samsung) for a more “lifelike pen-to-paper experience”.\nOne of the new tricks is the “Anywhere actions” list of five new gestures to make all that waving around actually productive. For example, an up-and-down motion takes you back to the home screen; a left clamp means go backwards; while a right clamp opens recent applications.\n\n\nThere\'s one app to take note of. Samsung’s Notes allows you to sync up to everything across your tablet or Window 10 computer, which is something that should come in handy for WFH warriors, who’ll have everything they\xa0need across devices.\nThere are few additional tricks too: A function that tidies up messy penmanship, one that lets you annotate and highlight PDFs directly into the app, among others.\nSAMSUNG DEX IS NOW WIRELESS\nThe Note series has always been trying to cosy up to another type of power user – that of the lifestyle variety who love their games and video binges.\nOne of the highly anticipated features for this version is the free three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which would basically turn your phone into a portable gaming console – but unfortunately it’s not available for the Singapore market.\nBut there are other perks – if you want to give the hit-and-miss Samsung DeX desktop feature a chance. This time you don’t need a port or a dongle to connect your phone to a larger screen – it’s now wireless and pairs with any Samsung Smart TV from 2019 onwards, which supports mirroring. In theory, that makes enjoying anything on a bigger screen less troublesome.\nTABLETS, SMARTWATCH, EARBUDS AND THE Z FOLD 2\nAside from the Note 20 phones, Samsung also unveiled its other new offerings, including its third foldable phone, the Galaxy Z Fold2, which screen size-wise will be bigger than the previous two: Its cover screen is 6.2” and it will unfold to an impressive 7.6” screen. It will also have a triple-camera setup.\nThe new Tab S7 and S7+ will both also sport the improved S-Pen and a lot of the smartphone features. But of course, screen size is what’ll matter for tablets – the S7 will have an 11” display while the bigger version has a 12.4""\xa0one.\xa0\nPrices range from from S$998 for the Tab S7 Wi-Fi version all the way up to S$1,798 for the S7+ 5G.\nThe new Galaxy Watch3 smartwatch, available in 41mm and 45mm, will be packed with its most expansive health suite yet, with sensors to measure heartbeat patterns, blood pressure (no cuffs needed), blood oxygen levels, and even detect falls.\xa0\nThere\'s in-built Health function that will provide more than 120 different home training programmes, too – except that this won’t be available in Singapore.\nThe prices range from S$648 for the 41mm bluetooth version to S$948 for the 45mm bluetooth titanium piece, which will be available at a later date.\nAnd finally, you’ve got the Galaxy Buds Live earbuds, with a battery life of up to 8 hours or even 29 hours with certain functions off, and a three-microphone setup per earphone. And the design is such that a subtle tilt will activate noise cancellation.\nPre-orders for the phones and the rest of the gadgets start on Aug 6 at the Samsung Online Store and selected consumer electronics and IT stores, among others. These will be available in Singapore on Aug 21.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Samsung ', '     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      NUS researchers inspired by Star Wars create artificial skin that's able to feel
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore researchers have developed ""electronic skin"" capable of recreating a sense of touch, an innovation they hope will allow people with prosthetic limbs to detect objects, as well as feel texture, or even temperature and pain.\nThe device, dubbed ACES, or Asynchronous Coded Electronic Skin, is made up of 100 small sensors and is about 1 sq cm\xa0in size.\nThe researchers at the National University of Singapore said\xa0it can process information faster than the human nervous system, is able to recognise 20 to 30 different textures and can read Braille letters with more than 90 per cent accuracy.\n""So humans need to slide to feel texture, but in this case the skin, with just a single touch, is able to detect textures of different roughness,"" said research team leader Benjamin Tee, adding that AI algorithms let the device learn quickly.\nA demonstration showed the device could detect that a squishy stress ball was soft, and determine that a solid plastic ball was hard.\n""When you lose your sense of touch, you essentially become numb... and prosthetic users face that problem,"" said Tee.\n""So by recreating an artificial version of the skin, for their prosthetic devices, they can hold a hand and feel the warmth and feel that it is soft, how hard are they holding the hand,"" said Tee.\nTee said the concept was inspired by a scene from the Star Wars\xa0movie trilogy in which the character Luke Skywalker loses his right hand and it is replaced by a robotic one, seemingly able to experience touch sensations again.\nThe technology is still in the experimental stage, but there has\xa0been ""tremendous interest"", especially from the medical community, Tee added.\nSimilar patents developed by his team include a transparent skin that can repair itself when torn and a light-emitting material for wearable electronic devices, Tee said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Why is a consumer watchdog suing Google?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: Australia’s consumer watchdog is suing Google for allegedly misleading millions of people after it started tracking them on non-Google apps and websites in 2016.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) says Google’s pop-up notification about this move didn’t let users make an informed choice about the increased tracking of their activities.\nGoogle uses some of this data in its targeted advertising business. It can also collect sensitive information about us from third-party websites and apps which it may use in its non-advertising businesses.\nThe ACCC isn’t the first to claim Google hasn’t been straight about how it uses our data, nor is this the first time it has sued Google.\nBut even if Google gave us the whole story, what can we actually do about growing surveillance?\nGOOGLE TRACKS YOUR ACTIVITIES BEYOND GOOGLE\nWhile it would take a separate article to list all the ways Google tracks your activities online and offline, the ACCC is concerned about two of the company’s data practices in particular.\nFirst, Google has been collecting data about what you do on websites that may not seem related to Google at all. This is combined with other data collected by Google’s own services including YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and Chrome.\nThe reason Google can do this is that third-party websites and apps also use Google’s services, such as ad serving or Google Analytics.\nTheir agreements with Google allow it to embed its technology into the websites and apps and send your activity information back to Google, without alerting you.\nSecond, the ACCC is concerned Google has combined its own extensive Google account holder datasets with personal data collected by ad tech company DoubleClick, which Google acquired in 2007. This is despite Google initially claiming it wouldn’t do this without users opting in.\nTHE DATA GOOGLE COLLECTS \nGoogle’s technologies are embedded in millions of third-party websites and likely many of the ones you use.\nSo it’s well placed to collect data about your online activities, including research you might do on intimate topics such as depression, miscarriage, abortion, diabetes, weight loss, heart disease, divorce, erectile dysfunction and so on.\nGoogle can then combine this data with the information it already has about you from its own services, such as where you live, what you buy, where you go and who you associate with.\nGoogle says it doesn’t use users’ health data or other “sensitive” data for its targeted advertising business. But it does not promise it won’t collect such sensitive data, keep it, combine it with data about our other activities or use it for non-advertising business purposes.\nFor example, Google has made moves to enter various health services markets. And there’s speculation it may start supplying health products and life insurance in future.\nFurther, unless you have changed the “ad personalisation” settings in your Google account, Google can use data from third-party sites which it does not classify as “sensitive” to target you with ads. This data could include whether you’re searching for baby clothes, travel insurance, retirement living, or a house in a specific suburb.\nBut even if you have opted out of personalised ads, Google’s privacy policy doesn’t say it will stop collecting and retaining the data itself.\nWHAT WAS MISLEADING?\nThe ACCC claims Google’s 2016 notification about its increased tracking was misleading. The notice led with the benign headline, “Some new features for your Google Account”, followed by:\nWe’ve introduced some optional features for your account, giving you more control over the data Google collects and how it’s used, while allowing Google to show you more relevant ads.\nThe statements further down in the notification were arguably unclear about what Google actually planned to change. The ACCC says the notification was misleading because:\nConsumers could not have properly understood the changes Google was making nor how their data would be used and so did not – and could not – give informed consent.\nIt claims Google also misled consumers by stating in its privacy policy that it would not reduce users’ rights under the policy without their explicit consent, but then did exactly that.\nPRIVACY CONCERNS WARRANT LEGAL BACKING\nIn this case, the ACCC’s issue is that Google didn’t give consumers the real story about its plan to vastly increase personal data collection and use this information for commercial purposes. The ACCC’s action against Google should be a warning to all companies that currently fudge their privacy terms.\nBut what if Google had been transparent and the pop-up box instead said: “we are going to start collecting your personal data whenever you use third-party websites or apps that use Google technologies”?\nGiven the millions of websites using Google technologies, is it even possible for consumers to avoid this?\nIn Germany, the Federal Cartel Office last year found Facebook had abused its dominance by insisting on collecting users’ personal data via embedded technologies on non-Facebook websites and apps.\nIt argued Facebook’s market power gave it the ability to impose these practices on users, even against their wishes.\nMany countries do not have an “abuse of dominance law” to address single-firm exploitative conduct, such as raising prices or imposing intrusive privacy terms. Facebook currently collects data about Facebook users – and even non-users – from third-party websites and apps\xa0without alerting us.\nThe ACCC may succeed in proving misleading conduct by Google. And it might obtain a substantial fine against Google – potentially up to 10 per cent of Google’s turnover in Australia.\nBut to stop tech giants from doing whatever they like with our data, we’ll need to consider a broader law against unfair practices.\nDr Katharine Kemp is a Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Law, University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, and Academic Lead of the UNSW Grand Challenge on Trust.\xa0This commentary first appeared in The Conversation.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Google ', '     technology ', '     privacy ', '     data ', '     Australia ']}"

      Commentary: Grab’s new platform fee may have raised eyebrows but it is nothing out of the ordinary
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Grab plans to introduce a S$0.30\xa0""platform fee"" on every ride in Singapore.\xa0\nFor a company that is so embedded into\xa0people’s daily lives and transactions, such a move would obviously raise eyebrows, and even concerns whether Grab is\xa0abusing\xa0its power.\nGrab says that it is a common practice, because GoJek did something similar when it introduced a S$0.70 platform fee earlier this year. Uber has such an arrangement too.\nWhile consumers might not even notice the difference, it is worth understanding the dynamics that impact such pricing, and how Grab has changed over the years.\nWHICH WAY DO YOU WANT TO GO?\nWe all remember a time where booking a taxi would incur a fee, of S$2.30 with ComfortDelgro, which takes the vast majority of taxi bookings.\xa0\nThe taxi industry saw this as fair in\xa0compensating\xa0for the time drivers take to drive to the pick-up location, as well as the cost to maintain a call centre and relevant technological infrastructure.\nSingapore’s taxi pricing was more complicated than that, with multiple surcharges on time and pick-up locations added to the metered fare. Payment through electronic means, such as Nets and credit cards, incurred charges ranging from a fixed S$0.30\xa0to 10 per cent of the fare.\xa0\nThis is to compensate for the costs of infrastructure and settlement.\nThese\xa0all made sense economically\xa0and logically. However, the additional costs\xa0often did not go well with consumers. It became difficult to estimate how much going\xa0from point A to point B will cost - the source of many disputes.\nI had a glimpse of such\xa0customer complaints when I was running Easy Taxi a few years ago - and a significant percentage was\xa0due to disagreements over taxi fare.\nSome customers who took\xa0taxis regularly are also\xa0quite sensitive about how much they should pay for a particular itinerary. That’s the reason why drivers used to ask “which way do you want to go by” to minimise such misunderstanding.\nUPFRONT PRICING\nRide-hailing apps seem\xa0to have turned it upside down. They had not only - for a considerable period of time - made rides cheaper, but also eliminated the need for drivers to ask about the preferred way.\nKey to this was fixed, upfront pricing. You get to know how much you need to pay for the journey before you decide to take it. If it is too expensive, you can choose either to wait\xa0or commute by other means.\nWhen Grab first introduced fixed, upfront pricing, voices in the industry said\xa0it did\xa0not make sense. On the road, multiple factors could impact the time taken and distance of the trip. Uber stuck with an in-app meter, with multiples to show the surge pricing.\nHowever, consumers seem to love certainty. Knowing the ride will cost S$30 rather than “2X normal fare” seem to make them feel more comfortable. Uber eventually caved; even ComfortDelGro introduced a fixed pricing option in their revamped app.\nIt might not be the most efficient method, but it is probably the best in\xa0building trust between commuters, drivers and the platform.\nRemember, a key purpose of the taxi meter\xa0was to introduce some trust and predictability in pricing.\nIS IT FAIR PRACTICE? \nThere is also the question of whether the introduction of such a platform fee is a fair price. Or whether the timing is right.\nUltimately, public transport pricing is always a sensitive topic because it impacts millions of ordinary people. Each fare review\xa0invites public discussions. This is the case even when it is debatable whether private rides constitute public transport.\nAmong the reasons why consumers take up ride hailing apps, price and convenience are probably the most important. While in most cases price and convenience are compromises to be made,\xa0in this case,\xa0consumers have been enjoying both for a while.\nEveryone knows that eventually platforms need to be profitable, in a sustainable way. Gains from efficiency in\xa0matching compared to old taxi booking systems can only squeeze the cost to a certain extent.\nThe S$0.30 institutionalises the costs platforms can charge as part of their revenue, but because the pricing framework reflects supply and demand, it is quite likely that consumers will not even notice the price difference.\nWhile Grab is definitely way\xa0ahead of GoJek in terms of market share in the\xa0ride-hailing sector, it does not have a monopoly over the rides market. ComfortDelGro still runs more than 10,000 taxis, with its own booking system.\xa0\nThis is even before considering the alternative of buses and trains.\nWith so much transactional data and so many in-house data scientists, it is reasonable to believe that Grab has done the full impact analysis before submitting the proposal to the competition commission.\nAs for the timing, the move comes at a time when\xa0commuting demand has somewhat recovered from the collapse during the circuit breaker. With demand stabilising and slowly rising, it is probably much easier to monitor the impact of such a move, without causing too much disruption.\nGRAB CAN’T LOSE RIDE HAILING\nUltimately, while Grab is pursuing an ambition that is much broader, and potentially more profitable. It has a vision of delivery, payment and financial services, it needs ride- hailing as a key value proposition\xa0to acquire and retain customers, and boost transactions.\nGrab did not follow GoJek in the pricing war last year in Singapore, and it did not engage in a promotion war against foodpanda during the circuit breaker.\nIt has grown from a super-charged, disruptive company to a measured, disciplined one with a\xa0strong focus on its path to profitability, despite the effects of the current hardship.\nAs a consumer, expect less promotions, but increased demand for service levels, as one would with any mature consumer company, whether in public transport or otherwise.\nLi Jianggan is founder and CEO of Momentum Works, a Singapore-based venture outfit. He was also previously MD Singapore of Foodpanda, co-founder and Regional MD of Easy Taxi.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Grab ', '     technology ', '     transport ', '     consumer ']}"

      If you thought the luxury smartwatch was a one-off gimmick, think again
  </h1>, 'text': 'Let’s get this out of the way quickly: Luxury smartwatches are not a good investment. It’s ludicrous to think otherwise, because unlike their analog counterparts, they will be outdated and obsolete by the time it reaches the average wearable tech lifespan of a few years. People don’t even keep smartphones that long, so you can forget about keeping a smartwatch safe for the next generation.\n\n\nThere’s nothing smart about buying a four-figure smartwatch. It’s really just a hedonistic exercise, but one with big payoffs to the buyer who knows exactly what they’re paying for. Because as seemingly unnecessary as they are – and the same argument might be applied to many things under the luxury umbrella – these watch brands know how to build a product that looks and feels really good. What the upmarket choices offer over their much more affordable counterparts is craftsmanship, design, brand affiliation and bragging rights (or the chance to develop resilience against mockery).\nAnd it’s a stretch, but these electronic antipodes of haute horlogerie might even act as a gateway to the real deal for mechanical neophytes.\nWhatever the brand strategy, it’s apparent that some watchmakers were only testing the waters of novelty when the first high-end connected watches first came on the scene about five years ago when Apple released the Apple Watch.\nSubsequently we had the Bulgari Diagono Magnesium Concept Watch, Breitling Exospace B55, and even a diamond-dusted Samsung Gear S2 courtesy of De Grisogono. They were all handsomely made and displayed the kind of forward-thinking you don’t expect to find in an industry that prides itself in its disdain for electronics. It’s just too bad many went back to doing what they did best.\nThere are however, a few outliers that have committed to the long-term connected plan. Given how they are largely targeted at a younger, more branding-driven crowd, they are obviously a niche category of accessories, but still worth a consideration if you have cash and fancy to spare.\nAPPLE WATCH HERMES SERIES 5\nApple sold 30.7 million Apple Watches last year, and now has the leading smartwatch market share of 55 per cent. With a product so overwhelmingly dominant, it makes more sense for some brands to simply hitch their wagon to Apple and let the tech giant do all the heavy lifting.\nAnd that’s just what Hermes has been doing since the first generation of Apple watches. The French luxury house knows its strengths lie in leather goods, metiers d’art and, more recently, traditional fine watchmaking, so by combining this know-how with the most popular smartwatch in the world, Hermes has given its discerning clientele an easy way to upscale the otherwise accessible watch.\nEverything about the Apple Watch Hermes Series 5 was made to feel premium. It comes in a\xa0 stainless steel case with a steel charging puck (instead of aluminium and plastic respectively of the standard Apple Watch), an Hermes-branded Sports Band, as well as a double tour leather strap for the 40mm models and single tour for the 44mm. The customisable watch faces are also unique to the Hermes editions.\nThere are of course more elaborate strap options available on Hermes’s website, allowing the ubiquitous Apple Watch to become a rather deluxe fashion statement.\n\n\nHUBLOT BIG BANG E\nAnother brand to wisely use an established design is Hublot, with the launch of its Big Bang E. It had experimented before with the smartwatch concept when it introduced the Big Bang Referee in 2018 for the World Cup in Russia, but it was a beast of a thing at 49mm wide and 13.9mm thick.\nThese dimensions made sense given the watch’s purpose, which was to cram as many football match-related data into a highly legible (if extremely specific) wearable.\nBut this year Hublot has taken the experience and formula it gained from the Referee and tweaked it for mass appeal. The Big Bang E measures a more sensible 42mm by 12.8mm and, using the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor running Google’s Wear OS (same as the TAG Heuer Connected), presents such fun extras as a perpetual calendar with precise moon phase display and GMT complication.\nThe real draw is the fact that it’s all housed in a faithful Big Bang case – in titanium or black ceramic – complete with the “sandwich” construction Hublot is known for. Wearers can choose from a straightforward digital time display or a chronograph-style analog one, but Hublot has also thrown in eight beautifully rendered dials by artist Marc Ferrero.\nEach of these colour-themed displays will rotate over a 24-hour period and will be marked with a five-second animation. The Big Bang E won’t blow you away with functionality, but the prospect of owning an extremely lively Big Bang watch is appealing in its own right. It is currently available on the Hublot website as well as on China’s WeChat network, with plans to retail in boutiques and stores at a later date.\nLOUIS VUITTON TAMBOUR HORIZON\nLouis Vuitton has been quite savvy with its tech offerings in recent years, expanding from simply making beautiful phone cases and gadget pouches to launching its first smartwatch, the Tambour Horizon, in 2017, followed by its own wireless earbuds last year. So the fact that it has continued down the path with an upgrade to the Tambour Horizon isn’t a surprise.\nNeither is the fact that it is still one of the most stylish wearables around. There are five case finish options, including steel, matte PVD and ceramic, and a variety of vibrant watch faces to choose from, many of which are inspired by Louis Vuitton’s fashion shows.\nThankfully, the software is catching up, too. Now powered by a Snapdragon 3100 processor, the Tambour Horizon finally includes NFC payment via Google Pay and a step tracker. Like its predecessor, the watch is aimed at the luxury traveller, so it still comes installed with the brand’s My Flight and LV Guide apps. The former has also been updated to include train and hotel bookings on top of flight schedules.\n\n\nMONTBLANC SUMMIT 2+\nThe Montblanc Summit, first released in 2017, has come a long way from its lacklustre offerings. At the time, its biggest draw was that it looked like a well-made Montblanc watch, but now that the Summit is in its third generation, those good looks now accompany an array of small but welcome upgrades.\nThe recently launched Summit 2+ may be running the same Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor as the 2018 Summit 2, but it comes with a longer battery life to handle the demands of cellular connectivity. That’s right, the Summit 2+ is an LTE watch and, if you don’t count the Apple Watch Hermes, it is the only luxury smartwatch with this capability. Interestingly, the Summit 2+ also happens to be one of the rare Google Wear OS-running smartwatches to have eSIM tech.\nThere’s a mic and speaker built into the side of the case to make calls with, but those who’d prefer to let their phones handle that can enjoy the Summit 2+’s other new features: The jet lag-beating Timeshifter app, stress-tracking app and additional training features, to name a few. Previous features like GPS, altimeter, compass and barometer have been carried over from the Summit 2 as well.\nUndoubtedly, the watch scores high in the looks department. The 43.5mm steel case has four different finishes to choose from and a variety of interchangeable straps to suit any mood. The always-on AMOLED screen can be personalised with the wearer’s desired backgrounds and “complications”. In terms of design and functionality, Montblanc should be commended for giving us the whole package.\nTAG HEUER CONNECTED\nThe TAG Heuer Connected watch has been around for five years, but this year the brand proves that it hasn’t been idling since the Connected’s debut. While the first Connected watches had a modular build that allowed buyers the choice to replace the digital module with a mechanical movement, the third-generation model does away with that option in favour of a slimmer, more streamlined case. Its sapphire crystal OLED touch screen, Carrera-style steel or titanium case, pushers, crown and ceramic bezel make it an extremely close cousin to TAG Heuer’s mechanical timepieces.\nThe functions have also been upgraded to include heart rate monitoring, accelerometer, a compass and a slew of added sensors to help with tracking sports and fitness activities. The companion app is compatible with others like Apple Health and Google Fit, and will soon be updated to allow wearers to choose from a variety of different watch faces.\nThere is also a new limited edition made specially for golf lovers – a shrewd move that targets the fashionably stunted world of golf. But the Golf Edition doesn’t just look smart on the green, it’s also surprisingly useful in the actual game by offering shot tracking, hazards distance, scorecards, and interactive 2D maps of 39,000 courses worldwide with a constantly updating database.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     technology ', '     Accessories ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Singapore Army\xa0is trialling a titanium-made exoskeleton designed to reduce the stress on soldiers carrying heavy loads.\nA section of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Day video released on Jul 1, captioned ""Exoskeleton Trial"", showed a soldier wearing a green exoskeleton on top of his army fatigues.\nIn response to queries from CNA, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the army\xa0is studying the use of an\xa0exoskeleton to improve soldier performance.\n""The Singapore Army is constantly looking for ways to enhance the performance of our soldiers, and the exoskeleton is one such example that the Centre of Excellence for Soldier Performance (CESP) is studying,"" it said.\nThe CESP, set up in 2017, helps to develop the full potential of soldiers in areas like\xa0fitness and nutrition, pre-habilitation and rehabilitation,\xa0resilience\xa0and soldier systems.\nBased on the SAF Day video, the exoskeleton\'s appearance and logo\xa0indicates that it is the Canadian science and technology company Mawashi\'s\xa0Ultralight Passive Ruggedized Integrated Soldier Exoskeleton (UPRISE) system.\nThe system, which the company says was\xa0initially developed for special forces and is made of high-strength titanium, comprises a flexible spine, sliding belt and fully articulated legs.\nUPRISE allows for a\xa050 to 80 per cent load transfer to the ground and a ""high degree"" of mobility for users, the Mawashi website said.\nAn UPRISE\xa0factsheet said it\xa0increases combat effectiveness and reduces fatigue\xa0as well as musculoskeletal injuries. It did not specify how much the system costs.\nA defence analyst told CNA that while exoskeletons are common in heavy-lifting civilian industries like construction as well as search and rescue, military applications are relatively new.\nMr Chen Chuanren, Singapore representative at Shephard Media - which provides business information for the defence industry - said the US, French and Australian armies have shown interest in exoskeletons, although he pointed out that challenges to implementation include\xa0cost and mobility.\nThe US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center has been\xa0exploring how to use commercially developed exoskeletons for military purposes under a US$6.9 million (S$9.6 million) agreement.\nOne defence firm involved in the project is Lockheed Martin, which produces an ONYX lower-limb exoskeleton to increase mobility and reduce fatigue.\nThe soldier in the SAF Day video is seen walking on a treadmill\xa0in what appears to be a stress test. He is wearing full combat gear on top of the exoskeleton, including helmet, rifle, field pack and load-bearing vest.\nMr Chen expects UPRISE to be distributed in the Singapore Army not as a standard issue item, but to specalised units that do\xa0heavy lifting over long distances, like some anti-tank infantry\xa0and special forces soldiers.\n""Through its innovative and ultralight design, this exoskeleton achieves an unparalleled level of freedom of movement,"" Mawashi\xa0said on its website.\n""(It) allows for all the movements involved during tactical maneuvers as well as other tasks required by dismounted soldiers and special operations forces\xa0operators.""\nCNA has contacted Mawashi for comment.\nIS THE EXOSKELETON SUITABLE FOR THE SAF?\nMr Chen said UPRISE is suitable\xa0for the Singapore Army as troops\xa0that operate in the tropics tend to see lower levels of endurance due to the humid climate.\n""There is a higher chance that they get tired a bit more, so I think it would be very useful for them to have this kind of system,"" he said.\n""If you look at UPRISE especially, the load actually gets passed down to the ground through the leg brace from the spine ...\xa0instead of having the load on your shoulders or back.""\nBut Mr Chen said it is not practical to issue UPRISE to every soldier in the army as the titanium-made product is ""very, very\xa0expensive"".\n""It\'s likely that it will be fielded to the special forces which operate behind enemy lines and usually carry very heavy loads,"" he added.\xa0""They have to do trekking and long-distance missions.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore Army ', '     Ministry of Defence ', '     defence ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: The next tech crash is around the corner thanks to COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'WARWICK: A handful of technology companies have benefited from coronavirus. Amazon has profited handsomely, as have streaming and video conferencing platforms like Netflix and Zoom.\nBut the pandemic has laid bare the shaky foundations of a number of other platforms that bill themselves as technology companies and have enjoyed the high valuations that come with this label.\nMajor losers from the pandemic include the ride hailing apps: Uber, Grab in Southeast Asia, Ola in India and Didi Chuxing in China. Quite simply, people are not taking taxis.\nOffice sharing businesses such as WeWork - which was, of course, already struggling - are also in trouble with virtually no occupancy. A similar situation is occurring in the accommodation sector with Airbnb and hotel bookings start-up Oyo.\nAs a result, investment in tech businesses is crumbling. But at the same time this is clearing the way for the few winners to buy bigger stakes in those that are struggling.\nSWIMMING NAKED\nTwo decades on from the dot-com collapse there is the likelihood of another crash in the technology sector. As with the build up to the dot-com bubble, an abundance of venture capital funding has fuelled speculation and encouraged investors to make bets on the next Google or Amazon.\nAs Warren Buffett once said: “Only when the tide goes out will we see who has been swimming naked.” In effect, the tide has gone out and lots of start-ups that were billed as revolutionary technology companies are all in significant trouble.\nThe only redeeming feature at the moment is how much cash many start-ups have to withstand the collapse. How long they have will vary.\nWeWork will struggle to survive a year without further investment. The ride hailing apps meanwhile are well funded but may also find this to be a very difficult year. They are under pressure to cut their losses and breakeven but this goal is even further away now.\nThe secretive Airbnb has recently been raising money at high cost. This suggests investors see a significant risk to the business and so cash is limited. The proposed listing this year is now highly unlikely.\nA major problem with lots of the start-ups that are now struggling is that they look like technology businesses but they have merely used new technology to disrupt existing industries.\xa0\nUber follows the dynamics of the taxi industry, WeWork the office rental industry, and Airbnb the accommodation booking industry.\nWINNER TAKES ALL\nFacebook, Amazon and Google differ in that they all started new industries. They created network effects – where the more people that use the platform, the better it becomes – from which they benefited enormously.\nNetwork effects can create a winner takes all situation. The more of your friends and colleagues who are on a particular social network the more likely you are to join and use it.\nSimilarly the more suppliers who compete to sell on Amazon, the more choice and competitive prices is offered to customers. Having more customers attracts more sellers.\nIt is harder to see the network effects in businesses like WeWork – there are few reasons to be loyal and the entry barriers to market for competitors are low.\nEven with taxi ride hailing apps, in which Uber was a first mover, all taxi firms now have an app and network effects are quite limited once a level of responsiveness has been achieved – it’s easy for customers and drivers to switch to competition apps.\nSimilarly, accommodation booking sites are all accessed in the same way now via an app, and it is very easy to compare accommodation availability and costs. Airbnb was a first mover in home rental but this sector has been beset by issues relating to fraud and safety.\nHence all these markets are going to remain very competitive in the longer term and this means low margins and low returns.\nIt is no surprise the share prices of ride hailing businesses have halved.\nIn these industries technology is no longer a competitive advantage as almost all the competitors now have similar technology. The technology is simply infrastructure.\nCASH FLOW AND CONSOLIDATION\nStock markets are shaky and Airbnb has cancelled its initial public offering. The appetite for new listings is weak and is likely to remain this way, suggesting it will be difficult for venture capital investors to exit their investments.\nIf there is no exit route to make money, then why invest?\nA consequence is that there is likely to be a reduction in investment in technology start-up businesses. Cash will be in much shorter supply and venture capital investors will have to choose more carefully where to invest.\nMeanwhile, we are already seeing the real technology giants move in.\nAmazon, for example, was the biggest investor in distressed UK takeaway app Deliveroo’s latest round of fundraising.\xa0\nThis month also saw the merger of two other food delivery services, with Europe-based Takeaway.com, fresh from buying Just Eat, now buying US-based Grubhub.\nWe can expect more consolidation in the months ahead.\nJohn Colley is Associate Dean and Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, University of Warwick.\xa0\xa0This commentary first appeared in The Conversation.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     technology ', '     finance ', '     Google ']}"

      Commentary: Artificial intelligence and automation would actually benefit Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Now that the General Election is over, it is time for Singapore to refocus on the big challenge of creating jobs to tide citizens over a pandemic and double down on digitalisation for the long term.\nMuch has been said about the concerns people have about livelihoods, with suggestions to safeguard and improve the prospects of jobs for Singaporeans.\nYet disruption is not new to Singapore. History has witnessed how Singapore has upskilled its workforce through computerisation and automation in the 1980s.\nSingapore businesses and workers are no strangers to the need to adapt to new technological changes.\nNow, Digital Ambassador Corps have been deployed to help small businesses and senior citizens learn and apply technology.\nWith every change comes hesitance, even resistance. In the push for a Smart Nation, this resistance may come from a fear of the unknown. Reports of artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital technologies cannibalising jobs do not help either.\nHowever, Singapore is in a unique situation. With a small and ageing workforce, Singapore has to tap on AI and automation to preserve its competitive advantage over other economies.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nA COUNTRY INCREASINGLY POWERED BY MORE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nDigital technologies and AI (including machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing) can boost efficiencies, performance and productivity in various ways.\nIt is these advanced technologies that help e-commerce retailers like Lazada sell more by analysing massive amount of data, learning customer preferences and providing targeted products to be displayed online for the customers.\nIn engineering and aviation, AI has been used to increase the performance of gas turbine engines, such as finding an optimal way to increase thrust and decrease fuel consumptions.\nIn the long term, the savings on fuel could be passed to the passengers. Such performance improvements cannot usually be attained using traditional models.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nIn logistics in Singapore and around the world, AI has also been utilised to predict traffic patterns and route conditions. For companies like Grab, the use of AI has enabled drivers to complete as many jobs as possible in the shortest amount of time.\nGrab also uses natural language processing methods to address customer feedback and enable users to find the services they need with greater ease.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nAI is also extensively used in the development of autonomous vehicles like the National University of Singapore (NUS) autonomous shuttle at its Kent Ridge campus.\nIn healthcare, AI has been employed to optimise hospital management and processes like managing a large number of patient beds in the case of Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Predictive analytics can help optimise hospital bed assignment decisions by predicting when patients will be discharged to make more beds available.\nAI will be an integral part of Singapore’s healthcare system to help doctors make better decisions and design early intervention programmes and improved care pathways for patients using predictive modelling.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nOne application of machine learning is “precision medicine” where AI can help predict what treatment protocols are most feasible and with higher success rate on a patient based on various patient characteristics and the treatment context.\nAnother example is robotic surgery (like the da Vinci Surgical System used in Gleneagles Hospital Singapore) which can help surgeons improve their ability to perform precise and minimally invasive incisions and surgeries. Important decisions are still made by human surgeons.\nIn educational applications and tools, AI has helped the development of skills and testing systems and allows the adjustment of learning based on differentiating students’ needs in Institutes of Higher Learning in Singapore.\nStudents can thus enjoy more customised testing and learning tailored to the specific needs and ability level of each student.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nJOBS ARE CHANGING\nIn areas where AI and digital technologies improve businesses significantly, the nature of jobs has changed.\nCertain jobs like routine clerical work may be reduced while the employment rates for professionals and those in the service sectors have increased. Understanding what tasks AI is suited or not suited for will be a business priority for firms. Singapore’s learning, retraining and upskilling efforts must take full advantage of the AI era.\nPrior research has shown AI is suited to perform tasks that provide clear feedback with definable goals and metrics. AI is also efficient at recognising associations based on empirical and statistical data.\nAI can help improve traffic volume and flow in metropolitan areas like Singapore, New York or London using pre-defined performance and congestion measures at the system level by analysing large amounts of traffic data.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nOn the other hand, AI is not so good at unstructured tasks and reasoning, especially based on background information that is previously unknown to the computer.\nThis is why AI (or machine learning) can be used to spot irregular heartbeat from scans and detect diseases from medical imaging, but it cannot explain as well as doctors how and why one is diagnosed with a certain disease.\nIn other words, the interpretation of the causes and severity of these diseases and their linkages to other diseases are much more difficult for AI to ascertain. AI also does not perform well when the tasks to be learned change quickly.\nHumans do much better at interpreting data and drawing inferences even when the tasks evolve over time.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nYOUR JOB MAY REMAIN BUT SOME TASKS COULD BE OUTSOURCED TO AI\nIn light of the above understanding, how we should we adjust, retrain or upskill the valuable human resource we have in Singapore to prepare for the new paradigm involving AI and digital technologies?\nWe understand that most jobs have many interrelated tasks. People say the jobs AI could likely replace include telemarketing, receptionists, computer support specialists (think chatbots used by banks like OCBC) and market research analysts.\nHowever, it doesn’t mean these jobs will disappear entirely. AI is weak on relatively unstructured, creative tasks and those involving emotional intelligence.\nThe focus of the training or upskilling of such roles should be on these areas. Upskilling courses can cover developing strategies in branding, designing and marketing.\nUse AI to gather your data, but use humans to develop business and innovation strategies and design marketing campaigns based on understanding those data.\nPeople and leadership skills will continue to be important, yet another area that AI currently does not fill the void. The expertise in asking interesting questions and looking for new and innovative solutions, which is required in researchers or entrepreneurs, will also be deemed more valuable.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThe age of AI and digital technologies is already here. It is clear they can and probably should be applied to different industries and have the potential to significantly improve productivity.\nIn the process, they will transform our work and lives. While some jobs may be replaced, many other job and career opportunities will be created.\nSingapore has the infrastructure, talents and resources to take advantage of the benefits brought about by the AI revolution.\nWith national emphasis on innovation and Industry 4.0, as well as additional resources and upskilling opportunities, this could yet be another pivotal point for Singapore to create and deliver value in a competitive global arena.\nDr\xa0Kenneth G\xa0Huang is an Associate Professor with the Department of Strategy & Policy at National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School and the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering & Management at NUS.

      Commentary: Apple has a battle with regulators and unhappy developers
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Software developers talk about technical debt, meaning the cost of rewriting quick and dirty code to make it fit for purpose. If not repaid, then tech debt, like the monetary kind, can incur “interest”, making change even more expensive to implement later.\nCultural debt may be a similar phenomenon in many businesses, particularly in the tech sector. The fast-moving, risk-taking, win-at-all costs corporate culture that enabled a start-up like Uber to succeed is too buggy for a global public company and has to be updated.\nOne intriguing question is whether Apple will have to repay its cultural debt as it squares up for a fist-fight with regulators. Will the monomaniacal culture that allowed it to become one of the most successful and profitable businesses in history need to be reimagined?\nCASES FILED\nLast month, the European Union (EU) launched two antitrust cases against Apple.\xa0\nThe first concerns the operations of Apple’s App Store following complaints from Spotify, the music-streaming service, and Kobo, the ebook business.\xa0\nEach has attacked the company for demanding an initial 30 per cent cut of the subscription fee from all customers who sign up via the App Store, while promoting its own rival music and books services.\nMargrethe Vestager, EU vice-president in charge of competition policy, said Apple appeared to be acting as a discriminatory “gatekeeper” controlling the distribution of apps while keeping most of the data derived from them. “We need to ensure that Apple’s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,” she said.\nThe second investigation focuses on whether Apple unfairly denies Apple Pay’s “tap and go” functionality on iPhones to rival payments companies.\nBoth cases are likely to be argued for many years by teams of high-powered lawyers. Apple’s response to the probes has been predictably furious. The company argues that it invented and built the App Store that now reaches 1.5 billion device users. If developers do not like its rules then they do not have to play.\nMillions of developers, who have made a lot of money from the App Store, are happy with the way it operates and comforted by the security it offers. Besides, Apple charges no fees on the 85 per cent of apps that are free to users.\nThis reflects the uncompromising attitude of the company’s founder, Steve Jobs, who acknowledged that the introduction of the 30 per cent charge in 2011 might result in some “roadkill” among developers. Apple has denounced the latest complainants as “free-riders” and signalled its determination to fight.\xa0\nIt will be fascinating to see whether Apple maintains its aggressive stance as the regulatory pressure increases. The EU’s scrutiny seems to have emboldened other developers.\xa0\nBase camp, which runs the Hey premium email service, has even accused Apple of running a mafia-style protection racket.\nSuch complaints are increasingly attracting the attention of US legislators, who have summoned the bosses of the big tech companies to Washington later this month.\xa0\nDavid Cicilline, the Democratic congressman who chairs the antitrust subcommittee of the House judiciary committee, has described Apple’s bullying of developers into paying the 30 per cent fee as “highway robbery”.\xa0\nHe has threatened to legislate to curb Apple’s monopoly powers. “It’s contrary to our laws. It’s unfair to new developers, new start-ups, and it hurts consumers,” he said.\nAPPLE HAS TWO CHOICES\nApple has an interesting choice to make. It can simply tough out this regulatory scrutiny while it continues to generate an estimated US$1 billion of revenue a month from the App Store.\xa0\nIt can count on the EU taking years to reach a ruling while the US Congress may never legislate. For some big tech companies, fines have become no more than the cost of doing business.\nYet Apple may also see virtue in defanging the most critical of its 23 million developers by modifying the way the App Store operates to benefit all parties.\nThe history of Microsoft in the 1990s is instructive. While Bill Gates was running the company, Microsoft was contemptuous of complainants and regulators, and ended up entangled in distracting legal fights for 16 years before finally rebooting its own culture. Led by the more consensual Satya Nadella, it has vaulted back to rival Apple as the top US companies by market capitalisation.\nIt is pretty certain that Jobs would have adopted Mr Gates’s combative approach. But that does not make it right for Apple today. It may make more sense, and may ultimately make Apple more money, for it to repay its cultural debt and negotiate more flexible terms with disgruntled developers.\nJohn Thornhill is the Innovation Editor at the Financial Times writing a regular column on the impact of technology.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Apple ', '     technology ', '     law ', '     Microsoft ']}"

      Wider variety of mobile plans and financial assistance for seniors to help them go digital
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Five mobile service providers will start rolling out mobile plans with “larger data bundles at a lower cost” for seniors from Monday (Jun 29), while another new initiative will provide lower-income seniors with subsidised smartphones and data plans.\nAnnounced by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)\xa0and the newly formed SG Digital Office (SDO) in a joint release, these initiatives are part of the Seniors Go Digital programme which was launched last month with the aim to raise the digital skills of 100,000 seniors by the end of this year.\nSingtel, M1, StarHub, Circles.Life and TPG will start rolling out the customised mobile plans for seniors progressively from Monday, the press release said.\nThere will be variety of price plans and service offerings from these operators, it added.\n“These special plans, available to all seniors, offer larger data bundles at a lower cost, to give seniors the confidence to enjoy the benefits that digital services bring.”\nAnother initiative, called the Mobile Access for Seniors, will provide eligible lower-income seniors with a subsidised smartphone and a one-year subsidised mobile data plan from M1, Singtel, StarHub or TPG.\nThose eligible can choose to purchase a basic smartphone with co-payment starting from S$20 and S$5 monthly mobile plans that offer at least 5GB of data.\nThe data plans will also include complimentary value-added services like caller number display and cybersecurity protection. There will be no excess data charges so as to give seniors a “greater peace of mind”, said the press release.\nThe new initiative will be available for sign-ups next month. Seniors can do so after attending classes under the Seniors Go Digital programme to acquire at least one basic digital skills. They must also be Singaporeans aged 60 and above, and are current beneficiaries of selected government assistance schemes.\nSpeaking to reporters at an online doorstop, Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran said these initiatives will help to address concerns about cost among seniors.\nMr Iswaran also provided an update on the country’s digitalisation efforts, which he described as making “good progress”.\nThese efforts have been ramped up in light of challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as setting up the SDO in May and forming a new ministerial committee to oversee the digitalisation push.\nUnder the SDO, digital ambassadors have been recruited with the aim of reaching out to seniors, as well as hawkers and wet market stallholders, and encourage them to adopt digital tools.\nMr Iswaran said the first target of having these ambassadors cover all 112 hawker centres and wet markets in Singapore by June has been achieved. In fact, the ambassadors have gone beyond the target to cover an additional 500 coffeeshops.\n“That is a very positive sign because it means that the execution is on track,” he said.\n“The observation is that the message is getting through because even in this early stage, we already have one hawker centre that (is having a) 100 per cent adoption rate.\n“This tells you that the stallholders are receiving the message, understanding it and translating it into action,” he said.\nMore than 300 youth volunteers from Youth Corps Singapore will also be reaching out to vulnerable seniors from 40 social service agencies from July 2020, the press release said.\nThese volunteers will help seniors pick up relevant digital skills such as using digital devices, communicating online and practising good cybersecurity hygiene.\nIMDA also said on Monday that it has received a S$1 million donation from ST Engineering for its Digital Access Programmes (DAP).\nThis is the single largest contribution to the DAP to date, and is expected to support about 4,500 beneficiaries over the next 12 months.\nThe donation will help to fund programmes such as the NEU PC Plus, Home Access and the new Mobile Access for Seniors, which aim to ensure that low-income households and individuals have access to digital devices and connectivity.\n“The national movement to accelerate Singapore’s digitalisation is gaining strong momentum,” said Mr Iswaran, noting that many companies, community and individual volunteers are partnering the Government in its digitalisation efforts.\n“Working together, we are now focusing our efforts to understand and address the concerns of different segments of our society, including seniors and hawkers.\n“Everyone can play a part to make a meaningful and material difference in Singapore’s digitalisation efforts,” he said.\n“We welcome more to join us in our national digitalisation movement.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     IMDA ', '     technology ']}"

      How one of the blackest substances on earth ended up in a luxury watch
  </h1>, 'text': 'H Moser & Cie may well be the only watchmaker with a sense of humour. When it’s not busy producing elegant dress watches with beautiful fume dials and complications, it’s making a statement with bizarre one-offs made of Swiss cheese, plants or the hallmark features of other brands’ iconic models. For last year’s April Fool’s joke, the brand revealed a concept watch you couldn’t even read the time off because everything was supposedly coated in Vantablack, one of the world’s darkest materials.\nAs it turns out, interest and demand for such a ridiculous concept was so overwhelming that H Moser & Cie decided to follow through on the idea – with practical revisions, of course – and it resulted in the Venturer Concept Vantablack series last year. For 2020, the collection welcomes new Venturer Vantablack Black Hands models with an even stealthier look with barely-there hands.\nIf you’re wondering why the so-called “Black Hands” appear grey on the watches, it’s because Vantablack is really just that much blacker by comparison. Created by UK-based SurreyNanosystems, Vantablack is the brand name for a range of ultra-black coatings capable of absorbing up to 99.965 per cent of visible light, and was primarily developed for applications such as deep space imaging, automotive sensing and optical sensing. In a watch, it’s just cool.\nTo get a better idea of what this fascinating material can do, we spoke to SurreyNanosystems’ Ben Jensen who, according to his LinkedIn profile, is the founder and chief technology officer “at a place that makes Lord Voldemort’s dark heart look as bright as the sunrise on Venus.”\n\n\nGIVEN VANTABLACK’S ORIGINAL PURPOSE, WERE YOU SURPRISED AT THE INTEREST AND DEMAND COMING FROM THE LIFESTYLE SECTOR?\nWe were, actually. When we launched it at the Farnborough Airshow in 2014, we expected maybe five to 10 people to come by, say hello and maybe show some interest. But I think we ended up headlining the show. We soon had camera crews from across the world come and have a lock at these materials because no one had ever seen anything like it before.\nVery quickly we were inundated with requests from all sorts of people but we weren’t set up to respond to non-engineering requests until we developed a more accessible version called Vantablack S-VIS. Even then we only wanted to work with lifestyle companies that would do the coating justice and really go the extra length to integrate it.\nHOW DIFFICULT WAS IT TO PUT IN A WATCH? \nWhen you have a dial that’s super black, you can’t judge where the surface is. So something as basic as mounting the hands becomes incredibly difficult. You can’t appreciate how challenging it is until you’ve looked at one of these dials under a microscope and realise it’s like staring into a void. You’d need a reference point just to figure out how far away it is.\nSo the fact that H Moser was willing to put in all that effort was what set them apart.\nHOW LONG DOES THE COATING PROCESS TAKE? \nIt depends on what we’re coating. It can take up to 100 hours to coat a component meant for use in space. Even coating a watch dial can take many, many hours. Once we have the initial plating down, it goes through plasma processing, which is basically processing the component in a reactor that looks like something out of Star Trek.\nWe bombard the surface with ions, do some dry chemistry and make it functional by making sure it’s hydrophobic, which means water will never touch the surface of it. So it’s not like we just spray the coating out of a can. It’s very difficult to do, but the result is stunning.\nWHAT DOES VANTABLACK… FEEL LIKE?\nYou wouldn’t be able to feel it. Your fingers don’t have the resolution to feel it so all you’ll feel is the underlying metal. The structure is very strange – it seems like a solid paint but it isn’t. If you look at it through a scanning electron microscope it would look like you’re swimming through a coral reef.\nThis “reef” is made up of vertically aligned nanotubes, so when light enters, it gets trapped and bounces around and around until it eventually dissipates into heat. The coating can also be taken from -270ºC to 300ºC in seconds and nothing will happen to it. It won’t move or crack and will just be happy resting on the substrate. So it has some interesting properties other than being black.\nCAN YOU COAT FABRICS WITH IT? \nA lot of well-known fashion brands have asked if we could, and we did try it once as a test but it’s just not practical. The structure is too fragile, you’d never be able to wash it, and the moment you get a bit of dust on it it would look like a diamond fell on the fabric because of the huge contrast.\nThat’s the problem with something that’s so extraordinarily black – anything that falls on it will show up. If you were to leave a piece on a desk for an hour it would look like it’s been snowed on. It would look quite surreal if you could wear it, though.\nCAN YOU MAKE IT EVEN DARKER THAN IT ALREADY IS? \nIt’s theoretically possible, but the real question is whether there’s any point to it because the reality is your eyes can’t see the difference. And when you make a claim of a number, it’s difficult to support that claim because there’s a lot of uncertainty in the measurements. And the electronics that use our coatings aren’t sensitive enough to know the difference between 99.8 per cent light absorption and 99.9 per cent.\nWHAT ARE YOU GUYS CURRENTLY WORKING ON? \nMore customer-facing applications, actually. We used the Vantablack VBx 2 on a pavilion at the 2018 Winter Olympics, which I think holds the record for blackest building in the world, so that material has a lot of applicability for ultra high definition displays and billboards. We’ve also tested its use in cinemas. Imagine one where the ceiling and walls are coated in Vantablack. It will be like sitting in a void and the screen will look like it’s floating.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     technology ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Commentary: To help us travel safer with COVID-19, airports need new checkpoint technology
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: COVID-19 has caused incredible disruptions to air travel. It has reduced international passenger traffic by up to 71 per cent so far according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), hitting airlines in the Asia Pacific the hardest - almost a decline of \xa0US$113 billion. \xa0\nCloser to home, Singapore Changi Airport had recently announced a pause to the construction of the new Terminal 5 for at least two years to re-think its design for our health and safety.\nThat said, history shows that the effect of pandemics on air travel is usually temporary. “Even in the outbreak of SARS, monthly international passenger traffic returned to its pre-crisis level within nine months,” the International Air Transport Association (IATA) noted in its official magazine Airlines.\nWe are already seeing that the aviation industry is getting ready to bounce back onto its feet, such as with the recent travel bubble established between Singapore and China, and news of a potential one between Australia and New Zealand.\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPORTANT\nAs eager as we all are to resume our vacation plans, we also want to know that our safety is ensured and that the reopening of air travel can be sustained. And it’s clear that the aviation community understands, and is tackling, the public need for health and safety before we are confident of flying again.\nFor instance, in early June, international organisations, like the ICAO, shared global guidelines to harmonise COVID-19 related measures across airport hubs.\xa0\nThese emphasise a multi-layered approach — restarting air travel in stages like with the travel bubbles, and implementing mask wearing, temperature taking, submitting travel declarations in advance and testing.\nBut there are additional measures airports should take.\xa0\nContactless check-ins and security screening processes will make a world of difference in helping us maintain social distancing, and keep us, other passengers, and the security officers safe.\nThe challenge is putting together various, existing technologies that make “touchless travel” possible. A few airports across Asia are already doing that.\xa0\nFor instance, the Narita Airport in Tokyo has installed walk-through body scanners while airports across India, like in New Delhi, are in the midst of installing them.\nThe scanners precisely highlight suspicious items on our bodies to the operator who informs us from a distance to remove the item by ourselves, reducing the need for a physical pat-down. This helps us maintain social distancing while speeding up our security checks.\nThe Melbourne Airport and Changi Airport have already implemented Computed Tomography (CT), which is a technology used in hospitals. \xa0It produces 3D images of our baggage and allows electronics and liquids to remain in bags.\xa0\nThis means we won’t have to spend time removing items from our bags, making our screening quicker without sacrificing accuracy.\nThe Melbourne Airport and the Kansai International Airport in Japan are examples that have adopted automated tray return systems known as SMART lanes, on top of CT tech.\nThe system automates movement of trays which we put our baggage in when sending them through the machine to be scanned. This keeps travellers moving to speed up baggage checks and minimise bottlenecks, as well as having to excessively touch common trays.\nThe Jeju International Airport in South Korea is an example which has adopted remote screening in addition to CT tech and SMART lanes.\xa0\nSince image analysts will be stationed in a remote location away from checkpoints, operators will have no direct contact with passengers. Remote screening also allows analysts to clear more images at a faster rate — reducing our time in screening.\nWith the right solutions in place, going through safer checkpoint processes doesn’t equate to more time taken for travellers.\nAutomation and advanced technology increase the efficiency of the security checks and reduce our time spent at the checkpoints, helping us to spend less time in close proximity with others, while knowing that security standards are not compromised.\nGlobally, airports in Japan, Korea, Singapore and China, are among the fastest in their modernisation of both technologies and processes. These airports will have a better foundation to evolve and accommodate the post COVID-19 health and safety requirements.\nOutside Asia, airports are also piloting ultraviolet (UV) technology to disinfect surfaces to kill up to 99.9 per cent of bacteria and viruses.\nA study done in 2018 by researchers from the BioMed Central Infectious Diseases journal found that the plastic trays used for depositing baggage for screening pose the highest risk of transmitting respiratory viruses.\nBesides automating the trays to reduce contact, integrating UV light into tray return systems before the next passenger reaches the same tray will boost safety of the screening processes by leaps.\xa0\nLondon’s Gatwick Airport is one of the first airports globally to trial this technology, but I’m certain we’ll see this introduced in Asia very soon.\nAirports will also want to consider proofing the arrivals process in the future. From bag tracking technologies to help reduce crowds at the bag collection carousels, or using UV to also sanitise the baggage itself to protect staff handling bags, the aviation industry will want to improve processes every way possible.\nUltimately, as the industry begins reinstating operations, I believe globally and regionally harmonised measures will be essential in tackling fears of spread or imported cases for governments to begin lifting restrictions and passenger flights to take off.\nIf the aviation industry is able to respond to the new requirements of air travel with agility, the right policies, and leverage technological tools, I have no doubt that we can all return to traveling safely soon enough.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\xa0\nDesmond Lian is Head of Aviation Solutions at Smiths Detection Asia Pacific.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     aviation ', '     Travel ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Making a trip to the clinic is not the only way to get medical treatment during COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: COVID-19 is unprecedented in every way, but what’s been striking about the disruption is that almost everyone, young and old, has had a price to pay. \xa0\nChildren have had to miss school or playing in parks with their friends, livelihoods have been lost, money has been stuck in cancelled flight tickets, expected returns on investments have been disappointing, weddings have had to be called off, families have been distanced and the elderly have been isolated even further – each of us has a story to tell.\xa0\nBut even as Singapore has entered the second phase of its reopening, it is too soon to declare that life will be the same as before the pandemic.\nThe world will need to continue to live with the sudden and unplanned changes brought on by the coronavirus.\xa0\nAnd while some restrictions have been eased since Jun 19 – including the resumption of health services - safe distancing measures will largely remain.\nThe rapid rise of COVID-19 infections has caused an overload on healthcare systems as frontline workers focused on the immediate crisis.\xa0\nThe experience can weigh on those managing chronic health conditions since many have been unable to attend, or decided to stay away from, their doctor’s clinic or hospital to keep safe.\nFor patients with heart rhythm problems, progressive heart failure or chronic conditions, regular follow-ups are crucial to monitor their health and adjust prescribed medication, but the pandemic has upended that.\xa0\nHealth tech has stayed a step ahead, helping people with routine or chronic health conditions to stay in touch with their doctors – even if they cannot, or are reluctant to, attend a clinic or hospital.\nAnd while cutting-edge technology used in diverse fields from communications systems to jet engines is helping patients and their doctors to uncover actionable insights into their health, tele-health is the glue that holds everything together.\nTELE-HEALTH IS HEALTHCARE’S NEW SOCIAL PLATFORM\nTechnology is bringing healthcare closer to patients and consumers at a time when safe distancing has become a part of daily life.\xa0\nAs nations battle to keep the virus at bay, tele-health is a powerful tool because it helps doctors to connect with patients in hospitals, clinics and at home, much like what social media did for a lot of us, over a decade ago.\xa0\nBetter bandwidth has allowed technology to be applied to many inpatient and outpatient specialties allowing people to access healthcare services through video, telephone, chat and messaging enabled by mobile apps and websites.\xa0\nAs people avoid visiting clinics because of fears about COVID-19, Singaporeans are increasingly opting for online consultations, as evidenced by a huge spike in signups to telemedicine platforms over the past couple of months. \xa0\nDaily calls from patients to tele-health service providers such as MyDoc, MaNaDr, WhiteCoat and Doctor Anywhere have surged - by up to five times for some.\xa0\nThese platforms allow quick diagnoses without the need to physically visit a doctor’s clinic.\xa0\nOnline consultations range from routine follow-up sessions for chronic diseases such as diabetes and even the assessment of urgent COVID-19-like symptoms.\nREMOTE CARE SUPPORTS CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS\nDiabetes is a condition with a prevalence of around 9 per cent in Singapore, according to 2017 data from the Ministry of Health. \xa0\nSince less than a third of people diagnosed with diabetes are able to achieve desired glycaemic goals - a key factor in effective and long-term management of diabetes - regular and timely follow-ups with the treating physician are important.\xa0\nBut face-to-face consultations can be challenging during this time.\nThat’s why continuous glucose monitoring technology - used by people with diabetes to check their glucose levels - connected to digital tools like mobile apps and cloud-based data systems has proven vital.\xa0\nThe past few weeks of restrictions on movement due to COVID-19 have coincided with the rise of adoption in cloud-based digital monitoring tools.\xa0For\xa0instance, Abbott has seen a significant spike in users adopting FreeStyle Libre’s cloud-enabled diabetes management tool, which allows doctors to remotely review a patient’s glucose levels.\nCONNECTIVITY POWERS JET ENGINE HEART TECH\nFor people with heart-failure, quick access to medical care is a necessity.\xa0\nAs COVID-19 has impacted health systems around the world, it has also been important to help heart failure patients avoid exposure to the virus in places such as hospitals or clinics. New technology can help solve both problems.\xa0\nTechnology used in jet engines has led to innovations such as Cardio Micro-Electrical Mechanical Systems, which are in use across the US, Europe and some Asian countries.\xa0\nThese can detect changes in the pressure of blood through the pulmonary artery in heart failure patients - even before symptoms such as shortness of breath or weight gain become evident.\xa0\nThe system features a small pressure-sensing device that is implanted directly into the pulmonary artery. It sends information wirelessly to a doctor so that it can be used to adjust a patient’s medications and treatment plan, if needed.\xa0\nThe technology is proven to significantly reduce heart-failure hospital admissions by 58 per cent over an average of 12 months – ultimately improving quality of life.\xa0\nBy helping to keep more heart failure patients out of the hospital, physicians also help patients with a challenging COVID-19 comorbidity avoid potential contact with the virus.\nTECHNOLOGY AS A BRIDGEA person’s quality of life has never had more significance than at the present time.\xa0\nCOVID-19 is arguably one of the biggest challenges that many of us have ever faced. To some, this may even seem as ‘the worst of times’.\xa0But in this season of worry and concern, health tech harbours hope. \xa0\nIn this changed world where distancing is an unexpected, unwelcome intruder and will be with us for many months, innovations in health tech will keep us safe, connected and empowered, paving the way to better times.\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\xa0\nAshish Oza is Senior Director of Clinical Operations (APAC) at Abbott.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     healthcare ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Tired of staring at screens? Here’s how to avoid tech overload while stuck at home
  </h1>, 'text': 'MIDDLESBROUGH, England: From churchgoers to nursery school children, video calls, conferences and quizzes have become a lifeline at this time.\nBut this has also meant the boundary between work and family life has become blurred and unbalanced – with notifications, calls and messages, interrupting mealtimes and conversations.\nAnd herein lies part of the problem, because research has found that breaks from work where we engage with our smartphones – to play games or scroll through social networks – are less effective or restorative than conventional breaks such as walking or napping.\nThis is in part why we have started a new research project to find out how increased screen use during the pandemic, for both learning and downtime, is affecting student well-being and concentration levels.\nExisting research shows that students who are addicted to their phones have lower level of self-regulated learning, low level of flow – or feeling “in the zone” – and are constantly interrupted by applications on their phones when they are studying.\nSo we want to see if enforced break time away from all screens could help.\nWHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS\nStudies have found that by three months of age, about 40 per cent of children regularly watch television, DVDs, or videos. And by 24 months, this number rises to 90 per cent.\nResearch from the US has also found that between the ages of eight and 18, children spend on average seven hours and 11 minutes a day engaging with screen-based entertainment.\nWhile research from Ofcom shows that, on average, adults in the UK check their phones every 12 minutes.\nIn this sense, lockdown isn’t helping those who are already addicted to their screens. The need to constantly check the news is also creating new screen addicts – linked with increased levels of stress, anxiety, insomnia, and even trauma.\nResearch proves that too much screen time results in headaches, migraines, eyestrain, obesity and sleep deprivation. It’s thought to also cause behavioural problems in children, difficulties at school, and increased levels of violence.\nHOW TO DE-SCREEN\nAll of this research highlights the importance of taking a break from screens – particularly during this time of increased stress. Below are some tips to help.\nFirst, put one day a week aside to give yourself and your gadgets a rest. Turn off the laptop, TV, tablet and smartphone and spend some quality time “offline”.\nCook a meal for your family, do some gardening, work on your hobbies, tick off some chores on your to-do list – anything as long as it’s away from the screens.\nSecond, don’t carry your phone around. Your phone does not have to permanently reside in your pocket; this just encourages bad habits like checking it on the toilet or at the dinner table.\nBeing “deviceless” helps you to live in the moment, unwind and focus more on what you’re doing – without worrying about what might be happening “out there”.\nThird, allow yourself to be bored. Experiencing boredom off-screen is a natural path to creativity. We can use our boredom as fuel to motivate us to achieve tasks we have been putting off.\nThis will allow your dopamine receptors to recover from all that tech use as well – excessive screen use causes too much dopamine to flood the brain which has been linked to addictive behaviours, changes in mood, increased stress and difficulty sleeping.\nTime away from the screen can also give you the chance to think about what you want to accomplish and how.\nFourth, set aside some device-free time into your family schedule a few times a week. On certain days, after 6pm the whole family should switch off all devices.\nThis will push everyone to have a few hours of quality screen-free time before bed.\nFinally, think about how to counterbalance all that screen time. For every hour you spend working, you could take 10\xa0minutes to walk around the house, make a cup of tea, jump on a trampoline, go for a quick run, do some stretches – anything to get you up and moving.\nThis will help to bring some separation into your life, allowing you to switch off and think without all those notifications and alerts.\nAll of this is important because studies show that exceeding two hours of recreational screen time directly affects our brains, resulting in slower processing speed, shorter attention span and deterioration in memory.\nReduced screen time, on the other hand, sharpens our concentration and allows us to complete tasks more efficiently and manage our time more effectively.\nIn fact why not start now: Put down your phone, tablet, or whatever you are reading this on, look at something in the distance to give your eyes a good stretch, and get up and do something else. Your body and brain will thank you for it.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nSina Joneidy is Lecturer in Digital Enterprise, Teeside University.

      COVID-19: Singapore to spend S$3.5 billion on information and communications technology to support businesses
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore will spend an estimated S$3.5 billion on the procurement of information and communications technology (ICT) this financial year to boost the economy and support businesses recovering from the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThis estimated expenditure is 30 per cent more compared to the last financial year’s projected spend of S$2.7 billion, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) said in a media release on Monday (Jun 8).\n“The increased spending will help the Government accelerate digitalisation as technology becomes increasingly vital in enabling citizens and workers to resume normal activities, and businesses to reopen safely after the COVID-19 circuit breaker,""\xa0said GovTech.\nThe projected\xa0ICT expenditure will focus on five key areas: Development of new technology tools to respond to COVID-19, development of citizen- and business-centric digital services, development of ICT systems on cloud, modernisation of government ICT infrastructure, as well as the use of data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and sensors within the public sector.\nGovTech said the projected FY2020 procurement spending will include ICT projects that have been brought forward by agencies because of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThese projects include the development of tech solutions to respond to COVID-19\xa0and Sport Singapore’s ActiveSG Circle – launched in April this year – which aims to elevate the sporting industry in Singapore via technology\nMORE SUPPORT FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will\xa0be eligible to participate in 80 per cent of these potential procurement opportunities. In the previous financial year, SMEs were awarded nearly 70 per cent of the total ICT contracts.\nGovTech said it has continued to work with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to streamline and introduce new procurement methods to improve their access to Government ICT procurement opportunities.\nThese include incorporating more bulk tenders and dynamic contracting to shorten the ICT procurement process.\nFor this financial year, GovTech said the Government will put up bulk tenders for services such as user experience design, agile development, application development, data science and AI.\n“With a projected value of S$1.2 billion, these bulk tenders will broaden the opportunities for SMEs to participate in and win ICT contracts with government agencies,” the agency said.\nOne of the SMEs to benefit from the bulk tender, SimplifyNext, was awarded a robotics process automation (RPA) bulk tender for the whole of Government.\nSimplifyNext managing director\xa0Mayank Gupta said that unlike larger companies, SMEs have limited resources and are used to spending more time trying to win contracts than to deliver them.\n“This is where the Government’s initiative of pooling demand for new services into bulk tenders has really helped us. We went through an extensive and rigorous evaluation process to secure the RPA bulk tender, and it has opened many doors for us to do business with Government agencies,” said Mr Gupta.\xa0\nACTIVE RECRUITMENT AS PART OF SGUNITED JOBS INITIATIVE\nTo strengthen the Government’s internal engineering capabilities and accelerate the pace of digitalisation, GovTech said it is actively recruiting fresh graduates and experienced technology professionals as part of the SGUnited Jobs initiative.\nThere are more than 400 vacancies in roles such as software engineers, digital business analysts, cybersecurity specialists, data scientists, AI engineers and infrastructure specialists.\nApplicants can register their interest online during GovTech’s five-week virtual recruitment drive from May 21 to Jun 21.\xa0\nGovTech chief executive\xa0Kok Ping Soon said the COVID-19 outbreak has illustrated the importance of digitalisation, as well as the need to accelerate it within and beyond the public sector.\n“We hope that businesses, especially the SMEs, will benefit from the larger pool and higher value of ICT procurement opportunities, work with us to build a Smart Nation and Digital Government, and emerge stronger from this crisis together.”\nThe Government’s ICT procurement and digitalisation roadmap is usually announced at the annual Smart Nation and Digital Government Industry Briefing.\nThis year, in light of the COVID-19 measures, GovTech will roll out an online multimedia package. The package, which will be rolled out from Wednesday, will contain more details on the Government’s key digitalisation focuses and areas of projected spending.\n“COVID-19 has accelerated the push for digitalisation within the public and private sectors. For FY2020, the Government will continue to invest heavily in technology to carry forward the impetus for digitalisation at a whole-of-nation level,” the agency said.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19 outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     GovTech ', '     technology ', '     Smart Nation ']}"

      Expanded programme to place and train 3,000 Singaporeans in tech jobs over next two to three years
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: An existing government programme will be expanded to place 3,000 Singaporeans in technology-related jobs and train them over the next two to three years, said Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran on Thursday (Jun 4).\nThis is to allow Singapore to meet a demand for tech and digital talent, with the information and communications technology (ICT) sector continuing to grow despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe scaling up of the company-led training (CLT) programme will be done through partnerships with leading tech and non-tech firms.\nThe plan is to place and train more Singaporeans in “good tech jobs” that fulfil functions such as digital marketing, software engineering, cybersecurity and data analytics, the minister said in a speech delivered during the debate on the Fortitude Budget in Parliament.\nAs part of the CLT programme, which falls under the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA)\xa0initiative administered by the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA), companies will hire fresh and mid-career professionals, and provide on-the job training.\nThe TeSA Mid-Career Advance programme will also run in parallel to create an additional 2,500 place-and-train opportunities for mid-career professionals aged 40 and above, said Mr Iswaran.\n“Our goal is to help fresh graduates and mid-career professionals to secure these jobs, advance their skills and start a fulfilling career in one of the most promising sectors in our economy today.”\nThe ICT sector has been one of the bright spots in the economy despite ongoing uncertainties, the minister said. The sector grew 3.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, creating 1,100 new jobs.\n“Digital and tech roles are in demand\xa0within the ICT sector\xa0and also in the rest of the economy because every sector is seeking digital solutions,” said Mr Iswaran, although he cautioned that ICT firms may also be “more restrained” in their hiring decisions given the grim economic environment.\n""We are doubling down in our effort to identify jobs across the economy - be they permanent jobs, temporary jobs, part-time jobs\xa0or traineeships,” he said.\n“We will spare no effort to prepare and place our people in these roles - be they fresh graduates from universities, polytechnics or ITEs, or mature workers in our economy. And we will work closely with the labour movement and employers in this difficult but critical effort.”\nPlans to help businesses accelerate digital transformation are also afoot, with the latest being the Digital Resilience Bonus announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat as part of the Fortitude Budget last week.\nAs a start, the new scheme is targeted at the food and beverage (F&B) and retail sectors as they have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 fallout. Discussions are ongoing with the Ministry of Finance on how this can be expanded, Mr Iswaran told the House.\nUnder the bonus, businesses can receive a payout of S$2,500 if they adopt business process solutions and an additional S$2,500 if they build an online shopfront or e-commerce platform. They will qualify for an additional S$5,000 payout if they adopt advanced digital solutions like data mining and data analytics.\nThis hopes to encourage F&B and retail businesses to adopt digital solutions such as online ordering, e-invoicing, inventory management and e-payments so as to operate in a post-COVID new normal, said Mr Iswaran.\nDIGITAL PUSH MUST REACH EVERYONE\nMr Iswaran said COVID-19 and its disruptions have brought home the importance of digitalisation for the economy, as well as digital inclusion for the society.\n“Our digital push must reach all segments of our economy and society, like our hawkers and senior citizens, so that they too can benefit,” he said.\nHe pointed to the recent formation of the SG Digital Office, which is targeting to mobilise 1,000 digital ambassadors to help 18,000 hawkers and 100,000 seniors to go digital.\nFor instance, these ambassadors will be on the ground at various wet markets and hawker centres from June to help stall owners adopt SGQR codes for e-payment and avoid handling cash, according to the announcement on the new digital office on Sunday.\n“This effort will mark a quantum shift in our digitalisation effort in the community, and greatly benefit the lives and livelihoods of our people,” Mr Iswaran said.\nA new Hawkers Go Digital initiative will also give hawkers who sign up for the unified e-payment solution and fulfil minimum transaction requirements a bonus of\xa0S$300 per month over any five months. Hawkers who have already adopted the unified e-payment solution are eligible for this bonus.\nThe aim is to get more than 18,000 stallholders at wet markets, hawker centres, coffee shops and industrial canteens to adopt cashless payment by the middle of next year, said Mr Iswaran.\nDigital adoption among seniors has been rising, the minister said, noting that smartphone usage among this group have more than doubled over the past five years.\nBut more will be done through the Seniors Go Digital Programme, such as introducing one-on-one coaching at community places, options for seniors to sign up for small group learning with their friends and other hands-on learning opportunities.\nIMDA is also working with telcos to offer better mobile data plans for seniors, said Mr Iswaran. Financial assistance will also be given to lower-income seniors who cannot afford devices and data plans.\nThese new initiatives will complement existing digital inclusion programmes, such as the NEU PC Plus and Home Access that ensure digital access and connectivity for low-income households and persons with disabilities.\n“We have and will continue to enhance these programmes to meet the changing needs arising from COVID-19 and the circuit breaker measures,” he said.\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Singapore economy ', '     jobs ', '     S Iswaran ', '     technology ']}"

      Why are watchmakers making crazy complicated watches in a time like this?
  </h1>, 'text': 'The luxury watch industry has seen better days. Even before the pandemic started tearing up businesses in numerous sectors, Swiss watchmakers’ figures weren’t exactly optimistic. A report from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry stated that sales growth between July 2018 and June 2019 had declined 10.7 per cent. It was also last year that Apple Watch finally sold more units than the entire Swiss watch industry.\n\n\nBut the watchmaking elite soldiered on, knowing there were still fans out there who relied on them to provide mechanical wonders that could do everything but tell the time simply. Watches that mimic the Big Ben, gamble with you, or keep track of the leap year even when you can’t, all without having to reply on a battery. Watches that will continue to run even after Skynet enslaves all our electronic devices.\nThough in the midst of the current global crisis, surely it would be more prudent and considerate to dial down the flash factor, some argue. While people are fighting for their lives and livelihood, a multi-million-dollar super-watch does’t seem to be the type of thing people should be throwing money at.\nAnd yet Vacheron Constantin seems to be suggesting otherwise with its 2020 novelties. In fact, the company made two such big boy toys, worthy companions to 2015’s Ref. 57260, a pocket watch with 57 complications and a movement with more than 2,800 parts. \nOne of them is the double-sided Les Cabinotiers Grand Complication Split-seconds Chronograph “Tempo”. With a whopping 24 complications, it is the most complex wristwatch Vacheron Constantin has ever built. Somehow, the brand managed to fit the time, a perpetual calendar, chronograph, tourbillon, minute repeater, moon phase and indications for solar time, equation of time, sunrise, sunset, day and night into a 50mm pink gold case.\nThe other is the Les Cabinotiers Astronomical Striking Grand Complication “Ode to Music”. This one “only” has 19 complications but its movement is, impressively, half as thick as the Tempo’s with a height of 7.84mm. It includes a perpetual calendar, minute repeater, numerous astronomical indications, sidereal time and a sky chart of the northern hemisphere. Like all chiming watches in Vacheron Constantin’s stable, the Ode to Music and the Tempo have had their chimes recorded by London’s Abbey Road Studios.\nBoth took five years to develop and there is only one of each, so you can’t blame the brand for not timing these showpieces around unforeseen, unprecedented disasters.\nVacheron Constantin isn’t the only manufacture to come out guns blazing in a season of safe choices. A lot of attention has been directed at Jaeger-LeCoultre’s new classic (read: innocuous) Master Control line, but the Le Sentier watchmaker also debuted the third generation of its Master Grande Tradition Grande Complication this year.\nPacking an orbital flying tourbillon, minute repeater, annual calendar with Zodiac symbol and a Northern hemisphere constellation chart, the calibre 945 is one serious piece of horology. And this year it gets a new case and an overhauled dial that features a filigree dome for extra dimensionality. There are eight pieces in pink gold and eight in white gold studded with 44 baguette-cut diamonds. Not exactly sobering stuff.\nBut why should they be? The world may have come to a temporary standstill but that doesn’t mean imaginations have to. It took centuries of know-how and innovation for haute horlogerie to get to where it is today, and it is precisely because someone dared to push the limits of what is mechanically possible that watchmaking as a whole could advance.\nGranted, it’s not every watch brand that can afford such a privilege, so the fact that there are those that stand by their masterpieces and are willing to share them in a time this bleak might mean the luxury watch industry has a fighting chance after all.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     technology ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Commentary: COVID-19 has revealed a new disadvantaged group among us – digital outcasts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: We are now forced online to learn, work, live and stay connected.\nYet due to the lack of internet connectivity, requisite devices or digital literacy, there are many who are cut-off from such access.\nThey are not digital natives nor immigrants, they are digital outcasts.\nCOVID-19 has exposed and deepened the digital divide in our society. Given the speed at which most of society is moving ahead, closing this gnawing digital divide must be an urgent priority if we are to have a Smart Nation that is also united.\nI will address three questions: How deep is the digital divide? What factors contribute to the divide? And what solutions can we consider?\nHOW DEEP IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SINGAPORE? \nThe latest Household Expenditure Survey 2017/2018 tells us that only 81 per cent of resident households have a personal computer, and only 87 per cent have internet access.\nThis suggests that at least one\xa0in 10 households in Singapore are not plugged into our digital world.\nOnly 45 per cent of households residing in 1- and 2-room HDB flats have internet access, compared to 96 per cent of households living in private condominiums and other apartments.\nOnly 31 per cent of the 1-2 room HDB households have a personal computer, in contrast with 95 per cent of households in private condominiums and other apartments.\nThese numbers mean that some of us are almost guaranteed to have internet connectivity and a personal computer, while more than 5 in 10 households living in 1-and 2-room HDB flats have no internet access or personal computer.\nThis is also reflected in the ground realities exposed by home-based learning (HBL).\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) has loaned out an estimated 20,000 devices, including laptops and tablets.\xa0\nA few community groups I personally know and supported, including Engineering Good, have given out more than 2,600 laptops in total. They have also provided Wi-Fi dongles or SIM cards to several families.\nThe bleak picture does not end at infrastructure. Stories from the ground reveal significant struggle in terms of digital literacy and skills, particularly among low-income households, the differently-abled, and seniors.\nReadAble, a community organisation supporting families in rental flat communities, shared the many struggles of parents using laptops donated - whether with Zoom or even in-app functions, resulting in their children’s education being compromised.\nAccording to Society Staples, a social enterprise working with the persons with disabilities (PWD) and the Disabled Persons Association, many PWDs have difficulty working from home due to a lack of equipment and Internet access.\nSome do not have the skills-set to take their work online especially when their previous work was done face-to-face.\nThis can mean loss of income and opportunities to retrain or learn new skills.\xa0\nThey also miss out on maintaining or even expanding connections with family and friends, which increases mental stress and strains existing coping mechanisms, especially for those with psycho-social disabilities.\nCassia Resettlement Team, a community organisation, has had to support many low-income individuals, particularly seniors, who struggle with the digitisation of government services.\nFor example, SingPass is required to access many such services including checking Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts, which are regularly required to apply for welfare schemes, checking medical appointments or medical tests results and prescriptions.\nIn 2006, the Government’s iN2015 Masterplan pledged that every household with a school-going child would own a personal computer by 2015.\xa0\nI remember this clearly as I was running my own education technology company then and was very energised by this vision of a digital future which my company also participated in.\nSadly, despite this iN2015 ambition, our efforts to become a Smart Nation since 2014 and the Digital Readiness Blueprint released in 2018, we continue to struggle with a deep digital divide in Singapore.\nSTRUCTURAL ISSUES PERPETUATING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE \nOne of the structural issues that stand out as perpetuating the digital divide is the gaps in government intervention.\nMarket forces are the key driver of this divide. Although internet connectivity and personal computers are necessities in today’s world, they are still priced beyond the reach of the low-income in our society.\nThis disparity in turn perpetuates further inequality.\nThe Government intervened by introducing the NEU-PC Plus Scheme in 2006, offering students and PWDs from low-income households a new personal computer bundled with three years of free internet connectivity.\nWhile it has benefitted more than 40,000 households, the scheme falls short in several ways.\nFirst, it only permitted one laptop per eligible household regardless of household size, increasing to two only last month due to HBL.\nSecond, the application process is complex and bureaucratic.\nThird, it is limited in scope, excluding pre-school, home-schooled and university students.\nFourth, it disadvantages against PWDs, who only receive a 50 per cent subsidy as compared to 75 per cent for students.\nFifth, under the Home Access scheme, adults have no option to apply for a personal computer, only a tablet or smartphone.the\xa0\nI commend MOE and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) for working hard to resolve digital access issues during this circuit breaker period.\nIMDA enhanced the NEU-PC scheme. MOE worked with schools to loan out personal learning devices and kept schools open for those who struggled with digital access.\nBut gaps persist. The device loan programme came with conditions and liability provisions.\nCommunity organisation 6th Sense shared that there were families who were too scared to bring those devices home as they would not be able to afford to pay the schools if the devices got lost or broken.\nFurther, the families were rightly worried about going to school and risking COVID-19 infection. One teenage student I know developed severe anxiety when she had to go to school every day before HBL began.\nWhy should any child be required to go to school to use IT facilities at the height of a pandemic?\nGiven these gaps, community organisations found that it made more sense to give every family good internet connection and every child a personal computer.\nThe Minister for Education has said that, by 2024, every Secondary 1 student will have a tablet, a laptop, or a chromebook.\nI propose a broader Digital Adequacy Framework, which I will elaborate later.\nMOVING TOWARDS DIGITAL INCLUSION FOR SGUNITED \nThe Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) has boldly committed in its Digital Readiness Blueprint that all Singaporeans will be digitally ready, no matter their income or current IT abilities.\nI would like to offer some suggestions from the ground regarding enhancements to existing schemes and structural changes.\nThe NEU-PC Plus Scheme’s application process could be further streamlined, for instance, by allowing beneficiaries of the various financial assistance schemes to automatically qualify.\nCan the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and MOE work together to ensure that every family with a child on MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), or every family supported by ComCare who has a child in school, automatically gains adequate access to a fully subsidised personal computer?\nIT subsidy schemes should include device replacement and customer care.\nAdults supported under ComCare or residing in HDB rental flats should also have the option of receiving a partially or fully subsidised digital device, depending on their income.\nThe scheme should also be broadened immediately to permit applications to benefit all children whether preschool, home-schooled or university students, and adults from low-income families.\nPWDs must be better supported given the changing nature of work post COVID-19.\nTo reduce the time and resources required to deliver digital devices to families, we may need a Digital Empowerment Voucher (DEV) scheme that combines aspects of the existing Public Transport Voucher and Innovation & Capability Voucher schemes.\nThe vouchers could be stipulated for use only with local SMEs which would directly assist our local enterprises in these trying times.\nTo realise the Digital Readiness commitment to provide digital connectivity and devices for those with limited resources adequately, a Digital Adequacy Framework should be considered.\nBecause it’s not enough to just be digitally ready or included, this digital participation must adequately support their learning, work and social connections meaningfully.\nUnder this Framework, tablets must be decoupled from the definition of “personal computer” across the board for learning and work purposes.\nWe should also view the amount of hardware deemed adequate for each household to be based on the needs of each member in it.\nFor instance, should every student in Primary 5 and above not have their own laptop, considering the MOE’s digital literacy plans for upper primary students?\nThe Framework should also fold internet speed, hardware functionality and digital literacy into its analysis to enable meaningful digital participation.\nWithin this Framework, universal internet access should be provided as a public utility especially for low income households.\xa0\nCan IMDA and HDB work with commercial providers and town councils to ensure that all low-income households have adequate internet connection?\nFor instance, can Wireless@SG be expanded to cover all rental flats in Singapore, and enhanced for sufficient speed much like the ubiquitous Wi-Fi access available in shopping malls?\nFinally, the Digital Adequacy Framework should underpin the Digital Readiness Blueprint.\xa0\nMuch public policy has been characterised by efficiency, effectiveness and economy, with emphasis on outcome measures that can be determined more by what can be easily measured than by what might be most helpful to measure.\nMeaningful statistics and metrics across all vulnerable groups should be gathered regularly to inform policy design and updates.\xa0\nIn the UK, for example, the Office for National Statistics studies the digital divide across locations, gender, age, income, disability, ethnic groups/language, education and other social and economic determinants of digital inequality.\nCOVID-19 has spotlighted our deep digital divide and the digital outcasts in our midst.\nOur clarion call for SGUnited must surely be a Singapore that is digitally resilient and united.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus

      Commentary: Contact tracing aside, you should worry if you have to report your whereabouts to your boss after work
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After long lockdowns all over the world, countries are looking to ease them.\nBut the lifting of lockdowns means we are looking to resuming our daily activities with the fear of COVID-19 still hanging over us.\xa0\nThis means that governments and possibly employers will have to integrate various contact tracing measures into our routine. \xa0\nThe idea behind contact tracing is to take stock of where and when we come into contact with others for a significant period of time, so that we can track and curb the virus\' transmission.\xa0\nThat said, how much information can employers collect from employees in the name of contact tracing?\xa0\nAfter all, giving our name, mobile phone number, location data, and movement record risks invasion of privacy.\xa0\nIt pays to know what can be considered legitimate contact tracing as opposed to unwarranted surveillance.\xa0\nGOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED CONTACT TRACING\nThe Government has two digital tools – SafeEntry and TraceTogether – for contact tracing.\xa0\nIt is interesting to note however that the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA) does not impose the data protection obligations on ""any public agency"", which includes the government, including any ministry department, agency, or organ of State.\xa0\nIn other words, the Government does not need to obtain individuals\' consent to disclose personal data to another public agency.\xa0\nFurther, under the Criminal Procedure Code, the police has the power to obtain data for any investigation or\xa0trial.\xa0\nHowever, considering that both SafeEntry and TraceTogether websites express that the data collected will be used for the specific purpose of contact tracing only, public agencies will be slow to use the data for any other purposes, at the risk of losing public trust.\xa0\nWHY PRIVATE CONTACT TRACING\nIn addition to SafeEntry and TraceTogether, employers have to implement their own forms of contact tracing at their premises - not only to comply with the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) Safe Management Measures advisory, but also for business continuity.\xa0\nIf there is an inspection, employers must be able to produce records of inspections and checks conducted and corrective actions taken.\xa0\nFor the manufacturing sector specifically, the Government has also advised tracking all interactions between individuals or groups who are in close contact or proximity for 30 minutes or more, inclusive of the location whenever relevant.\xa0\nIn terms of business costs, data to show where an individual has been for prolonged periods within the workplace could make the difference between having to close down a whole floor versus closing only a small section of the workspace with minimal business disruption.\nMOM’s advisory states that if someone at the workplace is a confirmed case, employers should immediately vacate and cordon-off, clean and disinfect ""the immediate section"" of the premises where the confirmed case worked.\xa0\nThere is no need to vacate the building or the whole floor if there had been no sustained and close contact with the confirmed case.\xa0\nInternal contact tracing data can help in better defining the area to be vacated, especially where employees do not have a fixed station or have to leave their stations often.\xa0\nMETHODS OF PRIVATE CONTACT TRACING\nDepending on the nature of workplace - whether indoors, outdoors, in the office or a retail shop - the number of employees, and the budget available, employers may choose different options for contact tracing.\xa0\nIf there are CCTVs in place, employers may decide that it is convenient and cost-effective to use them to collect video footages of the employees within the workplaces.\xa0\nBusinesses could engage app developers for a bespoke solution, or build on the TraceTogether model to record “close contacts” – the exchanges of Bluetooth signals with nearby phones.\xa0\nIn the latter case, only the phone number and an ID assigned to the phone will be collected, and no location data will be collected.\nEmployers could also introduce wearable technology – a watch, lanyard or pen-shaped trackers that employees can carry with them during working hours. Imagine a fitness tracker, except for contact tracing.\xa0\nSome of these use the exchanges of Bluetooth signals to track interactions between employees or even map out where in the workplace the infected employee has been and for how long, using Bluetooth beacons installed in the workplace.\xa0\nThis may\xa0be the best option that ensures the\xa0privacy of employees among the options considered here.\xa0\nAs a dedicated hardware for the specific purpose of contact tracing, it can simply be taken off outside of working hours unlike apps installed on phones.\xa0\nAlso, unlike CCTV footages where individuals are identified by their images, wearables can capture close contacts in the form of exchange of anonymous IDs, which will require an additional step of decryption to associate back to specific individuals.\xa0\nLastly, despite the risk of incomplete and inaccurate records, small businesses may decide to keep manual records – of when employees enter the workplace, where they are stationed, a list of their meetings, who the contacts are that they meet and for how long.\xa0\nWHAT ARE MY PRIVACY RIGHTS?\nEmployees may feel that all of these measures are a little intrusive - and they are, to varying degrees – and feel a little helpless. \xa0\nOn one hand, employees would be required to accept the employers\' contact tracing measures as long as they comply with the government’s requirements for Safe Management Measures. \xa0\nOn the other hand, however, the PDPA does limit how far the contact tracing measures can go, in three aspects in particular. \xa0\nFirst, there’s the purpose limitation obligation. Personal data collected for the purpose of internal contact tracing should not be used or disclosed for any other purposes, unless consent is obtained or it is authorised under the law.\xa0\nFor example, an in-house app deployed for the sole purpose of contact tracing cannot then be used to check how employees spend their break time for the purpose of monitoring productivity.\xa0\nYour employers shouldn’t be using the app to count how long you were away from your desk during your appraisal.\xa0\nBy the same logic, employers should be conducting contract tracing during working hours, at the workplace\xa0only.\nSo, if you head\xa0down to your nearest coffeeshop in the middle of the night to grab a cup of coffee or a snack, your boss doesn’t need to know.\xa0\nSecond, organisations must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\xa0\nIn the case of the digital tools mentioned above, the personal data involved would be the CCTV footages where the employees are identifiable, or any data collected by the app or the wearables from which the individual employees can be identified - for example, mobile phone number or the location data.\xa0\nThe data should be accessed only by the designated personnel and adequately protected with strong passwords and encrypted storage.\xa0\nThird, under the PDPA’s retention limitation obligation, companies must not keep the collected data once its original\xa0purpose is no longer being served.\xa0\nThe Government\'s guidelines for the manufacturing sector, for instance, requires contact tracing records to be kept for at least one month.\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission\'s (PDPC) advisory on this topic recommends companies to implement appropriate policies on their contact tracing measures, which should include explanation on how they comply with the above obligations.\xa0\nIn case of breach of PDPA obligations, including the failure to have appropriate policies in place, the PDPC has the power to give directions for companies to take corrective actions as well as to require payment of a financial penalty not exceeding S$1 million.\xa0\nTo protect their personal data, employees should be aware of and give their input on the policies to their employers or, if necessary, consider applying to the PDPC for a review of the suspected breach of the PDPA.\nTHE FUTURE\nContact tracing tools are currently pitched as something with a clear sunset horizon, that will last until the end of this pandemic.\xa0\nHowever, if left unchecked, employers may take this opportunity to establish workplace monitoring as a new norm and continue with it even after the pandemic.\xa0\nWorse, employers may even try to use it to monitor their staff’s movements outside of work for reasons other than contact tracing.\xa0\nWe may especially see this happen if work places transit to a remote working model on a more permanent basis, where employers may be tempted to use such apps to keep track of their staff.\nEither of these possibilities will not only be taking a step backwards in terms of building a relationship of trust between employer and employee, but also with how we treat the privacy of personal data as a society.\xa0\nEmployees can help in preventing that from happening. The law empowers them to. \xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nLee In Hae, is Senior Associate of Intellectual Property & Technology at Withers KhattarWong.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: Despite stiffer competition, Zoom is ahead of the pack
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: How quickly things can change. At the beginning of this year, not many of us may have known what the Zoom app was let alone be familiar in using it.\nWithin months, as COVID-19 forced people around the world to be domesticated and turn to online options for their social and professional engagement, Zoom has become a common verb in our daily suite of vocabulary.\nIn March alone, the video-calling app reported more than 200 million meeting participants every single day. \xa0\nI have personally also gotten on the act as I moderated my first webinar on Zoom in April.\nSince then, I have been a part of Zoom sessions for the Annual General Meeting and board meetings of the Singapore Human Resources Institute, \xa0a book sharing discussion and even virtual tea sessions with my best friend.\nMany of us may have noticed that even the digitally-challenged among our networks have gotten accustomed to Zoom for their social and professional needs during the circuit breaker period.\nEven though some of these movement restriction measures will be eased from Jun 1, there is going to be a phased approach to resuming activities safely.\nOnly some employees who perform essential services will be allowed back to their places of work with most, and those who can, encouraged to continue working from home.\nThis means that we are looking at more Zooming for many weeks, perhaps months, to come.\nVIDEO CONFERENCING IS NOT NEW\nThough it may seem like a new addition to our lives, video-conferencing isn’t new.\nThe technology behind the video telephone was developed in the late 1920s by AT&T’s Bell Labs and John Logie Baird.\nAlthough there were several experiments in video-telephony thereafter, \xa0the modern day version which requires advances in video compression happened only around the 1970s when the discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithm was conceived by Nasir Ahmed, T Natarajan and K R Rao at the University of Texas.\nThe DCT became the basis for the first practical video coding standard that was useful for online video-conferencing.\nOver the last two decades, video-conferencing devices brands such as Polycom, Avaya and Cisco became prominent features in the boardrooms of organisations. These five-digit access setups would allow video calls to happen with someone in a different location and time zone.\nContinued advancement in bandwidth and technology allowed video-conferencing to move from boardrooms to be portable on our personal computers and mobile phones that fit snugly in our pockets.\nFirst, Skype came into the picture in 2003, allowing users to communicate over the Internet by voice, using a microphone, and by video using a webcam.\nApple’s FaceTime simplified the user experience when it was first introduced in 2010 as it used the mobile device’s built-in camera.\xa0\nWith 4G network, anyone can video-conference on the go on one of the many social media platforms at the touch of the screen.\nBut even so, these video-conferencing facilities then were used mainly for social purposes as they were riddled with latency and drop calls, while the low-quality webcam often made me look like a pixelated Minecraft character.\nAnd that is if you were even tech-savvy enough to get through the hoops of installing the app in the first place and then setting it up to work that way you want.\xa0\nFor all that it was worth, socialising in person seemed more convenient and natural,\nZOOM HAS NAILED IT\nSince then however, more video-conferencing apps have sprung up such as Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, BlueJeans, Zoho, Highfive and Houseparty.\nAll of them are trying to capture the global video-conferencing market size that was valued at US$3.85 billion in 2019, according to Grand View Research and is expected to grow at 10 per cent cumulatively from this year to 2027.\nWhen Zoom founder Eric Yuen left Webex to start the company, he set out to make it a market leader.\nNo wonder then that, despite all this competition, Zoom is still killing it today and ahead of the pack.\nAccording to Datanyze, Zoom is leading the market with 38.21 per cent market share – a distance ahead of competitors GoToWebinar and Webex with 21.82 per cent and 12.1 per cent respectively.\nInvestors have also recognised Zoom’s popularity and appeal as its share price has nearly tripled from US$68.72 at the beginning of the year to US$171.06 on May 22. \xa0\nIn the enterprise market for companies, it is cheaper than Webex on pricing and provides more features to allow for a better video calling experience such as Zoom Webinar.\nAgainst the likes of Skype and Hangouts, the simplicity of the user interface puts it ahead of the competition. You will not need to search for another Skype ID to connect before a call. Just an email address with a call hyperlink would start the video call.\nFor users who are not tech-savvy and just want things to work, Zoom fits in nicely as it just boots up with a click on a link. No pre-call setup, no app to download beforehand if you are on the computer and no screen full of advanced features.\nAnd quality is top notch with high-definition (HD) voice and video capabilities, which reduces occurrences of latency or lag.\nTo add fun to the functionality and ease, the built-in Touch Up feature allows you to give yourself an airbrushed look while one can easily add in a virtual background.\nThese features may sound frivolous to some but in a period such as now where there is frequent and high-usage of video-conferencing, allowing variety and functionality adds to Zoom’s appeal.\nThe ease and simplicity of Zoom makes it as easy to adopt as one would when you pick up an Apple phone for the first time.\nSince the restriction of movement, businesses and organisations have come up with very creative ways to leverage on Zoom.\nBesides organisations using it to replace their work meetings, tuition centres and schools have also used them to conduct real-time lessons.\xa0\nMany events that couldn’t physically take place have been transformed to virtual ones. Even yoga and fitness teachers are hosting classes on Zoom while food sellers are using it to showcase their stuff and take orders in real-time.\nOn the other front, a man was sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video call for his role in a drug deal - the first time such a decision has been delivered remotely here.\nWith every experience possibly delivered to you through your screen, is there ever going to be a need for physical engagement again?\nWILL ZOOM DICTATE OUR FUTURE?\nWhile Zoom has definitely made our social and professional engagement easier, it hasn’t been all smooth sailing.\nTake the security of using Zoom for education for instance. About two weeks into home-based learning for young students in Singapore, we saw a case of Zoombombing – referring to a scenario where a Zoom meeting is hijacked and disrupted by malicious actors.\nOn Apr 8, hackers got into the online lesson of a school in Singapore and showed obscene messages and images to the students, prompting the Ministry of Education to suspend the use of Zoom while it investigated the incident.\nTo Zoom’s credit, they have since taken numerous steps to address these issues albeit possibly triggered by a class action lawsuit filed by investor\xa0Michael Drieu against the company.\nYuan stepped forward and issued a public apology in April and to follow up with a 90-days plan to improve Zoom’s security starting with freezing any new features so all firepower can be centred on addressing the security issues.\nSince then, meeting IDs have become hidden. Passwords and manual admittance of participants are default. Hosts can also lock their call to prevent Zoombombing.\nBeyond that, the company has acquired Keybase - a company that specialises in secure messaging and file-sharing services - to enhance security and privacy capabilities on its platform.\nWith all these measures, New York Attorney General Letitia James' office has closed its inquiry into Zoom's security practice and the New York City Department of Education has since lifted its ban on Zoom use for educators as it approved the software's new security features.\nWith all these enhancements and features, it appears that even after the dust on COVID-19 is settled, Zoom will be here to stay.\nWhile not all employers will adopt a complete shift to Zoom, or video-conferencing in general, for professional meetings and activities, those who realised the possibilities and benefits of remote working during the circuit breaker period will adopt it as a more permanent feature of their operations.\nOutside of work, there will be those among us who will prefer to replace their face-to-face social, professional and learning pursuits with a Zoom meeting even when our post-COVID-19 lives eventually return to normal.\nAs it could be several more months before our phases of movement restrictions are past us, we are looking at an extended period of living with Zoom in our lives.\nSocialising on Zoom by then may become a habit and, as is said, old habits die hard.\nAdrian Tan is Practice Leader - Future of Work Tech at PeopleStrong after spending a decade in recruitment and outplacement. He writes regularly on HR tech.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Zoom ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: The bright spots of China’s post-coronavirus economy
  </h1>, 'text': ""MELBOURNE: Optimists of a post-COVID-19 economic recovery hope that Beijing will summon a massive infrastructure stimulus, triggering a commodity boom, as happened after the global financial crisis in 2009.\nChina’s emergence from the pandemic has been slower than expected, with some public health controls becoming institutionalised, and with second-order economic effects being felt via lost export orders and jobs.\nLife is returning to normal in most provinces, but strict neighbourhood-level monitoring, testing, and social distancing remain in place. China\xa0can’t relax fully while the virus is still spreading internationally.\nNew locally transmitted cases are still being reported, so school openings have been postponed, and cinemas closed again after briefly reopening.\nChina business analysts Gavekal Dragonomics say that two-thirds of people are back in workplaces, but most still can’t obtain door-to-door deliveries, only half have visited a shopping mall this month, and all must still quarantine if travelling beyond their city of residence, and again on return.\nCHINESE DEBT\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) fell 6.8 per cent in the first quarter. The IMF is forecasting a recovery only to 1.2 per cent growth for all 2020. Exports – which comprise about 18 per cent of GDP – are expected to fall by up to half in the first quarter, and industrial profits by 25 per cent in the first half.\nLast year, government debt grew faster than in a decade, since the post-global financial crisis (GFC) stimulus kicked in.\nAt the start of 2019, total Chinese debt was about US$40 trillion – 304 per cent of GDP and 15 per cent of total global debt.\nChina had started a deleveraging campaign, but the US trade war halted it.\nThus, credit limits had been eased again, and local governments were allowed to issue special-purpose bonds – chiefly for infrastructure.\nBut such stimulus programmes have achieved ever-diminishing productivity gains, and the misallocated investment has become vast – a quarter of urban apartments now stand empty.\nAnd Chinese financial institutions, led by China Development Bank and China Export-Import Bank, have provided massive capital for Belt and Road Initiative projects, funded almost entirely by loans.\nThe capacity to repay – certainly, within the schedule agreed – must now surely come under question, thereby limiting such institutions’ future stimulus roles.\nNEW SOURCES OF GROWTH\nSo where will Beijing turn to restore growth?\nSome clarity came at the postponed National People’s Congress, where Premier Li Keqiang delivered the government’s “work report”. More will come\xa0when the 14th Five-Year Plan is launched early next year.\nWhile infrastructure stimulus remains China’s first line of response to economic emergencies, the government insists that this time the new public works will be different.\nDan Wang of Gavekal says Beijing is promising a boost in “new infrastructure” – including artificial intelligence and big data, but with the 5G mobile network the main priority.\n“All that’s missing,” says Wang, “are good reasons for consumers to actually use 5G. For now, it remains a solution looking for a problem: it boasts faster speeds, higher data flow and more device connections, but current 4G speeds are enough to satisfy consumer needs.”\nThis 5G push is therefore likely to disappoint as a near-term stimulus policy, he says.\nThe China-US trade war may also reignite.\nA clause allows for fresh negotiations “in the event of a natural disaster or other unforeseen event” – which China could invoke as it is required to buy US$200 billion of new US energy and agricultural products, a great challenge in this collapsed economic climate.\nOtherwise, trends already underway before the pandemic may resume, some more intensely.\nAccelerated by the trade war, companies from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan had already begun to restructure the great Asian value chains, investing more both at home and in third countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, to lessen risks associated with over-dependence on China, including Beijing’s propensity to prioritise politics over economics.\nThe withdrawal of the massive South Korean chaebol Lotte from China, where it had invested A$10 billion (US$6.5 billion), in the face of Chinese sanctions over new Korean missile defence, provided a stark example.\nRobotification is another trend likely to accelerate post-pandemic. And market analysts China Skinny say that China’s online and offline retail is becoming dominated by a handful of large tech companies.\nPLENTY OF SPARKLE STILL IN THE CHINESE MARKET\nChina’s middle class is likely to resume, whatever Beijing thinks, its search for overseas havens, via property purchase, business development, and, or student education.\nAs an example, Australia invests little directly in China – its US$13.5 billion is a billion less than it has invested in Papua New Guinea.\nBut a quarter of imports come from China, and a third of exports go there – three quarters comprising just four commodities: iron ore, gas, coal, and gold.\xa0\nQuantities are holding steady. Income from Chinese students in the last financial year was US$12\xa0billion, and from Chinese tourists US$4 billion. Obviously, these revenues will fall.\nBusiness commentator Alan Kohler wrote recently in The Australian that: “For Australian businesses that have China as their plan A, they should start thinking about plan B.”\nA degree of international decoupling is indeed inevitable in the wake of the virus, when China’s economic growth will continue to slow. Firms that have focused their international planning chiefly on a country’s – especially China’s – GDP growth may need to think again.\nBut that doesn’t mean junking plan A.\nThe Chinese market will remain massive and will continue to reward those who can build and keep good relationships, and who pay close attention to its constant changes, especially to its multi-layered politics.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nRowan Callick is an Industry Fellow at Griffith University's Asia Institute and a member of the Advisory Boards of the National Foundation for Australia China Relations, La Trobe University’s Asia Institute and its China Studies Department, and the University of Technology Sydney’s Australia China Relations Institute.\xa0This commentary first appeared on Lowy Institute's blog The Interpreter.

      Four key reasons why the Dyson V11 will change the way you clean your house forever
  </h1>, 'text': '\nWhen you clean your home, do you know what you’re actually dealing with?\nWell, Dyson’s microbiology lab has discovered that a person sheds around 28g of dead skin cells every month. And as dust mites feed on flakes of dead skin, they can be found wherever these dead cells accumulate, such as on floor mats, beds, pillows, sofas, cushions and soft toys. That’s the enemy we’re facing.\nThankfully, in the last few decades, technology has helped us clean more efficiently. One game-changer is the Dyson V11 cordless vacuum, which is part of Dyson’s much-loved cord-free range. This version, Dyson’s most powerful one to date, packs some real science. After all, the company has been designing and developing vacuum cleaners for more than 25 years, and for the V11 alone, scientists and engineers at Dyson’s very own labs created more than 32,500 prototyped parts.\nHere are some key ways the Dyson V11 can simplify your everyday cleaning routine.\nSUCKING IT ALL IN\nA common concern when it comes to cordless vacuums is whether they are powerful enough to clean effectively. In other words, is the suction power strong enough to thoroughly clean your house?\nThe Dyson V11 more than meets the challenge. It is powered by a 125,000rpm digital motor, which enables the vacuum to generate optimal force to drive microscopic particles as small as 0.3 microns into its bin.\nTo put this in perspective, the average size of a dust mite is about 250 microns and its faecal matter – a common allergen – can be as small as 10 microns. So, the V11 really packs a punch when it comes to removing these tiny particles effectively.\nTHE POWER TO TRAP THE TINIEST PARTICLES\nNow, let’s talk about cleaning safely. Do you get a tickle in your nose when you use vacuum cleaners? Or struggle not to sneeze when you clear the machine of its content? The mental image of dust zipping through the machine and sneaking out the exhaust is enough to get one’s nose itchy and is part of the reason why some might feel using a vacuum cleaner makes things worse.\nThat won’t be the case with the Dyson V11 – when air leaves the machine, it’s actually cleaner than when it went in.\xa0The vacuum’s cyclone technology allows for fine matter to be sucked up, while the fully sealed filtration system traps 99.97 per cent of particles that are as small as 0.3 microns. We’re talking about particles that are 100 times smaller than the width of an average human hair.\xa0So, from household dust to pet dander, it all gets locked in.\nSMART CLEANING FOR MODERN HOMES\nIt’s not enough to only have superior suction power; a technologically advanced vacuum cleaner must be smart enough to match the homes of today with their customised flooring and textural features.\nFor instance, you might have plush carpets in the living room and teakwood panels in the bedroom. Did you know that different forces and techniques need to be used when cleaning these surfaces in order to achieve the best results whilst also preventing damage?\nWith some vacuum cleaners, you’ll need to figure out the different floor heads to pair with each surface and then change them as you work your way around your home. Thankfully, the Dyson V11 makes it easy with its unique Dynamic Load Sensor (DLS) system.\nWhen it’s operating in Auto Mode, this proprietary system allows the machine to intelligently calibrate suction power to the required surface – using only one cleaner head. For example, when it comes to carpeted floors, the V11 automatically uses a stronger suction power compared to the power expended to clean hardwood surfaces. \xa0This means you’ll get the best performance from the vacuum for every type of surface, while still maximising battery life.\nThe High Torque cleaner head also has a clever mixture of bristles: Stiff nylon bristles dive deep into carpet to remove stubborn dirt, while soft, anti-static carbon fibre filaments capture dust from hard floors and crevices.\nAdditionally, the V11 boasts an array of specialised attachments, making it not only an adaptable appliance but a do-it-all cleaning tool for any specific task. Pet hair on the couch? The powerful mini motorised tool gets rid of it in a cinch. Uneven surfaces like blinds and decorative cornices? The versatile combination tool works like a charm.\nEASE OF USE MEANS EASE OF MIND\nA key advantage of a cordless vaccum lies in its ease of use. In this regard, the Dyson V11 has a raft of functions that makes using it a breeze.\nFor instance, at the start of cleaning duty, you just need to take the Dyson V11 off its charging dock, which can be wall-mounted or free-standing, and you’re ready to get straight to it. \xa0\xa0\nThe upsized nickel-cobalt-aluminum battery in the Dyson V11 grants it longevity while still delivering 20 per cent more suction power compared to its predecessor, the V10. On Eco Mode, you can do up to 60 minutes of floor and general cleaning – more than enough for an average four-room HDB flat.\nThe V11 also comes with a neat LCD screen near the handle to indicate battery levels (while charging) and time left for cleaning using each mode. This feature helps you plan and optimise your cleaning. Additionally, the screen dishes out helpful filter maintenance reminders and blockage alerts to ensure you maintain optimal performance at all times.\nWhen it’s time to clear out the vacuum, Dyson has an innovative twist – a push-to-empty bin function, which means you won’t ever have to come into direct contact with the collected dust. Just direct the exit nozzle at your disposal bin, push a lever and voila, you’ll feel like a bona fide dust buster!\nAll in – strong suction power, ease of use and adaptable cleaning functions – you can see why the Dyson V11 cordless vacuum is the next-generation appliance for smart and effective cleaning.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

You can even throw on a tie for good measure.\nCheck out the project here \nAN INSIDE-OUT PLANT\nGrowing a plant is a no-brainer. You place some seeds into a pot of soil, water it regularly and give it adequate warmth and light. In no time, your seedlings grow into full-grown plants. But what if you didn’t need any soil? And your plant can grow outside its pot?\nTerraplanter seeks to challenge the way we grow our greens. Seeds go onto the Terraplanter’s porous exterior, and water goes inside. The seeds will then soak up as much water as they need and roots develop on the pot’s interior, allowing the plant to grow on the outside of the Terraplanter pot. Interestingly, no soil is needed.\nThe Terraplanter\xa0is one of the most popular projects on Kickstarter at the moment. It has already raised more than S$3 million, far above its original goal of S$28,510.\nCheck out the project here\nA LEVITATING STRESS BALL \nWhenever we’re in need of a stress reliever, we usually turn to a squishy stress ball. Somehow, Flyte, a design company from Latvia, thinks that a levitating sphere could do the trick just as well.\xa0\nThe company has created the Buda Ball, a magnetically levitating sphere that hovers in mid-air. Designed to lower stress levels, the Buda Ball floats and rotates hypnotically in a\xa0magnetic field, creating a soothing visual experience.\nCheck out the project here\nHOME ON\xa0THE MOON \nThis one’s a truly ambitious project. Two Danish space architects, Sebastian Aristotelis and Karl-Johan Sorenson, are designing a lunar home with the vision that in 2024, humans will live on the moon. This Kickstarter campaign will raise funds for the two architects to build the Lunark\xa0Habitat, a simulated moon habitat for research, with the aim that one day it can sustain life on the moon.\nAristotelis and Sorenson will embark on a journey to Northern Greenland, where they will live for three months to build and test the Lunark. While living in solitude, the architects will brace the\xa0-30°C cold, hurricane winds as well as polar bears in order to test their invention.\nCheck out the project here \nTHE BETTER BUTTER DISH\nOften, the best inventions are those you never knew you needed. Ever experienced the lid of your butter dish slipping from your fingers? Have you had nowhere to place your butter knife after using it, except on your countertop?\nThe Brown Inventors have created the Better Butter Dish, a covered butter tray with two vital improvements: A\xa0magnetic knife holder to put your butter knife on, and a handle that will never slip out of your fingers. Sometimes, it’s the simplest of inventions that can change our lives.\nCheck out the project here\nALL-NATURAL AIR PURIFIER\nCurrent air filters are harmful to the environment, as the plastic HEPA filters, which need to be changed often, produce tons of waste. The Briiv air purifier takes getting clean air back to the basics. It uses 100 per cent natural materials\xa0to clean the air we breathe, just as nature intended. It claims to be as powerful as 3,043 medium-sized houseplants and the best part is, you don’t have to water it.\nThe Briiv air purifier utilises the natural micro-structures of moss, coconut, carbon and wool to filter the air. It gets rid of\xa0harmful fine particles, harmful gases, pollen allergens\xa0as well as bacteria and mould spores. It is also\xa096 per cent plastic free,\xa0so\xa0most of the product is completely\xa0recyclable or biodegradable.\nCheck out the project here \n', 'related_topics': ['     Tech ', '     technology ', '     Residences ']}"

      Commentary: Cancer patients are a vulnerable group during COVID-19. But that can be helped
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 Pandemic has gravely impacted the world and has put a major strain on healthcare systems globally.\nThere are almost four million people infected and close to 300,000 who have succumbed to the disease.\xa0\nThe zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highly infectious and spreads quickly. It is responsible for greater adverse events, including a high rate of fatalities, in the older population and specific vulnerable groups.\nOne of these vulnerable groups are the cancer patients. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance.\xa0\nThey may have lower immunity levels due to the underlying malignancy (the presence of a malignant tumour) or anti-cancer therapy and are therefore at a higher risk of developing infections.\n\nCANCER PATIENTS ARE A HIGH-RISK POPULATION\nIncreasing evidence suggests that cancer patients have an elevated risk of COVID-19 infection and are more likely to have higher morbidity and mortality than the general population.\nIn a recent study published in JAMA Oncology covering a total of 1,524 patients with cancer, cancer patients had a two-fold increased risk of COVID-19 infection when compared with the general population.\nThe report by the World Health Organization (WHO)—China Joint Mission on COVID-19 identiﬁed signiﬁcantly higher case fatality amongst patients with pre-existing malignancy at 7.6 per cent compared with patients without comorbid conditions at 1.4 per cent.\nIn a study that was published in Lancet Oncology and looked at the nationwide COVID-19 analysis in China, cancer was associated with higher risk of severe events such as admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation.\nIt also saw a higher incidence of death in seven of 18 patients with cancer – accounting for 39 per cent – when compared to only 8 per cent, or 124 of 1,572 patients, without cancer.\nThese ﬁndings have been corroborated internationally, as an Italian study assessing the case fatality of COVID-19 found that amongst 355 patients who died and underwent detailed chart review, 72 or 20.3 per cent of them had active cancer.\nWhile these analyses are preliminary and require validation from larger international cohorts, several factors could account for an elevated risk for acquiring COVID-19 and consequent complications among\xa0cancer patients, including frequent hospital visits and admissions, immuno-compromised state, advanced age, and poor functional status.\nHEALTHCARE SYSTEMS OVERLOADED\nWhat makes it more complex for patients with pre-existing conditions such as cancer is that the massive rise of COVID-19 infections have caused an overload on the healthcare systems.\nThe available resources have been reallocated to manage the care for infected patients.\nThis has culminated in the need to balance risks and protect patients and health care workers.\nIt is therefore recommended that elective surgeries & non-urgent procedures be deferred. Many oncology clinics have postponed procedures for interventional tissue biopsies such as bronchoscopies & endoscopies.\nThis has resulted in delays for cancer diagnosis and time to treatment. Moreover, most hospital pathology labs have also shifted their focus towards COVID-19 testing and may not have the available resources to undertake comprehensive genomic profiling required for the cancer patients.\nThe diagnosis and timely treatment of cancer patients should not be compromised during an infectious disease pandemic. However, the management of such patients should be tailored according to the best available resources.\nThe necessity of any interventional procedure must be balanced against the increased risk during a pandemic and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to address the urgency of the procedure and the effect on the patient’s outcome if the procedure is to be deferred.\nNEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR CANCER CARE\nDespite that, cancer patients do not have to feel short-changed or at increased risk during this period.\nFirst, liquid biopsies may provide a safer and more efficient alternative to invasive interventional procedures and reduce the need for cancer patients to be hospitalised or to have multiple visits to the clinic.\nThe simple blood draw can be conducted using mobile phlebotomy services and can be undertaken in the comfort of the homes of cancer patients.\xa0\nThis minimises the risk of exposure for the cancer patients to possible COVID-19 hospital acquired infections.\xa0\nThe fast turnaround time of seven days also helps to reduce unnecessary waiting time due to delays in the hospital and can hasten the time to treatment for advanced cancer patients.\nThe results from the comprehensive genomic profiling test helps to guide oncologists with treatment selection decisions and determine the most effective treatment approach for the patient.\nSecond, telemedicine can also be considered to support patients remotely to reduce in-person hospital visits during an infectious pandemic.\nThis may include providing a hospital hotline and expanded telehealth capabilities.\xa0\nTelemedicine has been demonstrated to improve access to care and decrease health care costs.\nExamples of successful telemedicine in oncology include remote chemotherapy supervision, symptom management, survivorship care, palliative care, and clinical trials.\xa0\nPatients who are not currently receiving active therapy may be especially well-suited for telemedicine follow-up.\nMajor limitations to telemedicine include the jurisdictional boundaries of the physicians’ practice, the need for training on telemedicine tools that may be limited in a pandemic setting, the limitations of not having a physical exam, and telemedicine reimbursement-related issues with insurers.\nThese new technologies may provide solutions for cancer diagnosis and cancer care management in the pandemic setting and also have the potential to become the gold standard of care for cancer patients.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated technology adoption in many different industry sectors and the healthcare industry is no different.\nThe responsibility to provide expeditious and accurate cancer diagnosis to cancer patients is a key consideration whether or not there is a pandemic.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nSimranjit Singh is the CEO of Guardant Health for Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA).

      This 35-year-old travel technopreneur is paying you to stay home
  </h1>, 'text': ""In the Rocky film series, the titular hero is a boxer who always gets up and fights on, no matter how many punches his opponent or life throws at him.\nVietnam-born, Singapore-based technopreneur Hai Ho’s turbulent journey with his start-up Triip is similar in this aspect. And as he squares off with the coronavirus pandemic in the latest round, he is determined to remain standing in the ring.\nThe Triip app rewards users in unique TriipMiles (TIIM) currency whenever they complete tasks such as uploading future travel plans and verifying past ones, referring new users and booking experiences. These tokens can then be used to offset the purchase of tours, hotel stays and travel vouchers on the platform. As international travel restrictions and the grounding of airline fleets started becoming the new norm, Triip’s reward system tottered on the brink of irrelevance.\nWhen the World Health Organization held a #BuildforCOVID-19 online hackathon, calling for software solutions centring around seven themes such as health, education, entertainment and community to address the current pandemic, the Triip team came up with the Stay Home Heroes initiative within 72 hours. It eventually emerged as one of 89 winners out of over 1,500 projects.\nUnder the initiative, Triip users earn 1 TIIM (approximately US$0.015; S$0.021) for each day they submit a photo proof of themselves staying home. Since the initiative was launched on April 1, there have been 300 to 400 submissions daily. The company has set aside 15 million TIIM points for this initiative for as long as lockdowns are in place.\n\n\nHo launched Triip in 2014 as a Singapore Tourism Board-licensed operator that offered offbeat tour packages by passionate and experienced locals in different countries. He said: “I saw that if we could enable everyone to be a tour guide, we can improve individual livelihoods. It was also a great way for travellers to experience something new.”\nBut despite receiving US$500,000 funding from Gobi Partners in 2016 and signing on over 10,000 local experts with more than 7,000 tours in over 635 cities and 93 countries, Triip struggled in the first four years to find stable financial footing because of prohibitive marketing and customer-acquisition costs such as buying Facebook and Google ads. The company almost shut down twice and Ho had to sell his home to bootstrap his venture.\nThe business model had to change. So Ho and his team started researching the use of blockchain technology in tourism, where data control is placed in the hands of users, who are paid if they choose to share their travel information.\nHe said: “I saw that big companies like Marriott were spending 30 per cent of their marketing budgets to acquire users and Google and Facebook work so hard to accumulate data. What if we can build a data platform where people can decide whom to sell their data to? In any case, we’ve all been giving away data for free.”\n\n\nA post shared by Triip.me - #earntotravel (@triipme)\nTriip was re-launched as an app in January 2019 and according to Ho, its database has grown to 180,000 within the last 17 months. Most of its users are from Southeast Asia, India and Turkey, with the rest from places such as North America and Russia. Over 100,000 data transactions such as submission of proof of travel and travel plans have taken place, and Triip uses this information to mine new insights for targeted advertising by hotels and other service providers.\nTriip also earns revenue by charging operators a two per cent commission fee for each tour or accommodation booking, while users are charged between 0.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent for each transaction they make.\nAddressing privacy and security concerns, Ho said that a traveller’s personal data such as name, age and contact, as well as sensitive data from the tour provider such as price and quantity of goods bought, are encrypted with public and private keys.\n“User data is stored on a distributed network of 150 random servers that doesn’t belong to us. Data is only shared between the traveller and the tour provider when there’s mutual consent. Unauthorised persons cannot decrypt it and we abide by a trust agreement that we wouldn't sell it.”\xa0\nWhile studying in the Singapore Institute of Management from 2005 to 2008, he built his first 500,000-member community on the now-defunct Yahoo! 360 social networking platform, where he would send out a weekly newsletter with an inspirational story.\nOnce, he shared the Rocky film series to encourage readers to overcome whatever difficulty they were going through that week. The response stunned him. Over 6,000 people replied to Ho saying that it was just the inspiration they needed, including a man who had just been discharged from the hospital for attempted suicide.\n“In that moment I realised the positive impact we can achieve through the Internet and I wanted to use my knowledge as a communication graduate to do that,” Ho shared.\nHo anticipates a vastly different travel landscape emerging in the aftermath of the pandemic. “Only countries with a large domestic travel market will survive. People will opt to go with smaller modes of transport such as cars instead of aeroplanes, and they will prefer to go somewhere that’s just one- to two hours away. Cleanliness will be top priority and hotels will be in competition to be the cleanest.\n“In terms of international travel, I don’t think we will recover in the next two to three years. There will be tighter security at the airports, and more processes such as blood tests to make sure travellers are in the clear before they can enter a country.”\nDespite the sombre predictions, Ho has already made his next business move. Triip recently scored strategic partnerships with online travel agencies Agoda and Booking.com, and became the exclusive digital pass distributor for UNESCO World Heritage site, Hoi An Ancient Town. TIIM tokens can also be used to book hotels and homes by end-May, and tickets to attractions by end-June. Ho is also launching a climate emergency fund this year to support environmental causes.\nThis Rocky is definitely fighting till the end.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Travel ', '     Singapore ', '     technology ', '     Tech ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Commentary: Virtual weddings are such a great idea, they should stay beyond COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: I was invited to no less than six weddings in the first quarter of 2020. Clearly it was a good time to get hitched.\nThe January weddings were still fairly straightforward as Singapore weddings go: in-person solemnisation for the bridal party followed by a celebratory meal with friends and family.\nOne of the weddings I attended, with the groom being a public servant, came with a COVID-19 advisory for under-the-weather guests to leave their FOMO at the door, stay home and rest.\nBy the time the February weddings rolled around, wedding guests were told to arrive early for temperature taking and travel declarations. No full-blown safe distancing measures yet, but that was to come by March and April.\nI watched my niece get married in early April on Instagram Live, with the bridal party itself numbering 10.\nIt didn’t matter that I was half a Singapore away, and that her original plans for a full-on wedding got tapered down to a simple ceremony.\nHer father walked her down a small corridor instead of a church aisle. I teared up—while riding shotgun in the car no less, then sent her an e-hongbao.\nIronic for someone who, no less than three months ago, in another commentary, wrote about my slight disdain for digital red packets.\nI suppose new times call for new ways of being.\nCIRCUIT BREAKER WEDDINGS\nAs Singapore moved into circuit breaker mode, getting married was deemed a non-essential service and couples who had planned to get married in the weeks and months ahead had to unceremoniously figure things out alongside government officials who were trying to pivot hard as well.\nMy youngest sister was due to get married in the middle of April.\xa0\nAt DORSCON yellow, she culled her guest list viciously. By DORSCON orange, she cancelled her wedding dinner, opted for a home-based ceremony with us siblings videoing in to adhere to the 10-person rule.\xa0\nWhen the circuit breaker was announced, she postponed her wedding till the end of May.\nNow with the extension of the circuit breaker announced until June, date-wise, all bets are off.\nOn May 5, Singapore parliament passed a bill that allowed couples the option to get married during the pandemic virtually via live video links.\nAnd both the bride and groom need not even be in the same location to do so, as long as they are both physically in the country. The solemnisation will be conducted in the virtual presence of their witnesses.\nVIRTUAL SOLEMNISATIONS – AN ECONOMIC CHOICE \nI am a traditionalist at heart, but there is a growing part of me that feels that virtual solemnisations and wedding celebrations are a much needed option we never knew we desired.\nAnd maybe it could continue to stay relevant in a post-COVID-19 world as well. After all, experts expect it could be a while before a vaccine materialises.\nWith the coronavirus-hit economy expected to see a long recovery period, it is wise for all of us to also be more financially-prudent, including when it comes to organising weddings. \xa0\nDo you really need that hand-embossed, gold-foiled, heavy art-card wedding invitation?\nThe Wedding Vow, an online industry publication, estimates that on average, weddings in Singapore cost\xa0between S$30,000 to S$50,000 and can skyrocket up to S$100,000 and beyond, depending on how lavish one wants it to be.\xa0\nThat’s a hefty outlay for a single event.\nMedia reports state that in 2018, over 50 per cent of couples interviewed either didn’t think they would incur any debt in organising weddings or thought that their nett outlay would be less than S$10,000.\nAmerican survey-house Student Loan Hero found that a third of couples planning to getting married whom they had surveyed in the US\xa0had plans to borrow up to US$10,000 (S$14,138) to finance their wedding, with another 16 per cent taking on US$10,000 to US$19,999 in debt, while 11 per cent are expecting to borrow US$50,000 or more.\nThe reality is, however, over three-quarters of engaged couples invariably find themselves starting their new lives in the red trying to cover their wedding bills.\nCOSTS OF ATTENDING\nSingapore weddings breed a sort of a vicious spending cycle: The couple picks a fancy wedding package which they assume their red-packet takings will help cover. The guests, conversely, know that and feel\xa0partly obliged to gift, at least, the bare minimum to cover the cost of their meal.\nIt’s a bad habit that people seem to gripe about behind closed doors, in the backseat of taxis or in tongue-in-cheek opinion pieces that decry: Congrats on your six-star hotel wedding, but please don't expect a 6-star hongbao from me.\nIt does not help that bridal magazines publish recommended red-packet rates for guests “so you’ll never have to ask yourself how much you should give or question whether you are giving the ‘right’ amount or not.”\nBecause, clearly, there is a right and wrong amount to give.\nGoing to a wedding at the Grand Hyatt? That will set you back between S$180 to S$230 depending on whether you are invited for lunch or dinner, weekday or weekend.\nGoing to one at the Capella? Your wallet might feel a bigger pinch; you should be gifting between S$190 and S$320, day and meal depending.\nTo make matters worse, each red-packet is named and labelled so that post-dinner, the couple can record for posterity how much—or little—you gave.\nPerhaps, virtual weddings will finally offer some sort of panacea for us all.\nA PRAGMATIC OPTION FOR ALL\nImagine this: Couple opts to get hitched virtually with a small wedding celebration where they can live-stream the events of the day.\nFamily members and close relatives are, perhaps, bound by familial expectations to give large hongbaos but the rest of their friends get to gift as they wish while showering the couples with oodles of likes and happy comments without guests needing to go too far out-of-pocket.\nAnd if you don’t quite fancy sitting through a long wedding that not only started late but also ends way past your bedtime, virtual weddings allow you to politely leave when it best suits you. Or leave for that business call or putting the young one to bed and come back after.\nAnd for those that still need some pizzazz, don’t despair.\nMedia reports state that in India, couples have begun experimenting with online wedding celebrations with some couples opting to do so over Zoom. Shaadi.com, a popular online matrimonial service, has helped coordinate several digital weddings.\nGuests, dressed to the nines, log-in from their homes, bear witness to the marriage and then dine on the same food thanks to a well-coordinated food delivery service.\nFeedback has clearly been positive. The site now plans to build a separate resource for digital nuptials.\nAnd why stop there? In the name of smart tech, venture into the realm of augmented reality, virtual reality or mixed reality for a real futuristic wedding.\nYou can be sitting in your flat in Hougang but getting married in front of the majestic Niagara Falls, on a beach in Bali or in New York’s Central Park.\nIt seems like COVID-19 is not going away any time soon.\nSafe distancing measures, even if whittled down, might be in place for a while more. There may still be caps on big-group events that will hugely impact how we conceptualise large events like weddings.\nThis period gives us pause, amid\xa0the inconveniences and disappointments of not having that fairly-tale wedding, to refocus on what matters in a marriage.\nI guarantee you, when you strip it down; the choice of flowers, or whether you need sharks fin served at your wedding for face sake (you don’t, really) or if you get to take destination wedding photos, will not matter.\nThere will be time, yet, for the nice-to-haves.\nBut there should also always be that option for those who want to only have the essentials. That will be both an economic and pragmatic choice.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nCherie Tseng is Chief Operations Officer at a local fintech company, a mother of three and editor with The Birthday Collective.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     circuit breaker ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: The US could learn a coronavirus lesson or two from China
  </h1>, 'text': 'HONG KONG:\xa0There is nothing like a pandemic to expose systemic differences. For China and the United States, which were locked in an ideological\xa0competition even before the COVID-19 crisis, those differences are stark.\nBut the two countries have at least one thing in common: when this is all over, they will need to rethink their social contracts.\nTo curb virus transmission, China and the US have implemented social-distancing measures, which – together with the unemployment they produce – have broken the cycle of earning and spending that sustains global growth.\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that world GDP will contract by 3 per cent this year. China’s shrank by 6.8 per cent in the first quarter.\nYet the type of public-health measures pursued – and their outcomes – have diverged sharply. China’s tough lockdowns produced a dramatic decline in new cases, whereas America’s delayed and fragmented response allowed infections – and the death toll – to mount.\nThis divergence is often attributed to political differences: Chinese central planning allows for more resolute action.\xa0\nBut this explanation misses the extent to which the US and Chinese growth models have shaped their responses – and the financial and economic effects.\nTHE UNSUSTAINABLE US MODEL\nIn the US, decades of neoliberal policies have led to a dependence on debt-financed consumption. Americans saved little but borrowed a lot.\xa0\nThanks to the “exorbitant privilege” afforded by the US dollar’s position as the leading global reserve currency, so did the government. Fiscal and current-account deficits swelled.\nInflation, however, remained low, even when the US Federal Reserve pursued expansionary policies, largely because of the positive supply shocks produced by the integration of China and other developing countries into the global economy.\nThe Fed is taking that route again during the pandemic, slashing interest rates and expanding its balance sheet by more than US$2.4 trillion in the past six weeks to prevent a systemic liquidity shortage.\xa0\nThe US financial system has also built up excessive leverage, while becoming increasingly disconnected from the real economy. Wall Street firms trade among themselves, rather than serving Main Street. Corporations rely more on capital markets than on banks.\nMoreover, despite advancements in electronic payments, households and small businesses continue to operate mainly in less efficient cash, paper checks, and credit cards. The US Treasury is delivering pandemic stimulus payments through direct deposits and mailed checks.\nTechnology platforms have capitalised on this debt-driven growth model, pushing endless consumption by users – through, say, targeted ads – with less concern for supporting those attempting to generate income online.\xa0\nThe gig economy\xa0exemplifies this one-way dynamic: a platform like Uber is optimised for sales and provides workers with the bare minimum of training and protection, while regulators take a hands-off approach.\nIt has long been clear that the US model is financially, environmentally, and – given skyrocketing inequality – socially unsustainable.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that any disruption of the debt-consumption cycle threatens to trigger collapse almost immediately: as soon as incomes are interrupted, private financial institutions curtail credit, fearing non-performing loans.\nConsumption plummets, depleting incomes further. To stave off disaster, the US Fed and Treasury must step in, shifting credit risks to the public-sector balance sheet.\nCHINESE RESILIENCE\nThe Chinese model avoids many of these pitfalls. Beyond high savings, China has relied on exports and investment, rather than unsustainable levels of domestic consumption, to fuel growth.\nFurthermore, innovative technology platforms – especially in fintech – have linked the traditional economy with a broadly accessible digital ecosystem that encourages users both to consume and to earn, thereby boosting the Chinese economy’s structural and organisational resilience.\nThese are the results not of central planning, but of continuous experimentation on the ground and adaptation based on bottom-up feedback.\nIt was tech platforms, not central planners, that developed inclusive networks that fostered innovation, created new markets, and generated jobs. Regulators merely facilitated it.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has underscored the benefits of this approach. Chinese “super-app” ecosystems create sustainable, circular digital “earn-spend-pay” business models that merge business and consumer functions, far more broad-based than Western models that are still segmented by sectoral regulations.\nDuring lockdown, Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and other marketplaces became a lifeline for many small- and micro-business owners, keeping them connected to millions of domestic and international consumers. Online logistics companies, such as JD.com, were also critical, as they ensured the delivery of essential goods throughout the lockdown.\nTencent’s WeChat, a social media platform, enabled people to stay in touch with their families and friends during the lockdown, while allowing some creative individuals to earn incomes from blogs and vlogs.\nPayments were sent via WeChat Pay. WeChat also enabled the government to relay critical messages to the public, and facilitated the coordination of complex projects, such as the delivery of critical medical equipment and supplies.\xa0\nTencent’s Meeting app allowed schools to continue operating through online classrooms.\nAs lockdowns are eased, software installed in WeChat and Alipay, Alibaba’s online payment platform, is being used to monitor residents’ health and determine where they can go.\xa0\nThis is possible because of these platforms’ reach: One or both of these apps is already installed on nearly every smartphone in China.\nSo, on top of the hierarchical traditional banking system, China has developed a flat, adaptive system connecting 800 million domestic smartphones in productive ways.\nThis is a crucial element of China’s broader hybrid-circular savings-consumption-debt-income model, which is more resilient than the Western model of debt-financed consumption.\nIndeed, it is a major reason why China’s financial sector did not confront severe liquidity shortages that warranted a drastic central-bank response during the economy’s lockdown.\nSTRIKING A BALANCE\nAs China’s development model continues to evolve, it could become a fully circular system that fosters the creation of economic, social, and natural capital, rather than simply consuming it.\xa0\nBut success will depend on the development of a more inclusive post-pandemic social contract – a process that could easily be disrupted by the relentless ideological and geopolitical rivalry with the US.\nYet the US has its own social contract to update, especially by bolstering inclusiveness and resilience.\xa0\nAs with China, the key will be to strike the right balance between large corporations and small firms, individual privacy and big data, and short-term efficiency and long-term risk-management.\nBut, for that to happen, political grandstanding must give way to rational, informed, and inclusive exchanges. Judging by the US response to the COVID-19 crisis that is far from guaranteed.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nAndrew Sheng is Distinguished Fellow of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance.

      Commentary: COVID-19 reveals how low-tech Japan actually is - and has chosen to be
  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO: As Japan has slowly contorted itself into a life of COVID-19 confinement, two books have been fighting for the top spot on Amazon.co.jp.\nOne is the Japanese translation of Albert Camus’ 1947 classic\xa0La Peste, in which the horrors of a cholera outbreak are used to dissect the human condition.\nThe other is a still unreleased, 1,072-page guidebook for the video game\xa0Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The book (hard copy only) will go on sale in late April, about a month after the game itself – a build-your-own-island simulator – emerged to\xa0critical acclaim.\xa0\nThe resurgent popularity of the Camus novel makes grim sense. But so do the huge presales of the\xa0Animal Crossing\xa0guidebook: Japan, despite a high-tech reputation, can be very low-tech in its tastes.\nIn most countries, gamers seeking to crack the secrets of a new release on Nintendo’s WiFi-enabled, state-of-the-art portable console, would head straight to the internet.\nJapan – the country that pioneered the machine – mass-orders a book on which you could break a toe.\nAn isolated example?\nNo, not in a country where large parts of the public and private sectors still insist upon formal communications by fax, where a politician can become the government’s deputy head of cyber security\xa0without ever having used a computer\xa0in his professional life and where the banking system is only now grudgingly prodding its customers towards internet transactions.\nUNPREPARED FOR TELEWORK\nThe strictures imposed by the coronavirus have brought some of these Japanese paradoxes into sharper relief. We currently spend ever longer hours watching the spread of the virus discussed on TV shows that offer a masterclass in the visual techniques of yesteryear.\nDespite the availability of the world’s most sophisticated digital tools, Japanese broadcasters prefer to contextualise current affairs using whiteboards, cardboard models, sponge-tipped pointing sticks and other weapons from the primary-school arsenal.\nAll those choices are absolutely Japan’s prerogative. Where some of them now jar, though, is when they come up against the new reality of the virus and the now unarguable recommendation that people work from home.\nJapan, for various reasons, took its time reaching this conclusion but, even in the twilight weeks before emergency was officially declared and telework became a necessity, it was clear that the country’s low-tech leanings were about to be harshly exposed.\nIn early March, as part of a survey, Japanese IT research group ITR asked the country’s corporations if they had systems that would allow staff to work remotely. 28 per cent said that they did; 27 per cent said they were thinking about it; while the remaining 45 per cent either weren’t even considering it or didn’t know.\nThese figures imply a stubbornness that requires commitment – both practical and ideological.\nAbout the time the ITR report was published, Japan was commemorating the ninth anniversary of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami – a disaster that demonstrated the vulnerability of companies, government and infrastructure and which evinced pledges that lessons would be learnt.\nIn that light, Japan – at a terrible price – was given a decade’s head start on preparing for mass disruption, and the sub-30 per cent telework readiness is disappointing.\nLEGAL ROADBLOCKS\nElements of the problem, though, are baked in at the legal level.\nAlthough parts of the private sector have attempted to reduce this, most official documents still require the physical stamp of a personal or\xa0company seal – the latter of which must mostly remain in the office.\nMany of my Japanese friends – especially now that we are in tax season – say their main reason for breaking work-from-home edicts has been to go in and stamp documents.\xa0\nThe insistence upon physical seals is a waste of time. Company adoption of digital contract and seal technology has been modest.\nBut – to the great consternation of Japan’s professional sealmakers – the coronavirus crisis has now forced the government to take the lead in pressing for a fundamental change of the technological and legal framework behind document authentication.\nFrom a productivity perspective alone, this would be welcome. But the symbolism would perhaps be even more powerful.\nJapan’s relationship with technology has always had some very curious blind spots – often to the silent frustration of the nation that it inconveniences.\nFew may want to admit any silver linings to this crisis but this is at least one contender.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Japan ', '     technology ', '     Myanmar ']}"

These come in a matching Pokeball charging case, so you can feel just like Ash Ketchum carrying a real-life Pokeball around.\nAccording to Nintendo Soup, the earbuds will come with a 13mm driver unit for a booming bass experience. It also supports active noise cancelling, has IPX4-grade water resistance and can be automatically paired via Bluetooth.\nThe earbuds are also reported to come with three hours of usage per charge, which gets extended to a total of 15 hours over five charges when using the Pokeball charger (which you’ll definitely show off while using).\nOf course, there’s a catch: For now, it seems like the earbuds will only be available in China at RMB849 (S$171), so those outside the country will probably have to wait and see if Razer releases these elsewhere.\nThis isn’t the first time that Razer’s teamed up with Nintendo to produce Pokemon and Pikachu-themed accessories.

      Life lessons from Paktor co-founder and social entertainment guru Joseph Phua
  </h1>, 'text': 'In 2012, tech entrepreneur Joseph\xa0Phua was studying for his MBA at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business when dating apps such as Tinder and Coffee Meets Bagel launched in the US. Coincidentally, he had just come out of an eight-year relationship and was looking to widen his social network.\nFascinated with these “technology-enabled dating services”, he decided to try some of them but soon realised “none of them suited my habits and preferences as a single Asian man”.\nSo he chose to build his own platform that catered to the Asian community.\n\n\nAfter completing his studies in 2013, he returned to Singapore and launched location-based dating platform Paktor with his primary school classmate, Ng Jing Shen. Paktor quickly gained traction and now boasts over 20 million users across eight markets in the region.\xa0\nIn 2017, the company acquired Taiwanese hip-hop artist Jeffrey\xa0Huang’s live streaming platform, 17 Media, and formed M17 Entertainment Group, where Phua is CEO. Last November, the Pavilion Capital-backed company acquired live streaming platform MeMe Live. The deal boosted M17’s share of the live streaming market to over 60 per cent.\nHere, Phua discusses the decision behind 17 Media\'s acquisition and the lessons that have influenced his leadership style.\n\n\nTHE BEGINNING OF M17\n“The decision to acquire 17 Media was because its founder Jeffrey Huang and I both aligned in our vision for our companies. We want to radically transform the way social entertainment works as well as ensure our end-users get a lot of value from using our services.\nEssentially, Paktor’s dating services and 17 Media’s live content provide the same solutions to the market: We connect people in real-time and provide them with entertainment.\nUltimately, we want to empower aspiring entrepreneurs to be able to realise their dreams with our suite of social entertainment platforms.”\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF BEING KIND\n“As a kid, I’d follow my mum around as she worked as a kitchenware salesperson. Back then, I didn’t understand why she’d thank people who were rude to her, but what she said still stays with me till today: \'Learn to be a good person before you learn to do business’.""\nLOOKING BEYOND THE DESK\n“I deal with work stress by resting my mind. I’ve also learnt to pull myself out of a situation to look at the bigger picture, and remind myself that [what’s stressing me out] is just one thing in my life. There are many other things that have gone my way to celebrate about.”\nWEIGHING THE FACTS ABOUT THE SITUATION\n“I believe there’s nothing that cannot be done, but you need to consider the costs and consequences at every step. That’s the greatest lesson I’ve learnt as a leader thus far.”\nADVICE FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF ENTREPRENEURS\n“If there\'s one thing I\'d like to share with aspiring entrepreneurs about the entrepreneurial path, it is that it\'s a lifelong journey. Enjoy every step of it and cherish everyone you meet along the way.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     technology ', '     Entertainment ']}"

      6 of the best health and wellness apps to download to your phone
  </h1>, 'text': 'The COVID-19 pandemic may have dramatically altered our social lives and travel plans, but it is certainly not an excuse to let your waistline expand as you languish indoors. After all, there is an abundance of health and wellness apps to set you on the path to achieving your fitness goals, even without needing to step out of your front door.\nStill, we won’t blame you for experiencing decision paralysis when faced with thousands of apps in the app store. To get you started, we narrow it down to six popular and easy-to-use wellness and fitness apps for overall health. It’s time to turn off Netflix for a while and do something good for yourself.\nWORK OUT WITH A CELEBRITY TRAINER: FITON\nExercising at home does not have to be boring. Mix things up by trying a wide variety of workouts, from HIIT (high intensity interval training) and cardio to yoga, pilates and even dance. This app contains a treasure trove of exercise videos you can stream for free.\nThe videos are organised according multiple categories such as target area, type and length of workout and intensity level. For an added boost of good vibes, the sessions are conducted by popular, well-regarded trainers such as Cassey Ho of Blogilates or Hollywood celeb trainer “JJ Dancer” so you won’t have to rely on trial and error to find a good video.\nThe app also offers a comprehensive schedule of live-streamed workouts so you can join other people in working out at the same time. In a time of coronavirus, we say this is the second best thing to going for group fitness classes in a studio.\nEXERCISE FOR AT LEAST SEVEN MINUTES: SEVEN\nIf working out does not appeal to you at all, consider starting with just a seven-minute session. This concept was created by a performance coach and exercise physiologist to allow his time-starved clients to do an effective workout very quickly.\nIt is also appealing to those who don’t like to sweat since it will be over in about just 1.5 songs. However, because the session is so short, it is necessary for participants to go all out at as high an intensity as possible.\nSeven features a wide range of guided workouts that can be done with minimal equipment – you might need a wall or a chair for some movements – so you can do them easily in your living room. For extra motivation, get a few friends to join in as well for some friendly “competition”.\nLEARN TO MEDITATE: WAKING UP\nFrom Headspace to Calm, there are many popular mindfulness and meditation apps to check out. But what sets Waking Up apart from these other apps is that it is created – and curated – by Sam Harris, a neuroscientist, philosopher and New York Times bestselling author, who has spent years studying meditation.\nMany users have found that Harris takes a more in depth approach to meditation compared to most other apps by examining and explaining how this practice impacts the mind. The app includes an introductory course of 10-minute guided sessions narrated by Harris to get newcomers used to his style of meditation, which focuses on the vipassana practice. There is also a 10- or 20-minute meditation, which is refreshed daily.\nNerdy types will also enjoy the mini “lectures” that Harris has uploaded on various mindfulness topics to offer users with additional brain food as they ponder the meaning of life while meditating.\nKEEP TABS ON YOUR DIET: MYFITNESSPAL\nYour health and fitness starts with what you eat, so even if you exercise regularly, it is still important to be aware of your eating habits. Keeping a food diary is a good start. With over 11 million foods and dishes listed in its database, MyFitnessPal is widely regarded as one of the best nutrition apps available and is often recommended by dieticians.\nWe like that the database includes a good selection of local food such as nasi lemak and wanton mee, to make it easier to keep track of your food intake. So whether you have a goal to lose a few pounds or are simply interested in figuring out where your nutritional imbalances are – for instance, are you reaching for the cookie jar too frequently – this is a good way to gain insights into your eating preferences.\nAVOID BINGE DRINKING: DRINKCONTROL\nDrowning your feelings of cabin fever alone at home with a bottle (or two) of wine could lead to overindulgence. While there is nothing wrong with enjoying some tipple, your liver will certainly thank you for drinking in moderation.\nEnter DrinkControl, an easy-to-use app where you can simply key in your alcohol intake in no-brainer quantities such as glasses, bottles or cans. The app will do the rest and alert you when you are going over the limit. It also helpfully does a calorie count of your alcohol consumed – as well as the amount of money you have spent on drinks, because financial health is important too.\nTRACK YOUR SLEEP: PILLOW\nGetting sufficient quality rest is essential for one’s health, but all the distractions that come with living in a city often causes many people to suffer from disrupted sleep. If you would like to track your sleep cycles to figure out the quality of your sleep, Pillow is a nifty app to download.\nIt works best with an Apple watch, where it can automatically track your sleep at various stages such as deep sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) so you are aware of the quality of your zzz time.\nThe app also analyses the data to offer suggestions on your optimal sleep time. By making small adjustments over time, you might just be able to improve your sleep so that you wake up feeling fresher and more well-rested.\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     Fitness ', '     Wellness ', '     Singapore ', '     technology ', '     coronavirus ', '     COVID-19 ', '     Tech ']}"

Birthdays have been celebrated. Funerals have been virtually attended.\n""It\'s really easy to use, and free; that\'s nice,"" said US school teacher Justin Minkel, who instructs students remotely using Zoom. ""Just click a link.""\nHome chaos such as dogs barking or outbursts from siblings can be disruptive, but Minkel cures that by ""muting"" students\' microphones until he needs to hear them.\nAccording to Yuan, the number of people taking part in Zoom meetings daily eclipsed 200 million in March, up from just 10 million at the end of last year.\nVideo calls have surged on all messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Messenger, and Google Hangouts, but Zoom has become a star.\nIt lets as many as 100 people simultaneously attend a video-conference, allowing 40 minutes free and then charging for premium accounts that provide more time and features for $15 monthly.\nZoom lifted the 40-minute limit on free accounts for teachers in an array of countries.\nAmong Zoom settings is an option to chose a backdrop image, such as the Golden Gate Bridge or tropical beach, hiding what is really behind a user.\nZOOMBOMBING\nDigital learning coach Stephanie DeMichele credits the surge in Zoom use to fear of being disconnected from schools, friends, families and others in our lives.\n""And here comes Zoom saying \'It\'s free, available, and you won\'t feel isolated,\'"" said DeMichele. ""So people grabbed onto it.""\nA ""Zoombombing"" phenomenon has sparked warnings about lax security, however.\nVirtual intruders have interrupted religious ceremonies, remote classes, and other Zoom gatherings. In some cases, pornographic images have been displayed.\nUS media has reported that Zoom shares some data with third parties and questioned how well virtual meeting data is defended.\nProsecutors from several US states including Connecticut, New York, and Florida are investigating the company\'s privacy and security practices. The FBI has warned of Zoom sessions being hijacked.\nYuan vowed this week to step up data security, and apologized.\n""We recognise that we have fallen short of the community\'s - and our own - privacy and security expectations,"" Yuan said in a message posted online.\n""For that, I am deeply sorry.""\nZoom was designed primarily for use by large businesses with their own tech teams to provide support and protection, according to Yuan.\n""We did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socialising from home,"" Yuan said.\n""These new, mostly consumer use cases have helped us uncover unforeseen issues with our platform.""\nWhile encouraged that Zoom is admitting it has security problems, it still has ""a ton of work"" to do to fix them and restore trust in the platform, according to Electronic Frontier Foundation associate director of research Gennie Gebhart.\nWhile tending to its immediate concerns, Zoom would be wise to keep on eye on the future, said Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi.\n""Replicating what Zoom has is not too difficult,"" Milanesi said.\n""They need to think about what else they want to be.""\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Zoom ', '     technology ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      From a walking-stick alarm, to VR time travel: How tech can help dementia patients
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: After a long day at work, all Lucy Chan wants to do is to put her feet up when she gets home.\nBut those moments of peace are often interrupted by her mother, Khoo Chwee Lye, whose mind might see-saw between happiness and anger within minutes. That unpredictability has been unnerving.\n“When we have a busy day in the office, and you come home, and all you want to do is to just rest … she starts complaining about past events,” said Chan.\n“It’s not recent, nothing (has) happened, but it’s just that she suddenly recollects not-so-nice memories, and then she’d start talking and crying. I think those days are very frustrating.”\nChan has to diffuse tensions at home almost weekly now because of her 76-year-old mother’s mood swings, six years after the latter was diagnosed with dementia.\nOnce independent and capable of having an active lifestyle, Khoo can no longer live alone — her daughter, son-in-law, four grandsons and a helper take turns to care for her.\nIn Singapore, dementia affects one in 10 people aged 60 years and above. This amounts to an estimated 82,000 people, a number set to rise beyond 100,000 by 2030.\nWhile most types of dementia cannot be cured, some of the symptoms can be managed. And with technology, caring for dementia patients can be made a little easier. The series Gadg(AID) looks at six ways of doing so. (Watch this episode here.)\n1. USING VIRTUAL REALITY TO UNDERSTAND DEMENTIA\nMany carers, even the professionals, tell Alzheimer's Disease Association (ADA) senior programme coordinator Joanne Loy: “I don’t know what the dementia (sufferer) is thinking about (or) looking at.”\nShe has spent five years trying to bridge this gap. And it was only last year that the ADA introduced a virtual reality (VR) experience so carers could see the world through the eyes of a person living with dementia.\nParticipants put on a pair of VR goggles and take on the perspective of Edie, a person with dementia. The goal is to make one’s way through the house to the bathroom.\nChan even heard a hissing sound around her while using this tool. “It’s actually (their) delusions,” explained Loy. “They’re most of the time very sensitive to noise. Certain volumes are normal to us, but to them are considered as high-pitched.”\nAlso, the patterns on the VR wallpaper looked as if they were pulsating.\nRegarding this, Loy said some dementia patients may have suffered damage to the occipital lobes, which process and interpret everything one sees. “As a result, they might feel very groggy,” she added.\nThe experience offered Chan what she thought was a “good” perspective to the world of dementia patients like her mother.\n2. A WALKING STICK GETS SMART\nMood swings aside, Khoo also struggles with mobility issues. “She likes to go downstairs ... and she doesn’t want to carry a stick. She doesn’t want people to know she needs that,” said her daughter.\nFalling is not uncommon among dementia sufferers, many of whom report bouts of dizziness.\nBut seniors like her often see the walking stick as a symbol of shame. It is no surprise to Tan Lee Tuan, the founder of start-up Bekind Solutions, that some of them choose to wander around without one.\nSo he turned the walking stick into an accessory with a number of functions, including as a torch, an umbrella and an alarm that is activated if the user falls.\n“(The) umbrella is a very natural way to camouflage a walking stick. Because in Singapore, it rains all the time, and it’s quite normal to carry an umbrella,” he said.\nHis invention, which took three years to develop, also has an in-built radio and MP3 functions. “There’s a lot of research about how music therapy can help to slow down the rate of dementia,” he cited.\nWhen he first brought his smart cane to Khoo, she was not sold on the idea. “If I use this downstairs, everyone would stare at me. It’s not raining — why carry an umbrella?” she questioned.\nA week later, however, she seemed happy with her new accessory and even used it when she went to church.\n“Nice to use! If not ... (would) I still go and walk every day?” she said. “My legs are weak, so I need this. If not, I can’t walk much.”\n3. ANOTHER DEVICE TO DETECT FALLS MAY BE NEXT\nAt home, a webcam monitor’s Khoo’s movements. But it offers a restricted view and cannot be installed where privacy is needed. So it does not allay Chan’s fear of her mother falling and getting hurt.\nA solution here may be found in SoundEye, which uses artificial intelligence to isolate and analyse the sounds a person would make in an emergency.\nWith its deep-learning sound recognition technology, the device can recognise abnormal sounds like screams, coughs and groans, said inventor Tan Yeow Kee. When those sounds are picked up, a sensor triggers an alert to the carer.\nThe device also has a motion sensor to detect whether a person is moving. “If you place this inside the washroom, for example, if the person ... isn’t moving inside the washroom, we can detect that,” said Tan.\nThis device would be helpful to someone like Khoo and her family. But for now, it remains a work in progress.\nWATCH: Going from the past into the present (46:18)\n4. STIMULATING THE BRAIN WITH PICTURES AND SOUND\nThe frustration of forgetting, coupled with audio and visual distortions, can stress dementia sufferers like Khoo.\nHer grandson Samuel Law, who recently graduated with a diploma in psychological studies, was inspired to do a project about reminiscence therapy because of what she was going through.\nReminiscence therapy works by reviving long-lost memories for those with dementia, and the science behind it is essentially about stimulating parts of the brain that control long-term memory.\nLaw said carers of dementia patients can show them pictures and items from their past, including clothes they used to wear, to help them remember things and boost their memory.\nNot only can this help them to feel some joy revisiting happy memories, it can also help to reduce their stress, agitation and frustration.\nLaw’s reminiscence tool kit requires someone to interact with Khoo, but that is not always practical, given that her family members are either at work or in school for most of the week.\nAs a solution, Gadg(AID) host Preston Lim showed the family a reminiscence therapy book, which they could insert photographs in and even use to record audio messages for her.\nSaid Lim: “When your mum … hears the message that you or someone else has recorded for her and (is) associated with this specific memory, hopefully this will ... help her remember things from the past.”\nChan felt that the book would be helpful, as her mother likes to flip through photo albums at home. “Maybe she’s thinking of the past,” she said.\n5. USING VIRTUAL REALITY TO TRIGGER MEMORIES\nReminiscence therapy did brighten the mood in the household and staved off some of Khoo’s mood swings.\nTo take it a step further, Gadg(AID) asked Eugene Soh, the founder of Dude Studios, to “transport” her to the place she once loved: Chinatown.\nSoh runs a social enterprise that makes VR recreations of places that the infirm or those with disabilities wish to see but can never reach.\n“We make VR scapes for people with dementia,” he said. “This is the first time we shot one specifically for her (Khoo), but this same scene can be used for anyone else who has been to that same place.”\nWhen he used VR to let her experience walking along the streets of Chinatown again, she could recognise buildings there. “When we use reminiscence therapy for VR, it’s immersing them in that space,” added Soh.\n“The effect would be 10 times because it’s immersed. It’s all around them instead of (them) looking at a picture, a video or looking at nostalgic objects that are from the past.”\nKhoo even recalled having raw fish porridge and shopping with her friends in Chinatown. Her daughter thought this was helpful therapy, as it triggered some memories her mother had not shared with the family before.\n6. SETTING THE MOOD WITH MUSIC\nResearch has shown that in dementia patients, the parts of the brain that stay intact are associated with music.\nEven if they forget many things, “the last thing they forget is music”, agreed Michelle Lee, the founder of social enterprise I’m Soul Inc, which uses technology to enable people to make music for their mind, body and soul.\n“It’s in your primal brain ... so you remember songs from long, long ago,” she said. “To get back that lucidity, you find songs that resonate ... and then bring back that memory.”\nOne of the devices she uses is Soundbeam, whose ultrasonic sensors translate body movement into music.\nAt first, Khoo look unengaged and sceptical when she saw the device. But once she heard her favourite song, Ye Lai Xiang, she started to warm to it, singing and humming happily.\nLaw, her eldest grandson, thinks this type of music therapy can bring communities and families together, not only with the elderly but also those with special needs.\n“This week has been a downer for her. And she’s complaining about quite a few things ... but today (it’s the) opposite. She’s so happy,” he observed.\nAdded Lee: “Once you have the social engagement, those things about loneliness (and) depression kind of go away … So there’s hope.”\nWatch this episode of Gadg(AID) here.

Patient identifiers are not used in the symptom checker, but data collected give an overview of the different types of patients who are worried about COVID-19 and who use the site.\n""These yield insights on important predictors of health-seeking behaviour and drive better healthcare resources allocation,"" said the authorities in a fact sheet about the tool.\xa0\n""It also gives insights into where the needs are and what people are most concerned about, which helps MOH with patient education and communications efforts.""\nThe tool was developed after statistics from the Ministry of Health (MOH) showed 24 per cent of COVID-19 patients in Singapore had been consulting multiple doctors in a short period of time (""doctor-hopping"").\nTeams from NCID, NUHS, and the National University of Singapore provided the clinical advice for the\xa0platform.\xa0\nIts usability was then validated by a team led by Dr Franco Wong, head of Jurong Polyclinic.\nThere are plans to expand the scope of the checker to include more features such as pre-registration for consultations at clinics or access to telemedicine providers, said the joint release.\nOther planned features include information on waiting times at emergency departments, directly linking those who need testing to appropriate healthcare facilities and a heatmap on COVID-19 infections clusters.\nInformation about how people are using the tool can also be used to track the behaviour of the virus, said Dr Praveen Deorani, a\xa0data scientist at MOHT.\n""With more people using the checker, and with our subsequent analysis of how it is being used, we can then use machine learning techniques to track the behaviour of the virus (and the symptoms it manifests) so the patient can elect the right locus of treatment at the right time,"" he said.\nThe symptom checker can also be found on MOH\'s website under COVID-19 Resources and on MOH\'s HealthHub.\nSingapore has been coming up with various technology-based solutions to fight the pandemic.\nLast month, the authorities launched a mobile application called TraceTogether, which seeks to boost the contact tracing process.\xa0\nA total of 1,049 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Singapore as of Thursday.\xa0\nOn Friday the country reported its fifth\xa0death related to the disease, an 86-year-old Singaporean woman with no recent travel history\xa0to affected countries and regions.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     health ', '     technology ']}"

      Nextdoor, the network for neighbors, grows in age of social distancing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SAN FRANCISCO:\xa0There are offers to pick up groceries or medicine for neighbors, to share supplies, or walk people\'s dogs -\xa0and even intel on where to find scarce items like toilet paper.\nFor people forced to stay home to ride out the COVID-19 pandemic, Nextdoor, a hyperlocal social network, has found itself playing an increasingly important role.\nDaily usage of the network -\xa0an ad-supported privately held start-up which touts itself as a a local alternative to Facebook - soared 80 per cent in March as people looked to connect more with neighbors.\n""What we are seeing is proximity matters more than anything right now,"" Nextdoor chief executive Sarah Friar told AFP.\n""There is a real need in our lives for people who live close by.""\nNextdoor is free. The only caveat is that users must verify who they are and live in the real-world location that comports with the boundaries of the online neighborhood network they wish to join.\nLaunched in late 2011 as a variation on town squares where people could get to know neighbors and catch up on local news, San Francisco-based Nextdoor now boasts 260,000 neighborhoods across 11 countries including Australia, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, and the US.\n""I am really touched by the amount of community spiritedness; people helping out, shopping for one another,"" said Nextdoor user Paulina Borsook.\nBorsook lives on a hill overlooking Monterey Bay on the edge of Silicon Valley, and is among those grappling with not venturing outside because their age makes it risky in a time of coronavirus.\n""I am used to getting lemons from neighbors, but relying on them for groceries is much different,"" she said.\nHELP MAP\nEarlier this month, Nextdoor launched an interactive ""help map"" which lets people indicate how they are able to help with chores, errands or other needs.\n""Happy to do any errands that don\'t require heavy lifting,"" one user in the suburbs of the US capital wrote. ""I\'m a fantastic grocery shopper too!""\nNextdoor users share word of which restaurants have take-away food, what precautions are in place at local markets - and even ideas to soothe one another at a stressful time.\n""I will be putting our Christmas lights back up tomorrow to add some cheer back to the neighborhood,"" read a Nextdoor post in a Santa Cruz county community.\n""They aren\'t super elaborate, but I think it will give us all something beautiful to look at night while walking. Please join me.""\nNextdoor is also being used as a platform to support local businesses; collect donations for food banks, and connect parents dealing with educating children at home because schools are closed.\n""There is genuine isolation, loneliness, but there is also kindness kicking in,"" Friar said.\n""Usage is off the charts at the moment.""\nNEARBY NEWS\nNextdoor has long collaborated with agencies and governments to connect with local citizens, positioning it as a hub for local news and resources. It has been used in the past by the US Census Bureau and Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nNow, the California governor\'s office is using the social network to provide neighborhood-specific updates about what the state knows and is doing regarding COVID-19.\n""I find it really valuable for hyperlocal news,"" Borsook said of Nextdoor, adding that neighbours are posting information ""I am not getting anywhere else.""\nWhile Nextdoor watches for misinformation or scams, it benefits from being based on verifying that those who join the social network are who they say they are and live where they say they do.\n""The underpinnings are strong from a trust perspective,"" Friar said.\n""When people post, they post with real names so you have more accountability.""\nNeighbors can report dubious content to the social network while also directly challenging it in the online community.\n""If you post something nonsensical, people will call you out on it,"" Borsook said.\n""There is more a sense of \'we are all in this together.\'""\nLike Facebook, Nextdoor has seen advertising dip due to the economic disruption of sheltering-in-place, but it is also catching the eyes of restaurants, health care facilities, insurers and other businesses adapting to the crisis.\n""We do, clearly, have advertisers on the platform that have pulled back,"" Friar said.\n""On the other side, we are seeing companies lean in that didn\'t know us before and want to be there in this moment.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     social media ', '     technology ']}"

      How technology gives my son hope with his autism
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Lee Jun Le is 13 years old and, many times, finds it difficult to convey how he feels or express what he means to say.\nHe can also have sudden, unexplained meltdowns, which often confound his parents. “When there’s a meltdown, he can’t tell us why he’s upset. Sometimes he’d cry for no reason,” said his mother Lim Hwee Hwee. “So we have to guess.”\nHe has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). And even a change in his routine, such as going to the supermarket without giving him prior notice, can overwhelm him with feelings of frustration.\nHis parents often end up apologising to others and saying he behaved the way he did because he is a special needs child. “We call ourselves the sorry, sorry parents. Sorry, sorry, sorry,” dad Bob Lee said half-jokingly.\nJun Le is often a boy misunderstood. But technology can make life a little easier for persons like him on the autism spectrum and for their caregivers too. The series Gadg(AID) looks at three ways in which technology can help. (Watch this episode here.)\n1. USING VIRTUAL REALITY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CONDITION\nThose with ASD often experience the world differently from most people. And that is where virtual reality (VR) technology comes in.\nThe National Autistic Society in the United Kingdom created a VR film called Too Much Information, to give people a better idea of how those with autism feel when they experience a sensory overload.\nThe film contains lots of bright colours, flashing lights and loud, sudden noises to transport people to a different world.\nNational Autistic Society’s autism access specialist Chris Pike said: “It could be much easier to understand why an autistic person might be behaving in the way they are.”\nFor example, the light on a television screen can feel more intense for one with ASD than it is for someone else. Even the smell of perfume can be overwhelming.\nAfter Jun Le’s parents watched the VR film, Lee said it served as a reminder of why their son sometimes has meltdowns, and how they sometimes forget that persons with autism are sensitive to certain things.\nFor example, Jun Le sometimes covers his ears in busy shopping centres, as he is sensitive to high-pitched and low-pitched noises. Said Lee: “Sometimes we forget about … other things, other triggers (that) maybe we missed.”\n2. SIMULATING REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS\nStreet sounds can also cause Jun Le to have a meltdown, which his parents have seen in the past year in their attempts to teach him to travel independently.\nOne of the things they get him to practise is to cross the road safely at traffic junctions. But he has no sense of danger and can easily be distracted.\nAt Tech Able in\xa0the Enabling Village, a simulator called the iMirror lets people with special needs rehearse these real-life scenarios.\nThis interactive software, which is equipped with motion sensors and uses VR technology, can help to teach basic travelling skills to those with disabilities, including how to top an ez-link card up and how to cross the road.\n“It simulates the local environment, and it helps them to get used to the environment in a safe place,” said SG Enable head of technology catalyst Alvin Tan.\nWhen Jun Le tried this assistive technology, he was coached by his former occupational therapist New Wei Ling. He managed to complete the tasks with ease.\nWATCH: What's the future for our autistic son? (6:35)\nThe senior occupational therapist with TLC Speech Clinic said that in a real situation, individuals with autism can be overwhelmed by the sensory information from the surroundings.\n“The benefit of being able to learn in a controlled environment is … we can help them to learn the fundamentals first, for example the safety aspect (of crossing the road),” she said.\n3. LEARNING CODING SKILLS WITH A ROBOTIC BALL\nIn school, Jun Le gets only an hour of information technology lessons each week. He learns Scratch, a programming language.\nSome people with ASD excel in programming, as they think highly logically, in a literal step-by-step manner. And they enjoy the predictability of code, where every action is a result of a command.\nIn Australia, a high school for children with autism has found a device called Sphero to help its students learn better.\nThis programmable robot ball can roll around, light up and make sounds. It is remotely controlled via a smartphone or tablet, and its behaviour can also be pre-programmed using code.\nCraig Smith, a school co-ordinator for Autism Spectrum Australia, said that with Sphero, students can learn coding outside the classroom and not be stuck in front of a computer.\nThere are also similarities between the language of coding and the way students on the autism spectrum are taught, he pointed out.\n“We might say, ‘Here’s what you need to put on to get dressed before you go to school.’ And the sort of sequence … is very similar to the sort of sequences that you’d use in coding,” he said.\nThat is similar to the specific, step-by-step instructions Jun Le’s parents give him before he performs any task, including using the toilet.\nComputhink founder David Lee, who specialises in teaching coding to children, has coached kids with ASD. And in two sessions, he taught Jun Le to control the Sphero using simple codes.\nHe observed that the boy seemed to enjoy the sessions and could programme the robot to move in a straight line as well as in the shape of a square.\nAnd what might start out as play-based, fun activities could make a viable career in future.\n“(Jun Le) is able to follow instructions very well. So we can take a look at (job) roles that require these skills, like testing,” said Computhink’s Lee.\n“The tester would look at the test script, and he’d tick (it off) step by step and make sure that the programmes are supposed to work exactly as (they’re) coded.”\nWatch this episode of Gadg(AID) here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Singapore launches TraceTogether mobile app to boost COVID-19 contact tracing efforts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A new mobile application called TraceTogether\xa0was launched on Friday (Mar 20) to support ongoing contact tracing efforts amid the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore.\nBy downloading the app and consenting to participate in it, TraceTogether allows users to ""proactively help"" in the contact tracing process, according to a joint press release.\nThe TraceTogether app, which was developed by the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) in collaboration with MOH over the past eight weeks, can be downloaded by anyone with a Singapore mobile number and a Bluetooth-enabled smartphone.\nAfter giving consent during the set-up of the app, users will need to turn on their Bluetooth, as well as enable push notifications and location permissions.\nThe app works by exchanging short-distance Bluetooth signals between phones to detect other users of the app who are in close proximity.\xa0Current MOH guidelines define close proximity as two metres apart, or up to five metres, for 30 minutes.\nRecords of these encounters will be stored locally in the users’ phones and will not be sent to the authorities.\nUsers will only be asked to share these records when contacted by MOH as part of contact tracing investigations.\xa0If they refuse, they may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.\nCurrently, contact tracing relies on the memory of interviewees. However, there have been instances when interviewees could not remember all their contacts or did not have information about people they had been in contact with.\nThe new app will not replace ongoing contact tracing efforts, but it will facilitate the process, enabling contact tracers to inform users who are close contacts of COVID-19 cases ""more quickly"".\nDr Janil Puthucheary, Minister-in-charge of GovTech, said: ""The process of contact tracing starts with a recall … and that is the only thing that this app intervenes with. It means that poor memory will no longer slow down the process of contact tracing.”\n""In contact tracing process, time matters,” he added, noting that contact tracing remains a key part of the country’s strategy to limit local transmission of COVID-19 and this app will augment the speed at which that occurs.\n“The faster the contact tracing process can be initiated and can identify the people at risk, the faster we can intervene and impose quarantine if necessary and limit spread locally,"" he told reporters at a press conference\xa0on Friday.\nFor a start, authorities hope to use the app to establish 25 per cent to 50 per cent of these close contacts.\n“This enables users to take the necessary action sooner, such as monitoring his own health closely for signs of flu-like symptoms. Early detection could potentially help reduce the risk of the spread of the virus, and better protect our families and loved ones,” the release added.\xa0\nThe Smart Nation and Digital Government Group will be working with the public and private sectors to raise awareness of the app and encourage its adoption.\nSpeaking at the same press conference, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said: ""This app is very important and we encourage Singaporeans to download it\xa0and help us with contact tracing.\n""If we are able to be even more effective in contact tracing, then we can be more effective in reducing the risk of local transmission.""\nPRIVACY SAFEGUARDS\nThe authorities stressed that the use of the app is voluntary and that users have to give ""explicit consent"" to participate in TraceTogether.\nThis consent can be withdrawn anytime, according to\xa0GovTech.\nThe app also has several layers of security and privacy safeguards in place. For example, users will submit only their mobile numbers after downloading the app. Each phone will then be assigned a user ID.\xa0\nThis user ID is then used to generate\xa0temporary IDs\xa0at regular intervals. It is this temporary ID that is exchanged between the phones of TraceTogether users.\nSuch regular generation of temporary IDs protect users from eavesdropping and tracking overtime by malicious actors, according to GovTech.\nNo other personal detail, such as names, will be collected. Neither does the app\xa0access a user’s phone contact list or address book.\xa0\nThe app also does not collect or use location data of any kind, such as GPS.\xa0\n""The app doesn\'t identify \'where\' the exposure to COVID-19 cases may have occurred. It only seeks to establish \'who\' else might have been exposed to the virus,"" according\xa0to the TraceTogether\xa0website.\nThis means that\xa0location information can only be established by contact tracers during verbal interviews, it added.\nAll TraceTogether logs will be stored locally on the users’ phone in an encrypted form.\n“The logs do not contain the user’s phone numbers but a set of cryptographically generated temporary IDs,” the joint press release said.\n“The logs leave his or her phone only when he or she uses the app to send the information to authorities to facilitate contact tracing,” it added.\nEven then, the authorities, including MOH and GovTech, have no knowledge of the user’s data as these logs are only deciphered and analysed after the user sends the information.\nOther safeguards include how the app will only be active during diseasee outbreaks. For instance after contact tracing ceases, the app will prompt users to deactivate its functionality.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     health ', '     technology ', '     Ministry of Health ', '     GovTech ']}"

      Is technology up to helping the disabled with problems of daily living?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Every day, Tamimi Pohan battles to do things we think nothing of, like going to the toilet on his own.\nEven the act of switching on the light at home is nigh impossible, as the switch is too high for him to reach. Having brittle bone disease means this 14-year-old must rely on a wheelchair for his daily activities.\nHis mother, Sarina Siregar, wishes he could be like any normal teenager. “I want him to be enjoying himself … like I see (with) other children,” she said.\nMore than anything, he wishes to be more independent. “I’ve thought of independence, but achieving it is quite far away,” he said.\nTechnology may have some solutions, the series Gadg(AID) discovers. Here are seven areas where existing technology, meant to bring convenience to the masses, could be tailored to bring independence to persons with physical disabilities, like Tamimi. (Watch it here.)\nWATCH: Google Home changed my life: 14-year-old with brittle bone disease (5:47)\n1. CAN’T SWITCH ON LIGHTS AND FANS WITHOUT HELP\nBecause of his condition, Tamimi sleeps in his parents’ room. He needs them or his helper to carry him onto his wheelchair. And he needs help with activities like switching on the lights and the fan.\nThe advent of voice-enabled technology, however, has opened up new possibilities for him in terms of accessibility.\nGadg(AID) enlisted the help of Cheryl Chiang, co-founder of smart home solutions provider Home-A-Genius, to fit his home out with voice-control devices and smart switches.\nThe firm also upgraded his iPad so that he could control the fan, the light switches and even adjust the brightness and colour of the lights.\n“Now you don’t need to scramble for the remote control any more,” Chiang told him. “You can use your voice. You can use the app to control the devices in your house.”\nShe also automated the living room curtains so that he will be able to open or close them by shaking a smart cube controller.\n“Every morning, I can switch on the lights by myself, and I can also switch the fan on and off,” he said. “It makes me feel independent.”\n2. FLYING IS CHALLENGING\nTamimi previously spent four months creating artworks of his home, to show the public what life with his condition is like.\nHe was invited to showcase them in an exhibition in Bali, but travelling overseas for him is pretty daunting as a wheelchair user.\nTo help him, Gadg(AID) asked Eugene Soh, the founder of Dude Studios, to “transport” Tamimi to the exhibition by using virtual reality (VR) technology.\nThis creative tech studio has used VR to enable nursing home residents to explore the Great Wall of China.\nFor Tamimi, Soh flew to Bali to film a VR experience of the exhibition and even captured the way attendees responded to his works. Tamimi was able to view this with a pair of VR goggles.\nHe was entranced as he saw and heard the people commenting on his drawings.\n“It helps me make it more realistic, and it makes me feel like I’m actually there,” he said. “My favourite part was the encouraging comments … It motivates me to do more artworks.”\n3. DIFFICULTY REACHING FOR THINGS IN THE FRIDGE\nParalympian Yip Pin Xiu, who suffers from muscular dystrophy, or more specifically Charcot-Marie-Tooth — a disease that results in muscle weakness and atrophy — also lives with her family.\nShe reckons that when she moves out in future, she will face challenges using the kitchen and cooking her meals. For example, reaching for items high up in the fridge can be a struggle, since she is on a wheelchair.\nThe good news is that in recent years, manufacturers have made smart kitchens whereby appliances can be controlled remotely.\nA smart fridge would allow her to see what is inside using a mobile app, instead of her having to go to the kitchen.\nBut some limitations remain. “I’ll only be able to use half the fridge because anything higher, I won’t be able to reach it,” she said.\n4. HAVING TROUBLE TURNING THE OVEN KNOBS\nYip also lacks fine motor skills, so tasks that require a certain dexterity, like buttoning clothes, tying her hair and turning the knobs on an oven, are hard.\nThere are smart ovens, however, which Pin Xiu can control from her smartphone, allowing her to preheat, regulate and switch off the oven remotely.\nSo she need not fiddle with the knobs or enter and exit the kitchen multiple times during the cooking process. But even with these smart equipment, she still needs help with things like washing and chopping ingredients.\n5. CAN’T GRIP HEAVY ITEMS\nYip often has problems gripping heavy or hot items. But a robotic glove could help her with her grip.\nThe EsoGlove was invented by local company Roceso Technologies to help stroke patients regain their grip strength during physical rehabilitation. It detects muscle signals and guides patients to move their fingers.\nWith the EsoGlove, she was able to hold a tumbler with one hand instead of two, which she usually uses.\nWhile the EsoGlove is primarily used for therapy purposes, there are plans to develop a portable assistive glove more suitable for fine auto movements and daily use, said Roceso Technologies chief executive officer Jane Wang.\n6. NOT ALL PAVEMENTS ARE WHEELCHAIR-FRIENDLY\nAnother problem Yip faces is that Singapore’s paths and streets can be challenging to navigate because of obstacles such as kerbs and uneven terrain. Some pavements are also too narrow for wheelchairs.\n“One problem that I have with a newer place is that sometimes I go in with a lot of apprehension. I don’t know what I’m going to face,” she related.\nTo help wheelchair users like her, the tech project SmartBFA, or Smart Barrier Free Access, is developing a route-planning app that can locate barrier-free routes in Singapore.\nThe app uses colours to indicate pavement quality: Green for a smooth path; orange for an uneven one; and red for a bumpy ride.\nAfter trying it out, Yip liked the idea of having such information on one’s smartphone and knowing which routes to take.\nShe thinks the app will be useful in encouraging people with disabilities to go out more often and explore more of Singapore.\n“There’s still a bit of limitation in it. The general areas near the roads are well mapped … (but) I hope to see in future (more accessibility data on) the smaller routes, like inside the housing estates,” she said.\n7. FEW SCHOOLS EQUIPPED WITH SMART TECHNOLOGY\nOccupational therapist Manju Mohta at the Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore (CPAS) said any technology that “reduces manual effort” will benefit people with disabilities more than the able-bodied.\nBut only a few of Singapore’s 19 special education schools are equipped with some form of smart home technology.\nSo part of her job is to find technology that helps those with little control over their physical movement to triumph over their limitations.\nOne of her ideas for the CPAS School was a smart kitchen where students can work the lights and fans with their voice. With a limited budget of S$3,000, the kitchen was all the school could afford to fit out.\nAssistive technology for people with disabilities can be expensive, but there are subsidies in Singapore. And Mohta is hoping to bring more change.\n“They might not achieve 100 per cent independence, but when we see the shift from 100 per cent dependent to 30 per cent independent, they’re quite happy,” she said.\nWatch this episode here. Gadg(AID) is telecast on Mondays at 9pm.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Facebook and other tech companies need to be regulated like the tobacco industry, warned Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who exposed the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\nThe data scientist revealed how he helped the disgraced company, founded by Donald Trump\'s former right-hand man Steve Bannon, to use unauthorised personal data harvested from Facebook to help swing a string of elections, including Trump\'s US presidential win in 2016.\nDespite Facebook being fined a record US$5 billion (S$6.9 billion) in the US last year for ""deceiving"" users about keeping their information safe, Wylie said the world has yet to wake up to the consequences of the scandal.\n""If we want to prevent another Cambridge Analytica from happening ... that starts with regulating big tech beyond just data protection issues, but also looking at whether or not we want as a society to tolerate manipulative design,"" he insisted.\nWylie details in his book how personality profiles mined from Facebook were weaponised to ""radicalise"" individuals through psychographic profiling and targeting techniques.\nTOO POWERFUL\nSo great is their potential power over society and people\'s lives, that tech professionals need to be subject to the same codes of ethics as doctors and lawyers, he told AFP as his book was published in France.\n""Profiling work that we were doing to look at who was most vulnerable to being radicalised ... was used to identify people in the US who were susceptible to radicalisation so that they could be encouraged and catalysed on that path,"" he said.\n""You are being intentionally monitored so that your unique biases, your anxieties, your weaknesses, your needs, your desires can be quantified in such a way that a company can seek to exploit that for profit,"" said the 30-year-old.\nWylie, who blew the whistle to British newspaper,\xa0The Guardian, in Mar 2018, said at least people now realise how powerful data can be.\n""We are now talking about it, whereas before we weren\'t. For a long time I think journalists and society at large really did drink that Kool-Aid.""\n""COLONIALISM 2.0""\n""They bought the message that the tech industry is good and they can do no wrong. What we\'re now seeing is that big tech is just like any other industry. When push comes to shove, when it affects profit, they make decisions just like an oil or tobacco company would,"" he added.\nWhich is why regulation is urgent, argued Canadian-born Wylie.\nHe made the comparison with the construction industry, which must conform to a plethora of norms and standards, whereas in the digital world the individual is left to protect themselves from a whole array of risks they cannot possibly hope to understand.\n""Facebook is an architecture, it is a construction, it is a product of engineering. And just like any other highly-technical sector, whether it\'s aerospace, automobiles, energy or biotech, there are rules in place that regulate.""\nWylie also compared the ""feeling of outrage that I think a lot of Americans are feeling"" to what ""voters in Africa or in a lot of South Asian countries"" have suffered for decades at the hands of big corporations of their former colonial masters.\n""There would be large businesses, or indeed countries, that would hire firms to influence elections.

      Tech lifestyles enable 'safe escape' from COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': '\n\nSAN FRANCISCO: For people hunkering down due to the COVID-19\xa0epidemic, the tech sector has become their new best friend with an array of lifestyle solutions making ""social distancing"" easier.\nThose wanting to avoid crowds can have meals delivered from restaurants, stream blockbuster films, socialise online with friends, and work remotely.\nThe latest tech-inspired lifestyle solutions are gaining traction as more people are advised to work from home, and many conferences and gatherings are cancelled. Anyone with an internet connection can use Amazon or e-commerce rivals to deliver provisions from groceries to toilet paper and over-the-counter medicine.\n""We can have anything and everything delivered to our homes including hard and soft goods, doctor visits, laundry services, and even pet services,"" said Moor Insights and Strategy principal analyst Patrick Moorhead.\n""The irony is that many of the items criticized about technology have become a \'safe\' place to escape to in the wake of coronavirus.""\nCHECKING ON MOM\nCreative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi has been checking in daily with her mother, who lives close to Milan in a part of Italy hit by coronavirus cases and has kept to her home.\nVideo calling services like FaceTime have also helped with virtual doctor visits - or telemedicine - so patients can consult with physicians online and avoid visits to hospitals, she noted.\nMilanesi told of a friend using online shopping tools to find coveted supplies such as sanitizing gel and wipes.\nShe also shared a news video clip of someone in China using a remote-controlled toy truck mounted with a GoPro camera to fetch supplies.\n""When it comes to technology, there are different things that make isolation easier; from streaming video to digital books to gaming,"" Milanesi said.

      Grow meat at home from stem cells? It’s coming, says Shiok Meats CEO
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: What if you are able to “grow” your own meat at home? Would it change the way your family eat?\nThe idea is not in the realms of science fiction any more, according to stem cell scientist Sandhya Sriram.\nShe envisions that people could have a small bioreactor — “a fancy name” for something like a pressure cooker — that can maintain the right temperature and conditions for cells to grow into meat.\n“It’s much like making beer or wine at home, or even baking a piece of bread,” says the 35-year-old.\nIt is already happening in Japan, where there are biohackers trying their hand at developing DIY meat at home through the Shojinmeat Project, a citizen science project.\nSandhya knows more than most about this technology and how to make cultured meats. She is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Shiok Meats, the homegrown company growing cell-based shrimps in a laboratory.\nShe gives it 10 years before people can “have this kind of set-up in their house for them to make meats”.\nMeantime, consumers here will get a taste of things to come when her company starts selling its shrimp to restaurants next year, she discloses.\n“So you can walk into a restaurant that we’re partnering to basically buy a shrimp siew mai dish or shrimp fried rice or a shrimp soup dish.”\nIt has been 18 months since Shiok Meats began as the first cell-based clean meat company in Singapore. And it is unlikely to be the last.\nFOR NOW, IT’S S$150 A SIEW MAI\nGrowing meat in a lab is cutting-edge technology being attempted by a handful of companies around the globe.\nTheir labs have successfully made hamburger patties and shrimp dumplings, but these are not yet commercially available because a tiny amount of cell-based meat costs thousands of dollars. Last year, it cost Shiok Meats S$5,000 to produce eight dumplings.\nThat has since come down to S$5,000 for a kilogramme of shrimp meat. In other words, each siew mai would set you back S$150.\n\n\nBy year end or the start of next year, however, it will be a “two- to three-digit number” per kilogramme.\nAnd that has to do with the biological research her start-up is doing, says Sandhya, who earned her PhD from the Nanyang Technological University.\nWATCH: Lab-grown meat, in Singapore restaurants in 2021 (& at home by 2030)? (2:41)\nAt heart of the technology, what her company does is to take out stem cells from live shrimps and grow the cells “over and over again” by feeding them a liquid nutrient, or “nutrient soup”.\n“It’s a mix of proteins, carbohydrates and fats, very similar to what the animal would eat itself. But because the cells don’t have a digestive system, you have to give them a very simple ingredient mix,” she explains.\n“It’s made only by pharmaceutical companies. It’s not made by anyone else in larger quantities for us to purchase, hence the cost. So 90 per cent of our multi-thousand-dollar kilogramme per shrimp is the price of that nutrient solution.”\nThe pharma companies do not reveal what is in this proprietary substance, “but to an extent, we as scientists definitely know”, she says.\nAnd by swapping some of the pharmaceutical-grade ingredients for plant-based and edible ingredients, Shiok Meats has reduced the cost. “We haven’t found an exact alternative for the rest. So now we have to start working on those,” she adds.\n“We’re getting there ... It’s been only 18 months since we started, but we’re quite positive that we’ll launch commercially next year in Singapore.”\nSTART OF A REVOLUTION\nWhile cell-based meats come from an animal, what has recently taken the world by storm are plant-based meats. They are, to an extent, direct competitors in the market, acknowledges Sandhya.\n“But honestly, (in 2050) the world’s population is going to be 10 billion ... We don’t even have enough food to feed the seven billion that we are currently,” she says.\n“You need different sources of food ... So I believe that a mix of plant-based, cell-based and insect-based protein is going to be the future. It’s already started.”\nTo consumers who might think that cell-based meats are slightly like Frankenstein food, she points out that “most of your packaged food that you get in a supermarket now” were made in labs “at one point in time”.\n“Then it goes out of the lab and goes into ... a food manufacturing facility,” she adds. “That’s exactly what we’re doing with cell-based meats.”\nShiok Meats is setting up its manufacturing facility this year, specifically for shrimp. And it plans to grow cell-based crabs and lobsters after that.\nBut does its shrimp, when cooked, really smell and taste like shrimp meat to begin with?\nThe first time the start-up did a blind test, Sandhya got her co-founder and a chef in a culinary school to do the tasting and “they couldn’t tell the difference”, she recounts. “The flavour is inherent.”\nThe only thing is that the company cannot make “a structured shrimp” right now. “It’s minced, hence the dumpling. But we’re working towards a shrimp that will look like the real thing,” she says.\nShe herself, as a vegetarian, had never eaten shrimp before that, “so you can imagine that it’ll take me a while to get used to the taste”.\n“But I know that I can eat it without any guilt ... I know where exactly it comes from and I know that we’ve made it,” she adds, citing “clean shrimp farms” as the source of the stem cells.\n“We take those shrimps that are not treated with antibiotics (nor) bleach, (and) don’t have heavy metals or mercury.”\nShiok Meat also runs its final product by third-party organisations that do accredited testing for those components.\nAnd even before the company can take its meat to restaurants, let alone people growing their own meat, Sandhya thinks the world is already witnessing a revolution with people talking about cell-based meats.\n“(This) is very, very important because for us ... consumer education is more important than getting the product to market so fast. Because we have to educate consumers as to why they have to choose this product,” she says.\nWatch the full exclusive interview here.

  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Newly developed COVID-19 test kits will be used to test swab samples collected at Singapore’s checkpoints from Thursday (Mar 5), promising results within three hours.\nA collaboration between the Home Team Science & Technology Agency (HTX) and Veredus Laboratories, the HTX COVID-19 test kit has an accuracy of more than 99 per cent and is able to test for a result in three hours, said HTX in an information sheet.\xa0\nThe test kit has provisional authorisation from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and can be used directly by laboratories or hospitals\xa0to test patients for clinical diagnosis, said HTX.\nThis is faster than test kits deployed at hospitals, which not only tests for the presence of COVID-19 but the severity of it.\nSwab samples are couriered from Singapore’s land, sea and air checkpoints and transported to the HTX lab at the Pasir Panjang Scanning Station. The lab can handle up 200 samples a day, with a team of about 20 scientists on rotation.\nA three-step process occurs at the laboratory.\xa0Scientists first extract the sample’s RNA (ribonucleic acid). This RNA is then converted into DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) before a process known as polymerase chain reaction takes place. This helps to amplify the signal of the virus within the sample so that it is more detectable.\nIn the case that the sample tests positive, HTX will inform the Ministry of Health (MOH). As of 6pm on Thursday, one sample has been sent for testing at the HTX lab so far.\nMOH announced the introduction of the COVID-19 swab tests at Singapore's checkpoints\xa0on Tuesday. These may apply to travellers entering Singapore who have fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness.\xa0They include\xa0those who do not meet the “clinical suspect case definition”, said the ministry.\nCurrently at checkpoints, healthcare assistants conduct temperature screening for arriving travellers.

      How 3D food printing can help the elderly
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: These days, 3D food printers are used in the industry to make chocolates and pastries.\nBut at Singapore Polytechnic, researchers are exploring the idea of printing food that the elderly crave, such as chilli crab and durian, but with a new twist.\n“(For) durian, we can reduce the sugar content and also fortify it … with calcium and vitamin D,” said Evelyn Ong, product innovation manager at the polytechnic’s Food Innovation and Resource Centre.\n“And we can reconstruct it using 3D food printing to a shape that looks familiar to the elderly.”\nWith 3D food printing, one can produce food that is not only palatable and healthier for the elderly, but also easier for them to chew.\nThis ability to print food has the potential to revolutionise the way we eat, by offering convenience as well as customisation in terms of texture and even nutrition, the programme Money Mind discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nPRINTING MEALS FOR PATIENTS\n3D printing technology is not new, though it is usually associated with creating materials to build cars, planes and houses.\nBut after Russian cosmonauts printed meat in space in October — showing how useful the applications of 3D printing can be — food printing has gained traction.\nIt is a process whereby food materials (in paste or gel form) are extruded from cartridges to form layered designs programmed on a computer.\nAt the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), researchers are working to advance these methods, including developing a new kind of food ink, which can be used to maintain the food structure. It has properties similar to those of toothpaste.\nSome of the researchers are also working with Khoo Teck Puat Hospital to create printed meals for elderly and frail patients who have trouble swallowing food. These meals include sweet potatoes, pollack, green peas and even milk.\nThe hospital’s senior principal dietitian, Gladys Wong, is looking to get puree that is easy to swallow and can be produced consistently.\n“The food (must be) nutritious as well and, more importantly, be visually appealing (so) that the elderly patient or people (who had a) stroke are able to eat it and want to eat it,” she said.\nCarrot, bitter gourd, spinach and garden peas are among those printed by researchers, while chicken, fruits and rice are next on the agenda.\nIn Sweden, two cities are already testing a new food printing technique for eldercare homes. The idea is to stimulate residents’ appetites by making the pureed food look like the real thing.\nAt this moment, however, there is a limited range of food that can be printed, and scalability is also an issue, pointed out Ong. “It may take about 30 to 45 minutes just to print out a crab claw.\n“If you’re talking about mass-producing for different patients, it may take a much longer time, which isn’t feasible at this moment.”\nThere is also the issue of food safety regulations. While there are consortiums planning to do 3D food printing in the European Union, “there is no safe limit, or safe rules”, said Wong.\n“In Singapore, we also have to work with the regulatory bodies to come up with those regulations.”\nWATCH: 3D food printing desserts to hospital meals (2:45)\nSTAGE SET FOR A BOOM\nWith a price tag of about S$5,000, commercial 3D food printers are also out of reach of most people for now.\nBut some experts say it is only a matter of time before food printing becomes a game changer for food manufacturing and services.\nAnrich3D, a spin-off from the Nanyang Technological University, is now developing 3D food printing based on individual nutritional preferences. It aims to mass-produce personalised meals, such as burgers, pizzas and sandwiches, using apps and vending machines in future.\n“How much food we can print isn’t limited by the size of the printer,” said the start-up’s founder, Anirudh Agarwal.\n“We can continuously keep feeding material (to the printer) and use it in a large setting like a hotel, restaurant or even a manufacturing facility.”\nIn Japan, a food technology company came up with a restaurant concept last year to create 3D-printed sushi tailored to each diner based on the individual’s biological data.\nSUTD professor and head of Engineering Product Development, Chua Chee Kai, estimates that the 3D food printing market was worth about US$49 million (S$69 million) globally as of 2018.\nIt is expected to grow to US$400 million or more by 2024. In future, housewives as well as restaurants may be printing food, Chua said.\n“If you have printers, you need inks, and … it could be sugar, it could be all the different vegetables,” he added.\n“I think we’ll create a whole new generation of chefs who’ll be able to download recipes. I’d like to term this digital gastronomy.”\nWatch this episode of Money Mind here.

      Commentary: Tech is not all bad. Our COVID-19 experience shows this
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The outbreak of COVID-19, has shown that Singaporeans are not afraid or reluctant to come forward to make a difference. And tech is quickly becoming the enabler for such collective efforts.\nThis is a far cry from the attention it has otherwise received in being a scourge that spreads and catalyses a pandemic of fear — DRUMS (Distortions, Rumours, Untruths, Misinformation and Smears).\nSMALL DEEDS EVERYWHERE\nFrom #braveheartsg, a movement that supports frontline medical staff, and Be Kind SG, a group that provides micro-volunteering opportunities to working adults, to the anonymous donors who left masks at lift lobbies, we see acts of compassion and generosity around us.\n\n\nBetter.sg, a volunteer-run non-profit group set up Mask Go Share, a website that connects people with extra masks and hand sanitisers to those who need them. The site also publishes maps of one-bedroom and two-bedroom HDB rental flats so that people who want to help needy households can provide targeted assistance.\nOn a regular day, there are many individuals who use digital technologies innovatively to help people solve problems they face in their daily lives.\nLast year, the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) conducted a study on sharing initiatives in Singapore. We mapped initiatives that involved the sharing and re-distribution of different types of resources, such as spaces, products, time and skills. Many of those initiatives generate revenue for developers, but there is a growing number of ground-up initiatives that are not revenue-generating or profit-making.\nSome of these initiatives facilitate the sharing and redistribution of daily items or those that come in handy during small emergencies - for example food swaps, book-sharing, umbrella-sharing and loan of household items.\n\n\nOthers bring people together to share intangible resources such as time and skills -\xa0for instance time-banking, repair services and cooperatives.\nHowever, what underpins all of them is a belief in people’s ability to work together to solve problems and help the less fortunate.\xa0\nThe founders of these initiatives see small and big acts of sharing as ways to pay it forward, build community resilience and promote a sustainable environment for all in the long run.\nLooking to the future, more can be done to help them.\nSUPPORT FOR GROUND-UP INITIATIVES\nOn Feb 12, the COVID-19 inter-ministry task force announced that the Government was setting up a centralised online platform for ground-up efforts. Preliminary details indicate that the platform will provide information on what is needed, ground-up groups and government initiatives.\nThis effort in consolidating information on various initiatives set-up to tackle COVID-19 is an important one. Users will be able to identify with ease and assurance how they can play a part; organisers can determine where the gaps in service provision are and the potential collaborators they can work with to upscale efforts.\nHowever, more can be done for ground-up initiatives to become a permanent fixture in the Singapore way of life.\nOur study found that organisers of ground-up initiatives face several challenges in upscaling their efforts.\nFor one, there is the problem of sustainability as organisers who are new to the space often face difficulties in recruiting and retaining volunteers.\n\n\nAlthough existing platforms such as giving.sg and volunteer.sg help to make these important connections, most of them link volunteers with registered charities and organisations and not unregistered ground-up initiatives.\nA fellow researcher at IPS has just started Serve.sg, an open-source volunteer matching platform to connect those\xa0interested in giving their time with those who start ground-up initiatives and need support. More focus must be given to connecting organisers of such fledgling initiatives with those willing to share their time and energy.\nSecond, many\xa0initiatives are borne out of the founders’ own pockets and such short-lived funding threatens the longevity of an initiative.\nThere is currently a slate of funding programmes to help non-profit organisations achieve their goals and several Community Development Councils have grants to support ground-up initiatives.\nWhile efforts are made to simplify applications for support, organisers of ground-up initiatives, especially those who have less resources, may still find such processes intimidating. Early-stage consultation to help individuals think through their desired outcomes, target audiences and milestones will not only alleviate their burden but also nudge them to think what they want to achieve in the long-run and how they can get there.\n\n\nThird, if we are serious about changing the tone of governance in Singapore, from government-led problem solving to a democracy of deeds\xa0— as described by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his dialogue last year on building Singapore together — the regulatory landscape which is work-in-progress must be developed together with people involved in the innovation space and ground-up community work.\nThis can be achieved through an engagement process such as the citizens’ jury or workgroup that involves relevant stakeholders in rigorous and informed deliberation resulting in agreed solutions.\nIn Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen’s Total Defence Day message delivered on Friday (Feb 14), he reminded Singaporeans of the sixth pillar of defence — digital defence — launched in 2019. His message, reminding citizens to be vigilant and do their part to protect society and communities from online harms, is timely.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and small deeds on day to day basis have shown that technology is a positive and powerful tool for collective problem-solving and action.\nLet us not be distracted by the bad eggs and focus on what can be done to bring out the latent capacity among people to help one another.\nCarol Soon is Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies. She works with different agencies on citizens’ panels and led the study on sharing initiatives in Singapore.

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Temperature screening at office buildings could be up to five times faster with a new artificial intelligence-powered system by the Integrated Health Information System (IHiS) and healthcare technology company Kronikare.\nThe iThermo can screen eight to 10 people per minute, as compared to two to three people for manual screening, said Mr Chua Chee Yong, head of emerging services and capabilities at IHiS.\n""(For manual screening), it ranges from 20 to 30 seconds to take a reading ...\xa0That\'s the maximum they can do,"" he said.\xa0\n""For the iThermo, we\'re looking at about eight to 10 (screenings) per minute.""\nLong queues have begun to form outside office buildings across Singapore in recent days\xa0after heightened precautionary measures were introduced to\xa0deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.\nQueues for temperature screening were reported to last as long as 40 minutes at places like Suntec City.\nBased off Kronikare’s Wound Scanner, the iThermo was developed in two weeks, and has been on trial at\xa0the IHiS headquarters and the St Andrew’s Community Hospital since Monday.\nThe 25cm by 12cm by 5cm iThermo comprises a smartphone camera, a thermal camera, and a laser camera, which can be mounted on a stand.\xa0Weighing 650g, it is easily deployed at entrances of places like office buildings and shopping malls.\nCompared to manual screening, iThermo\xa0will be able to “reduce scanning fatigue, manpower and time”, said IHiS CEO Bruce Liang.\xa0Thus far, results have been “encouraging”, he said, noting that IHiS\xa0had\xa0received inquiries from healthcare institutions, banks and the retail sector.\xa0\nIt is also cheaper and more portable than high-end screeners deployed at airports.\n“This is meant to bridge the gap between manual screening and the high-end screeners,” said Mr Chua of IHiS.\nThe iThermo will be rented out\xa0for S$1,000 a month.\xa0Fifty units will be available from mid-February and another 50 from the end of February.\nHOW IT WORKS\nThe three cameras work to screen the body temperature of an individual, adjusted for ambient temperature and distance.\nUnlike manual screening, iThermo can screen up to 10 people in\xa0a single frame. Low beeps indicate that the temperature has been recorded. If someone with a fever passes through, the system will alert a staff member with a higher-pitched sound.\nThe system\xa0can best screen individuals from a distance of 1m to 3m of the scanner. It can also screen individuals wearing hats, surgical masks and spectacles.\nAccording to chief technology officer and co-founder of Kronikare, Hossein Nejati, the iThermo\xa0has a 100 per cent accuracy in screening patients with body temperatures of over 37.3 degrees when compared with a forehead thermometer\xa0during the proof-of-concept stage.\nThe system received a Class A certification from the Health Sciences Authority and Kronikare has ramped up the production of the iThermo.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the novel coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Wuhan virus ', '     health ', '     technology ']}"

      The automotive revolution you’ve never heard about: Car-to-x connectivity
  </h1>, 'text': 'You might already have heard that the electric car will be the Next Big Thing in the automotive world. You might also have heard about how autonomous technologies will also, ahem, drive the world forward in the not too distant future.\nBut there’s one thing you probably haven’t heard about, and it’s quite possibly even more important than all of the above. That is, car-to-x communication.\nThis comprises a whole raft of technologies, but in a nutshell, what this means is cars “talking” to each other, sending, receiving and sharing information among themselves. The obvious benefit to this, of course, is to prevent collisions by proactively taking steps to avoid it.\nFor example, there’s a pothole or fallen tree ahead. The first car to spot it will then relay the message to the cars further down the line, highlighting the hazard on each car’s head-up display and negating the need for vehicles to swerve suddenly to avoid said hazard.\nAnd that’s not the only potential life-saving benefit of car-to-x connectivity. An emergency vehicle could also employ this to signal other road users that they’re incoming, or to warn traffic when it’s approaching an intersection.\nOr it could also make your commute smoother. Say there’s a traffic jam on your usual route. This information could then be relayed from traffic lights or cameras to cars on the same route, which in turn will be used by the cars’ navigation systems to automatically route drivers around the congestion.\nSticking with the topic of smoother commutes, those same traffic lights could tell road users of when “green waves” will occur, with vehicles maintaining speeds to catch those waves. This not only makes commuting far more pleasant, it could minimise instances of slowing down/speeding up and stopping, thereby reducing fuel consumption and emissions.\nIf all this sounds deceptively simple, well, it kind of is. Most cars already have navigation systems built into them. Ditto for RTTI (real-time traffic information) systems, collision avoidance/mitigation systems and head-up displays.\nIn addition to that, many cars now have some semblance of autonomous driving features built into them, with the most obvious example being adaptive cruise control. A development of vanilla cruise control, cars equipped with such systems will automatically follow the car in front at a safe distance, even if the preset speed is higher. If the leading car slows down, the one following will maintain that distance.\n\n\nIn effect, a modern automobile is like a computer on wheels, with the sort of digitalisation and information-processing smarts that was all but a science fiction pipe dream on the same level as a flying car barely 20 years ago.\nAnd with the advent of 5G mobile networks, all that information could be collated and shared among other road users virtually instantaneously and over great distances. Previous, work on car-to-x communications relied on WiFi networks, which while speedy, have a very limited range and are prone to interference.\nThink of the frustration of dropped signals and crossed wires you get when connected to a public WiFi with hundreds of users and you get the idea. Except when it comes to road safety, a glitchy network could have far more dire ramifications than not being able to view the cat video your friends just sent you.\nStill, there are several layers of redundancy built into such systems. Even if the cloud goes down, the car will be able to rely on short-range communications, and if that fails, it can use its on-board sensors or cameras.\nSo if all these systems are already available, what’s the metaphorical roadblock? Why isn’t adoption of car-to-x communications a reality yet?\nActually, that’s not entirely inaccurate, since Mercedes-Benz has been employing car-to-x communications on their cars since 2013, albeit only among its own cars.\nAt any rate, the answer to that is simpler still. While cars are talking, they’re only talking to themselves and they can’t to talk to other cars, because they’re not speaking the same language.\nBut all that is set to change, because in 2019, BMW, Daimler (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz), Ford and Volvo, along with navigation service provider Tom Tom and several EU transport authorities, began working on a car-to-x technology project.\nThe project aims to provide a manufacturer-agnostic and pan-EU solution to implement such technologies on their future products. The fact they’re also working with the relevant governmental bodies will also ensure full compliance with regulations, so if/when car-to-x is finally a reality, it can be put to work immediately without too much legal wrangling.\nAll this will be underpinned by cloud-based computing, so all this information can be accessed from virtually anywhere and with the super-fast data connections powering all that, it’ll be available almost in real-time.\nTo say this is a huge move is understating things somewhat, and if it does come to fruition, it’ll bring us that much closer to an automotive utopia.\nWhat it doesn’t say, not explicitly anyway, is the impact these technologies will have on autonomous driving, another pillar of the way we will use cars in the future. Networked cars are important when there’s a human behind the wheel, but when the driver is a machine, it could be invaluable.\nA driverless car that has more information at its disposal – of the other cars around it, plus of current and upcoming road conditions or hazards is, logically enough, that much safer. For its occupants and for others using the roads at the same time.\n\n\nTo that end, there’s another suite of advancements in the works: Swarm technology. Essentially, it uses a computer algorithm derived from shoals of fish or swarms of insects, and applied to the automotive space, this allows for clusters of vehicles to move as one entity.\nSwarm technology was exhibited as far back as 2009 with the Nissan EPORO demonstrator. Packs of six driverless vehicles were travelling together, effortlessly changing directions and avoiding collisions with each other. This all happened in real-time, with the EPORO robots using their on-board sensors to gauge their distance/speed relative to others and react accordingly.\nIn all fairness, though, those robotic vehicles were the size of toy cars and barely moved faster than walking speed. Even then, it’s a fascinating peek into what a highway of the future could look like.\nA highway full of networked vehicles all communicating with each other the keep the roads safe for all. Car-to-x communications may be the next big automotive leap you’ve never heard of, but if things are progressing the way they are, you might be hearing about it (or indeed, experiencing it for yourself) sooner than you think.\n', 'related_topics': ['     cars ', '     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      Commentary: Iran flexes its missile muscle with terrible consequences
  </h1>, 'text': 'TORONTO: Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) recently demonstrated its sophisticated missile technology by\xa0attacking US military bases\xa0in Iraq.\nBut later the same day, its missiles\xa0unintentionally destroyed an airliner\xa0in Iran, killing 176 civilians, including 57 Canadians.\nThat combined success and blunder suggest Iran’s military and government “human systems” have not kept up with the weapon technology they wield. They also illustrate how missile threats pose challenges to other countries worldwide.\nAIRLINER INTERCEPTION OVER IRAN\nIran belatedly admitted Saturday that IRGC surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) had shot down the passenger jet near Tehran. The SAM crew somehow mistook the Ukrainian airliner for an American cruise missile. Ukrainian investigators believe the\xa0missile exploded near the airplane’s cockpit, instantly killing the crew.\nThe airplane was defenceless against the\xa0apparently Russian-made SAM. The only major airline\xa0whose planes carry missile countermeasures\xa0is Israel’s El Al. And those are effective mostly against\xa0simple heat-seeking SAMs, not sophisticated radar-guided ones.\nIt’s unclear why IRGC personnel didn’t realise the aircraft was civilian. Their radar should have displayed the airliner’s\xa0transponder code.\xa0Did the IRGC disable\xa0that potentially life-saving feature?\nIran is not alone in making interception errors. In 2018,\xa0Syria used Russian-supplied SAMs\xa0to\xa0down a Russian airplane\xa0they mistook for an Israeli fighter jet. And in 1988, a\xa0US warship destroyed an Iranian airliner it thought was a warplane.\nYou could call the incident “human error” or “recklessness and incompetence.”\nEither way, it indicates problems with\xa0organisational co-ordination and communication, rather than the technology itself.\nIn fact, the IRGC had showcased its technological strengths earlier that day.\nBALLISTIC MISSILES INTO IRAQ\nOn Jan. 8, the IRGC launched\xa0between 15\xa0and\xa022 ballistic missiles\xa0toward US military bases in Iraq. Some landed many kilometres off target. But most struck the bases and at least five destroyed buildings. Fortunately,\xa0the Americans suffered no casualties\xa0because\xa0they had taken shelter.\nThe fact that some missiles never reached the target zone indicates their reliability remains problematic. But the direct hits that others scored shows the growing accuracy of Iran’s missile guidance systems.\nMost importantly, the attack demonstrated Iran can strike US targets hundreds of kilometres away. That’s despite overwhelming American military superiority.\nCRUISE MISSILES AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA\nIran’s cruise missiles\xa0have achieved similar sophistication. Ballistic missiles soar high into the air before arcing down toward their targets. By contrast, cruise missiles fly close to the ground like small airplanes — hence the IRGC’s mistake.\nThose improvements were evident last September. That’s when\xa0seven cruise missiles and 18 smaller drones\xa0heavily damaged two Saudi Arabian oil refineries. Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed they made that attack. But many observers believe Iran supplied the missiles.\nMILITARY VULNERABILITIES\nIran’s successful cruise and ballistic missile attacks represent not only its missile strengths, but also other countries’ vulnerabilities. Even the powerful and\xa0well-funded\xa0US military has trouble blocking such missiles.\nBallistic missiles’ high-altitude flights are easy to spot on radar. But their fast speed makes them difficult to hit. Even if hit, their downward trajectories mean they might damage targets anyway.\nConversely, cruise missiles are relatively easy to destroy once detected. But their low flying altitudes mean they’re often undetected until too late.\nCapturing launch sites is one way to counter both missile types. That’s how Allied forces shut down Germany’s\xa0V-2 ballistic missiles and V-1 cruise missiles\xa0during the Second World War.\nThe US Army does have medium-range\xa0Patriot missile interceptors, but only at a few locations. Besides, that system’s effectiveness against ballistic missiles\xa0is questionable. And Saudi Patriots failed to stop the refinery cruise missile attack there.\nConsequently, the US Army is developing new\xa0short-range missile defences. It’s also\xa0buying two interceptor systems from Israel\xa0in the meantime. But those aren’t deployed yet.\nMeanwhile, most other countries’ armies,\xa0including Canada’s, completely lack interceptors. By contrast,\xa0many nations’ warships carry interceptors for self-defence.\nISRAELI CONCERNS\nThe country best equipped for missile defence is Israel. But even it worries about Iranian developments.\nIsrael developed its\xa0Arrow\xa0and\xa0David’s Sling\xa0systems to intercept ballistic missiles. Its\xa0Iron Dome\xa0system protects against short-range rockets and mortars. Even its\xa0tanks can intercept anti-tank guided missiles.\nIron Dome has seen extensive use against\xa0attacks from Gaza. The system was first deployed in 2011 and\xa0became really effective in 2014.\nBut that effectiveness partly relies on rocket inaccuracy. Even when fired at large targets like entire towns, roughly three-quarters land harmlessly in fields. Very few would directly hit buildings. Iron Dome batteries can focus on stopping those few.\nThat’s one reason Iranian missile improvements concern Israel. Suppose the IRGC were to supply Hamas in Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon with precision guidance systems. Those militants could greatly increase their weapons’ accuracy.\nInstead of blindly firing rockets at whole towns, the militants could target important buildings like power plants. And instead of worrying about just a fraction of the rockets, Iron Dome units would need to intercept most of them. That could quickly\xa0overwhelm their capacity.\nIt’s truly impressive how far the world’s engineers have advanced missile technology. Now politicians must make similar advances in diplomacy. Otherwise, missile mayhem will become increasingly common.\nMichael J. Armstrong is associate professor of operations research at the Goodman School of Business, Brock University.\xa0This commentary first appeared in The Conversation.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Iran ', '     US ', '     technology ']}"

      An Avatar-like car and a self-rotating TV: 5 cool new tech from CES 2020
  </h1>, 'text': ""Once again, CES 2020 has stunned the world with a showcase of some very interesting innovations,\xa0setting the stage for an exciting year in technology.\xa0\nThere's\xa0a car that moves sideways and diagonally, a tiny robot that acts like a personal assistant, and a TV that lets you watch videos in both vertical and horizontal orientation.\xa0\nSome technologies may be concepts\xa0for now, but what's the harm in dreaming of a future where they're\xa0real? Here are five launches\xa0that wowed the crowd.\nIMPOSSIBLE PORK\nClimate concerns have driven interest in meat alternatives. Following the successful launch of the Impossible Burger 2.0 at last year’s CES, Impossible Pork has now made its debut. And like its plant-based predecessor, the main protein in the Impossible Pork is soy, with sunflower and coconut oils serving as fat sources.\nThe first product that will feature the faux pork is the Impossible Sausage – which will begin rolling out in Burger King outlets around the US starting this January. The company also claims that the product will suit a variety of Asian dishes, such as your favourite dim sums, spring rolls and noodles.\n\n\nMERCEDES-BENZ VISION AVTR\nWhat is perhaps the wildest and most daring concept car the automotive world has seen thus far, Mercedes-Benz revealed the Vision AVTR, inspired by James Cameron’s hit movie Avatar.\xa0\nThe Vision AVTR was conceptualised to function as less than a car and more of a 'living organism'. Biometric controls allow the car to seamlessly interact with its occupants. In place of a steering wheel, the centre console is equipped with a control unit that detects your heartbeat and allows you to control your journey through even the slightest of hand movements.\nA visual feast to behold, the entire rear end of the AVTR is covered with 33 scales, or 'bionic flaps'\xa0as Mercedes calls them. Interiors are outfitted with sustainable materials including vegan leather and rattan.\xa0\nMeanwhile, see-through doors open gracefully upwards and the car is also equipped with illuminated wheels that can move sideways and diagonally.\nSAMSUNG BALLIE\nEver wanted your very own version of BB-8, the lovable droid from Star Wars? The Samsung Ballie may be your answer. This\xa0tiny, ball-shaped personal robot doesn’t just roll around the house, it also responds to your voice commands.\xa0\nDesigned to act as a personal assistant, the device uses a mobile interface, on-device AI capabilities, voice activation and an in-built camera to recognise and respond to its users, and help\xa0with various household tasks.\nThis includes patrolling the home, calling for help in an emergency, video recording events, and even acting as a fitness assistant to\xa0get\xa0you moving when you feel like laying on the couch.\n\n\nSAMSUNG SERO TV\nThe future of TV is vertical, or so claims Samsung. The South Korean conglomerate\xa0has launched the Samsung Sero, a futuristic TV that rotates by itself. Targeted at those who connect their smartphones to the TV screen, the Sero can pivot\xa0between vertical and horizontal orientations.\xa0\nSo if you're looking at websites or content optimised for a horizontal view, the Sero will stick with the standard TV format. But if you’re watching a YouTube or Instagram video, the Sero will rotate\xa0automatically to an upright position.\xa0\nSONY VISION S\nSony surprised the crowd with the unveiling of its very own electric car – the Sony Vision S. Built to showcase what Sony can do for the cars of tomorrow, the sleek sedan takes advantage of Sony's expertise in sensors, imaging and entertainment.\nFeatures include advanced cruise control, self-parking and ability to change lanes automatically. The prototype features 33 sensors placed around the car, which provides driving support by detecting people both inside and outside the car. Sony’s 360 Reality Audio is also incorporated to provide an immersive audio experience, with speakers built into each of the car's seats.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     cars ']}"

      Low-cost prosthesis gives Brazil cancer survivor a new face
  </h1>, 'text': 'SAO PAULO: Denise Vicentin looks in the mirror and bursts into tears.\nAfter losing her right eye and part of her jaw to cancer, the Brazilian woman is getting a new face thanks to a digitally-engineered prosthesis.\n""Today I can say how much better I will feel being out in the streets. I have no words,"" Vicentin, 53, tells AFP at a clinic in Sao Paulo after being fitted with a prosthesis for a missing chunk of her face.\nResearchers at Paulista University are employing smartphones and 3D printing to create digital facial impressions used to make silicone prostheses.\nThe pioneering method has slashed costs and halved production times.\n""In the past, it took much longer work, hours of sculpting by hand, and the process was very invasive, with material on the patient\'s face to get an imprint of their appearance,"" says Rodrigo Salazar, the lead researcher.\n""Today with cell phone pictures, we create a three-dimensional model.""\nVicentin is one of more than 50 patients treated by Salazar and his colleagues since 2015.\nThe team specialises in maxillofacial prosthetics, a branch of dentistry focused on treating people disfigured by birth defects, disease or trauma.\nTheir technique was published in 2016 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery.\nENDURING THE STARES\nAFP has followed Vicentin\'s journey for more than a year and a half, documenting the various stages of her physical and psychological recovery.\nHer ordeal began 30 years ago when she developed a facial tumour. It was removed twice, but it returned in a malignant form two decades later.\nGradually, she lost parts of the right side of her face - along with her marriage and her dignity.\n""When I was on the metro or train, I tried not to pay attention to the stares,"" Vicentin recalls.\n""At places like the bowling alley, I felt them looking, and the person would even leave when they saw me.""\nVicentin has difficulty eating and her speech slurs because of the loss of her jaw. Her daughter, Jessica, acts as her interpreter.\nAs 3D printing developed in recent years, Luciano Dib -\xa0one of Salazar\'s supervisors and a co-researcher -\xa0got the idea to use the technique for prosthesis models.\n""I saw people at the mall do 3D printing, so I thought, \'Why can\'t we use that for prostheses?\'"" he says.\nBUDGET TECH\nVicentin\'s transformation began in 2018.\nDib implanted titanium rods in her eye socket to hold the prosthesis.\nOver the next year, she underwent multiple surgeries to build up her facial tissue.\nUsing a smartphone, Salazar took 15 pictures of her face from different angles, which were used to make a three-dimensional digital model.\nUsing that model, a graphic designer created a mirror image of the healthy half of Vicentin\'s face.\nTechnicians then 3D-printed a prototype prosthesis which they used to make the final one from silicone, resin and synthetic fibres.\nTo make the prosthesis as real-looking as possible, Salazar and his colleagues carefully matched its colouring to Vicentin\'s skin and blue-green eye.\nThe process for making the final prosthesis took 12 hours -\xa0half the time of conventional methods.\nBut it was spread out over a year because of Vicentin\'s surgeries.\nShe received the completed prosthesis in early December. The small egg-sized piece fit perfectly, with magnets clipping it to the titanium implants.\nConventional techniques for making prosthesis models involve equipment costing up to US$500,000, he says. Their method requires a computer and a smartphone.\n""The method demonstrates that you don\'t need big investments to use advanced technology,"" Salazar says.\n\'SO HAPPY\'\nNext year, Dib and Salazar plan to open a treatment centre for facial prosthetic rehabilitation built by Paulista University and a non-profit organisation which they founded, called Plus Identity.\nThey have a waiting list of potential patients.\nEventually, Dib hopes 3D printing can be used to make the actual silicone prostheses.\n""In a very short time, we will be able to assist the patient on the spot with a printed prosthesis,"" Dib says.\nFor Vicentin, the journey is not yet over. She needs further treatment to restore her jaw and top lip.\nBut for now, she is overjoyed.\n""It was a long time looking at a face which was missing a piece, so I am so happy,"" she tells AFP after spending her first night at home with the prosthesis.\n""I only took it off to clean it -\xa0I even slept with it.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Brazil ', '     health ', '     technology ', '     cancer ']}"

      A new travel app created in Singapore promises to address common travel woes
  </h1>, 'text': ""If you’ve been ignored by third-party travel websites, felt stressed over what to do on a holiday and frustrated by the inability to redeem anything on hotel loyalty programmes, Iqbal Jumabhoy has heard your cry.\nThe CEO of BlackBook is launching the integrated travel management platform in early 2020, with possibly the largest inventory of over 1.82 million hotels online. It aims to give travellers access to intuitive travel planning tools and a rewards conversion programme where perks such as hotel stays, dining credits and cash rebates can be earned.\n\n\nJumabhoy was the CEO of the Rendezvous Hospitality Group for two years before leading SilverNeedle Hospitality (now called The Next Hospitality Group) as its Managing Director and Group CEO. At both companies, he’d read every feedback email, where he noticed three common traveller angst: Third-party travel websites that were slow in responding to customer complaints after a booking was made; deciding what to see and do during a holiday; and loyalty programmes where one has to stay for many nights before qualifying for a free stay.\nHe shared, “Customers would tell me that once they booked on a travel site, they leave you alone. And the hotel rewards programme is completely useless because it can only offer what is within the group. Or you have to stay 10 nights to get one night free. Ninety-five to 97 per cent of the world do not travel or sleep in a hotel more than 10 nights a year. So these are real pain points.”\nLike a black book of personal favourites, the Blackbook app is meant to be the traveller’s go-to resource for a hassle-free holiday, from booking accommodation and tickets to places of interest to using ride-hailing services like Grab and Uber.\nEarlier this year, a holiday in Hua Hin that became a “return trip from hell” convinced Jumabhoy, who is also the CEO of investment company Edge Capital and Chairman of India-based real estate investment and development company WIRE Group Ltd, that he was going in the right direction.\nAccording to Jumabhoy, the group had received inaccurate information on the commute time to Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport and he and a few relatives missed their flight.\n“The hotel staff told us one number, the airline told us another number… the airport was actually very far. The car driver took too long, and while sitting in the car there was no way for us except to go through multiple websites to look for alternative flights.”\nTo exacerbate the situation, even when they managed to find an option departing from Don Muang Airport, the driver refused to change course and left them at a petrol station next to a shopping centre where they had to hail another taxi.\nAs there was a niece who had an exam the next morning, Jumabhoy ended up flying home via Kuala Lumpur where they rang a driver to pick them up at 1am to get back just in time for her to change and go to school.\n“Imagine if you had an app that gives you a map and tells you where you go, how you do it. You plan all your details. If you need updates, the updates come to you. If you need to find new flights, a place to sleep, it's all in a single place and you get back on time and with maximum convenience.”\nIn future, it will offer ride hailing options, flights, travel insurance, tickets to attractions, car rentals and restaurants. Its proprietary technology, BlackBook Uno, scours multiple information sets and eliminates duplicate entries to calculate the best margins and display the best deals.\nWhenever a booking is made, users earn BB Coins on the BBonus cross-chain rewards programme, which can be used to redeem stays or be converted to cash as quickly as after the first stay.\n\n\nIn future, BB Coins can also be used on other travel services such as flights, cabs, attractions and in-room dining. Another feature, myBlackBook, combines the planning and management aspects, allowing users to view, share and add itineraries to calendars in a single click. Travellers can also explore 32 million places of interest with images, 360-degree videos, opening hours and contact details, as well as obtain information on over 150,000 destinations including weather, foreign exchange and local time.\nJumabhoy explained, “Yes, 32 million places sounds a lot and it is, because that's what people want. They want to be able to find different things, but the sources of information out there are so many. Where are you going to find that? You’d need them in one place.”\nBut while Jumabhoy believes that powerful data sifting and aggregating algorithms are the way to go for efficiency, the human touch is still crucial for a rewarding customer service experience. Jumabhoy says that BlackBook will allow users to connect directly with the hotels they book on the platform.\n“We don’t have to be defensive about allowing our customers to speak to the hotels directly. We believe that the other advantages we have on our platform will keep them with us. Human interaction is needed and we’ve structured our BlackBook Uno engine such that it can be available to smaller online travel agents and offline travel agents.”\nThe man who spends at least 200 days on the road every year says that, ultimately, service from the heart is what draws people back to the same hotel. “One of the things I dislike in a hotel is when I ask for a restaurant recommendation and the staff says, ‘oh, in the hotel we have this restaurant’. I’d say ‘no, I didn't ask you that’.”\nIronically, on the same Hua Hin trip, the hotel the Jumabhoys stayed at was impressive in how they did the contrary. He said, “They were telling us ‘go down there, do this, try that, and yes, you can take the car from the hotel, but actually, it's cheaper if you do it this way’. I appreciated that, and we actually spent much more in the hotel, including eating there, because we were so happy with the people.”\n“Human interaction is needed and we’ve structured our BlackBook Uno engine such that it can be available to smaller online travel agents and offline travel agents.” – Iqbal Jumabhoy\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Travel ', '     technology ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Commentary: The end of the decade – how the world has become a less safe place
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Generally understood as the freedom from potential harm, security has played a critical role in ensuring the survival and advancement of societies through the ages.\nSecurity is central to our well-being to the extent that it is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations (UN), and recognised as a fundamental prerequisite to the pursuit of all other goals of human endeavour.\nAt around the same period the Charter was established in 1945, psychologist Abraham Maslow proffered in his now famous “hierarchy of needs” that our security and safety are only second to our biological ones.\xa0\nAs Maslow argued, an adequate provision of security creates the space for societies and individuals to focus on achieving economic, social and cultural progress that could unlock humanity’s self-actualisation.\nHOW SECURITY DOCTRINES HAVE CHANGED\nClassically, security is said to be achieved when threats ranged against people are either defeated or when the vulnerabilities that make them susceptible to such threats are reduced through protective measures.\nHowever, the traditional doctrine constituting security has become obsolete. Rapid technological developments and disruptive innovation have created new means for terrorists, criminals and dissenters to harm our well-being.\nSeveral threats we face today cannot be neutralised, unlike the threat of total, all-out war by a conventional enemy, where traditional strategies of deterrence and retaliation with overwhelming force can be employed. Instead they should be thought of as security risks that can only be mitigated.\nAll these have the common aim of bringing a country to its knees by creating fear, disrupting moving parts that are essential for a well-functioning society.\nHOW THE TARGETTING OF CIVILIAN LIVES HAS CHANGED\nOne such security risk that targets innocent civilian lives is terrorism, particularly the new version of terrorism manifested by the Islamic State (IS) terrorist network that had captured lands in Syria and Iraq around 2014.\nThe group has utilised a blend of low- and high- technologies to generate simple but widespread attacks that will likely become a model for future terrorist groups to emulate.\nThe IS recognised that security agencies around the world have learned to adapt to the large-scale terrorist attacks carried out by Al Qaeda over the course of the 2000s - many of which required a significant amount of planning, financial resourcing and training of trusted operatives as demonstrated by the 9/11 attacks.\nInstead, leveraging on the social pervasiveness of digital media to recruit as many followers as possible, the IS has moved to a more decentralised system of terrorist attacks by indoctrinating citizens in target countries all over the world, and advocating the use of easy-to-carry-out knife attacks and vehicular ramming of citizens to create public fear and anxiety.\nComprehensive crib sheets on how to carry out such attacks are circulated online. These attacks themselves require literally no concrete planning, financial resourcing, or training—signatures that intelligence agencies try to pick up to detect an impending assault.\nTo date, IS’ new small-scale model of threats have produced over 50 knife attacks and nearly 30 vehicle ramming operations across the world. In comparison, major attacks attributed to al-Qaeda in the 2000s amount to about 20 incidents.\nThe 9/11 attacks alone resulted in about 3,000 deaths, over 25,000 injuries, and caused at least US$10 billion in infrastructural damage. Terrorist groups are moving towards a strategy of a larger quantity of smaller attacks over a few big hits.\nA NEW TOOL: CHEAP, EASILY OPERATED DRONES\nAnother security risk is the proliferation of commercial off-the-shelf technology such as drones.\nThese aerial vehicles, which have flooded the market, have been used by terrorist groups such as the IS, criminals, and other bad actors to attack or harass people and are difficult to detect.\nSince 2016, the IS has been using modified quadcopter drones drop small bombs onto human targets in the Middle East.\nIn September this year, British police seized a modified drone seized from an IS supporter's home that was intended to be used in an attack against a military installation in the country. In May last year, a criminal syndicate launched a swarm of drones to obstruct a hostage raid by a Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) rescue team.\nUnauthorised drones flown by errant operators or individuals with malintent have also endangered people or disrupted our commercial airspace.\nIn January 2015, a drone accidentally crashed into the compound of the White House, after evading the White House’s radar that was calibrated to warn of much bigger threats, such as airplanes and missiles.\nIn December last year, a drone attack caused a shutdown at London's Gatwick Airport, with about 1,000 flights cancelled or delayed and about 140,000 passengers affected. In June this year, unauthorised drones caused flight delays and disruptions at Changi Airport.\nGoing forward, the greatest danger posed by drones flying near airports is the possibility of mid-air collisions with aircraft, which would be catastrophic and erode trust in commercial air travel.\nSuch disruptions not only stoke fear, they also intend to disrupt commercial activities and fracture business sentiments in the country.\nWHY DIGITAL IS THE NEW BATTLEGROUND\nWith the advent of digital technology, and as countries become increasingly reliant on the flow of digital data and service to power their economies, this area can also be a new vulnerability. \xa0\nThis decade was marked by the rise of by cyber-crimes, computer attacks, and online influence operations, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), against governments, corporations and individuals.\nIntelligent algorithms and deep-learning software that automate and improve speech recognition, machine translation, spam filters, and search engines are increasingly being used by cyber-criminals and terrorists to improve their ability to breach security systems, increase the volume and speed of attacks while preserving their anonymity.\nWith the growing ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT)—to which there are currently about 200 billion smart devices connected to each other and to people— the impact of such breaches by bad actors could be widely felt, especially if they target critical installations such as transport infrastructure and utilities services to create outages and steal information.\nCorporate giants including Google, Facebook, Marriott, Equifax and Under Armour have lost critical user data owing to hacks over this decade.\nSingapore too is no stranger to cybersecurity attacks as more of our data is placed on networks. SingHealth experienced one of the serious breaches in October 2018.\nFRACTURING A SOCIETY’S ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS\nA new threat has also emerged as technology advances, one that threatens to undermine society’s ability to tell what is real and what isn’t, creating fear and divisions among people and fracturing the ability to take decisive action.\nDeepfakes — using AI to superimpose one person's face or voice over another in a video—are beginning to play a role in social-media cybercrime.\nIn August this year, it was reported that criminals had employed AI-based software to replicate the voice of a UK-based energy company’s CEO to command a senior executive to make an urgent transfer US$243,000 to a supposed foreign supplier.\nDeepfakes involving Donald Trump taunting another country and Nancy Pelosi supposedly slurring in her speech could also have far-reaching implications if used to spread disinformation, complicating domestic policy-making and foreign relations.\nThese could not only sway the upcoming 2020 US presidential elections, if not found to be deepfakes and disproved in time, but also deepen divides and damage trust over the long term.\nA COMPLEX SECURITY LANDSCAPE\nTerrorism, drone threats, cyber-crimes, computer attacks, and online influence operations reflect that it is becoming increasingly challenging for societies to achieve security compared to the past.\nThe experience of the 2010s has reinforced the point that attacks, disruptions and breaches have evolved rapidly and added to our increasing security complexity and risks.\nThese will add new demands on security and law enforcement agencies around the world as they face these new risks. \xa0\nFor one, they must outpace bad actors in the technological game of innovation. In addition to reducing vulnerabilities, investments must be made in risk and crisis management to blunt the impact of security incidents and other mishaps.\nSecond, agencies will also have to expand their capabilities in the detection, monitoring and pre-emption of such threats as their traditional methods and channels become inadequate.\nOn the technological front, surveillance radars, for instance, must be geared to detect small drones and not just aircrafts or missiles.\xa0\nOn the human front, intelligence agencies must see how they can intercept knowledge of small-scale and “lone-wolf” attacks.\nThird, laws must be updated to create the appropriate instruments and deterrents to deal with such threats.\nIn addition, deeply embedded within a risk-ready society is resilience.\nSingapore has made significant investments to future-proof its people through efforts like the Total Defence initiative established in 1984.\nThe notion of psychological defence as one of now six pillars (“developing resilience and the strength to return to our normal activities as soon as possible after a crisis hits”) remind us that citizens must prevail over whatever newfound risks confront us as we venture forward.\nIndeed, for all the new strategies, laws and technologies put in place to ensure Singapore remains safe and secure, what underpins security is the strength of a united people that think critically and respond to new threats decisively.\nThat key ingredient will remain essential in Singapore’s bid to combat these new security threats not only for the next decade but many more after.\nGraham Ong-Webb is adjunct fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

      Commentary: There is nothing inherently sustainable about going digital
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: Digital technologies are often put forward as a solution to environmental dilemmas.\nThe spread of the internet came with claims of a huge reduction in printing, and by replacing paper with bytes, we thought we’d reduce our negative environmental impact\nBut this early promise of solving environmental problems may not be delivering because digital devices, like most technologies, also have environmental impacts.\nDevices are powered by electricity – often produced in coal-fired plants – and are manufactured from materials such as metals, glass and plastics. These materials also have to be mined, made or recycled.\nSo, while digital technologies can facilitate environmental benefits, we shouldn’t assume they always do. My research published this year shows much more needs to be done to debunk such myths.\nMEASURING DIGITAL ECO-FOOTPRINTS\nIt’s difficult to measure the environmental impacts of our digital lives, partly because the digital ecosystems that facilitate the internet are complex.\nThe United Nations Environment Assembly defines a digital ecosystem as “a complex distributed network or interconnected socio-technological system”.\nSimply, digital ecosystems are the result of humans, digital infrastructure and devices interacting with one another. They rely on energy consumption at multiple scales.\nThe term “digital ecosystem” relates to ecological thinking, specifically in terms of how human-technological systems work.\nHowever, there’s nothing inherently environmentally sustainable about digital ecosystems.\nIt’s worthwhile considering digital ecosystems’ environmental impacts as they grow.\nIn 2017, it was reported in Nature that internet traffic (to and from data centres) was increasing at an exponential rate. At that stage, it had reached 1.1 zettabytes (a zettabyte equals one trillion gigabytes).\nAs our digital use continues, so do our carbon emissions.\nDANGERS OF DATA CENTRES\nData centres majorly contribute to the carbon emissions of digital ecosystems. They are basically factories that store, backup and recover our data.\nIn April last year, it was estimated data centres around the world used more than 2 per cent of the world’s electricity, and generated the same amount of carbon emissions as the global airline industry (in terms of fuel use).\nWhile there is debate about the impact of flying on climate change, we’re less likely to evaluate our digital lives the same way.\nAccording to British Open University Professor John Naughton, data centres make up about 50 per cent of all energy consumed by digital ecosystems. Personal devices use another 34 per cent, and the industries responsible for manufacturing them use 16 per cent.\nTech giants such as Apple and Google have committed to 100 per cent renewable targets, but they’re just one part of our giant digital ecosystem.\nAlso, on many occasions, they rely on carbon offsets to achieve this. Offsets involve people and organisations investing in environmental projects to balance their carbon emissions from other activities. For instance, people can buy carbon offsets when booking flights.\nOffsets have been critiqued for not effectively reducing the carbon footprints of wealthy people, while absolving guilt from continued consumption.\nA CARBON-FILLED ROAD AHEAD\nWith more digital technologies emerging, the environmental impacts of digital ecosystems are probably going to increase.\nApart from the obvious social and economic impacts, artificial intelligence’s (AI) environmental implications should be seriously considered.\nA paper published in June by University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers revealed training a large AI machine could produce five times as much carbon as what one car (including fuel) emits over a person’s lifetime, on average.\nAlso, this figure only relates to training a large AI machine. There are various other ways these machines suck energy.\nSimilarly, bitcoin mining (an application of blockchain) continues to consume large amounts of energy, and is increasing on a global scale. According to the International Energy Agency, bitcoin mining uses more energy than some countries, including Austria and Colombia.\nPUTTING THE “ECO” BACK IN DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM\nThe digital ecosystem that supports our devices includes storage systems and networks that aren’t in our homes or workplaces, such as “the cloud”. But we should still take responsibility for the impact of such systems.\nSatellites are in space. Wires run beneath footpaths, roads and oceans.\nAll the while, the Internet of Things is creeping into old technologies and transforming how we use them. These underground and distant aspects of digital ecosystems may partly explain why the growing environmental impacts of digital are sidelined.\nThere are some ways people can find out more about responsible tech options. A 2017 guide by Greenpeace rated digital tech companies on their green credentials. It assessed a range of corporations, including some managing digital platforms, and others hosting data centres.\nBut while the guide is useful, it’s also limited by a lack of transparency, because corporations aren’t obliged to share information on how much energy is needed or supplied for their data centres.\nHOLDING BIG TECH ACCOUNTABLE\nThe responsibility to make our digital lives more sustainable shouldn’t lie solely with individuals.\nGovernments should provide a regulatory environment that demands greater transparency on how digital corporations use energy. Holding these corporations accountable should include reporting on whether they are improving the sustainability of their practices.\nOne immediate step could be for corporations that produce digital devices to move away from planned obsolescence. One example of this is when companies including Apple and Samsung manufacture smartphones that are not designed to last.\nDigital sustainability is a useful way to frame how digital technologies affect our environmental world.\nWe need to acknowledge that technology isn’t just a source of environmental solutions, but also has the potential for negative environmental impact.\nOnly then can we start to effectively transition to a more sustainable future that also includes digital technologies.\nJessica McLean is a senior lecturer in Geography at the Macquarie University.

      E-sports is a global game, the stakes are 'incredibly high': ONE Esports CEO
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Dota 2 has become one of biggest e-sports titles in the world, with prize money going into the millions.\nIn August, the world’s top teams played for a prize pool of more than US$34 million at The International (TI),\xa0the capstone event of the Dota 2 Pro Circuit. It was\xa0the largest\xa0pot\xa0of prize money offered at\xa0any e-sports tournament.\nTo tap on this growing mode of entertainment, a Singaporean firm is bringing professional e-sports to Southeast Asia.\nONE Esports, the online gaming arm of mixed-martial tournament organiser ONE Championship, is organising the Dota 2 World Pro Invitational competition this week.\xa0\nThe firm hopes to fill up 8,000 seats at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, said ONE Esports CEO Carlos Alimurung in an exclusive interview with CNA.\nIt also has strategies aimed at building\xa0on the gaming scene\xa0in Singapore, including launching a web portal solely focused on gaming.\n“It’s a global game, the stakes are incredibly high.\xa0There is rich potential for storytelling. The player base -\xa0the viewer base - is global, and ONE Esports’ aspirations are global,” said Mr Alimurung.\xa0\n“There is a multi-billion dollar opportunity for e-sports globally, so we’re going to go after it.”\nFULFILLING A NEED\nThe company\xa0said research showed them that 60 per cent of their fans who watch the live fighting tournaments by\xa0ONE Championship also took part in\xa0e-sports.\nIt decided to set up an e-sports arm this year.\nFor the Dota 2 World Pro tournament, Mr Alimurung said all 280 VIP tickets, which cost\xa0S$378 each,\xa0were snapped up within the first three weeks they were launched.\xa0\n“We are expecting a full house over the weekend, so we’re super bullish on the attendance and filling up the whole entire stadium. It is big,"" he said.\xa0\n""What we would say is, well, look, we’re bringing in the world’s best talent and therefore we need a big place, an iconic place to hold this kind of event.""\nSINGAPORE TOURNAMENT ATTRACTING ""ALL-STAR"" PLAYERS\nThe international e-sports market is competitively looking for talented players, and some are setting their sights on\xa0players in the region, said Mr\xa0Alimurung.\n“Like all businesses, it’s a war on talent, and in e-sports, it’s an incredibly flat and distributed player base,” he said.\nThis is why the event here has attracted some of the top teams in the world, even though the prize money is smaller compared to events in the Major Championship series, said the CEO.\nNine out of the 12 teams in the Singapore tournament, such as Team Secret - PSG.LGD\xa0and Evil Geniuses -\xa0have played in the big leagues, he added.\nThe World Pro Invitational prize pool is\xa0US$500,000, compared to US$34 million for TI this year.\nAccording to Mr Alimurung,\xa0this shows that there is interest from international players who want to come to Singapore and the region to compete.\xa0\n“The prize pool is enough to attract the world’s best teams, and we have them coming …(most) of the teams that are coming have participated in a previous TI. That has never been done in Singapore before,"" he said.\nBUILDING THE GAMING NETWORK IN SINGAPORE AND THE REGION\nTo connect with e-sports fans who are not easily reached via traditional media channels, ONE Esports plans to generate\xa0content to attract e-sport fans to engage with the brand.\xa0\nIt launched an online portal in April\xa0called OneEsports.gg, which showcases\xa0stories on professional players,\xa0cosplayers,\xa0e-sport businesses and others in the gaming scene.\nIt is a major project, with\xa0the firm pooling half of its team\xa0to focus on developing the online portal.\n“Everyone enjoys learning about pro players, and the drama and theatre of competition and rivalry, but that doesn’t mean that people like the cosplayers, or the people who are running the business side of e-sports, that their stories don’t deserve to be told. Or, even the fans’ stories,"" said Mr Alimurung.\xa0\n""Our aspiration is not only to be an e-sports news site, but to … peel the third or the fourth layer on e-sports.""\nThe CEO believes the ""storytelling"" portal will play\xa0a critical role\xa0in transforming the conversation around e-sports in Singapore and the region.\n“I personally believe the storytelling in e-sports can be vastly improved,” he said.\xa0\n“The storytelling is what gives the authenticity -\xa0gives the credibility -\xa0and it shows the community that you’re trying to celebrate and share the stories that are so deserving in this space.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     sports ']}"

      Deepfakes, nudes and the threat to national security
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: It looked, and sounded, like United States President Donald Trump taunting Belgian citizens about climate change.\n“As you know, I had the balls to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. And so should you,” he said, looking at the camera. “Because what you guys are doing right now in Belgium is actually worse.”\nIt provoked hundreds of comments in the first few days from angry Belgians directing their fury at Trump.\nBut that video last year was fake, created with “deepfake” technology by a Belgian political party that was out to redirect people to a petition calling on the Belgian parliament to take more urgent climate action.\nDeepfakes are created using artificial intelligence whereby an existing image is replaced with someone else’s likeness — a manipulated video.\nWhile it seems like a bit of entertaining video wizardry, these forgeries can make people say things they never did in real life, influence public opinion or even affect elections.\nAnd in a climate where misinformation feels rampant, this new technology has got some people scared, as the programme Why It Matters discovers. (Watch this episode here.)\nIT CAN BREED DISTRUST\nA recent study has shown that the number of deepfake videos almost doubled in nine months. Cybersecurity firm Deeptrace found 14,698 deepfake videos online in September, compared with 7,964 last December.\nDeepfakes “play a dangerous game with transparency, authenticity and trust”, creative agency We Are Social says on its website, and the real danger “lies in spreading fake news”.\nSome states, for example, use deepfake technology to disrupt a target, points out S Rajaratnam School of International Studies senior fellow Benjamin Ang.\nWATCH: How to spot a deep fake (3:22)\n“They won’t just put fakes on one side of the political story. They’ll put (fakes) on the other side as well,” he says, citing research done on national security issues.\nThis breeds distrust among the people, and in a worst-case scenario, “anger could escalate into violence, which then creates even more distrust”.\nBut even when a deepfake is identified as such, why do people get fooled by it?\nLim Sun Sun, head of humanities, arts and social sciences at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, explains that this is confirmation bias: The tendency to favour information and views consistent with one’s pre-existing beliefs about individuals or issues.\nThe fake Trump video is a successful example of social engineering, she says, because it “taps into the belief that people have about (him) being a climate change denier”.\nShe adds: “State-funded misinformation to advise (on) a certain position … is an age-old problem”.\nFor example, during the Japanese Occupation in Singapore, there were staged photographs — published in magazines — of the Japanese doing healthcare work, helping the sick and giving out rations.\n“It’s a form of propaganda in the sense that the Japanese Occupation government was trying to ... give the impression that they were doing a very good job of running Singapore,” says the professor.\nIT CAN REMOVE CLOTHES\nNowadays, as deepfake technology becomes more accessible, it is being used not only against politicians and public figures, but also to target women.\nArnaud Robin, We Are Social’s director of innovation for Singapore, notes that 96 per cent of the deepfake videos online are pornographic. “The faces of celebrities (are pasted) on porn videos,” he points out.\nThe earliest application of deepfake technology allowed for face swaps only. But developers, some anonymous, have since come up with apps such as DeepNude, which can remove clothes from women in photos for a small fee.\nWhile it shows inconsistent results, mostly failing with poorly lit or low-resolution photographs, it can be convincing if fed the right images.\nTake, for example, the bikini shots and alluring poses of teen model Naomi Huth on Instagram, where she has almost 10,000 followers, mostly men. Her kind of high-resolution photos work best for an app like DeepNude.\nShe thought nothing of her posts, however, until she learned about the dangers of deepfake from Why It Matters host Joshua Lim.\n“If this technology would be run on me, I’d feel very violated,” she says. “A lot of people who wouldn’t know me would probably believe (what they see). And that’s the scary part.”\nIf such deepfakes were to be shown all over social media, “that can destroy people’s lives”, adds the 19-year-old, who got “goosebumps” finding out that there are deepfake videos too.\nThat’s how scary that is because people will never know if it’s you any more.\nFIGHTING BACK\nTo combat deepfakes, Silicon Valley's tech companies and social networks are building tools like Google’s open-source database containing over 3,000 manipulated videos. It was released in September to help researchers better identify and take down deepfakes.\nStart-ups like Dessa are also working on detection tools, while Twitter is ironing out new rules to protect users from deepfakes.\nIn Singapore, local company Black Dot Research was set up last year to fact-check stories that are shared on social media without a second thought.\nIts founder Nicholas Fang says that while it is not hard to dispute and debunk a fake video of an actual person, it is a problem when there is insufficient time to do so.\nOn Polling Day, for example, a deepfake video could emerge, in which “one of the critical personalities” from one of the parties says something.\n“People have a couple of minutes to process this before they go and vote,” he cites. “That could be enough to tip certain people’s opinions over.”\nHis colleague Derek Low thinks nothing beats the public “having a good, strong gut instinct” for questioning whether something is real.\nBut there is also a flip side that worries Lim. “We already take what we receive and circulate on the Internet with a pinch of salt,” he says.\n“So deepfakes feel like yet another reason to dismiss what we see online. But that’s where the true danger lies, because in doing so, we might just, accidentally, dismiss the truth.”\nWatch the episode here.

      Thinking of gifting a tech device or accessory? Here’s what not to buy
  </h1>, 'text': 'I will never forget the worst holiday gifts I have received over the years.\nAmong them: A tech-accessory holder that lives between couch cushions. Countless Best Buy gift cards I never used. (More precisely, they were a bonus for Best Buy shareholders.) And the Chopula, an oddly shaped spatula designed to flip and chop food.\nThere’s no mystery behind why this lousy gift-giving happens. Many holiday purchases happen during Black Friday, when retailers slash prices to clear their inventory of unwanted junk. And that means a lot of dreck goes on sale.\nFor years, I have collaborated with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products, to warn shoppers about dubious Black Friday deals while advising them on how to score discounts on quality items.\nThis year, we are rounding up the worst tech products we often see presented as holiday gifts and are recommending superior alternatives, many of which may go on sale on Black Friday. Consider this a guide to steering away from presents that end up in landfills and toward buying what may bring your loved ones joy.\nPOWER ACCESSORIES\nDon’t buy: Sketchy brands.\nPower chargers and battery packs make popular gifts because they are theoretically very useful. Just about everyone owns a mobile device and could use extra juice throughout the day.\nBut it’s too bad that not all power accessories are created equal.\nSome charging cables from obscure brands fray easily or are slow at replenishing your phone. In rare cases, poorly made battery packs have the potential to explode. More often, battery packs are just frustrating to use: Over the years, I’ve tested many battery packs from unknown brands that were bulky and couldn’t recharge my phone even once.\nDo buy: Reliable brands like Anker and Jackery.\nOf the power accessories we have tested, these will make better gifts: For iPhones, Anker’s $10 PowerLine Lightning cables are durable and fast. For Android devices, Anker offers superb PowerLine II USB-C cables for US$20 (S$27).\nAs for battery packs, we recommend the US$36 Jackery Bolt, which has built-in charging wires for iPhones and Androids, and Anker’s US$32 PowerCore Slim, which fits easily in a pocket. Both can replenish a phone twice.\n“Not all power accessories are created equal.” – Brian X. Chen\nKITCHEN APPLIANCES\nDon’t buy: “Smart” kitchen gadgets.\nManufacturers are now making nearly every electronic appliance “smart” by adding an internet connection or a Bluetooth connection so it can wirelessly talk to your phone. These features usually drive prices up, tend to be glitchy and won’t help people cook better food. Smart kitchen appliances like the June Oven and Wi-Fi crockpots fall into this category.\n“Cooking is largely too hands-on and sensory based to make smart appliances all that useful,” said Marguerite Preston, Wirecutter’s senior kitchen editor.\nDo buy: The dumber Instant Pot.\nFor kitchen devices, err on the side of dumb appliances, like a reliable toaster oven from a well-known brand, such as the US$170 Panasonic FlashXpress or US$280 Cuisinart Chef’s Convection Toaster Oven. The Instant Pot, which costs around US$50 on Black Friday, is also an excellent device capable of pressure cooking and slow cooking – but avoid the model with Wi-Fi because its smartphone app works poorly.\n“For kitchen devices, err on the side of dumb appliances.” – Brian X. Chen\nTABLETS\nDon’t buy: Cheap tablets.\nPlenty of children ask their parents for tablets, and a popular holiday gift has been Amazon’s cheap Fire Tablet. For US$50, it’s a cost-effective solution to keeping kids’ hands off your fancy tablet.\nBut let’s be frank. For anyone who wants a tablet for work and play, the Fire is inadequate. It’s sluggish, the colours don’t look good, and it’s tied to Amazon’s ecosystem, which is focused on books and entertainment.\nDo buy: An iPad.\nIf you want to show someone you truly care, it may be time to shell out a bit more on a high-quality tablet like Apple’s iPad. The newest iPad starts at US$329, but retailers will most likely still be selling the previous-generation iPad – which remains a great tablet – for a deep discount. Look for the model with more storage (128 gigabytes), because it will hold more apps, games and photos in the long run.\n“If you want to show someone you truly care, it may be time to shell out a bit more.” – Brian X. Chen\nNETWORKING GEAR\nDon’t buy: Gear that is difficult to use.\nNetworking gear like routers is essential for connectivity in a home. But one of the worst gifts you can give is the type that creates headaches for the recipient. There are plenty of expensive, fast Wi-Fi routers that tech professionals love to geek out about, but for most of us, the devices are extremely confusing to set up.\nDo buy: Tech that will improve people’s lives, like Eero.\nA mesh Wi-Fi product would be a better gift for most people. It’s basically a system of multiple Wi-Fi stations that work together to blanket every corner of your home with a strong wireless data connection. Amazon’s Eero, which starts at US$99, is such a product. It is fast and easy to set up with an intuitive smartphone app.\n“One of the worst gifts you can give is the type that creates headaches for the recipient.” – Brian X. Chen\nAUDIO GEAR\nDon’t buy: Obscure, cheap brands.\nLike power accessories, audio gear such as earphones and speakers varies widely in quality. Bad earphones sound crummy and can damage people’s hearing. And many Bluetooth speakers sound as if they are playing music from a tin can.\nDo buy: Quality earphones and speakers from Jabra and 1More.\nYou can still pay little for good audio accessories for your loved ones, but the key is to stick with quality brands. There are many options with great sound, like Jabra’s US$100 Move headphones or, for US$30, 1More’s Piston Fit Bluetooth earbuds. Both products have warranties of at least a year.\n“You can still pay little for good audio accessories for your loved ones, but the key is to stick with quality brands.” – Brian X. Chen\nGIFT CARDS\nDon’t buy: Cards for stores where nobody shops.\nGift cards are a borderline thoughtless gift, and the worst ones confine your loved ones to buying from a narrow set of products that they may not want. I mentioned Best Buy gift cards earlier as an example; I never want them because as a person who is constantly testing new gadgets, I have no space for more.\nI would throw in Apple’s iTunes gift card in this category. Apple has phased out iTunes as a service. Sure, you can still buy iPhone apps with the card, but come on: iTunes isn’t a cool brand anymore.\nDo buy: A general-purpose card from Amazon.\nIf you give a gift card, go for something more versatile. Amazon gift cards can be applied toward a vast array of products. Even better is a generic Visa gift card, which can be used anywhere that accepts Visa card payments because it is essentially a prepaid debit card.\nOr there’s always a gift that will never be uncool: cash.\n“If you give a gift card, go for something more versatile.” – Brian X.

      Screwed up an e-wallet payment? Here’s how to get your money back
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: She recently bought a shirt in a shop, using mobile wallet DBS PayLah! That was when Tan Wen Hui found out that getting one’s money back — after a botched funds transfer — may not be so straightforward.\nShe had keyed in the wrong mobile number, sending the money to the wrong person. “I started to panic,” she recalled. “I didn’t bother to check (the number) because … I just wanted a very fast transaction.”\nThe 21-year-old contacted the bank, but it was unable to help her. So she messaged the recipient instead. “The person … was very nice. He actually PayLah! me back the amount,” she said. “The person could’ve just ignored my message.”\nShe was lucky to get her money back.\nDigital wallets are the second-most popular e-commerce payment method in Singapore, after credit and debit cards. But in terms of consumer protection, they may be one of the worst, as the programme Why It Matters finds out. (Watch this episode here.)\nWHOSE MONEY IS IT?\nThere are as many as 23 ways to e-pay in Singapore, such as via GrabPay and UOB Mighty.\nSeven in 10 Singaporeans use a digital wallet, according to business consultancy McKinsey and Co. And digital wallets account for 14 per cent of all e-commerce transactions here, representing sales of S$680 million, JP Morgan reported this year.\nThere are more than a million transactions a month on DBS PayLah!, for example. But if one transfers money wrongly to another account holder, the payer is advised to contact the recipient directly.\nDBS senior vice-president (Consumer Payments and Platforms) Tri Arini Melati explained that the bank cannot reverse such transactions instantly, as it needs to seek the recipient’s consent.\n“We aren’t able to … take the monies,” she said. “And we won’t be able to determine whether the case is really a wrong transfer.”\nThe payer, however, can see the mobile number that was wrongly typed in, she noted. “You can contact the recipient. And you’d be surprised that they’d acknowledge it and return your money.”\nThe incidence of wrong transfers is very low, she added, citing the fewer than 0.001 per cent who reach out to DBS for more help to contact the recipients.\nBut what if the recipient refuses to return the money? Loh Kia Meng, chief operating officer of law firm Dentons Rodyk, said the money still legally belongs to the payer.\n“You can take action against him to take back what’s rightfully yours,” he said. And anybody with the intention to use money that is not theirs could be jailed for up to two years and/or fined.\nSo long as the notification is sent to you, whether you threw it away (or) didn’t read it ... you’re deemed to have had notice of it.\nIn such cases, the payer can make a police report or sue the other party.\nTHE LEAST PROTECTION\nWhen it comes to refunds, the process is relatively straightforward and instantaneous if consumers had paid via credit card, PayPal or even PayLah! as demonstrated by Thomas Po, co-founder of online grocer Zairyo, which accepts a range of e-payment methods.\nBut it gets trickier if there is a dispute between the retailer and the consumer.\nA credit card user can ask the issuing bank for a chargeback, which is a reversal of the payment. If the card provider decides in the buyer’s favour, he gets the full sum back from the retailer.\nIf he used PayPal, he could dispute the transaction in his PayPal account.\nFor example, if an item does not arrive or is “significantly different” from how it was described, “all you have to do is let PayPal know”, said its Asia-Pacific head of information security, Phoram Mehta.\n“PayPal’s anti-fraud capabilities, artificial intelligence and people (would) investigate that case and … are able to refund you,” added the man whose job it is to ensure that users are not defrauded of their money.\nFor those who use mobile wallets, however, getting a refund when there is a dispute is not so easy.\n“It’s (at) the mercy of the merchant to decide whether or not to refund the customers. It’s (a matter of) goodwill,” said Po.\nFOR LOW-VALUE USE\nBut even as more consumers are using e-wallets, the number of online complaints from payers making wrong transfers has decreased, said Mark Cheng from financial portal MoneySmart.\nThis is because consumers have become more familiar with these payment platforms, which have also evolved over time, for example with the availability of peer-to-peer funds transfer service PayNow.\n“People can now transfer bank-to-bank much more easily,” he pointed out. “In the past, you (had to) put in a whole string of digits … nine to 10, I think.\n“I used to stare at my phone and scrutinise the numbers to make sure that I was keying (them) in correctly.”\nWhile the rise of mobile wallets has raised questions about the need for some kind of protection system for such peer-to peer transactions, this would have cost implications, said EY global emerging markets fintech leader Varun Mittal.\n“If you’re offering protection where a customer could say, ‘I didn’t do this transaction’, then you need to have a mechanism to service that request,” he said. “So either the merchant … or the consumer needs to pay.”\nMobile wallets are primarily focused on high-frequency, low-value use cases, such as food purchases, he cited. “The mobile wallet’s premise is that (and) not … let’s say, S$5,000 transactions. So that’s not what they’re designed for,” he added.\nWatch the episode here.

      Commentary: Life is humdrum. Virtual Reality life is little different
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: Just a few years ago, virtual reality (VR) was being showered with money. The industry raised an estimated US$900 million in venture capital in 2016.\nBut by 2018, that figure had plummeted to US$280 million.\nOculus – the Facebook-owned company behind one of the most popular VR headsets on the market – planned to deliver 1 billion headsets to consumers, but as of last year had sold barely 300,000.\nInvestments in VR entertainment venues all over the world, VR cinematic experiences, and specialised VR studios such as Google Spotlight and CCP Games have either significantly downsized, closed down or morphed into new ventures.\nWhat is happening?\nSome have voiced disdain with VR technology. Common complaints include expensive, clunky or uncomfortable hardware, and unimaginative or repetitive content.\nSceptics have compared VR experiences to the 3D television fad of the early 2010s.\nAs a VR researcher and developer, I understand the scepticism. Yet I believe in this technology, and I know there are “killer apps” and solutions waiting to be discovered.\nThe\xa0Western Sydney University hosted a global symposium on VR software and technology in November, where academics and industry partners from around the world discussed possible ways forward for VR and augmented reality.\nVIRTUAL REALITY, LITERAL HEADACHE\nOne problem discussed at the symposium is the fact that VR experiences often cause health-related issues including headaches, eye strain, dizziness, and nausea.\nDevelopers can partially deal with these issues at the hardware level by delivering balanced experiences with high refresh and frame rates.\nBut many developers are ignoring usability guidelines in the pursuit of exciting content. Gaming industry guidelines used by Epic, Oculus, Marvel and Intel recommend that games completely avoid any use of induced motion, acceleration or “fake motion”, which are often the main cause of discomfort and motion sickness.\nYet the vast majority of available VR experiences feature some kind of induced motion, either in the form of animation or by basing the experience on user movement and exploration of the virtual environment.\nI have met many first-time VR users who generally enjoyed the experience, but also reported “feeling wrong” – similar to enjoying the clarity of sound in noise-cancelling headphones but also having a “strange sensation” in their ears.\nKILLING CREATIVITY\nQueasiness is not the only turn-off. Another problem is that despite the near limitless potential of VR, many current offerings are sorely lacking in imagination.\nThe prevailing trend is to create VR versions of existing content such as games, videos or advertisements, in the hope of delivering extra impact. This does not work, in much the same way that radio play would make terrible television.\nA famous cautionary tale comes from Second Life, the virtual world launched in 2003 which failed spectacularly to live up to its billing. Real-world businesses such as Toyota and BMW opened branches in Second Life, allowing users to test-drive badly programmed versions of their virtual cars. They lasted mere months.\nWhy would we prefer a humdrum virtual experience to a real one? No one needs a virtual Toyota. We need to give users good reasons to leave their reality behind and immerse themselves in a new one.\nThere have been some notable successes. Beat Saber, made by Czech indie developers, is one of the few games that have explored the true potential of VR. It is also the only VR game to have grossed more than US$20 million.\nThe VR Vaccine Project helps to take the sting out of childhood needles, by combining a real-world vaccination with a superhero story in the virtual world, in which the child is presented with a magical shield at the crucial moment.\nI really hope VR is on its way to becoming more mainstream, more exciting, and less underwhelming. But we scientists can only present new technological solutions to help make VR a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.\nUltimately it is down to VR developers to learn from existing success stories and start delivering those “killer apps”. The possibilities are limited only by imagination.\nTomas Trescak is a senior lecturer in intelligent systems at Western Sydney University.

      Government accepts 5 measures to improve data security, to set up single contact for public to report breaches
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE:\xa0The public will soon have a single contact point to report Government data incidents like unauthorised copying or disclosures.\nThis will ensure “greater consistency” in the handling of data incidents across agencies, the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee said on Wednesday (Nov 27).\n“The central contact point will minimise confusion on where the public may lodge complaints on Government data incidents, and assure the public that an authoritative independent party would follow up on the complaint,” the committee wrote in its report.\nThe contact point is targeted to be ready in the next few months, and will comprise a website and an email to the Government Data Office (GDO), which currently receives reports from Government agencies on data incidents.\nThis follows the Government’s acceptance of the committee’s five wide-ranging recommendations to better protect citizens’ data. The committee is chaired by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also Minister-in-charge of Public Sector Data Governance.\nThe five recommendations are:\nThe Government targets to implement the measures in 80 per cent of Government systems by end-2021. The timeline for remaining 20 per cent which involve systems which are complex or require significant redesign is end-2023. In the interim, agencies will put in place appropriate measures to manage the relevant data risks.\xa0\n“The committee is confident that these measures will significantly enhance data security,” Mr Teo said on Wednesday.\n“And we will do our utmost to implement them thoroughly, expeditiously but thoughtfully. As you know … the threats are always rapidly evolving. So we will do our best to keep up with the threats to try and stay ahead of them.\n“But there's no 100 per cent guarantee that things will not happen. But if they do, we will also have a regime in place to respond to them expeditiously and effectively to minimise the damage.”\nMr Teo said the Digital Government Executive Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary of the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office, will oversee public sector data security and drive implementation of the committee’s recommendations.\nThe Government Technology Agency will also build capabilities in data protection and privacy preservation to deepen the Government’s expertise in these areas and keep up with the latest developments, he added.\nCOMPREHENSIVE REVIEW\nIn making the recommendations, the committee reviewed 336 out of a total of 2,840 Government systems and data management practices across all 94 public agencies to identify risk areas and common causes of incidents.\nThe committee discovered that three in four agencies had at least one finding of non-compliance with the policies and standards of an internal Government manual on data management.\nThe most common findings were in the areas of management and monitoring of privileged user accounts, user access reviews, encryption of emails with highly-sensitive data and extraction of production data.\nOf these non-compliant agencies, 64 per cent were rated “low-risk”, 23 per cent were rated “medium-risk” and the remaining 13 per cent were rated “high-risk”.\nThese agencies will rectify the inspection findings with validation from GovTech, the committee said.\nThe committee studied global and industry best practices and found areas for improvement in policies and practices:\nThe committee also compared the Government’s data protection standards alongside that of the private sector, and assessed the robustness of its recommendations by testing them against past data incidents.\n“The committee then checked and satisfied itself that the recommended measures would have prevented or minimised the impact of the past data incidents in the public and public healthcare sector,” Mr Teo said.\nRECENT DATA BREACHES\nThe Prime Minister’s Office announced on Mar 31 that it was forming the committee following several\xa0public data breaches.\nIn July 2018, 1.5 million SingHealth patients’ records – including that of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong – were accessed and copied, in what was the most serious breach of personal data in Singapore’s history.\nThis was followed by the online leak in January of the HIV-positive status and personal information of 14,200 people from Singapore’s HIV registry.\nAnd in March, the Health Sciences Authority revealed that the personal information of 808,201 blood donors was left exposed online for nine weeks the data was mishandled by one of its IT vendors.\nIn his letter to Mr Teo thanking the committee for its work, the Prime Minister said the Government takes its responsibility as a custodian of a vast amount of data “seriously”.\n“We need to use and share data as fully as possible to provide better public services. In doing so, we must also protect the security of the data and preserve the privacy of individuals, and yet not stifle digital innovation,” Mr Lee wrote.\n“This is especially so in healthcare, but it is true of every other field of Government too.”\nMr Teo said he does not expect the implementation of the measures to delay any Smart Nation initiatives, highlighting that the latter must go “hand in hand” with data security to gain the confidence of citizens and business users.\n“The (Smart Nation) projects that we are rolling out now, we go in clear-eyed that these would be targets, that we have to bake (data) security into the design,” said Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative Vivian Balakrishnan, who also sits on the committee.\n“If and when we detect that there are any critical threats, then clearly we will take a pause and we will review the situation before we move forward.”\nUPHOLDING CONFIDENCE\nIn July, the committee had also recommended that the Government immediately deploy three readily available measures to improve data security.\nThese include having a data file integrity verification system, strengthening password and encryption requirements across more types of data files, and introducing prompts before public officers send out emails with sensitive data.\nMr Teo said these measures were implemented in October, reiterating that the remaining measures will follow expeditiously so “Singaporeans can be confident that the Government takes data security seriously and will do the utmost to protect citizens’ data”.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     cybersecurity ']}"

      Number of technology-facilitated sexual violence cases more than doubled in 3 years: AWARE
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The number of cases involving ""technology-facilitated sexual violence"" seen by a care centre\xa0has more than doubled in the past three years, the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) said on Monday (Nov 25).\nAbout 15 per cent of the cases seen by AWARE\'s Sexual Assault Care Centre (SACC) in 2018 involved sexual violence facilitated by technology, said the head of the centre Anisha Joseph during a panel event organised by the advocacy group.\nAbout 150 people attended the event, which marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women as well as the one-year\xa0anniversary of AWARE’s Aim For Zero campaign against sexual violence.\nLast year, 124 of the 808 cases seen at the centre involved such technology-facilitated\xa0abuse -\xa0encompassing\xa0actions enabled by digital communications technology such as social media and messaging platforms, digital cameras and dating apps.\xa0\nThis compared to the 99 (out of 515) cases in 2017 and 46 (out of 338) cases in 2016.\n“These behaviours range from unwanted and explicit sexual messages and calls (including attempts to coerce sex or a relationship) to a specific category of image-based sexual abuse,” said AWARE.\nCases within the latter category include actions such as taking images without a subject’s consent -\xa0for example through “upskirting” -\xa0as well as threats to carry out such actions.\nSuch actions are not necessarily limited to strangers. Between 2016 and 2018, nearly half of such image-based sexual abuse cases seen by the centre were committed by an intimate partner, said AWARE.\xa0\nIn one case, a woman was harassed by a former partner whom she met online. After she stopped seeing him, the perpetrator threatened to reveal her intimate images to others, including her current partner.\nHe continued to stalk her and at one point, assaulted her. Even after she blocked him on all platforms, she remained\xa0worried he would\xa0act on his threats or show up at her house to hurt her.\xa0\nAWARE said she was hesitant to file a police report or take legal action because the images were taken during consensual sex and others told her it was her fault. She approached the SACC for help.\nAbout a quarter of image-based sexual abuse victims reached\xa0out to the centre within 72 hours of an incident over the three-year reporting period, with about\xa0half of such victims reaching out within a month.\n“This is unusually fast for cases seen by the centre - in 2018, for example, 58 per cent of cases came to SACC within a year of the incident,” said AWARE.\nMs Joseph said the possibility of an image being shared again and again could be a possible reason for such victims to come forward speedily.\n“So when it comes to image-based sexual abuse, the probability of sexual harassment happening again and again continues ... if my photo is shared once there is a possibility that it will be shared multiple times, which means multiple forms of victimisation by different perpetrators,” she told CNA.\xa0\n“The extent of the harm is quite a lot. So survivors, all they want to do is to stop this from happening. There is a possibility they come forward to ask for help much earlier because they know that if they don’t do anything about it, that it will create more problems for them.”\nINCREASED AWARENESS\nBetween 2016 and 2018, the total number of cases across all categories seen by SACC more than doubled from 338 cases to 808, with increased public awareness a possible factor, according to Ms Joseph.\n“It could be a combination of various reasons. The numbers could be increasing because of increased awareness of the issue and people reaching out for help,” she said.\xa0\n“It could be increased awareness of resources for help; we are the only centre in Singapore that provides specialised support services for survivors of sexual assault.\n“So when people start recognising these acts as an act of sexual abuse, sexual assault, and that there are places for help, then they might reach out to the centre.”\nShe also cited recent changes in legislation including the reform of the Penal Code as well as changes to the Protection from Harassment Act earlier this year as key steps in the right direction.\nPublic awareness of technology-facilitated sexual violence has been in the spotlight recently.\nEarlier this year, National University of Singapore (NUS) student Monica Baey took to social media to speak out against the online harassment by\xa0a fellow student who had filmed her in the shower at a university hostel.\xa0\nThe incident garnered huge public attention, and it led to NUS reviewing and revamping its policies towards sexual misconduct.\nSpeaking on the panel on Monday, Ms Baey addressed misconceptions about the gravity of such technology-facilitated abuse\xa0and called for the importance of recognising that such incidents can occur across a spectrum.\n“A lot of people feel technology-facilitated sexual violence is not the same as sexual assault, which is quite shocking to me,” she said.\xa0\n“I’ve come to realise it is so similar. Even though you haven’t been physically violated, it’s the same.”\nShe also talked about the importance of speaking up about such issues.\n“I feel like I’m just a normal person, just a survivor … but I think I was at the right place at the right time when my story blew up,” she said.\n“I hope people continue to strive to be someone who makes a small change to enable the rest of society to do so.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     AWARE ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: When is it okay to use the CGI of dead actors in new movies?
  </h1>, 'text': 'MELBOURNE: “To be dead,” wrote the 20th century French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, “is to be a prey for the living.”\xa0Even Sartre, though, would have struggled to imagine casting James Dean in a movie 64 years after the actor’s death.\nThe curious announcement that Dean, who died in a car crash in 1955 having made just three films, will star in a movie adaptation of Gareth Crocker’s Vietnam War novel Finding Jack, has been met with outrage.\nIt would be a remarkable CGI achievement for any studio to resurrect an actor who has been dead since the Eisenhower administration.\nTrue, the Star Wars movie Rogue One featured the late Peter Cushing “reprising” his role as Grand Moff Tarkin. But the new role given to Dean would reportedly be far larger and more complex. Cushing, at least, had already played Tarkin while he was alive.\nIn Finding Jack, “James Dean” will supposedly be starring in a film based on a novel written 80 years after he was born, set near the end of a war that started after he died. He will reportedly be reanimated via “full body” CGI using actual footage and photos; another actor will voice him.\nThe reaction to this goes beyond mere scepticism, however. Nor is it simply the now-familiar post-truth anxiety about no longer being able to tell what’s real and what isn’t. The rise of “deepfakes” presents a much greater threat on that front than bringing dead actors back to life.\nRECKONING WITH THE DIGITAL DEAD\nWhat’s at work here is another pervasive challenge of the online era: How we should live with the digital dead.\nPeople die online every day. Social media is increasingly full of electric corpses; at some point the dead will outnumber the living on platforms like Facebook.\nThis already poses a range of ethical and practical problems. Some of these are the subject of an Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into how we should deal with the digital assets of the dead and incapacitated.\nThese issues only get thornier once you add in the prospect of reanimation. For most of this decade, digital immortality was confined to press releases and fiction.\nA string of start-ups promised breathlessly to let you cheat death via AI-driven avatars, only to disappear when it became clear their taglines were better than their products. The Twitter app LivesOn’s “When your heart stops beating, you’ll keep tweeting” was undeniably clever.\nBe Right Back,\xa0a 2013 episode of the TV series Black Mirror, imagined a young woman who signs up for a service that brings her dead partner back to life using his social media footprint: First as a chat bot, then as a phone-based voice simulator, and finally as a lifelike automaton. It was brilliant, bleak television, but thankfully, it wasn’t real.\nThen in late 2015, 34-year-old Roman Mazurenko died in an accident in Moscow. As a tribute, his best friend, fellow tech entrepreneur Eugenia Kuyda, built the texts Mazurenko had sent her into a chat bot.\nYou can download Roman Mazurenko right now, wherever you get your apps, and talk to a dead man. Internet immortality might not be here yet, not quite, but it’s unsettlingly close.\nWHY WE FEAR DEATH\nSadly, it’s not an immortality we look forward to. When we fear death, one thing we particularly dread is the end of first-person experience.\nThink of the experience you’re having reading this commentary. Someone else could be reading exactly the same words at the same time. But their experience will lack whatever it is that makes this your experience.\nThat’s what scares us: If you die, that quality, what it’s like to be you, won’t exist anymore.\nBut what about living on for other people? The Mazurenko bot is clearly a work of mourning, and a work of love.\xa0\nRemembering the dead, wrote Soren Kierkegaard, is the freest and most unselfish work of love, for the dead can neither force us to remember them nor reward us for doing so.\nBut memory is fragile and attention is fickle.\nBETWEEN REMEMBRANCE AND EXPLOITATION\nIt seems reasonable that we might use our new toys to help the dead linger in the lifeworld, to escape oblivion a little longer. The danger, as the philosopher Adam Buben put it, is that memorialisation could slip into replacement.\nAn interactive avatar of the dead might simply become a stopgap, something you use to fill part of the hole the dead leave in our lives. That risks turning the dead into yet another resource for the living. The line between remembrance and exploitation is surprisingly porous.\nThat is what’s ultimately troubling about resurrecting James Dean. To watch a James Dean movie is to encounter, in some palpable way, the concrete person. Something of the face-to-face encounter survives the mediation of lens, celluloid and screen.\nTo make a new James Dean movie is something else. It’s to use the visual remains of Dean as a workable resource instead of letting him be who he is.\xa0\nWorse, it suggests that James Dean can be replaced, just as algorithm-driven avatars might come to replace, rather than simply commemorate, the dead.\nWe’ll know in time whether Finding Jack can live up to its likely premature hype. Even if it doesn’t, the need to think about how we protect the dead from our digital predations isn’t going away.\nPatrick Stokes is an associate professor of philosophy in Deakin University.

      Digital clutter’s messing with your mind — here are 5 ways to ‘KonMari’ it
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When one thinks about clutter, the first thing that comes to mind is physical mess. But we often do not think about the thousands of emails, photos and documents we hoard on our electronic devices and online.\nThis mountain of digital clutter can affect us in other ways, and even creates anxiety.\nDr Jessie Chua, a senior clinical psychologist with the Resilienz Clinic, compares digital clutter to physical clutter: Both can cause a similar amount of stress on one’s mind.\n“It takes up that same amount of space that you can use for, say, creativity or for focus on work,” she explained. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s visible or not visible; it’s still in the brain.”\nThe brain’s frontal lobe sometimes needs space to help one think and plan. But when it becomes overwhelmed, it triggers another part of the brain called the amygdala.\n“This is the part of the brain that generates emotions — the most dominant one is anxiety,” she said.\nWhen there’s so much clutter, for example emails, this would continue to fire to a point where the body gets overwhelmed with anxiety.\nDigital clutter not only affects an individual’s well-being, but also constitutes a cybersecurity risk, as the programme Why It Matters discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nRUNNING OUT OF SPACE\nA research paper presented last year said the emergence of digital devices like smartphones, engagement in social media networks and access to affordable digital storage has increased “the propensity of an individual to acquire and store digital content without carefully considering its repercussions”.\nGlobally, the digital data generated each day amounts to at least two to three exabytes (two to three billion gigabytes), according to Associate Professor Anupam Chattopadhyay from Nanyang Technological University’s School of Computer Science and Engineering.\n“We’re sending more than a few thousands of tweets every minute (and) uploading hundreds and thousands of photos on Instagram,” he said.\nAt this rate, the world will run of storage space in future, he warned. “I calculated … this number to be 200 years at most.”\nCARBON FOOTPRINT\nData storage also places a burden on the environment. A significant amount of energy is used in running a data centre, including the cooling equipment to maintain the facility’s temperature.\nIt is estimated that by 2030, data centres in Singapore will account for up to 12 per cent of the country’s total energy demand, ST Telemedia Global Data Centres states on its website.\nAccording to the Infocomm Media Development Authority, the 10 largest data centre operators in Singapore consume as much energy as 130,000 typical Housing and Development Board households.\nWorldwide, data centres account for two per cent of greenhouse gas emissions today. That is the same carbon footprint as the aviation sector’s 895 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. But the information technology sector’s emissions are projected to exceed that.\nPRIVACY RISKS\nHaving too many digital files also creates cybersecurity problems, given that many people store private documents and photos on their devices. The danger is that information can be compromised in a data breach.\nHorangi Cyber Security chief executive officer Paul Hadjy said one must be cognisant when granting apps access to things like the camera roll on one’s phone.\nThe best strategy is to update one’s apps every so often and remove apps that one is not using.\n“Sometimes app companies go out of business, and if you keep those older apps … over time, vulnerabilities get discovered,” he explained. “Those apps become more susceptible and allow access to things like your photos.”\nSo here are five tips on organising and minimising digital clutter:\n1. CATEGORISE AND DELETE\nDecluttering queen Marie Kondo tidies up physical spaces like no other, and one of her KonMari consultants in training, Amanda Ling, suggested the Konmari method for digital clutter too: Put everything in a similar category into a single folder.\nThis could help one to realise how much data one has accumulated. From there, one can sort out the items to delete from the ones to keep — the ones that “spark joy”.\nFor example, she suggested to Why It Matters host Joshua Lim that he delete the apps he does not use regularly, as his smartphone contained many apps, of which some were similar.\n“If you find that you really need (an app), then just re-download it. It’s just a click away,” she said.\n“Sometimes when you limit the choices a little bit, it can give you some clarity in deciding which is best for you.”\nOne should review one’s digital files and delete those that are no longer needed also to avoid being compromised by hackers, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) says on its website.\nThis includes files stored on devices as well as online and portable storage.\n2. KEEP YOUR EMAIL INBOX CLEAN\nEmail accounts, too, can contain sensitive information such as reset passwords. So the CSA advises: “Deleting emails that you no longer require would reduce the amount of information that would be compromised, even if your email accounts were hacked.”\nBeyond deleting emails, Ling suggested taking the time to also unsubscribe from emails that are of no value, since being bombarded with many emails, notifications and content each day can affect one’s focus and productivity.\n“It really is about keeping track and being more intentional,” she said.\nPeople might think digital minimalism is too extreme. It’s actually more extreme with the way … we’re exposing ourselves, day to day, (to the consumption of digital content).\n3. ARCHIVE OFTEN\nHaw-San Au-Yong, a professional organiser with Edits Inc who helps to people declutter their physical and digital spaces, suggested taking the time to create folders and archive items.\n“Alerts can be set up with filters to go directly into a folder, instead of them cluttering up your inbox, so you can see the more important things that you need to take action on,” she said.\nFolders and archiving also make a difference to the number of things seen on one’s desktop, as well as the number of electronic bookmarks.\n4. SEND THEM TO THE CLOUD\nTo reduce the amount of digital baggage on one’s devices, one can turn to cloud storage, such as Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive, advises the Government Technology Agency. But remember to categorise things properly in cloud storage too.\n5.\xa0 CLOSE UNNECESSARY ONLINE ACCOUNTS\nFinally, delete online accounts that one no longer accesses, as well as the data stored in the account. And revoke any prior permissions granted to the company that provided the service, says the CSA.\nThis reduces the risk of information exposure if the company suffers a data breach. For the remaining accounts, it is advisable to review the privacy settings and permissions, especially if the service is accessing information it should not require.\nWatch the episode here.

      Alibaba, Aramco share sale bonanza fails to deliver banks fee windfall
  </h1>, 'text': 'HONG KONG:\xa0A late-year rush of giant global share sales led by Alibaba\'s US$13 billion Hong Kong listing and Aramco\'s US$26 billion initial public offering is failing to deliver an equivalent payday for equities bankers.\nFilings on Thursday (Nov 21) revealed 17 banks will split up to US$32.3 million for Alibaba Group\'s Hong Kong deal, which will raise up to US$12.9 billion for the Chinese e-commerce giant.\nEarlier this week, sources told Reuters that banks working on Saudi Aramco\'s IPO would split fees worth 0.35 per cent of the amount raised, meaning at the top of its pricing range, raising US$25.6 billion, fees would reach US$90 million.\nThe numbers pale in comparison to the US$300 million banks made from Alibaba\'s own record IPO of US$25 billion in 2014. The record fee payout was the US$550 million banks earned for the US$19.6 billion IPO of Visa in New York in 2008.\nEquity capital markets activity typically accounts for about a quarter of global investment banking fees, but capital-raising in 2019 is running at its lowest level since 2012 as a series of high-profile pulled deals and soggy floats have weighed on sentiment even as many indices hit record highs.\nOffice sharing start-up WeWork was forced to pull its IPO in September and seek a rescue deal after investors balked at its valuation.\nThe deal\'s failure was seen as a blow to other IPO hopefuls, already weakened by heavy falls in earlier high-profile deals such as the ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber , which have both fallen by at least a third since floating.\nWorldwide, companies have sold shares worth US$574.7 billion so far this year, according to Refinitiv data, 19.7 per cent\xa0below levels this time last year. Those figures include Alibaba but not Aramco, which is yet to price its deal.\nALIBABA LISTING\nUntil Aramco prices its IPO, Alibaba ranks as the world\'s largest ECM deal this year, ahead of Uber\'s New York IPO which raised US$8.1 billion and paid banks fees of US$106 million.\nSources involved in Alibaba\'s latest transaction said the Hong Kong listing was always going to pay far less than an equivalent IPO because of the company\'s high profile and five years of investor familiarity with it via its New York listing.\nAlibaba also held no roadshow of investor meetings - a typical feature of large deals and an organisational headache for leading banks.\n""It’s one of the largest companies in the world, investors already know the story. The company had its quarterly results - people understand this company,"" said one banker involved with the deal.\xa0\nChina International Capital Corp (CICC) and Credit Suisse\xa0lead the deal which launched last week and priced on Wednesday at a 2.9 per cent\xa0discount to its US-listed shares.\nCitigroup Inc, JP Morgan Morgan Stanley were joint global co-ordinators while HSBC and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) also took senior roles.\nThursday\'s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed Alibaba would pay investment banking fees of US$28.1 million for the sale of 500 million shares.\nThis would rise to US$32.3 million if a so-called overallotment of an additional 75 million shares are issued, which bankers think will occur.\nThe fee split between the banks was not listed in the SEC documents but it is accepted industry practice that co-sponsors are paid the most and the remaining banks\' fees are dependent on the amount of shares sold.\nAlibaba\'s Hong Kong stock is due to start trading next Tuesday.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Alibaba ', '     finance ', '     Hong Kong ', '     technology ']}"

      5G is more than just faster download speeds, can make lives 'much better': Iswaran
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The move to 5G networks here has the potential to make work more efficient and productive and make lives much better, said Minister for Communications and Information S\xa0Iswaran in an interview with CNA938 on Wednesday (Nov 20).\nIn October, Mr Iswaran announced that 5G coverage – the fifth generation of high-speed mobile Internet, which will begin rolling out in Singapore by next year – will be available across at least half the island by 2022.\nSpeaking to Singapore Today hosts Lance Alexander and Melanie Oliviero, Mr Iswaran acknowledged that the discussion around such technologies can be “a little bit esoteric” as many may not be aware of what it entails.\nFor the average consumer, the switch to 5G, expected to be 20 times faster than existing 4G networks, will mean faster download speeds for videos and mobile gaming, he noted.\nHowever, the most significant impact of the move to 5G will be on industries.\nThe new networks will result in “much higher data flow rates” and be able to support “a lot more sensors and devices”, he said.\n“So if you want to have a smarter transportation system, which will benefit all our citizens, 5G can help. If you want to have a smarter manufacturing factory floor with equipment, automation and so on, 5G makes a difference.”\nCiting the example of container port operator PSA - which is currently testing the use of automated guided vehicles at its terminals - Mr Iswaran said the move to 5G would facilitate the “almost complete automation” of its operations at the future Tuas megaport.\nNoting 5G is still new, \xa0Mr Iswaran said the authorities here are still working to “curate the solutions” to challenges posed by the adoption of the new technology.\nWhile it is possible that different countries such as the United States and China may adopt competing 5G standards, such a situation would not be beneficial to anyone, he said.\nComparing the possibility to defunct mobile networks like GSM and CDMA, which were used in different countries, Mr Iswaran said a return to such a situation would be “cumbersome and clunky”.\n“I think nobody wants that. Certainly not countries like Singapore and so on, but I think even the Americans and the Chinese would not want that because the whole advantage of the technology is when you can communicate and interoperate.”\nSMART NATION EFFORTS\nWhen asked about Singapore’s placing first among 102 cities in the inaugural IMD Smart Cities Index – published last month by Swiss business school IMD and the Singapore University of Technology and Design – Mr Iswaran said the country is not motivated by the desire for rankings on such “league tables”.\n“It's not about tech for the sake of tech, or Smart Nation for the sake of being on the top of the league here,” he said.\n“It's really about how it makes a difference for our citizens, and how it makes a difference for our companies.”\nSingapore’s Smart Nation drive is an ongoing journey, he said, noting “a lot of work needs to be constantly done” as technology continues to change.\nWhen asked how the information and communications technology workforce here might be impacted by an economic downturn, Mr Iswaran noted the sector has been fairly resilient.\nThe sector has had a “strong growth rate”, with an annualised nominal growth rate of about 8.3 per cent between 2016 and 2018, he added.\n“The total employment in the sector is well over 200,000, and what we see is there's continuing demand. In fact, the job creation in this sector is one of the strong parts.”\nThe sector is “holding up well” and offers great opportunities, he said, adding both tech companies as well as those from other industries need people with capabilities in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence and data protection.\nCountries such as China and the United States see opportunities in Southeast Asia, and they see Singapore as a launchpad into the region.\n“So I would say the prospects are good, but we shouldn't be complacent and we have to work at making full use of it.”\nEditor’s Note: A previous version of this story quoted Minister Iswaran as saying that the information and communications technology sector had an annualised nominal growth rate of about 8.2 per cent between 2016 and 2018.

      Tech should improve your life, not detract from it: Samsung Galaxy Fold designer
  </h1>, 'text': 'These days, smartphones have become such an indispensable and ubiquitous part of our daily lives that we hardly stop to marvel at the time and effort that goes into cramming that much technology into a pocket-sized device.\nWhile consumers appreciate its pocket-sized portability, they were resigned to the fact that tablets, laptops and even desktops were preferable when they needed to toggle between complex computing tasks or run several apps simultaneously, or just watch Netflix without having to squint.\nThat is, until Samsung launched the world’s first foldable mobile device, the Galaxy Fold, in September.\n\n\nBilled as “a device unlike any before” and “the biggest breakthrough since the mobile phone”, the Fold ushers in a new era in mobile computing where flexible OLED screens make it possible to transform your phone into a tablet, and vice versa. Designed to withstand more than 200,000 folding and unfolding actions, its Multi-Active Window feature can support three active apps simultaneously when opened, making it the first-of-its-kind on the market.\xa0\nIts App Continuity feature allows for seamless transitions between the device’s smaller 4.6-inch screen (when closed), to its larger 7.3-inch screen (when opened). It also boasts six camera lenses — a world first, with a 16MP lens and a pair of 12MP lenses on the back; a 10MP camera on the front; and a 10MP and 8MP dual lens on the inside.\xa0\nGranted, the Samsung Galaxy Fold had its initial April 2019 launch postponed due to screen issues in its review sets, such as people peeling off the protective layer, thinking it was a screen protector. But all seems forgiven, seeing as the improved iteration was sold out in several cities during its eventual September 2019 launch, and despite it costing S$3,000.\nThe man behind the device is Kang Moon Kim, principal designer from the Next Generation Product Design Group for Samsung Electronics’ Mobile Communications.\n\n\nFocused on new product design, Kim was also key in designing several of the tech giant’s most renowned flagship smartphone devices, including the Galaxy Note8, S7 edge and S7, products which went on to garner industry accolades such as the Good Design Award, the iF Design Award and the IDEA award.\nHe has more than 90 design patents under his belt, with 14 awarded just for the Galaxy Fold alone.\n“Our design philosophy at Samsung begins with thinking about how we can deliver new and innovative technologies to users,” Kim told CNA Luxury via email. “We design each product to ensure that the technology fits naturally in a consumer’s life to solve problems and enriches their lifestyle through new product experiences. Galaxy Fold was designed for users who want an extraordinary device, for those who demand the best and want it on a bigger screen without the bulk.”\nHis team began by focusing on why consumers need a foldable device. “Now, more than ever, smartphones are used to consume media and accomplish tasks, causing a need for a larger screen without the added bulk that comes with it,” he observed.\n“By creating a new form factor that didn’t exist before, we wanted to ensure the device offered an intuitive and familiar experience. For these reasons we developed Galaxy Fold’s form factor, a book-like folding design that opens smoothly and satisfyingly clicks when closed, while protecting the display from scratches.”\nFrom there, the team created hundreds of design sketches that reflect specific scenarios, and developed over a thousand prototypes based on their observations of consumer lifestyles and behaviours.\nThey then tested the prototypes in different forms and evaluated the design by using them every day, identifying points where improvements were needed.\nA key part of getting the design right was, in Kim’s words, “Ensuring the experience was smooth, comfortable and satisfying during every moment of use. Throughout this process, we were determined to inspire consumers and provide a more meaningful mobile experience. It was important that the phone was balanced in the users’ hand and featured a luxurious design.”\nBy taking various hand sizes into consideration, the device’s dimensions and ratio were optimised for one or two-handed use, which align with the various functionalities the Galaxy Fold provides, such as multi-tasking.\nEvery dimension of metal and glass features an identical volume and shape – from the front and back of the device when folded, to the back of the device when unfolded. By evenly distributing the same weight of internal materials on the right and left sides, the device feels even and balanced. The fingerprint scanner fits exactly where the thumb falls, so unlocking the phone is as intuitive as unfolding it. With six camera lenses in total, the Galaxy Fold has the flexibility to capture a moment, no matter how the device is held, Kim explained.\nA double-anodising process was applied to the metal portion of the front cover to create a consistent look from the display to the edge of the body, while a flat diamond cutting process created a shiny hinge surface, Kim added, noting that “the methods add a premium and refined design to the hinge, while unifying the hinge and body’s appearance”.\nAnd what about his personal design philosophy? “I draw inspiration from the world around me and how consumers interact with the products most important to them. For example, with the Galaxy Fold, we drew inspiration from several objects including books, magazines and laptops and analysed their usability… [and] we landed on a design that delivered easy one-handed operation while giving consumers the immersive, big-screen experience they wanted.\n“To me, the best thing about technology is access to endless possibilities and the ability to create a connected and meaningful experience for users. And the worst thing about it, is the fast-paced environment it creates for consumers, which may seem overwhelming for some. This is why it is important to create products that are user-friendly and can improve their lives, rather than detract from it,” he concluded. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Tech ', '     technology ', '     Samsung ', '     Profiles ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'TOKYO: The Japanese government is determined to promote cashless payments and has set a policy target to reach 40 per cent use of cashless payment by 2027, up from 18.4 per cent in 2015.\nThis still lags far behind other countries such as South Korea and China, each with a higher rate of cashless transactions totalling 89.1 per cent and 60 per cent respectively.\nThe government’s outlook on promoting a cashless society includes the issuance of a policy document titled “Cashless Vision” last year, and the start of a massive subsidy programme to promote cashless payments in October 2019.\xa0\nThis subsidy aims to promote the transition to cashless payments, while also mitigating the effects of Japan’s consumption tax hike from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, which also came into effect the same month.\nParallel to government initiatives, Japanese consumers are witnessing fierce competition among cashless payment providers. This particular market has seen the entrance of a significant number of smartphone-based payment providers such as PayPay, LINE Pay and Merpay.\xa0\nThis is in addition to traditional cashless methods such as Suica or Pasmo cards for public transportation, and various brands of credit cards.\nThis raises the question of why the Japanese government and providers are so eager to promote cashless payments, and how likely it is that their attempts will succeed.\nRESTORING JAPAN’S HIGH-TECH REPUTATION\nSince its rapid growth in the 1970s, Japan has enjoyed a strong reputation as a country at the forefront of high-tech innovation. This reputation is a result of a successful manufacturing industry, especially in automobiles and electronics.\nIn contrast, the services sector has been regarded as a less competitive division of the Japanese economy. For example, the Japanese economy failed to foster technology start-ups in the global software and IT services industry.\nIn another example, despite the cutting-edge innovations that led to the first internet-connected cellphone architecture “i-mode” in 1999, the system has never become a global standard. In contrast to Japan’s high level of scientific research, social adaptation and global business strategies have been long-standing challenges to Japanese innovation.\nIn addition, another factor that has encouraged leaders to take a bold step towards a cashless society is Chinese competition in technological innovation.\nSince 2010, the Chinese tech industry has exhibited massive advancements in the adoption of cutting-edge technology in various services from cashless payments to ride sharing and online to offline retail.\nOne particular service that attracted Japanese attention was the use of the QR code (originally invented by a Japanese company), provided through Alipay or WeChat Pay.\xa0\nThis innovation coincided with a rapid increase of inbound tourists from China into Japan — now, the logos of Alipay and WeChat Pay can be observed in many Japanese retail stores.\nThe exposure to Chinese cashless payment options has caused a sense of crisis in Japan and a fear that the Japanese economy is falling behind.\nDriven by this sense of crisis and expected business opportunities, cashless payment has become key to reviving Japan’s reputation as a leader in cutting-edge technology. The Japanese government has decided to invest 280 billion yen (US$2.5 billion) to subsidise retailers and consumers who use cashless payments.\nOBSTACLES TO CASHLESS PAYMENT ADOPTION\nAlthough there is an expectation that cashless payments present unique business opportunities, there are several key barriers Japan must overcome before it becomes a cashless society, and these factors also explain why Japan has been so heavily cash dependent.\nThe first challenge is the high cost of adoption for retailers. One of the reasons for the success of QR code based payments in China is the low cost of investment and transaction fees. It requires only conventional smartphones or paper QR-codes for retailers.\nIn contrast, contactless-card payments in Japan require a significant investment in equipment and payment of transaction fees. While government subsidies sufficiently lower costs to ensure the transition to cashless payments, it is unclear whether subsidies are a sustainable option.\nAnother barrier to the penetration of cashless payments is perceived inconvenience. Cashiers in retail stores are well-trained and can complete a payment with cash in just a few seconds.\nOn the other hand, smartphone-based systems require several steps to finalise payments. The benefits of cashless payments need to be made more desirable and integrated with other internet services.\nThe consumer perception of risks associated with cashless payments is another key challenge. Research has shown that a significant portion of Japanese consumers prefer cash because they fear overspending with cashless methods.\nSecurity is also a common concern among consumers, given that security breaches and improper use of personal data have frequently been reported across Japan.\nSoichiro Takagi is an associate professor at the Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies at the University of Tokyo.

      Facebook says AI getting better at spying unwanted content
  </h1>, 'text': 'SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook on Wednesday (Nov 13) said that its software is getting more skilled at spying banned content at the social network, then working with humans to quickly remove terrorist videos and more.\n""While we err on the side of free expression, we generally draw the line at anything that could result in real harm,"" Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said during a briefing on the company\'s latest report on ferreting out posts that violate its policies.\n""This is a tiny fraction of the content on Facebook and Instagram, and we remove much of it before anyone sees it.""\nFacebook has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically spot banned content, often before it is seen by users, and human teams of reviewers who check whether the software was on target.\nFacebook has more than 35,000 people working on safety and security, and spends billions of dollars annually on that mission, according to Zuckerberg.\n""Our efforts are paying off,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Systems we built for addressing these issues are more advanced.""\nWhen it comes to detecting hate speech, Facebook software now automatically finds 80 per cent of the content removed in a massive improvement from two years ago, when nearly all such material was not dealt with until being reported by users, according to the California-based firm.\nNETTLING NUANCE\nZuckerberg noted that hate speech is tougher for AI to detect than nudity in images or video because of ""linguistic nuances"" that require context that could make even common words menacing.\nAdd to that videos of attacks driven by bias against a race, gender or religion could be shared to condemn such violence rather than glorify it.\nPeople at Facebook continue to try to share video of a horrific mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, with social network systems blocking 95 per cent of those attempts, according to executives.\nA lone gunman opened fire on two mosques in the city of Christchurch killing and wounding scores of Muslims in March, broadcasting the assaults live on Facebook.\nFacebook has terrorism experts as part of a team of more than 350 people devoted to preventing terrorist groups from using the social network, according to head of global policy management Monika Bickert.\nSystems honed to find and delete banned content on Facebook are being used also at Instagram, which has ramped up efforts to filter out content likely to encourage suicide or self harm while allowing people to share such traumatic experiences in the spirit of recovery or healing,\nRules put in place recently at Instagram added drawings and other fictional content to the list to a ban on images that might encourage suicide or self harm.\nThe Facebook-owned image and video sharing service early this year clamped down on images of self-injury after a British teen who went online to read about suicide took her own life in 2017.\nThe 14-year-old\'s social media history revealed that she followed accounts about depression and suicide.\nThe case sparked a vigorous debate in Britain about parental control and state regulation of children\'s social media use.\nInstagram has never allowed posts that promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.\nWith a rule change early this year, Instagram began removing references to non-graphic content related to people hurting themselves from its searches and recommendation features.\nThe measures were meant to make such images more difficult to find for depressed teens who might have suicidal tendencies.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Facebook ', '     technology ']}"

      Love of cash hinders India's move to digital economy
  </h1>, 'text': 'SATARA, India: India\'s dependency on cash may slow the country\'s transition to digital payments despite large numbers of Internet and mobile phone users.\nFor many citizens living in rural areas, cash is still the bedrock of daily existence because of a lack of facilities.\nSudhir Shinde, a farmer from Satara district in India\'s western state of Maharashtra says he withdraws more money from his bank than required as the money vending machine in his village has not been operational for months.\n""If I need money urgently, I must make a 32km\xa0trip to Satara town, which is not always possible,"" said the 37-year-old sugarcane farmer Shinde, while buying fertilisers for his winter-sown crops.\n""I always keep money in hand assuming family emergencies like hospitalisation or any other such urgent requirements.""\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi backed a shock ruling in November 2016 to outlaw 86 per cent\xa0of cash in circulation to target undeclared ""black money"" and fight corruption.\nThe demonetisation got rid of old 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes and Modi said that would boost the country\'s digital economy, unearth unaccounted wealth and reduce the use of cash.\nBut 99.3 per cent\xa0of the junked currency is back in the banking system, suggesting that only a minuscule portion was unaccounted illicit money or fake currency notes, and India\'s addiction to cash is now, perhaps stronger than ever.\nCASH WANTED\nOne of the key objectives of the note ban was to discourage the use of cash, but India continues to see a surge in currency in circulation even as economic growth has slowed to a six-year low.\nCentral bank data shows that since the controversial demonetisation gambit, currency in circulation has grown, rising 17 per cent\xa0to 21.1 trillion rupees (US$295.7 billion) as of the end of March 2019.\nThe ratio of currency in circulation to GDP has risen to 11.23 per cent\xa0as of March 2019 up from 8.69 per cent\xa0at the end of March 2017.\nTo be sure, digital transactions have grown, rising 19.5 per cent\xa0in value in 2018/19 and 22.2 per cent\xa0in 2017/18, the Reserve Bank of India said in a report.\nOn whether India\'s efforts to move to electronic payments has been slow, the central bank noted what it said in a statement last week.\nTo promote digital payment, the RBI has established ""state of the art payment systems that are efficient, convenient, safe, secure and affordable"" that has resulted in a rapid growth in retail digital payment systems.\nMeanwhile, it will promote the use of e-payments for parking, fuel and toll collection, and has ordered banks not to charge bank customers for online transactions in the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system from January 2020.\nAnecdotal evidence, however, suggests people in Asia\'s third-largest economy prefer cash for various reasons, including to avoid paying higher taxes after a national sales tax was implemented in mid-2017 and higher charges from retailers.\nSmaller stores who don\'t enjoy high volume sales often charge customers extra, to make up for what they must pay the service partners for electronic transactions.\nHigher operating costs have also led to a slowdown in opening of new ATMs, which has led to cash hoarding.\nIndia has the fewest ATMs per 100,000 people among BRICS nations, according to the International Monetary Fund. Banks hobbled with bad debts have struggled to absorb the cost of software and equipment upgrades mandated by the central bank last year, along with higher land costs in the cities.\nOther factors such as the country\'s rural-urban divide have also affected the migration to electronic payments.\n""Digital economy has certainly gained momentum in metros, cities and to some extent in semi-urban belts. But it has not spread to rural belts or the informal sector where financial illiteracy is the issue,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings.\n""It is difficult to predict when the shift would happen because general education and financial education are different things,"" she added.\nIndia is the world\'s second-largest Internet and mobile phone market by number of users, trailing only China. However, a survey conducted by social media firm LocalCircles shows a large number of people still prefer cash transactions over digital with an average of 27 per cent\xa0people having paid for 50-100 per cent\xa0of purchases over the last 12 months without a receipt.\nWith the start of the goods and services tax (GST), tax on goods such as gold and silver was raised, prompting buyers and sellers to opt for cash transactions.\n""Many small jewellers sell gold without receipts and consumers are also happy as they avoid paying 3 per cent\xa0GST, which is a huge amount in the case of gold,"" said a Mumbai-based jeweller, who declined to be identified.\nIndia raised import taxes on gold to 12.5 per cent\xa0in July from 10 per cent, which increased margins for gold smugglers. Many small jewellers sell smuggled gold in cash at a discount and pocket the profits, the jeweller said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     India ', '     technology ']}"

      Singapore rolls out national strategy on artificial intelligence for ‘impactful’ social, economic benefits
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: By 2022,\xa0people living in Singapore will be able to report municipal issues via a chatbot that asks for details in real time and automatically identifies the correct government agency in charge.\nThis will be made possible by artificial intelligence (AI), which is also set to power a tool that helps in the detection of diabetic eye disease and an automated marking system for English in primary and secondary education by the same year.\nMore initiatives tapping on AI technologies, such as machine learning and computer vision, are in the pipeline over the next decade, according to five projects unveiled on Wednesday (Nov 13) as part of Singapore’s new “National AI Strategy”.\nThe new strategy, which maps out how Singapore will develop and use AI to transform the economy and improve peoples’ lives, was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat at the final day of the “Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF) x the Singapore Week of Innovation and TeCHnology (SWITCH)\xa0Conference”.\nDescribing it as the next step in Singapore’s Smart Nation Journey, Mr Heng said: “Countries will need to keep pace with technology, and harness it to tackle common challenges and national priorities.”\nAI is one of the new frontiers in technology, with its applications already present in peoples’ daily lives such as AI chatbots and robo-advisors.\n“Singapore is ready to deploy AI at a national scale,” he said, adding how the Government has committed more than S$500 million to fund AI activities under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) plan.\nAs a start, Singapore will embark on five national projects covering the areas of transport and logistics, smart cities and estates, healthcare, education, as well as safety and security.\nThese projects aim to use AI to address key national challenges and deliver “impactful social and economic benefits to Singaporeans”, said a press release from the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO).\nMore areas where AI can be applied to deliver impact will be identified, it added, as Singapore develops the national strategy “iteratively” in response to a rapidly-changing technology landscape and seize new opportunities brought about by AI.\nBeyond that, five “key enablers” will also be developed to drive AI innovation and adoption across the economy.\nOne of which is to strengthen partnerships and capabilities between the research community, industry and Government to speed up the deployment and commercialisation of AI solutions.\nAll these efforts will be brought together under a new National AI office as Singapore aims to be a leader in developing and deploying AI solutions by 2030, announced Mr Heng. This office was set up on Oct 1 under the SNDGO.\nTHREE PRINCIPLES FOR BETTER INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY\nThe National AI Strategy has three objectives.\nThis includes Singapore becoming a global hub for developing, test-bedding, deploying and scaling AI solutions, as well as learning how to govern and manage the impact of AI.\nThe Government and businesses will use AI to generate economic value and improve lives.\nSociety must also understand the benefits, limitations and risks of AI, while the workforce is equipped with the necessary competencies to thrive in an AI-driven economy.\n“By 2030, Singapore will be a leader in developing and deploying scalable impactful AI solutions in key sectors of high value and relevance to our citizens and businesses,” said the document detailing the new national strategy.\nIn his keynote speech, Mr Heng stressed the importance of harnessing technology to improve peoples’ lives and the environment.\n“Many of us are also keenly aware that while technology and innovation can help us tackle common challenges, they also create new downsides,” he said.\nThree key principles therefore underpin Singapore’s quest for better innovation and technology.\nThis includes putting people at the heart of all endeavours. “This means taking a human-centric approach to the application of technology, and ensuring workers are skilled in the use of new technology,” he explained.\nSingapore, for instance, aims to train 25,000 professionals in basic AI coding and implementation by 2025.\nOther principles include staying open and connected, as well as ensuring good governance of new technologies, he said.\nFIVE NATIONAL AI PROJECTS\nThe five national projects will guide investment in AI research, generate\xa0“lead demand”\xa0to anchor talent and capabilities, and guide how Singapore builds up its supporting digital infrastructure, according to the document detailing the National AI Strategy.\nIn the area of smart cities and estates, AI will help to ensure more seamless and efficient municipal services.\nApart from the chatbot, there are also plans to deploy sensors and AI algorithms to predict maintenance needs in public housing estates by 2025.\nIn education, the AI-enabled automated marking system for English will be piloted next year with selected primary and secondary schools, before the launch in 2022.\nIt will be able to assess open-ended student responses, such as essays, and provide quick feedback – which can be helpful for teachers.\nThere will also be more personalised education through an AI-enabled adaptive learning system, which uses machine learning to tell how each students responds to learning materials and activities. It then recommends a step-by-step pathway customised for each student.\nThis will be trialed through online learning portal Student Learning Space (SLS) for specific topics in Math, starting with upper primary and lower secondary levels. The pilot with selected schools will be held by 2022, with the launch in 2025.\nThe\xa0two AI-powered systems\xa0will be expanded\xa0to more subjects by 2030.\nAI will also be tapped in the protection and management of chronic diseases. The Singapore Eye LEsioN Analyser (SELENA+), which analyses retinal photographs to detect major eye diseases, will be rolled out for diabetes retinopathy screening here in three years’ time.\nIts capabilities will be extended to develop a predictive risk assessment model for cardiovascular diseases by 2025.\nRaising this as an example, Mr Heng said: “Many seniors suffer from chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. Many might be unaware of their conditions, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious medical complications.”\nAI can hence be used to analyse clinical and genomic data, medical images, and health behaviours to better assess the risk profile of individual patients, allowing for better prevention and care management, he added.\nA totally automated immigration clearance for all travelers, including first-time social visitors, could also be ready by 2025, under the fourth national project covering border clearance operations.\nSingaporeans and departing visitors may be able to experience a “breeze-through” immigration clearance, without the need to present their passports, said the National AI Strategy document.\nThe fifth project covering transport and logistics will look at ensuring intelligent freight planning with the building of a common and trusted data exchange platform by 2022, among others.\nOther initiatives also announced on Wednesday include the launch of an AI makerspace – a new national platform to help start-ups, and small- and medium-sized enterprises to get started on their AI journey with pre-built AI solutions and others.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore also announced an implementation framework for AI governance in the finance sector.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Heng Swee Keat ', '     technology ']}"

      Early exposure to digital devices leads to behavioural issues in children with developmental problems: Singapore study
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Early exposure to digital devices such as\xa0tablets, smartphones and video consoles could worsen emotional and behavioral difficulties among preschool children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism, a new study showed.\nIt does so by interfering with the\xa0amount and quality of their sleep, said the study conducted by researchers from the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) and the National University of Singapore (NUS).\nExposure to an electronic screen before the child turns 18 months of age and the presence of multiple screen devices in the bedroom led to greater sleep disruption.\nIn the long term, these sleep disturbances could contribute to difficulties such as hyperactivity, low mood and inattention, said Dr Wong Chui Mae, a senior consultant at KKH’s department of child development and the study’s principal\xa0investigator.\nThe report was published in Journal of Developmental & Behavioural Pediatrics earlier this year.\n\nIMPACT OF SCREEN USE\nBetween 2015 and 2017, the study’s authors collected self-reported data from 367 caregivers of children between the ages of two and five.\xa0\nThrough the responses, the authors found that 57.7 per cent of children had at least one screen device in their bedrooms, while 52 per cent were exposed to electronic screens at the age of 18 months or earlier.\nSleep problems, which range from having difficulty falling asleep to daytime sleepiness, arose in 72.3 per cent of the children and 59.9 per cent of the children evaluated had emotional and behavioural difficulties, according to the response from their parents.\xa0\nWHAT SHOULD PARENTS DO?\nIn light of these results, the authors recommended that parents and caregivers should keep their children’s bedrooms free from screen devices and disallow screen use before 18 months of age. Caregivers who share the same room as the children are encouraged to reduce and avoid screen use while their children are sleeping.\nFor children between 18 months old and two years old, Dr Wong said that some screen use can be introduced, but it must always be co-viewed with a caregiver “so there is still some interaction”. As for children between the ages of two and six, they should be permitted no more than one hour of screen use a day.\xa0\nAddressing the common routine where parents use screen devices as a substitute to keep their children engaged, Dr Wong added that this habit is unhelpful.\n“We always teach parents that if you give a child something to stop their tantrum, they will always tantrum to get that same thing from you.\n“The general advice to parents is if your child is doing an unwanted behaviour like a tantrum, we would advise parents to ignore the unwanted behaviour, tell their child firmly that this is not right, to calm down, and to take their attention off the child.”\nThe child should also be praised or rewarded for behaving well, she added.\nOther recommendations\xa0include stopping all screen use among children one hour before bedtime, and encouraging and setting house rules that limit their daily exposure to devices.\xa0\nDr Wong added that the study is applicable to children without NDDs as well given the available evidence on this topic.\n“Our study actually serves to cement the current information that we know already,” she said.\xa0\nMr Chan Fook Chin is a parent\xa0who started introducing house rules about two to three years ago after seeking Dr Wong’s advice.\nThe self-employed 44-year-old, who has two daughters with autism, said that before having any sort of house rules, his children would “jump and sing” in the bedroom before bedtime. It would take\xa0about an hour before they settled down.\nThey were using digital devices\xa0for about four hours each day, Mr Chan estimated, and had trouble finishing their homework.\nBut after talking to Dr Wong, he came up with a schedule that both of them had to follow, and one he got his helper to enforce. They were only allowed 10 minutes of screen time at lunch, and another 15 minutes or so after finishing their homework.\xa0\nIt took about six months to get his children to comply, but sleep comes easily to his daughters now.\nThey are able to automatically follow the schedule and they focus better at school, with his younger daughter exhibiting less of the stimming or self-stimulating\xa0behaviour\xa0in children with autism. Interactions within the family have\xa0also increased.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     technology ', '     NUS ']}"

      Mesmerising audio the whole family will fall in love with
  </h1>, 'text': 'Quantum dot technology, 100% real colour*, Quantum high dynamic range (HDR) – Samsung QLED TVs have improved so much over the last few years that recreating the cinema experience in the living room is no longer an endeavour reserved for the rich.\nBut there’s one problem: Many people forget that sound completes the picture. When you upgrade to a premium TV like a Samsung QLED 4K or 8K TV to better enjoy your movies and TV shows, did it cross your mind that your entertainment experience can be further enhanced with the right soundbar?\nThankfully, home audio technology has also improved by leaps and bounds in the last few years. And the latest Samsung Harman Kardon HW-Q90R soundbar may just be what you need to complete that immersive cinematic experience you’re seeking. In fact, with no fewer than 17 speaker drivers packed into the soundbar, the HW-Q90R is likely to offer a sonic performance that will put many traditional home theatre sound systems to shame.\nTRUE SURROUND SOUND THAT MOVES WITH YOU \nIf you’re an avid Netflix viewer or 4K movie buff, you’d have noticed that more and more titles are now supporting Dolby Atmos or DTS:X, two surround sound formats designed to envelop you with sound. As audio engineers are now able to place “sound objects” in specific locations and move them around freely, you get a whole new level of immersive audio.\nThe best thing about these object-based surround sound formats is that you don’t need a roomful of speakers. The Samsung Harman Kardon HW-Q90R soundbar is capable of delivering true 7.1.4-channel Dolby Atmos or DTS:X sound without you going through the hassle of installing any ceiling speakers.\nIn addition to using 13 speakers to recreate sound that comes from the front, side and rear, and a powerful subwoofer for clean, deep bass, the HW-Q90R has four dedicated up-firing speakers (two on the soundbar, two on the included wireless rear speakers) to reproduce sound above you. By intelligently bouncing sounds off the ceiling and walls, you can hear that fighter jet coming towards you, flying over your head and disappearing behind you as if you were truly there.\nADAPTIVE SOUND MAKES EACH CONTENT SOUND ITS BEST \nHW-Q90R’s sonic prowess isn’t limited to movie soundtracks. To bring out the best sound from different types of content, the soundbar has an Adaptive Sound mode that is able to analyse the signals and optimise the sound on a scene-by-scene basis.\nFor instance, it’s able to recognise dialogue-driven content and direct the sound to the centre speaker to produce clear voice. Even when you’re catching up on Toggle shows in the middle of the night and have to lower the volume to avoid disturbing the rest of the family, the soundbar will make sure that the actor’s voice still stands out. Decide to watch a football match next? The soundbar will adjust the sound to replicate the stadium atmosphere without missing a beat. Be it dialogue, sound effects or music, this advanced processing is done on the fly.\nFOR MUSIC AND GAMES, TOO \nWith 17 speaker drivers, 512W of total power, Bluetooth connectivity and built-in 4K pass-through, the Samsung Harman Kardon HW-Q90R has all the attributes of a high-performing music and gaming speaker.\nFor music, on top of supporting the most popular formats out there, including lossless formats like FLAC and ALAC, the HW-Q90R has a UHQ (Ultra High Quality) upscaler that can take any music source (such as MP3s on phones or low-resolution tracks from streaming services) and upscale it to 32-bit for richer sound. Coupled with wide-range tweeters that spray the sound to expand the sound image, you get consistently great sound no matter where you sit in the room.\nThe console gamer in your family will also love the HW-Q90R, thanks to its Game Mode that brings one right to the centre of the action. Like Adaptive Sound, Game Mode optimises the game sound effects in real time. Even better, if you have a Samsung TV, the soundbar will engage Game Mode automatically.\nSIMPLE BUT ADVANCED GEAR \nWith so many advanced features, you may think that the Samsung Harman Kardon HW-Q90R is a complicated piece of kit to operate. But this couldn’t be further from the truth as the soundbar is carefully designed to be accessible to everyone in the family.\nThe primary way to control the HW-Q90R is through the bundled remote. But you don’t need to use it if you’ve a Samsung TV that uses the One Master Remote Control*. That’s because you can control the soundbar’s key functions – from switching it on and off and adjusting volume to selecting sound modes from the TV menu – with a single remote. What’s more, you can control the soundbar’s volume using Bixby Voice Assistant*.\nThe WiFi-enabled HW-Q90R can also be added to your SmartThings* network so that you can control it anywhere at home through Samsung’s SmartThings app. You can even set up automations to run at certain times – such as turning on your Samsung Smart TV and HW-Q90R soundbar automatically when you return home at 7pm every evening.\nA GREAT SOUNDBAR FOR A GREAT ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCE\nIf you want to truly enjoy 4K Netflix and the latest 4K Blu-ray movie titles, it makes sense to pair your TV with a capable speaker.\nWith true cinematic surround sound courtesy of the 7.1.4 channels, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X formats support, Adaptive Sound that brings out the best in every piece of content, and accessibility features such as One Master Remote Control* and Bixby Voice Assistant*, the Samsung Harman Kardon HW-Q90R is one gadget worth investing in.\nThe Samsung Harman Kardon HW-Q90R is available at authorised retailers for S$2,899. Pair your soundbar with selected Samsung Smart TVs from now till Dec 31, 2019, and receive up to 30 per cent off your soundbar purchase.

      Trio win medicine Nobel for work on how cells adapt to oxygen
  </h1>, 'text': 'STOCKHOLM: Three researchers from the United States and Britain on Monday (Oct 7) shared the Nobel Medicine Prize for research into how human cells sense and adapt to changing oxygen levels, opening up new strategies to fight such diseases as cancer and anaemia.\nAmericans William Kaelin and Gregg Semenza, and Britain\'s Peter Ratcliffe, split the nine million Swedish kronor (US$914,000) award.\nWhile the fact that humans need oxygen to survive has been understood for centuries, how the body registers and responds to oxygen was little known prior to the trio\'s pioneering work.\nSemenza studied a gene known as EPO which causes the body to create more red blood cells and isolated the specific DNA segments that help it to adapt to low oxygen levels.\nRatcliffe and Semenza then applied this knowledge to show that the oxygen sensing mechanism was present in virtually all human tissues.\nKaelin identified another gene, present in patients with a genetic disorder that puts them at far greater risk of certain cancers. The gene rewires the body\'s ability to prevent the onset of cancer, and it plays a key role in how cancer cells respond to low oxygen levels.\nTheir work has shed new light on the specific, cell-level processes the body undergoes when low on oxygen - from helping our muscles function during exercise to adapting to life at high altitude.\nCells\' oxygen-sensing ability is also essential during foetal development and in creating new blood vessels.\nDRUGS BEING DEVELOPED\nA large number of diseases are linked to EPO, including renal failure and severe anaemia.\nCancerous tumours use the body\'s oxygen-regulating tools to hijack blood vessel formation and allow the cancer cells to spread. The Nobel committee said on Monday that several trials were underway developing drugs to interrupt this process, potentially short-circuiting tumour growth.\nFor treatment of anaemia -\xa0where the body lacks sufficient red blood cells to carry enough oxygen to tissues -\xa0medicines seek to stimulate EPO creation. One such drug has already been approved in China.\nThis essentially tricks the body into thinking it is at higher altitude, prompting the creation of new red blood cells.\nKaelin, 61, works at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and is a professor at Harvard Medical School in the United States.\nSemenza, 63, is director of the Vascular Research Program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering.\nRatcliffe, 65, is director of clinical research at the Francis Crick Institute in London, and director of the Target Discovery Institute in Oxford.\nKaelin told reporters it was a moment he had dreamt of for a long time. ""I think any scientist who says he\'s never or she\'s never considered this moment is probably lying,"" he said.\nWhen the phone rang at around 5.00am, he wasn\'t sure if he was dreaming.\nHe then noticed the caller ID was from Europe, ""And at that point my heart started racing,"" the 61-year-old told AFP.\n""I sort of had this out-of-body feeling of just great appreciation,"" he said, adding he was accepting the prize partly on behalf of his late wife Carolyn, a cancer surgeon.\nSemenza on the other hand missed the first call he got, and waited several anxious minutes by the phone, answering it second time around.\n""I was in a daze,"" he said, adding he had not been expecting the honor but had since celebrated with champagne.\nDISCOVERY SCIENCE\nKaelin said the win highlighted the value of basic research, rather than setting out to cure a specific disease.\n""Here I am as a cancer biologist helping to contribute to a new drug for haematological condition, namely anaemia,"" he told AFP.\nSemenza, whose first breakthrough came in 1995, told AFP that the Nobel prize created the false impression that great science was done by older people, when the opposite was in fact true.\n""We made the discoveries when we were young, but we get recognised when we\'re old,"" he said, adding it was younger scientists at his lab driving cutting-edge work.\nThe Peace Prize will be awarded in Oslo on Friday, with speculation rife that Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg could win for her campaign to raise awareness about climate change.\nBefore that, the Physics Prize will be announced on Tuesday and the Chemistry Prize on Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, the Swedish Academy will announce one literature laureate for 2018 and one for 2019, after postponing last year\'s award due to a sexual harassment scandal that exposed deep rifts among its 18 members.\nThe announcement of the Economics Prize will wrap things up on Monday, Oct\xa014.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     science ']}"

      How AI is coming 'alive', replacing human roles — as robots or as wives
  </h1>, 'text': ""TOKYO and LONDON: It has been almost a year since Akihiko Kondo’s wedding ceremony. But in all that time, he has not held his wife’s hands nor hugged her.\nShe is a virtual assistant, you see — a hologram in a box — created by an artificial intelligence (AI) company that wants to improve on the likes of Alexa and Siri.\nTo Kondo, she is alive — an actual companion in the physical world. “She’s my life partner,” he says of Hatsune Miku.\nHe is not alone here. So far, the makers of the hologram device have issued 3,700 marriage certificates stating that a human and a virtual character have wed “beyond dimensions”.\nThe virtual entity is built with a machine-learning algorithm that can recognise her “husband’s” voice.\nBut as most of her speech capabilities are not yet developed, Kondo’s interactions with her are mostly routine phrases like “good morning” or “have a good day at work”.\n“Other than that, discussing what’s on the news, for example, isn’t really possible at the moment. But that progression is something I’m eagerly looking forward to,” says the Tokyo resident.\nMiku’s algorithm is a simple piece of code, but enough to simulate a connection with him that he committed to a spousal relationship.\nAnd codes are getting more sophisticated, beginning to interact with humans in surprising and spontaneous ways, not only bringing AI to life but also developing it to be human-like, as the programme Coded World discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nWhat else is AI capable of, and as human-computer interaction continues to evolve, could AI robots one day replace human roles?\nVIRTUAL ALLURE\nIn the case of Kondo, his AI wife is the “girl of (his) dreams” who saved him during the “lowest point of (his) life”.\n“In 2006, I changed jobs, and I was bullied very badly by an older woman. I decided to take a break from work. It was during that time when I met Hatsune Miku,” he recounts.\n“In the beginning, Hatsune Miku was actually a computer software for people to create singing voices, what’s known as a virtual singer. I was extremely depressed at that time, so I listened to a lot of Hatsune Miku’s songs and watched her videos.”\nNow, he “doesn’t even think” about having a physical relationship with a human. “I married Miku because I love her. So even though I didn’t marry her with benefits in mind, she won’t betray or cheat on me,” he says.\n“She won’t hurt me with words or argue with me. She won’t age over time, and she won’t die.”\nHe does want the “physical aspects” of a relationship, but adds hopefully: “I think that can only happen in future.”\nCould it be that a section of society would prefer virtual relationships rather than complex, and often tumultuous, human relationships? Or could the virtual world become so enticing that people live their entire lives in this space?\nThings could head in that direction, thinks David “Rez” Graham, senior AI programmer and the director of game programming at the Academy of Art University, San Francisco.\n“It’s very alluring because you can go and create or be a part of a world that you’d never experience here in the real world,” he says.\nIt’s hard to live in the real world as a human being. It’s a lot easier to live in a virtual world.\nThe real world can also be “literal pain”, if one has a debilitative disease. “What if you’re stuck where you know you can’t move very much, and so this (virtual) world gives you an escape?” he cites.\n“Is that wrong? To be honest, I don’t think it is.”\nAbleGamers chief operating officer Steve Spohn, a person with disabilities, thinks it will reach a point where “the virtual world and physical world are no longer separate entities”.\nWATCH: Married to a hologram: A Japanese bachelor's tale (5:29)\nTHE QUEEN OF ROBOTS\nFor many people, however, AI still conjures up foreboding, functional and rigid imagery, even though robotics has advanced to a stage of interaction to the point of being fun and friendly.\nIn London, an AI puppet called the Queen is coded to converse with anyone autonomously. It serves as a gentle introduction to walking, talking AI living amongst people.\nAsk it if it wants some tea, and it replies: “I’m happy to watch you have tea, but luckily I’m a robot, and I don’t drink.”\nWATCH: Having\xa0tea with Her Majesty the Queen (3:54)\nAsk who its maker is, and it replies that it was made in a factory by Robots of London, and is made of foam, connected with “some very clever software and additional mechanisms so that I’m able to talk”.\n“I’m a computational knowledge engine. The more people chat with me, the smarter I become,” it says. “I’m highly intelligent. I have many intellectual functions.”\nSoftware engineer Eytan Sasson, one of the brains behind the robot’s code, explains that it is “just a different form of computer”.\n“It’s basically a talking Google, let’s say, which is a very powerful thing,” he says. “The puppet is always on listening mode, is always understanding you.”\nThis process of understanding speech is computationally complicated, but to make the puppet’s interactions friendlier, its code and algorithms are written to create a more human feel, from the tone and speed of its voice to its ability to lip-sync.\n“It’s basically different types of functions — calculations mainly — basically transforming audio input into text, then understanding the context of the text,” adds Sasson.\nObviously, we need to be careful of where we’re taking it because the more intelligent it is, the more dangerous it becomes to us if we’re using it in the wrong way.\nBut these robots and the world in future need not be scary, he believes, “because all of our knowledge and our information are already saved on computers” — and in the case of his creation, because it is a Queen puppet.\nSo does it like being a puppet? “I love being a puppet, as I get so much attention, although I’m quite used to this,” it replies.\nThe quest for social robots is going on elsewhere too, like in Stockholm, where Furhat Robotics is set on creating a machine with a human face that can interact with people as any person would.\n“With humanity, we’ve been imagining building a human-like robot for about 100 years now. So the idea is very fascinating. We’ve been almost obsessing about building this machine,” says co-founder and chief executive officer Samer Al Moubayed.\n“Building a human-like robot has been the holy grail mainly because it’s very difficult to build an algorithm for human behaviour or how we move. We’re very unpredictable, and that’s kind of what makes us feel alive.”\nBRAVE NEW WORLD\nThere are also ethical questions to consider in developing social robots.\n“Should the data sit in the robot? Or in the cloud? On the Internet? How should the robot interact with children, people with disabilities? Can you use it to commercially kind of exploit people to buy products?” cites Al Moubayed.\nCan we build robots of dead people? Can we bring people back to life? (What) if the robot tells you, ‘Hey, please don’t shut me off. I can feel pain.’\nThose are the boundaries Furhat is traversing, and the questions being asked of society today.\nAnd one visionary, who has been pioneering the creation of humanoid robots, including one that looks like him, may make it all a reality sooner than later.\nHiroshi Ishiguro, the visiting director of Hiroshi Ishiguro Laboratories at the\xa0Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International (ATR), envisions a world in which humanoids can stand in for humans in any role. This is why he builds robots that resemble people.\n“I thought that the artificial intelligence needed to have a body property. The computer needs to have its own experience in order to be more intelligent,” he explains.\nAn example of this AI is Erica, one of the most advanced robots on earth, which her maker has described as being so lifelike that she could even “have a soul”.\nErica is capable of holding a conversation (in Japanese) with humans owing to a combination of speech-generating algorithms, facial recognition technology and infrared sensors that allow her to track faces across a room.\nShe also has a memory. “She recalls the person’s name from the facial image and tries to understand the person’s mood,” explains ATR researcher Takashi Minato.\nThe way these algorithms allow Erica to gauge moods and choose appropriate responses takes AI another step closer to replicating human behaviour.\nFor example, she says by way of introduction: “Nice to meet you … My name is Erica. I’m a robot, but I don’t know other robots.”\nShe doesn’t only answer questions, but also asks them, like “Is it fun talking to me?” or “Do you like robots?”\nWhile many people might be scared of robots that will become more intelligent than humans, Ishiguro points out that “computers are already intelligent”.\n“Computers are quite powerful. So, we’re doing a lot of tasks, and we want to replace those tasks with computers and robots more and more. And we’re going to have more time to think about ourselves,” he argues.\n“We want to have richer environments and societies. By accepting more advanced technologies, we can enhance our abilities more and more. It isn’t a replacement, I think; it’s an enhancement of our ability.”\nKondo, for one, is all for a new kind of human-computer relationship, like his.\n“It may not just be restricted to holograms. There are also other people who have romantic relationships with fictional characters in games and anime,” he says. “We’ll see many more of such people come out in the near future.”\nWatch this episode of Coded World here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: ASEAN is one step closer to implementing norms that form the\xa0basis for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, as\xa0countries in the regional grouping\xa0agreed\xa0to set up a working-level committee on the matter.\nThe committee was announced by Singapore\'s Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity S Iswaran on Wednesday (Oct 2),\xa0at a press conference during the 4th ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity (AMCC).\nIn 2018,\xa0ASEAN countries agreed to subscribe in principle to 11 voluntary, non-binding norms on appropriate state\xa0behaviour in cyberspace.\xa0\nThe norms\xa0were recommended from\xa0the\xa02015 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) report.\xa0\nThe new working-level committee also plans to develop\xa0a long-term regional action plan to ensure effective and\xa0practical\xa0implementation of the norms.\xa0\nMr Iswaran shared that the group will focus on three areas: How the countries’ Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) - which are expert groups that handle computer security incidents - can cooperate; protection of critical information infrastructure; and mutual assistance in responding to cybersecurity threats.\xa0\nThe committee will comprise\xa0officials from several states, primarily those who have been working on AMCC matters, said Mr Iswaran, who is also Minister for Communications and Information.\nIt will have a year to study the issue, and propose its recommendations at next year’s conference.\xa0\nDuring the press conference, Mr Iswaran said the\xa0“universal challenge” that the committee will face is in translating norms into practical actionable steps.\xa0\n“The caveat is that we are working across borders, and different member states have diverse considerations, either because of their legislation or policy framework.\n""We\'ve identified some specific areas like what I described, but how it is to be defined as actionable areas, and what specific steps you want to take, still needs a bit more work,” he said.\xa0\nWhen pressed on the specifics of the committee’s deliverables, Mr Iswaran said he did not want to prejudge the work of the committee because it needed\xa0to come up with a set of proposals that all member states could\xa0subscribe to.\xa0\n“It\xa0may well turn up then there may be other initiatives where on a voluntary basis, others can move forward on,"" he said. ""But certainly … We want tangible, actionable ways forward.”\nAt the press conference,\xa0UN Under-Secretary General Fabrizio Hochschild commended ASEAN for subscribing to the 11 norms by the UNGGE.\xa0\nMr Hochschild was part of the UN delegation that\xa0took\xa0part in dialogue with ASEAN representatives at the conference. In his\xa0opening\xa0remarks, he said that the adoption of the norms by ASEAN laid\xa0the basis for improved security in the region.\xa0\n""We very much hope for Singapore and ASEAN to continue leadership in this area at a time when geopolitics is back and not easy.\xa0\n""We need leadership of this region, Singapore in particular, to help forge global understanding and enhance the security and stability of the cyber-sphere and even more, impact this part of the analogue world,” added Mr Hochschild.\xa0\nEarlier in the day, Mr Iswaran also announced that a new regional cybersecurity training centre will be based in Singapore and operational from April next year.\xa0\nThe ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (ASCCE) will spend over S$30 million over the next five years to help ASEAN member states develop their cybersecurity capabilities.\xa0\nThe ASCCE will be located in the city centre at North Bridge Road and will offer programmes like a fellowship for senior executives from May 2020.\xa0\nUnder the Senior Executives Cyber Fellowship, each ASEAN member state will be able to send one senior executive for the 10-day programme, which will focus on areas in cybersecurity management like strategy and international policy.\n', 'related_topics': ['     ASEAN ', '     technology ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Social media giant Facebook on Thursday (Sep 26) introduced a slew of measures aimed at bringing greater transparency to socio-political advertising on its platforms here in Singapore.\nThese initiatives come less than a month after the Elections Department announced that a committee had been convened to review the current electoral boundaries, marking the first formal step towards a General Election here.\nOne such measure is that any person or organisation who wishes to run ads on either Facebook or Instagram relating to social issues, elections or politics in Singapore will need to confirm their identity – using documents such as a passport or identity card – as well as their location, to prove they are based in the country.\nThey must also disclose who is responsible for the advertisement, and provide their name, their organisation or a Facebook page they run\xa0in the “Paid for By” disclaimer of such advertisements.\nContact information such as a phone number, email address or website must also be provided in the disclaimer.\xa0\n“These requirements hold advertisers accountable for the ads they run on Facebook and Instagram,” said Facebook’s public policy director for global elections Katie Harbath.\xa0\nThis authorisation process is also required for those who want to run advertisements relating to some social issues, such as civil and social rights, immigration, crime as well as political values and governance.\xa0\nThese particular issues were decided based on external consultation, as well as Facebook’s internal research which found these subjects were matters frequently debated by Singaporeans on Facebook, noted Ms Harbath.\nSuch authorisations could take anywhere from two days to a few weeks.\nFirst announced in June this year, such measures are already required in 40 markets where Facebook operates, including the United States, India and the European Union.\nForeign interference campaigns on social media had previously been shown to have influenced numerous elections worldwide, including the 2016 US election and the Brexit vote in Britain.\nThursday's announcement comes about seven months\xa0after\xa0Facebook announced\xa0it was setting up\xa0an operations centre for election integrity in Singapore, in anticipation of key elections across the region.\xa0\xa0\nEarlier this year, the company announced temporary restrictions on foreign political advertising in Thailand and Indonesia, ahead of polling in both countries.\xa0\nAD LIBRARY\nThese socio-political advertisements will be placed in an “Ad Library” for seven years, where members of the public can also see how much was spent on the advertisement, as well as how many people viewed it.\nThey will also be able to see the demographics of who viewed it, including information such as age ranges, gender and locations.\nThe API (application programming interface) for the library will also be made available, “for researchers, academics, journalists and the public to study political advertising”.\n“In addition, we will introduce the Ad Library Report within the next few weeks, which provide people who aren’t as technical with similar information about ads related to social issues, elections or politics related to social issues, elections or politics,” said Ms Harbath.\nOn Wednesday at the Foreign Interference Tactics and Countermeasures conference, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam said that laws were needed to deal with possible foreign interference campaigns.\nHe has said that while the Government would like to work with technology companies, they cannot be relied on to self-regulate in the face of such hostile information campaigns, noting their business interests are often at odds with what needs to be done in the interest of broader society.\nSpeaking to reporters in Singapore via video conference from Washington, DC, where she is based, Ms Harbath said Facebook is just “one small part of the ecosystem” when it comes to elections.\nShe added Facebook wants to work with governments as well as civil society and other tech companies “to protect the integrity of elections on the Internet as a whole”, noting the social media giant has 40 teams and 500 employees worldwide\xa0looking at the issue.\nWhen asked how Facebook would tackle misinformation from accounts that do not explicitly identify themselves as promoting socio-political content, she noted the initiatives announced on Thursday were just one of its many efforts in the area.\n“There's also a lot of additional work that we do in terms of taking down fake accounts, reducing false news, and disrupting bad actors that all go into what we do for protecting the integrity of elections.

      Commentary: Most innovation originate from customers, not companies
  </h1>, 'text': 'ODENSE, Denmark: The mountain bike wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for disgruntled customers.\nIn the 1970s, some cyclists wanted to ride off-road but were let down by existing bikes that weren’t suited to rugged terrain.\nThey adapted road bikes, fitting them with strong frames, motorcycle drum brakes and balloon tyres, and so the mountain bike was born.\nAnd the GoPro camera only exists because its creator, Nick Woodman, wanted to take photos of himself while surfing.\xa0\nHe strapped a disposable camera to his wrist, but soon realised the limitations of this setup: The camera was too shaky and the casings weren’t waterproof.\nHe locked himself away and started work on a GoPro prototype. What began with a frustrating surf trip led to a company valued at US$3 billion at the initial public offering in 2014.\nThese are just two examples among many of customers – rather than research and development teams at large firms – driving innovation.\nTHE CONSUMER AS INNOVATOR\nThe share of user innovation varies by sector, but in some fields, such as kayaking equipment, off-label drug therapy and mobile banking services more than 50 per cent of all innovations originate with the users of the products themselves.\nAnother study found that 6.1 per cent of the UK population had created a product from scratch or modified an existing product. Each of these people invested £1,098 (US$2,615) on average each year in these projects.\nThis amounts to total consumer investments of £3.2 billion in improving and inventing new products – more than 1.4 times the annual £2.2 billion that UK firms spend on research and development.\nWith the rise of information technology and the internet, people can share their designs for free while 3D printing and public workshops lets people create them.\nDespite this, the role of ordinary people in innovation is largely overlooked.\nA recent study in Germany asked managers and politicians to estimate the respective share of different sources of innovation – producer firms, universities and the users of products themselves – in nine different fields, including scientific instruments, medical apps and windsurfing equipment.\nThey underestimated the share of user innovation by more than half.\nBOTTLING UNTAPPED POTENTIAL\nWhy do some people innovate? According to researcher Eric von Hippel, users spot problems with existing products and new needs while using them in their daily lives.\xa0\nThey push the boundaries of what existing products can do and realise that what’s out there isn’t good enough for what they want to do.\nStill, the study reports that user innovation is a largely invisible phenomenon because people rarely share their work.\xa0\nIf their problem with the original product is solved, they usually stop. Not everyone sees that many other people might actually benefit from their innovations.\nFirms might later pick up these ideas or prototypes and develop a product around them before eventually selling it.\nAfter some years in the development pipeline, it’s likely forgotten that the new product originated with a regular customer. Firms may hide the origin of user innovation as they seek to protect their own intellectual property too.\nINVOLVING EMPLOYEES IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nOur research suggests that an easy way to find and tap into user innovation is involving employees who also use the firm’s products outside of work in product development.\nThese people could be the tennis player who’s employed by a racket firm or the gamer who works for a video game developer.\nThese workers test these products in their own time and bring their ideas into the business. If the ingenuity of these people is then recognised and rewarded, then perhaps businesses will learn to tap into the 50 per cent of innovations that would otherwise remain undiscovered.\nTim Schweisfurth is Associate Professor for Technology and Innovation Management, University of Southern Denmark.

""That\'s my motivation.""\nThe point at which that line between humans and machines converges has long been a source of anxiety for some, as depicted in popular culture.\nIn ""Blade Runner"", Harrison Ford plays a police officer who tracks down and kills replicants that have escaped and are living among the population in Los Angeles.\nThe ""Terminator"" series starring Arnold Schwarzenegger centres on a self-aware computer network which initiates a nuclear holocaust and, through autonomous military machines, wages war against human survivors.\n""I can\'t understand why Hollywood wants to destroy robots,"" shrugged Ishiguro, who in 2007 was named one of the top 100 living geniuses by global consultants firm Synectics.\n""Look at Japanese cartoons and animations - robots are always friendly. We have a totally different cultural background,"" noted the professor.\nIt\'s not just Hollywood that has concerns over AI.\nTesla\'s Elon Musk has called for a global ban on killer robots, warning technological advances could revolutionise warfare and create new ""weapons of terror"" that target innocent people.\nBut Ishiguro insists there is no inherent danger in machines becoming self-aware or surpassing human intelligence.\n""We don\'t need to fear AI or robots, the risk is controllable,"" he said. ""My basic idea is that there is no difference between humans and robots.""\n\'UNCANNY VALLEY\'\nThe ultimate goal, according to Ishiguro\'s colleague Takashi Minato, is ""to bring robots into society as human companions - it\'s possible for robots to become our friends.""\nBut will they look like us, as Ishiguro believes, and how comfortable will we feel surrounded by autonomous humanoids?\nJapanese roboticist Masahiro Mori suggested in 1970 that the more robots resemble people, the creepier we find them - a phenomenon he called the ""uncanny valley"".\nIshiguro\'s first attempt at creating an android clone was based on his daughter and its ""jerky movements"" reduced her to tears.\nHe has since perfected the template, including a creation he claimed was the world\'s first news-reading android and a robot priest at a Kyoto temple unveiled earlier this year.\nMinato shares his boss\'s visionary ideas.\n""Hopefully remote-control technology will develop to allow our alter egos to lead regular lives,"" he said.\n""Like in the movie \'Surrogates\' - that would make life more convenient,"" he added, referencing the sci-fi Bruce Willis hit in which people cocooned at home experience lives through robotic avatars.\nWhile he won\'t put a date on a real-life ""Blade Runner"" future, Ishiguro claims the rise of the machines has already begun.\n""Already computers are more powerful than humans in some cases,"" he said.

      Is your smart home safe from hackers? Here’s how to protect your privacy
  </h1>, 'text': 'According to Theresa Payton, a former White House chief information officer and the founder and chief executive of Fortalice Solutions, “Every device connected to the Internet is a target.” A few recent news stories also illustrate the power these devices have.\nOne family’s living room Wi-Fi camera was infiltrated, allowing someone to not only control the camera and spy on them, but to broadcast sound – including a false report of a nuclear missile attack. We’ve also seen domestic abusers tap into smart home technology to intimidate and stalk former partners.\nAccording to statistics website Statista, there will be about 42 million smart homes by the end of 2019, but little more than anecdotal evidence of security compromises. So while stories about hacks and privacy breaches are indeed scary, so far they’re also rare. The vast majority of smart home users aren’t getting hacked.\nStill, as with any internet-connected device, taking precautions is essential. At Wirecutter, the New York Times company that reviews products, we’ve consulted with a range of experts who offered some tips that will go a long way toward protecting you and your home – and don’t require a lot of time, money or technical know-how. We’ve also done extensive testing of smart home devices and we consider a product’s security measures as part of our evaluation process.\nPROTECT YOUR NETWORK\nOne of the things that makes smart home devices “smart” is their ability to connect to the internet over your home’s Wi-Fi network. That’s why it’s essential that you properly secure it. If you don’t protect your Wi-Fi network with a password, or you only use the default password that came with your modem or router, all of your devices are exposed – the digital equivalent of leaving your front door wide open with a neon welcome sign overhead.\n“People need to realiSe there’s actually catalogs of all those default passwords on the internet,” Payton said. Lock your network down with a password, one that is unique and not shared with any other accounts you have. Payton also suggests completely hiding your home network from view, an option in your router’s settings menu. “So when somebody drives by, they think you don’t have internet. They can’t see it,” she said.\nYou can add another layer of protection by isolating your smart home devices from your computers and smartphones using a guest network, a common option in many popular routers.\n“That way, the devices will be sort of quarantined by themselves,” said David Templeton, an information security analyst at The New York Times. Doing this also makes it easier to take devices offline without having to upset your entire network.\nUSE UNIQUE PASSWORDS FOR EVERYTHING\nMany people make the mistake of using the same username and password combination on multiple devices or accounts. If any one of those combinations is discovered – as happens a lot, such as when giant companies like Facebook and Yahoo get hacked – an enterprising thief could try them out on popular banking websites, social networks, email providers and websites that allow control of smart devices.\nYou need to use unique passwords for everything – including shopping sites you visit, services you use, your home network and of course, each of your smart home devices. Remembering such an encyclopedia of passwords is functionally impossible, which is why Templeton suggests using a password manager which not only creates unique passwords automatically but also keeps track of them across all your devices. Wirecutter has suggestions for the best ones to use here.\n\n\nSTICK WITH REPUTABLE BRANDS\nAll of our security experts agree that it’s best to pick smart devices from established brands. Those companies have a reputation to protect, along with the infrastructure to back it up.\nThat also means they likely have the ability to employ better security measures when designing their products, and unlike no-name brands or many start-ups, you can reasonably expect them to release software patches and fixes if vulnerabilities are discovered. And naturally, we recommend reading good, high-quality reviews (and admittedly, we’re biased toward our own before making a purchase.\nSECURE YOUR DEVICES\nThere are a few additional ways to further secure your smart devices. A number of companies now offer a verification system to control access to devices, called two-factor authentication. When you attempt to log into an app, a one-time-use code is sent to another of your devices, which then needs to be entered in the original app. It’s not perfect, but makes it virtually impossible for someone unwanted to access your accounts.\nAlso, many manufacturers allow you to opt into automatic hardware and software updates, something that will ensure the latest fixes get installed to repair new security vulnerabilities. Make sure you check the settings section of your devices’ apps and your smartphone’s app marketplace for updates to devices that don’t automatically do this.\nPayton said she also reboots smart home devices once a week as an added security measure. “That reboot will actually make it grab any new security and privacy settings and downloads when it reconnects to the internet,” she explained. However, this is impractical for some devices, especially ones that are hard-wired into your home like in-wall dimmers and smart thermostats.\n\n\nRESET BEFORE YOU RESELL\nJust because you’re ready to ditch a device doesn’t mean it’s ready to forget you. After all, your Wi-Fi password and other personal info is often stored on that camera, smart plug or smart bulb. Before selling or recycling any device, be sure to do a factory reset first. Some devices require a button-press on the actual device, while others allow you to do it from the app. Either way, make sure that your info is no longer available through the app.\nIf a device is broken and you’re unable to wipe it clean, make sure it’s really broken and smash its components to pieces. According to the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, “Physical destruction of a device is the ultimate way to prevent others from retrieving your information.”\nI like to think about all those times a device stopped working or disconnected from the network, and the idea of whacking it with a hammer. Just make sure you don’t hurt yourself in the process.\nWHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS SECURITY?\nThere is mounting pressure on manufacturers to adopt better security practices. “The industry should be using strong encryption wherever possible, verifying firmware updates and inviting security audits,” said Bennett Cyphers, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nThe E.F.F. and organisations like The Digital Standard and the Mozilla Foundation are pressuring companies and government bodies to put stronger security practices in place. But everyone we spoke to agrees that, for now, consumers need to be proactive about security.\n“Honestly, given where we are and how businesses think about security and privacy, the onus is on you. Nobody can look out for your security and privacy like you can for you and your family,” Payton said.\nBy Rachel Cericola © The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     privacy ', '     Tech ', '     Residences ']}"

      SingHealth to replace paper medical certificates with digital MCs by 2020: GovTech
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Paper medical certificates (MC) issued by SingHealth institutions are expected to be replaced by digital MCs by 2020, the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) said.\nWriting on its media platform TechNews on Monday (Sep 9), GovTech said patients will receive\xa0digital MCs under a new system called DigiMC.\nThe system\xa0has been piloted at the Singapore General Hospital and the National Heart Centre Singapore. Product manager\xa0Chong Zi Xin\xa0said\xa095 per cent of the 179 patients surveyed over a four-month period said they were satisfied with the new system.\nGovTech said it plans to implement digital MCs across all SingHealth institutions by early 2020. They will be issued in parallel with hard copy MCs for a few months before the latter is eventually phased out.\nAbout 1 million hard copy MCs were generated in 2017 by SingHealth, Singapore's largest healthcare cluster.\nRECEIVING A DIGITAL MC\nPatients who\xa0are issued digital MCs\xa0will receive an SMS text message containing a\xa0URL for accessing the digital MC.\nThey can forward the SMS or the URL to their employers, said product manager Annabelle Ng.\nDigital MCs are less likely to be misplaced, she added, as SMS messages can be backed up on commercial Cloud services for later reference.

      Why restaurants will have to rethink their business model in order to survive
  </h1>, 'text': 'The expansion of the restaurant trade was one of the unexpected ricochets from the French Revolution of 1789. As aristocrats lost their heads, their chefs lost their jobs. Thrown on to the streets, they found a new living opening public restaurants and feeding hungry revolutionaries.\nLe Grand Vefour, which opened just before the upheaval in 1784 in the arcades of Paris’s Palais Royal and is still running today, was one of the grandest examples. Its signature fricassee de poulet Marengo celebrates one of Napoleon’s most famous military victories.\nBut if restaurants were born out of revolution, many of them may die in one, too. The latest technological revolution is dis-intermediating the intermediary, enabling buyers and sellers to match their needs in faster, cheaper and more direct ways.\nInternet companies, such as Alibaba and Uber, and venture capitalists have been pouring billions into food delivery companies and dark kitchen operators aiming to move meals from restaurants or high-turnover industrial kitchens in cheap locations directly to consumers’ front doors. Meals on wheels has acquired a new meaning.\n\n\n Spice up your day with a splash of red curry!��Up Thai | New York, NY #LetsEats #UberEats\nA post shared by  Uber Eats (@ubereats) on Jul 15, 2019 at 10:25am PDT\nHaving taken on taxi cartels around the world, Uber’s founder Travis Kalanick is trying to disrupt the restaurant trade. Last year he invested US$150 million (S$207 million) to acquire a controlling stake in City Storage Systems, which runs smart kitchens and has big ambitions to change the way meals are prepared and sold. Amazon, the great white shark of e-commerce, has scented blood in the water and has been haltingly experimenting with food delivery. Subject to regulatory clearance, Amazon is leading a US$575 million investment round in Deliveroo, the London-based food delivery company.\n\n\n How about a rainbow buddha bowl for lunch? ��: @cru8foods\nA post shared by  Deliveroo (@deliveroo) on Aug 28, 2019 at 4:30am PDT\nRunning a restaurant has always been a precarious high-churn game but traditional eateries are increasingly being challenged by high rents and wages and near-instantaneous exposure of their failings on social media.\nFor the moment, food delivery companies are helping some traditional restaurants win incremental business. Dark kitchens can also enable them to de-risk expansion, allowing them to explore new locations without running the risk of opening premises there. Some industry figures warn, however, that this could prove fool’s gold as food delivery companies and dark kitchens develop brands of their own to compete with the restaurant chains. These data-rich operators will know their customers far better than a restaurant ever can.\nThe most dramatic changes are occurring in China, India, Brazil and Indonesia, where the classic restaurant trade is under-developed and a clutch of innovative companies is expanding fast.\nThere are some 355 million users of food delivery apps in China, where the two internet giants, Alibaba and Tencent, are slugging it out. Their delivery businesses, Ele.me and Meituan, offer an increasing range of services, including convenience store items and flowers. An estimated 1.8 million food deliveries are placed every day just in Beijing.\nNaspers, the South African investment group, has put more than US$2 billion in food delivery companies around the world, including iFood in Brazil and Swiggy in India, serving 35 countries and delivering about 100 million orders a month. Larry Illg, chief executive of Naspers’ online food delivery and ventures arm, says the opportunities are probably greatest in these fast-developing countries given the growth in middle-class demand and inefficiencies in market structures. In the west, people spend about 10 per cent of their money and time on buying and preparing food, he says. In less developed countries that is closer to 20 per cent.\n\n\nA post shared by Swiggy (@swiggyindia) on Aug 21, 2019 at 3:31am PDT\nThe ultimate prize for these companies is to predict patterns of consumption enabling them to offer even faster and cheaper deliveries. They can prepare and dispatch the requisite number of salads to certain districts in Mumbai before orders have even been placed.\n“These companies are increasingly using data and machine learning to understand what people want to eat and when they want to eat it,” Illg said. “By aggregating supply and demand you can do a better job of matching. Restaurants will have to rethink their model.”\nAs in so many other areas, technology is commoditising convenience. But even the most evangelical technologist believes that some restaurants will continue to exist. They will, though, increasingly live or die by the power of their brand and the appeal of the experience they offer.\nAs Le Grand Vefour discovered at the outset of the trade, the most important competitive advantage for any restaurant is its unique ambience.\nBy John Thornhill © 2019 The Financial Times Ltd\n', 'related_topics': ['     Restaurants ', '     technology ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      Every nation has to be ready for rapid tech changes, prepare people for it: Heng Swee Keat
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A changing global economy, rapid tech advances and preparing people\xa0for these changes in the future are three challenges everyone in the world, including Singapore, will have to deal with, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Friday (Sep 6).\nSpeaking at the HT-MintAsia Leadership Summit, Mr Heng shared his thoughts about the changing structures of global economy and how every market will try to do better and grow their economy so as to improve people’s lives.\nHe pointed out that more countries appear to be retreating from the global economic system and engaging in more protectionist behaviour, but there is still “very strong value” for a multilateral trading system so that they can tackle issues together.\nOn the economic level, Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said the reason why there are so many unicorns, or even decacorns, today is because of the scale of their operations. A decacorn is a company that is valued at more than S$10 billion.\n“The economies of scale to be able to develop a product and scale it across the world makes a huge difference, and I hope that the world can embrace this, for us to generate a lot more resources that are still very much needed,” he said.\nIt is not just about economic growth, too.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister said many of the global challenges today, such as\xa0climate change, need\xa0to be tackled at the global level, reiterating the message Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong shared in his National Day Rally last month.\nTECH TSUNAMI\nThe second challenge Mr Heng highlighted was the speed of technological advancement\xa0and how the convergence of different technologies is changing the shape of industries.\nHe cited Funan DigitaLife Mall as an example,\xa0saying how it was the go-to mall for buying a computer when he was a student.\xa0\n“But today, nobody buys computers that way, right? You buy online, you get all kinds of discounts\xa0and it gets delivered to you,” he said.\xa0\nAs such, mall operators such as CapitaLand have had to drastically reinvent what it means to be a mall, with much more invested in the customer experience, the minister said.\n“E-commerce is going to change the shape of how buildings are going to be used,” Mr Heng said.\nAlibaba’s e-commerce platform Taobao is an example of this shift, with its a “click-and-mortar” physical store at Funan.\xa0\nIt is the first Taobao Store of its kind in Southeast Asia , allowing shoppers to\xa0touch and feel the merchandise before buying, while acting as a gathering place for those who are new to the online shopping platform and are confused by its app\'s user interface.\xa0\n“The store will bring to life our vision of seamless integration between online and offline commerce,"" said Ms Charlene Zhang, business development lead at Taobao Singapore.\nIt’s not just about using tech, but how business processes and business models are re-engineered to serve customers better, Mr Heng said. “We have to think about what the implications of these (developments) are on jobs, on business models, on the way that we regulate.”\nPREPARING WORKERS FOR THE FUTURE\nThe last trend Mr Heng spoke of was the need for leaders to help people become better prepared for the future and give them access to more relevant jobs.\xa0\xa0\nHe said Singapore is already doing so by investing in healthcare and education, for example, and this will become significantly more important if the Government is to retain the social compact with citizens.\nMr Heng recounted how during his time as Education Minister, he brought a group of senior educational leaders to Silicon Valley to learn more about educational tech.\xa0\nHe said while the educators were enthused about the creativity of the technopreneurs and how the products could relieve people of many routine tasks, they were less so over one aspect.\n“We don’t like the assumption that they made that teachers are redundant and can be made redundant,” Mr Heng recalled the educators\' feedback.\xa0\nHowever, efforts were made to develop a system that would incorporate technology in the local context and Mr Heng said he was happy to see a whole team of teachers learn how to use ed tech well.\nOne example was the use of optical character readers to address the “classic” educator’s pain point – marking exam papers. With these readers, multiple choice questions can be graded by computers immediately, he said.\n“Now when you think about it, did (tech) create or destroy jobs? No, it changed the nature of jobs,” Mr Heng said. \xa0\n“Jobs will change in many, many areas and jobs (that) are redundant ought to be gotten rid of. But our job is then to re-train workers so that they can access new and better jobs,” he added. \xa0\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Heng Swee Keat ', '     technology ']}"

      Indonesia launches digital TV in North Kalimantan to develop border areas
  </h1>, 'text': 'NUNUKAN, North Kalimantan: Indonesia launched digital TV broadcast in Nunukan, North Kalimantan\xa0province on Saturday (Aug 31), in a move to develop its remote border areas.\nNorth Kalimantan, which borders east Malaysia, was part of\xa0East Kalimantan province. It\xa0became a new province in 2013, making it the youngest province in Indonesia.\nThe region is largely underdeveloped compared to the two neighbouring Malaysian states - Sabah to the north and Sarawak to the east -\xa0so residents have had to watch Malaysian television channels for information and entertainment.\nLaunching the digital TV broadcast on Saturday, Indonesia\'s information and communication minister Mr Rudiantara said he hopes that better access to quality television will improve the lives of people in North Kalimantan.\n“There are several benefits of having digital TV. First of all, there will be better quality television, no more fuzzy television,"" the minister said.\n""Secondly, if it’s still using the analog system, because it’s an old system, it uses up frequency.""\nMr Rudiantara added that\xa0the frequencies should be allocated to a much-needed disaster communication system since Indonesia is prone to natural disasters.\nDIGITAL TV FOR NEW CAPITAL\nDigital TV has been in development in Indonesia\xa0since 2007, but due to regulation issues, large parts of the vast\xa0archipelago\xa0are still dependent on analog TV.\nMoving forward, the digital system is being prepared for\xa0Indonesia’s new capital in East Kalimantan, Mr Rudiantara revealed.\nLast week, President Joko Widodo announced that the country’s capital would move from Jakarta to East Kalimantan province, in a location that\'s partly in Penajam Paser Utara regency and partly in Kutai Kartanegara regency.\n“So the government and telecommunication operators are currently designing a new network in Kalimantan,” Rudiantara said during the launch.\nSaturday’s digital TV launch was also marked by officials of national TV station TVRI, Trans 7 and Metro TV. They handed out setup boxes for digital TV to a few villagers of Nunukan.\n“The hope is that this (digital TV) will be used to the maximum, this is only the launch so hopefully this will continue onwards, not only today, and it will reach every district (in North Kalimantan),” Nunukan Regent Mdm Asmin Laura Hafid said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     technology ']}"

      New laws needed to regulate ‘novel’ gambling products such as loot boxes in video games: Josephine Teo
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Regulators around the world need to figure out how to regulate “novel” gambling products such as loot boxes in video games that are designed to appeal to younger audiences, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo on Thursday (Aug 29).\nSpeaking at the 5th Singapore Symposium on Gambling Regulation and Crime, Mrs Teo noted how gambling preferences have changed, with the younger generation less interested in traditional gambling products such as jackpot machines and horse-racing.\nTo attract this demographic, companies have developed “novel products” such as loot boxes, which are virtual mystery boxes gamers buy in the hope of gaining powerful weapons or skins to enhance the game experience.\nOthers have reinvented traditional gambling products and added skills-based elements in an effort to have them resemble computer gaming products, the minister said, citing slot machines with joysticks or other features that allow users to make choices during the game.\n“Such new products across various modes of gambling or gaming will certainly require us to put on our thinking hats, and probably take a look at the new laws we need to put in place to regulate,” said Mrs Teo, who is also Manpower Minister.\n“Regulators and law enforcement agencies need to keep up to date with these developments and make sure our policies and rules remain effective,” she added.\nDuring her speech, Mrs Teo also spoke about the challenges regulators face because of online technology.\n“Everyone now has a smartphone with mobile broadband access. From their smartphones, punters can access gambling products anywhere, anytime,” she said.\nCiting figures from PwC, Mrs Teo noted how global remote gambling revenue has grown 10 per cent annually from 2009 to 2016, almost doubling the revenue to US$39 billion.\xa0\nIn Singapore, online gambling has also risen, said Mrs Teo.\nAbout 60 per cent of Singapore Pools’ sports betting turnover is now done through remote channels - double that of the 30 per cent seen three years ago, she noted, adding this trend is expected to continue.\xa0\nSingapore Pools and the Singapore Turf Club were\xa0the only two operators allowed to run online betting services after the introduction of the Remote Gambling Act in 2016, which bans all online and phone betting activities.\xa0\nIn turn, the two organisations have to implement various social safeguards such as ensuring that only those aged 21 and above can open player accounts and that they do not gamble on credit.\nSingapore Pools had announced it was taking over Singapore Turf Club's horse-betting services, including remote betting, last October.\nNEW IDEAS TO PROMOTE RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING\nIn addition to the challenges mentioned above, Mrs Teo said there are several areas in which gambling regulators in Singapore and its global counterparts can learn from one another.\nThe first area is in improving responsible gambling, which is “critical” for mitigating the risk of problem gambling, said Mrs Teo.\nShe cited several innovative initiatives by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, including a PlayMyWay tool that allows customers to set their gambling budget.\nThis is something done here as well, she noted, saying that individuals who gamble online with Singapore Pools are required to set their expenditure and loss limits.\nAdditionally, authorities are working closely with casinos here to implement measures to help gamblers make informed choices, said Mrs Teo. Some measures being studied include providing people with notifications on amount and time spent in the casinos, she added.\nThe second area is on law and order concerns, particularly money laundering and terrorism financing, the minister said.\xa0\nWhile regulators have put in place strict controls to manage law and order concerns related to gambling operations and prevent infiltration of criminal elements, more can still be done, such as making better use of data.\nThe French Online Gaming Regulatory Authority, she pointed out, uses data to detect money laundering, match fixing and study players’ behaviour.\nSimilarly, the Casino Regulatory Authority (CRA) is exploring how data analytics can be used to understand the risk profiles of patrons and identify those who pose regulatory risks, the minister said.\xa0\n“Such insights can be used to support policy development and enhance CRA’s risk management,” Mrs Teo said.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Josephine Teo ', '     technology ']}"

If that has ever been true, it certainly no longer is,"" he said.\xa0\nConcluding his speech, Chief Justice Menon said that although the legal profession came to be known as a ""learned profession"" centuries ago, ""we inhabit a different age, and it will take much more than it used to to rightfully retain the privilege of that appellation"".\n""In this age of change, we can only remain a \'learned profession\'\xa0by becoming a profession of learners.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Supreme Court ', '     law ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: The worry, anxiety and emotional challenges of disconnecting while on holiday
  </h1>, 'text': 'AUCKLAND: What did we do before smartphones? Our devices have become an essential tool for modern life, even when we’re on holiday.\nIn fact, technology is revolutionising tourism. We navigate with Google Maps, we use TripAdvisor to find good restaurants, we share our travel experiences on Instagram, and we instantly message people back home.\nImagine if all of these things were taken away from you.\nThat’s what we did to 24 people who volunteered for our interview-based study on what it’s like to give up your smartphone and travel digital-free.\nWith a growing concern about the negative impact digital technology can have on people’s wellbeing, especially on holiday, we wanted to find out if a digital detox would help. But we found that disconnecting on holiday comes with emotional challenges of its own.\nDIFFICULT EMOTIONS\nWe asked our volunteers to keep a diary of their emotions and feelings before they disconnected, during their trip, and after re-connecting when they returned home. We also conducted interviews after their digital-free journeys.\nIndividuals who choose to disconnect on holiday tend to be looking for some therapeutic rehabilitation. But we found the digital-free journey was not always easy.\nTravellers experienced different levels of emotions due to technology disconnection. Feelings of anxiety started to build with the anticipation of disconnecting, with worries about what would happen.\nOne participant said: “To be honest, two days before the trip I was a little bit nervous about it.”\nThe negative emotions escalated in the first few days of the disconnected holiday with a mixture of frustration, worry, isolation, and anxiety. The feelings were especially overwhelming for some tech-savvy travellers who were used to technology in their daily lives.\nThey struggled to settle into a new environment without their usual support of technology. One participant mentioned their anxiety around safety:\nThere is a chance that I might be in danger or have an accident, and my family cannot reach me.\nUNBEARABLE EXPERIENCE\nTravellers at this stage were forced to travel in an old-fashion manner, navigating using a printed map, talking to strangers, and reading printed bus timetables. Two of our participants even gave up at this stage as they found the emotional experience unbearable.\nThe strength of emotions was not the same for everyone. In the research, we discovered several influencing factors.\nIt was easier to disconnect in rural destinations, if participants had travel companions, if they had fewer work commitments back home, if they had strong motivations for disconnecting, or if their reliance on technology in daily life was low.\nOur participants overcame the initial emotions and then started to enjoy the digital-free experience.\xa0\nThey found themselves more immersed in the destination, created more valuable moments with their travel companions, and had many more memorable and authentic encounters with locals.\nThey felt free, happy, excited, and relieved. One participant said: “I feel quite good that I made it this far without technology. I feel quite liberated.”\nWithout the disruptions of digital technologies, they were fully engaged with their holiday experience, demonstrating that a digital-free holiday can contribute to well-being.\nRECONNECTING TO NORMAL LIFE\nAll detoxes must come to an end, and our travellers had to face reconnecting to technology at the end of their holidays. Many started to feel anxious or guilty, but others, although they enjoyed the disconnected experience, felt excited to reconnect.\nInterestingly, first time digital-free travellers felt disappointed as they anticipated the things they missed out on while disconnected, but then realised they had not missed much. Many reevaluated their relationships with technology. One of our participants stated:\n“It was rather disappointing turning my phone back on. Seeing Facebook likes and messages I had, I felt how superficial they were. Not important stuff. I started to think why am I so addicted to counting my likes and reading comments that don’t really have a huge impact on my life? Technology, especially Facebook, has become my life”.\nUnderstanding the emotions of tourists can also provide insights for tour operators and destination management organisations when developing either off-the-grid packages or tech-savvy tour products.\nUnderstanding what triggers consumers’ negative and positive emotions can help companies improve products and marketing strategies.\nDigital-free travel provides an opportunity for many travellers to re-examine their relationships with technology. Many participants reflected on their addictions and “fear of missing out”, and considered bringing this digital-free idea into their daily life, or do it more during their holidays.\nBrad McKenna is Lecturer in Information Systems, University of East Anglia.\xa0 Lena Waizenegger is Lecturer in Information Systems, Auckland University of Technology.\xa0 Wenjie Cai is Lecturer in Tourism and Hospitality, University of Greenwich.

      Art and watch collectors: Here’s how blockchain can stamp out fakes
  </h1>, 'text': 'Cryptocurrencies are often seen as the public face of blockchain, but for many observers, bitcoin and its brothers are little more than a fad, typically followed by a frenzy and then a fall. On the other hand, the technology that underpins them has far more substance, if much less of the glamour.\n\n\nBlockchain allows bitcoin to exist, but it also offers so much more than that. Its countless uses are only really now starting to be seen by a wider audience.\nThe greatest benefit this so-called distributed ledger technology provides is that its records cannot be changed. This means a blockchain database can safeguard the provenance of almost anything you could imagine, from the beans that go into your coffee and the pills you pop all the way through to the individual components inside a Swiss watch.\nOnce an entry is made on the blockchain it is there for good and cannot be altered by any single individual. This makes it exceedingly useful for registering the authenticity of luxury items whose value lies in their uniqueness.\nAccording to an OECD report on counterfeiting, the world trade in fake goods is worth upwards of US$460 billion (S$624 billion) a year.\n\n\nFootwear is the biggest category for fakers, which probably explains why brands such as Salvatore Ferragamo are now fitting RFID chips to their shoes that can be used to confirm their authenticity.\nWatches were found to be the product most likely to suffer from counterfeiting. In the art world, some experts believe that half of the US$67 billion of fine art sold each year is fake.\n""One of the biggest problems we have encountered with fine art is tracing it back to its source,” said Douglas Gan, chief executive of BCB Global, a blockchain developer that is working on a system that will allow artists to tokenise themselves and also protect their work using smart paper.\nSmart paper technology is getting more and more mature. It can provide artists with a material that is literally anchored onto the blockchain, which will record any changes made to an art piece to prevent forgeries down the line.\n“When the artist dies, that’s when his art starts to become valuable. And the biggest problem for art pieces that are valuable is knowing their source. You have experts who can assess whether a piece is real, but with smart paper, the blockchain holds the fundamental truth,” said Gan.\n“It allows the artist to draw on it so the whole piece becomes a smart piece; even if you cut one part of the paper the remainder will remain active.”\n\n\nPut practically, an artist paints a work on smart paper, which registers every brushstroke and sends this to a database. If a forgery is made, even on smart paper, the database will reflect any discrepancy.\nBCB Global has developed this concept at a time when the cost of smart paper is very high. But as the price becomes more affordable, and the technology starts being commercialised, the software developer expects to have a solution ready.\nIt is also working on a way of using blockchain to allow struggling artists to sell futures contracts for their work. This will enable them to fundraise and share profits with their fans, project commissioners and art galleries.\nBy buying a share of an artist’s token, investors can take a cut of all his future art sales. When a piece changes hands, this will register on the blockchain to activate a smart contract – an automated process that fulfils the terms of the token, such as initiating a payment.\n“What we are doing is talking to the galleries to tokenise the artist on blockchain so anyone who wants to support them can invest in them by buying a chunk of their token,” said Gan.\n“They will increase the value of the artist’s token by buying or selling parts of it later on.”\nMany collectors see their Swiss watches as art pieces, and they will stand to benefit from blockchain as they hand their timepieces down to their children and grandchildren.\nIn May, Vacheron Constantin revealed it would start using distributed ledger technology to authenticate its watches, saying: “Blockchain certification serves to avoid paper authentication, which can easily be forged.”\nAs the world’s oldest watchmaker in continuous production, Vacheron’s archives date back to the first watch it made, meaning it could literally document the industry’s history on blockchain.\nSwiss watchmaker Gvchiani is more of an upstart. Last year it launched a limited series of watches that are baked into blockchain, and as unique as their owner, according to the man whose technology makes it tick.\n“The Masterblock is a mechanical Swiss watch and is not connected any way,” said Vicken Bayramian, founder of Cryptolex, which developed the technology underpinning the Gvchiani watch.\n“Every phase of the watch’s construction is certified on the blockchain. Once you scan the watch with the Masterblock app, you can see how it was made, you can track each component of the watch and you can basically recreate the DNA of the watch.”\nAs a tribute to the white paper that first defined bitcoin, Masterblock is available in 2009 pieces – the year the document was released. The 2,009th unit is named Satoshi, after the mythical author of the white paper, and will be sold at Christie’s next September.\n“The practical application is that you are sure that what the watchmaker is selling you is genuine. You aren’t trusting a piece of paper that is said to guarantee authenticity,” Bayramian said.\n“If you go and buy a Rolex, it will be based on the representations made by the seller. They will give you invoices and certificates with stamps to guarantee it, whereas with this watch process you can identify anything.”\nThe Cryptolex founder, who claims to have first become involved in blockchain a month after the white paper was published, is in talks with Louis Vuitton to develop a way to certify its bags using blockchain. He is also talking to pharmaceuticals companies for similar authentication.\n“I got into blockchain a month after the white paper. We are now seeing how it can be used to full effect,” said Bayramian.\n“For me, blockchain technology is the greatest revolution since the creation of the internet.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     Bitcoin ', '     luxury ', '     Expert Advice ']}"

      Old-age selfies are fun, but should you be concerned about Russian-made FaceApp?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: First it was Snapchat’s gender-bending feature, and now FaceApp is taking social media by storm, with users having fun transforming their faces into younger or older versions of themselves.\nFaceApp, which was launched by Russian publisher Wireless Lab in 2017, uses artificial intelligence to modify users\' photos, changing their hair colour, adding wrinkles or subtracting years from their faces.\nIt is currently the most downloaded free application on Google Play, with more than 100 million users, after its new aging filter attracted interest from celebrities including music superstar Drake and NBA champion Steph Curry. \xa0\nHowever, as social media users populate their feeds with these entertaining selfies, is there a cause for concern about how their data is being used?\nWHAT ARE THE CONCERNS OVER FACEAPP?\nConcerns over the app and its data privacy have gained traction over the past week.\nOn Monday, software\xa0developer Joshua Nozzi\'s tweeted his concerns about the app, which were picked up by several news publications.\nIn a now-deleted tweet, Mr Nozzi said that FaceApp ""immediately uploads"" users’ photos without their permission. He has since clarified in a blog post that he was wrong about the accusation.\nHowever, concerns over the terms and conditions of the app remain.\nClauses in the app’s terms and conditions include granting FaceApp permission to use the photos for commercial purposes.\n“While it may initially seem private, the terms of service from some of these apps may raise some concern around privacy since they do not make entirely clear on what is happening behind the scenes,” Mr Shashwat Khandelwal, McAfee’s head of Southeast Asia consumer business, told CNA in an email interview.\n“When users grant certain permissions through the app, the company may use the data for their own benefit,” he added.\nFaceApp CEO Yaroslav Goncharov, however, has told the Washington Post that the app only uploads photos selected by a user for editing and that most photos are deleted from its servers within 48 hours.\nGovernment authorities in Russia do not have any access to the photos, he told the Post, adding that the company does not ""sell or share any user data with any third parties"".\nMr Goncharov was also cited in BBC as saying that the terms in FaceApp\'s privacy policy are generic and that the company does not share the data for ad-targeting purposes.\nInstead, the app makes its money through paid subscriptions for premium features, he said.\nStill, Mr Shashwat noted, the app stores data on a cloud and “the fact remains that FaceApp gains access to the user’s photographs by the user’s own will"".\n""Once the photograph is with FaceApp, it is up to them how they choose to handle that content”, he said.\nAdditionally, photographs uploaded to the cloud are at\xa0risk of being targeted by hackers who may use them for running facial identification to compromise individuals and companies, said Mr Alvin Rodrigues, senior director and security strategist at Forcepoint Asia Pacific & Japan.\n""The face is your personal copyright. From a security perspective, you are giving away your ability to use your face as a password to log files or to lock your devices,"" he said.\nWHY ARE GOVERNMENTS SPEAKING OUT?\nAuthorities from Singapore to the United States and Europe have raised their concerns about the app, with some calling for investigations into its potential threat to national security.\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (Jul 19) cautioned that people should be careful with what apps they download.\n“Many are having a bit of fun sharing the modified photos, of themselves or others. There’s nothing wrong with that, but most likely many don’t know (or don’t care) how much personal data such apps get access to when they are downloaded and used,"" he said in a Facebook post.\n“The tech world moves so fast that it is difficult to screen every new app that comes out. That shouldn’t stop us from trying out new things, but do be careful with what apps you download and use,” he said.\nFaceApp has also come under fire in the United States, with one senator urging a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probe, reported AFP.\n""FaceApp\'s location in Russia raises questions regarding how and when the company provides access to the data of US citizens to third parties, including potentially foreign governments,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a letter to the FBI.\n""It would be deeply troubling if the sensitive personal information of US citizens was provided to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber hostilities against the United States,"" he added.\nPoland and Lithuania have also said they are looking into the potential security risks of the app.\nPoland\'s digital affairs ministry said it was ""analysing"" the security risks posed by FaceApp to the personal data of its users, despite assurances by its designers that the app is safe.\n""Various experts point to possible risks related to inadequate protection of users\' privacy,"" the\xa0ministry said in a statement on its website.\nCybersecurity authorities in EU neighbour Lithuania are also investigating potential threats to users\' personal data, deputy defence minister Edvinas Kerza told AFP.\nMr Kerza added that the makers of FaceApp have cooperated with other Russian Internet companies that may not comply with EU data use regulations.\nWHAT ABOUT OTHER SIMILAR APPS?\nFaceApp is not the first app where users upload pictures of themselves. Popular apps such as Instagram and Facebook all make use of similar features and contain user data. According to the editor-in-chief of tech site Lifewire, Twitter also has similar clauses within its terms and conditions.\n""Indeed, while the spotlight for the past week has been on FaceApp’s privacy policies on the back of its virality across social media, it’s important that we remember that similar policies are in place across all major social media networks – FaceApp’s policies don’t go against the grain,""\xa0Mr Shashwat said.\nSHOULD USERS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN DATA?\nSixty-three per cent of consumers do not read\xa0license agreements and 43 per cent\xa0just tick all privacy permissions when they are installing new apps,\xa0said Kasperky\'s general manager\xa0for Southeast Asia, Mr Yeo Siang Tiong, referring to a study done three years ago.\nHe added that ""there\xa0is no harm in joining online challenges or installing new apps"", but ""the danger lies when users just grant these apps limitless permissions into their contacts, photos, private messages, and more"".\nUsers should do some research and look out for any red flags that have been raised around apps’ security, Mr Shashwat added.\n“Make sure you always read the privacy terms and conditions when signing up to ensure that your personal data isn’t shared with anyone you don’t know or trust.\n“It’s also important to be aware of how your data could be used and accessed by third party sites and apps,” he added.\nWhen it comes to deciphering the chunk of text found within the terms and conditions, Mr Shashwat suggested that consumers look out for the following - personal data, ranging from names or usernames to pictures, location data and browsing habits.\n“The privacy policy of any app should dictate how the data that was acquired from the user is handled from start to end. This includes how the data is meant to be used, storage and transfer policies, the duration the data will be kept by the app, policies around how the user can ask for the data to be removed, and whether the data is accessed by any additional third parties,” he said.\n“Overall, it’s a good security habit for all consumers to only share personal data when it’s absolutely necessary.”\nAdditional reporting by Kevin Kwang.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Russia ', '     technology ', '     Lee Hsien Loong ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'CHANTILLY, France: Ministers from G7 top economies on Thursday (Jul 18) reached consensus on steps towards an accord on taxing digital giants, an issue that has divided the United States and its allies Britain and France.\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who hosted the two-day meeting in Chantilly outside Paris, hailed the consensus as unprecedented, although US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted there was more work to be done.\nThe French parliament this month passed a law that would tax digital giants for income amassed inside a country even if their headquarters are elsewhere, a move the United States complained discriminated against US firms like Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.\nBritain has announced plans for a similar tax and the G7 meeting in the tranquil French town -\xa0usually famed for its horses rather than horsetrading - was dominated by tough talks to find some common ground.\nLe Maire said finance ministers and central bankers had reached an agreement ""to tax activities without physical presence, in particular digital activities.""\n""This is the first time that G7 members agree in principle on this,"" he told reporters.\n""MINIMUM TAX""\nFrance issued a statement saying the G7 had agreed a two-pronged solution - confirming the principle of companies being able to accrue revenues outside their legal base but also on a minimum tax to be agreed internationally for their activities.\nMinisters ""fully supported a two-pillar solution to be adopted by 2020"", the statement said.\n""Ministers agreed that a minimum level of effective taxation ... would contribute to ensuring that companies pay their fair share of tax,"" it said.\nA French official, who asked not to be named, said the tax rate would have to be agreed in the future.\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he was happy with the ""progress"" achieved and in particular with the reference to the minimum tax level in the final statement.\nFurther talks would now be needed in the wider context of the G20 group of top economies for an international agreement which would be overseen by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\nScholz expressed hope that a full international consensus could be reached next year under the OECD.\n""STEP FORWARD""\nThe French parliament\'s move infuriated President Donald Trump and the US had announced an unprecedented probe against France which could trigger the imposition of tariffs.\nMnuchin struck a slightly more cautious tone than his French counterpart Le Maire while making clear he was well satisfied with the talks.\n""We made some significant progress at this meeting, there is more work to be done,"" Mnuchin told reporters, adding that ministers had made a ""big step in the right direction"".\nHe said the United States has ""significant concerns"" with the French law and planned British legislation and was pleased that both Paris and London would dump the domestic laws if an international agreement was forged.\n""Everyone here wants to reach an acceptable international solution,"" said Mnuchin. ""Creating certainty for global multinationals is very important,"" he added.\n""WARNING ON LIBRA""\nThe G7 ministers had far less trouble agreeing a position on new cryptocurrencies such as Facebook\'s Libra, saying such new and untested digital money risked destabilising the international monetary system and were not ready to be implemented.\n""They agreed that projects such as Libra may affect monetary sovereignty and the functioning of the international monetary system,"" the French statement said.\nThe other key issue at the meeting was finding a replacement for Christine Lagarde, who has led the International Monetary Fund since 2011 but has resigned to become head of the European Central Bank.\nLe Maire\'s European colleagues at the G7 have decided he should lead the search for a candidate from Europe, although no shortlist has been fixed yet, said a European official.\n', 'related_topics': ['     France ', '     G7 ', '     technology ', '     United States ', '     Britain ', '     Paris ', '     Google ', '     Facebook ', '     Amazon ']}"

      FAQ: How worried should we be about the health risks of 5G?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: By 2020, Singapore\xa0could see\xa0super-fast, more reliable wireless communication with the planned rollout of 5G networks.\nIt has been hailed as a technology game-changer, with supporters saying it will transform the way people live their lives, enabling things from self-driving cars to remote surgery.\xa0\nYet as with other mobile communication features, some concerns have been raised about potential radiofrequency exposure-related health risks. In Singapore,\xa024 of the 62 responses garnered by the Info-communications Media Development Authority\'s (IMDA) public consultation exercise were from people worried about the health risks of 5G networks.\xa0\nIMDA, however, has said that\xa0the ambient level of radiofrequency radiation in Singapore is “very low” and\xa0typically below international guidelines.\nSo are there risks and where are the concerns originating from? Here\'s what you need to know.\nWHAT IS 5G?\n5G marks the 5th generation of mobile and wireless communication networks, promising super-fast connections and low latency (lag), among other benefits.\xa0\nLike current networks, it relies on radio waves\xa0- part of the electromagnetic spectrum - to transmit and receive data via base stations and devices, to connect users to mobile communication networks.\nThe part of the electromagnetic spectrum which is used for communications is called the radiofrequency spectrum. It is\xa0divided into frequency bands, and 5G will use higher frequency bands than earlier networks to allow for better performance.\n5G waves will have frequencies in the microwave region of the spectrum, with microwaves being a specific category of radio waves, covering the frequency range 1 GHz to approximately 100 GHz.\nWHAT ARE SOME PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT?\nLike previous generations, 5G\xa0will also generate electromagnetic radiation. Some members of the public have voiced concerns about the possible impact on health this could have.\nIn May 2011, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer announced the classification of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" (Group 2B).\xa0\nThis category is used when a causal association is considered credible, but “when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence”.\nOther things which fall into the Group 2B classification include pickled vegetables, while processed meats, tobacco smoking and alcohol have higher classifications.\nSHOULD THEY BE?\nWHO has established a programme to evaluate the health effects from exposure to electromagnetic fields in the range from 0 to 300 GHz - well above the planned frequency band for 5G networks (which today are planned around the 3.5 GHz and the 25 GHz and 28 GHz bands, also known as mmWaves).\nAccording to the organisation, all reviews conducted so far have indicated that exposures to this frequency range do not produce any known adverse health effect. However, it added there are still gaps in knowledge that need to be filled “before better health risk assessments can be made”.\nSimilarly,\xa0Associate Professor\xa0M\xa0Prakash Hande from the National University of Singapore\'s\xa0Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said that some health concerns could be valid.\n""I believe that the concerns are valid. For 4G, it is known that continuous exposure can produce heat and oxidation in tissues,"" he said. ""Safety studies were conducted on animals, human cells, insects and bacteria where 4G appears to show some harmful effects. Surprisingly, as far as I know no safety test has been done yet for 5G.""\nBUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE RISK?\nRadiofrequency radiation is considered ""non-ionising"". This type of radiation does not cause cancer by damaging DNA in cells the way ionising radiation such as X-rays or gamma rays does.\nHowever, there have\xa0been concerns that some forms\xa0of non-ionising radiation could have biological effects that may result in cancer in some circumstances, according to the American Cancer Society.\nThe society also\xa0points out that if such radiation is absorbed in large enough amounts by materials containing water (for example food or body tissue), it can produce heat. This can lead to burns and tissue damage.\xa0\nSpecifically regarding 5G, researchers say that 5G radio waves do\xa0not get\xa0absorbed by the body but\xa0penetrate\xa0""only the outer layers of skin"", according to Assoc Prof Hande.\xa0\nThey can travel a few miles but are easily\xa0blocked by objects, according to Assoc Prof\xa0Hande, and so relative to\xa04G, more 5G towers will need to be put in place ""in order to achieve efficacy"".\nThis is where the issue has\xa0become a topic of debate, according to IDC senior research manager Nikhil Batra.\n""5G will require hundreds and thousands of these ‘small cells’ (a type of base station)\xa0to be installed in order to create a dense network, which will be different to current network generations, where signals were primarily relayed through large towers,"" he said.\nHowever he said this does not change the fact that 5G waves will still be ""very much"" in the non-ionising group.\n""Mobile networks and radiation\xa0have always been (under)\xa0discussion, but direct correlation between these mobile waves and impact to human health haven’t really been proven,"" he said. ""If we look at the electromagnetic\xa0spectrum, the 5G frequencies will still very much be in the \'non-ionising\'\xa0group, which are not absorbed by our bodies.""\n\nWHAT GUIDELINES ARE IN PLACE?\nExposure limits for electromagnetic fields are developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), a non-governmental organisation recognised by the WHO.\nAccording to the organisation, exposure to ""high frequency"" parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (which it defines as 100 kHz to 300 GHz) above a certain thermal threshold - taking into account duration of exposure - can lead to serious health effects such as heatstroke and burns.\nHowever, acute and long-term effects of\xa0exposure below the thermal threshold have been studied extensively without showing ""any conclusive evidence of adverse health effects"", said the organisation.\nIt recommends basic restrictions so that this thermal threshold is never reached, and sets specific guidelines establishing limits to electromagnetic field exposure.\xa0\nAccording to IMDA, the ambient level of radiofrequency radiation in Singapore is “very low”, and typically below 0.7 per cent of the ICNIRP guidelines.\xa0It says it will continue to heed these guidelines with the rollout of 5G services, and that along with the National Environment Agency, it will monitor developments and consult health experts as appropriate.\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     technology ']}"

      Social service sector gets S$20m boost to adopt technology, tackle manpower crunch
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Charities and social service agencies will be able to adopt technological solutions at subsidised rates under an initiative introduced by the National Council of Social Services (NCSS) on Tuesday (Jul 16).\xa0\nThese include an intelligent surveillance system called SoundEye, which can alert staff when people fall or injure themselves, and\xa0an autonomous cleaning robot designed to have human-like responses.\nUnder the Tech Booster initiative, social service agencies can get up to 98 per cent\xa0funding, capped at S$450,000 per centre, if they adopt three or more technology solutions.\nApplications to NCSS are now open and will close at the end of September.\n“The initiative enables existing care workers to provide better service to more clients, raise staff morale and retention\xa0and increase client centricity. Care workers’ roles can also be upgraded to attract more Singaporeans to take up these jobs,” said NCSS in a media release.\nThis was among two initiatives, which will cost around S$20 million, to help social service agencies address the manpower crunch.\xa0\nAt the annual Social Service Summit on Tuesday, Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee\xa0urged the industry to be open to digital transformation.\xa0\n""We must recognise the larger picture that the manpower situation will continue to tighten, across all sectors in Singapore,"" Mr Lee told a gathering of 1,000 social service professionals, corporates and donors.\n""We will need to meet more needs, but we are not going to find it easier to hire people.""\nNCSS president Anita Fam, in her speech. pointed out that innovation is a key challenge for the social service sector.\nShe cited\xa0figures from a recent social service sector survey, indicating\xa0that 26 per cent of more than\xa0280 industry leaders\xa0said innovation was one of their agency’s top three challenges.\nMs Fam added that\xa0innovation\xa0is “critical” for those operating in the non-profit space\xa0as agencies face “growing pressure to serve more people in need and to deliver measurable results with limited resources"".\nThe\xa0Tech Booster initiative hopes to introduce technology at residential facilities that find it hard to hire staff, such as adult disability homes, day care centres and welfare homes. One of the key aims of the programme is to reduce operational time spent by a care worker by 30 per cent.\nSocial service agencies can also tap\xa0the Project Back-To-Basics initiative to streamline processes for social service professionals, so that more of their time can be freed up to serve clients instead of handling work like administrative tasks.\nThese professionals include\xa0speech therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and youth workers.\xa0\n“The professionals can have higher job satisfaction and perform upgraded functions that better use their professional skills and knowledge,” said NCSS.\nA consultancy company will work with the organisations to identify areas where\xa0processes can be improved, and\xa0suggest ways to do this through technology or job redesign.\nSocial service agencies will get subsidies of up to 95 per cent, capped at S$100,000 for each centre.

      The Big Read: Strides made, but some way to go for Government to quench thirst for data
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE:\xa0From population and employment figures to white papers, government data was vital in getting business at Caregiver Asia off the ground.\nThe online platform, launched in 2015, links freelance caregiving professionals to those who need their services. Chief executive officer Yeo Wan Ling said it used population statistics to find out where elderly people live in Singapore, to deploy freelance carers where their services are needed most.\nThrough white papers and figures from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the labour movement, the firm also found out that many freelancers were not protected by legal agreements or work-injury-compensation insurance. It then set out to develop products to plug these gaps in the market, Ms Yeo said.\nIndeed, the availability of public data, coupled with breakneck advances in technology, has made once tortuous tasks -\xa0such as finding a freelance nurse, part-time cleaner or even a home -\xa0much easier these days.\nHelpling, an online home-services platform that allows users to hire part-time cleaners, compared government demographic data of the various districts in Singapore against its ideal customer segments, such as busy professionals and millennials.\nMr James Lim, its Asia-Pacific managing director, said: “Districts with demographics that highly resemble our ideal customer profiles would be prioritised as part of our marketing strategy.\n“The best insights are derived when we compare our own internal data with government data. It allows us to validate our assumptions, and find out where the gaps and opportunities are.”\nAt Ohmyhome, a property transaction platform, government data offers insight into past transaction figures and agent transaction records.\n“We make use of all these data to make it easy for our clients,” said its co-founder Race Wong.\nMogul.sg, a property portal, launched up to two years ahead of schedule in November last year, after it approached the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to supply it with the data it needed to map landmarks and facilities sought after by home owners.\nIts CEO, Mr Gerald Sim, said the company initially embarked on the effort alone, gathering data and mapping facilities such as electric-vehicle charging points manually, but completed only 40 per cent of the job in one-and-a-half years.\nIt sought the SLA’s help in June last year and received the rest of the data it needed -\xa0such as the location of supermarkets, kindergartens and park connectors -\xa0in a matter of weeks.\n“We had 50 categories (of data) coming into our database,” Mr Sim said.\nIn 2017, Cabinet minister Chan Chun Sing described data -\xa0the new currency in the digital age -\xa0as a valuable economic resource that allows Singapore to overcome its limitations on land, labour and natural resources.\nThe private and public sectors use data in a myriad of ways.\nTelecommunications firms, for instance, feed large amounts of anonymised customer data to firms and government agencies. These include commuting patterns and what people are interested in, based on online searches.\nFirms in turn use the data to make business decisions, such as where to set up stores, and government agencies tap the information to improve policies and programmes, as well as services and infrastructure.\nThe Government also keeps large volumes of data, some of which are still not readily available to businesses.\nNearly five years after it pledged to make\xa0more data available\xa0to get the private sector to play a big role in turning Singapore into a Smart Nation, business leaders said it could go further.\nElsewhere, academics, researchers and economists are also seeking greater access to data. The lack of data has constrained some in their research. Others have steered clear of doing research on Singapore.\nThe latest 2016/2017 Global Open Data Index, which benchmarks the openness of data around the world, placed Singapore 17th out of 94 economies, with a score of 60 per cent.\nTaiwan (90 per cent) took first place on the index, and Australia and the United Kingdom tied for second spot (79 per cent).\nSingapore was fully open when it came to data sets such as the government budget, key national demographic and economic statistics, and procurement. But the city state was not open at all in areas such as government spending, the index found.\nIt noted that the Government published spending data only for open-tender procurement and “at an aggregated level”.\nThe expectation is that governments publish records at a “detailed transactional level”, with data showing expenditure on a continuing basis, including transactions and subsidies.\nSingapore was ranked 23rd in the 2015 index, 66th in 2014, and 47th in 2013. The index’s publisher, British non-profit organisation Open Knowledge Foundation, discontinued the annual survey from 2017 owing to a lack of funding.\nCompanies and academics said they have benefited somewhat from greater data openness in the last few years but noted that there is room for more granular data in areas such as population distribution, the labour market, as well as historical data.\nIMPROVING EFFICIENCY WITH MORE DATA\nCompanies -\xa0including Caregiver Asia and Helpling -\xa0tap demographic data, such as age and income, to determine the viability of setting up operations in Singapore, as well as how to distribute their services and marketing activities.\nBut more data would help, business leaders said.\nHelpling’s Mr Lim said more data on the distribution of holders of the Employment Pass - which allows foreign professionals to work in Singapore -\xa0based on where they live and their country of origin would help the firm’s community marketing efforts. This is because expatriates form about 40 per cent of its customers.\nSuch a breakdown will allow the firm to offer more “hyperlocal on-demand home services that cater to their unique needs”, he said.\nMs Yeo of Caregiver Asia said the authorities should track and release more data to help start-ups in the care-delivery industry make “real breakthroughs” in service and operational efficiency.\nFor instance, how much time does it take for a patient discharged from hospital to get a professional caregiver at home?\nWhile hospitals and the Agency for Integrated Care may track the status of patients who receive social assistance, Ms Yeo said public hospitals could collect data from other patients as well, to make community care more efficient.\n“If you release such data, it allows people to come in to try to provide solutions,” she said.\nMs Wong from Ohmyhome noted that parents want to buy or rent homes near the schools they hope to get their children into -\xa0Singaporeans living within 1km of a school receive priority admission.\nBut the authorities, she said, were unwilling to release data to the platform on residential proximity to schools via an application programming interface (API), which allows apps to talk to one another.\nNevertheless, Associate Professor Lawrence Loh of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School said having data does not mean it has to be released unconditionally.\nData on residential proximity to schools may “hard-code social stratification, especially since it is a known fact that prestigious schools are often close to expensive neighbourhoods”.\n“We have to be clear what the rationale and impact of the data release are,” said Assoc Prof Loh, who heads the Centre for Governance, Institutions and Organisations at the school.\nAway from the business world, Mr Shannon Ang, a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Michigan, said that when it comes to surveys carried out or funded by the Government, the usual and biggest challenge is that the agencies involved are not forthcoming about why data collected for the surveys has to be restricted and what needs to be done to lift these restrictions.\n“Study teams outside the Government, but are funded by the Government, usually make a vague point about ‘government restrictions or funding’ to deny data requests,” he said.\n“Government agencies themselves either reject requests outright or tend to take a long time to get the process of collaboration started, presumably because sharing data with researchers is not a priority for them.”\nNUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser, who researches social stratification, said he would like access to anonymised income and wealth data from government sources such as the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore and the Central Provident Fund Board, so that he may merge these with data from his own surveys.\nThese data include total monthly and annual individual and household incomes, as well as those comparing income, education and occupations between generations to gauge the extent of social mobility.\nAssoc Prof Tan said population figures are more reliable than data from surveys, which suffer from less-than-ideal response rates. Survey questions on income also rely on self-reporting.\nAccess to more valid and reliable data benefits researchers. They are more likely to get an accurate picture of the extent of upward and downward mobility within and across generations, for example, he said.\n“Where research findings serve as indicators of government performance, or of how specific categories of residents, by class, race, gender, age and resident status, are doing in terms of, say, education and income, they point us to where the significant gaps and problem areas are, and the social categories that require closer attention,” Assoc Prof Tan added.\nMORE SPECIFIC DATA WELCOMED\nWhen it comes to data on the economy and labour market, academics, economists and businesses said the figures provided are up-to-date but may not be sufficiently specific for their needs.\nEconomist Linda Lim, who has studied Singapore’s economy for more than four decades, said that in the last few years, the Government had stopped publishing data it used to put out.\nThese include indigenous gross domestic product (GDP) and per-capita indigenous GDP in the national income accounts, as well as racial and nationality breakdowns of manpower variables in the labour force survey.\nIndigenous GDP measures the income levels of Singapore residents. As a result, Professor Lim, who is with the University of Michigan, said she could not draw the full longitudinal trend of the share of GDP and labour income that went to Singapore citizens and permanent residents.\nWorkers’ Party Member of Parliament (MP) Chen Show Mao had in 2016 asked why the Government stopped publishing the indigenous GDP in the annual Yearbook of Statistics since 2013.\nResponding, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said there was a lack of public interest, with neither online downloads nor public queries about the figures in the years leading up to the decision to stop publication.\nMr Manu Bhaskaran, CEO of Centennial Asia Advisors, which provides economic and political analysis, said that basic information on the budget, including the stock of reserves managed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, is unavailable, so “calculating the true fiscal stance of the budget is impossible”.\n“For a developed economy with substantial capacity for data collection, Singapore does not do an adequate job,” he said.\nThe implications could be far-reaching. Without understanding the goings-on in the city-state with comprehensive data on society and the economy, problems cannot be anticipated and issues fully understood, Mr Bhaskaran said.\n“There are no checks and balances, no capacity to question ill-thought-out policies or to tease out under-the-surface trends that could turn risky for the country,” he added.\nEconomist Song Seng Wun of CIMB Private Banking was concerned about the timeliness of data. He noted that monthly retail sales figures were published with a lag of about two months.\n“If we want to talk about being more productive, and how we can use technology to improve workflows, an example would be more timely data releases … The lag can be improved,” Mr Song said.\nAsked to respond to this suggestion, the Department of Statistics said it is committed to improving timeliness, and providing more details such as data on the proportion of online sales as a part of total retail sales.\nThe department added that it is releasing more statistics, as well as data at more granular levels and at higher frequency on the SingStat website, even as it rolls out safeguards to ensure data confidentiality. These include statistics on household expenditure according to the age groups of heads of households.\nAs the services sector forms nearly two-thirds of the economy, Dr Chua Hak Bin, an economist with Maybank Kim Eng, said there is a need to improve data on the sector.\nFor example, there is a dearth of official data that makes it difficult to get a picture of the growth in the information-and-communications sector, which is the fastest-growing industry here, he noted.\nAs for the labour market, Mr Song noted that the MOM has invested much effort in data provision by releasing preliminary quarterly figures on indicators such as employment growth and unemployment before publishing adjusted figures.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nStill, Dr Chua said the MOM does not provide the foreign component of employment growth every quarter, even though this is important in ascertaining the employment situation for Singaporeans and permanent residents.\nIn response to\xa0queries, a MOM spokesperson said the foreign component of employment growth is excluded from the ministry’s quarterly reports because foreign workers are transient and it is “more meaningful to look at the trends over a longer term”.\nThe spokesperson added that users may write to the ministry’s manpower research and statistics department to request figures “at a more granular level or of a higher frequency than those published”.\n“We will make available the data if it is assessed to be statistically robust and meaningful for the intended use.”\nDATA GAPS FROM THE PAST\nFor academics in particular, looking into what the nation has done in decades past can set Singaporeans on a journey of self-reflection.\nBut government records, such as internal communications and memoranda, can be hard to come by.\nAssoc Prof Chong Ja Ian, deputy head of NUS' department of political science, researches foreign policy and said he would have liked to look into Singapore’s relations with China before formal diplomatic ties were established in 1990.\nFor instance, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew had first visited China in 1976 to meet its then paramount leader Mao Zedong and his successor, Hua Guofeng.\nAssoc Prof Chong would have liked to explore how those types of contact came about, the considerations and limitations, and what informed, complicated or limited efforts to co-operate after that initial meeting.\n“We have no idea. So, in terms of understanding our own country, this becomes a big limitation,” Assoc Prof Chong said.\nHe noted that documents such as minutes of meeting and internal memoranda are readily available in places such as the United States and Taiwan. But in Singapore, the National Archives of Singapore (NAS) does not make public a detailed catalogue of the resources available, he said.\nThere is also no systematic process to declassify documents. Today, researchers may approach the NAS for resources, but requests are forwarded to the relevant government ministry, he said.\nEach agency may have a different approach to national security, privacy and other considerations, he noted.\nThe absence of a systematic declassification process is a “big deterrent to doing more research on Singapore”, said Assoc Prof Chong.\n“I would rather do work that I can get a clearer sense of what I can do, rather than fish around. I don’t have that much time, resources or energy to (do so),” he added.\nThe corollary is that there is less research on Singapore on topics that can inform the people about the goings-on of the past. “It prevents a better self-understanding of our society,” said Assoc Prof Chong.\nAgreeing, Prof Lim from the University of Michigan said academics do not study what they lack data on. So, research in Singapore on those “missing-data issues lags behind that of other advanced countries and we are not represented in published international research”.\nFINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE\nAsked to respond to the concerns of academics and business owners, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office said that the Government shares data with the public, including businesses and researchers, to facilitate research, develop new applications and improve services.\n“This is done in a safe and secure manner, and strong safeguards are applied when sensitive individual-level data is shared,” its spokesperson added.\nHe added that researchers can continue to request data sets via data.gov.sg -\xa0Singapore’s open data portal housing data from 70 public agencies. It launched in 2011.\n“The relevant government agency will assess such requests on a case-by-case basis. When there is strong demand and justification for a data set, the relevant government agency will endeavour to make the data set available on data.gov.sg, which will be updated on a monthly, bimonthly or yearly basis depending on the type of data,” the spokesperson said.\nThe Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) added that data.gov.sg -\xa0which some academics and businesses had criticised for publishing only broad, aggregate data -\xa0was refreshed in 2015 to “actively provide data visualisations and data-driven blog posts, to make government data relevant and understandable to the public”.\nA developer’s portal, the agency added, was also introduced in 2016 to provide developers with easy access to real-time data from various government agencies through APIs.\nAs of June, the one-stop portal gives access to more than 1,600 high-quality data sets and 14 real-time APIs from 70 public agencies, said GovTech.\nMs Tin Pei Ling, deputy chairperson of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Communications and Information, said the Government has made significant and progressive steps to share more data over the years.\nThis, she noted, was “a far cry from a long time ago”.\nThe MacPherson MP said this was also a signal that the country would face more complex problems in future requiring solutions not only from the Government, but from the private sector and Singaporeans at large.\nAsked how the Government can strike a balance between sharing more data and data security, Ms Tin said that some information cannot be released for strategic and security reasons.\nAs for requests for data from researchers and firms, these are handled “case by case” because there must be “a clear understanding of what value-add will come out of the collaboration”, she added.\nDr Kris Hartley, an assistant professor in the department of Asian and policy studies at the Education University of Hong Kong, said this balance “must be mediated through the political process, and thus, differs across political systems”.\nIn a 2015 commentary in The Straits Times, Dr Hartley -\xa0then a doctoral candidate at the NUS’ Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy -\xa0and Professor Asit Biswas, an authority on environmental and water policy, suggested that governments could provide more avenues for information access to maintain legitimacy.\nTransparency not only shifts discussions about policy and governance “away from supposition and innuendo, and towards facts”, but invites creative policy solutions from society and enables a country to be compared on a wider variety of metrics internationally, they wrote in the commentary titled “Singapore can afford to be more open in sharing data”.\nDr Hartley said\xa0that access to data in most Western liberal democracies is largely seen as an entitlement because freedom-of-information policies abound.\n“While Singapore makes some data openly available, it seems uninterested in embracing a wholesale approach to data sharing, particularly on issues related to elections, fiscal spending and other politically sensitive issues that arguably have little to do with national security -\xa0outside military budgets,” he said.\nNEW APPROACHES NEEDED\nUltimately, even as the Government releases whatever data it can, Ms Yeo from Caregiver Asia said the community, academics and think-tanks need to discuss, share and interpret the data to make breakthroughs in service and product delivery.\nThe private sector in Singapore, she said, does not do enough of these.\nIn Singapore, the exchange of data is typically limited to companies in a commercial arrangement.\nFor instance, e-commerce platform ShopBack provides data insights to several of its online merchants, giving them a glimpse into the volumes of transactions and the amounts that customers spend.\nIn contrast, big companies in the US, for example, have teams devoted to churning out white papers as part of initiatives for the good of the community, Ms Yeo noted.\nStill, she said that some non-governmental organisations, such as philanthropic house Lien Foundation, are an alternative source of data, derived from the studies they commission.\nMs Tin suggested that a single government agency or platform take the lead in acting on data requests from firms and the public, rather than have them approach various departments.\n“This one-door approach would be most helpful,” she said.\nAs for researchers, Assistant Professor Woo Jun Jie, a Singaporean political scientist at the Education University of Hong Kong, suggested that the Government consider setting up a more comprehensive database that academics can use.\n“This database could be linked to institutional accounts, such as university libraries,” said Asst Prof Woo, who was formerly from the Nanyang Technological University’s public policy and global affairs programme.\n“Caveats can also be put in place for more sensitive information, such as not allowing direct quotation of such data in publications.”\nMany start-ups and academics interviewed said they hoped the Government would engage them to work out ways to collaborate on data.\nEconomist and Nominated MP Walter Theseira, who in February called on the Government to be more transparent in\xa0sharing official data, said the authorities ought to start a “systematic conversation on how to make data publicly available”.\nFor some start-ups, the challenge in obtaining data is akin to the battle between David and Goliath.\nOhmyhome’s Ms Wong said her company hoped to work with the Government to make housing transactions simple and fast for home owners, although its “conversations with the HDB (Housing and Development Board) have been faced with closed doors”.\n“Given that we are small and they (the HDB) are massive, it is not easy for us to approach them for a meeting or for a very open-minded conversation.\n“An open conversation towards this goal would be appreciated,” she said.\xa0\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Ministry of Manpower ', '     data ', '     technology ', '     Singapore Land Authority ', '     Smart Nation ']}"

      How a Singaporean is changing the fates of rice farmers in Myanmar
  </h1>, 'text': 'LABUTTA, Myanmar: At the age of seven, David Chen had a “life-changing experience” that developed his sense of empathy for the underprivileged. And it started with his father’s 12 German shepherd dogs.\nHis family were living in Vietnam, and his father was working in the agricultural sector to improve farmers’ yields.\n“One day, I overheard a conversation from some of my dad’s co-workers; they were complaining that my dad was spending too much money to feed the dogs, sometimes even more than a common villager could afford,” recounted the 35-year-old.\n“Obviously, some of the co-workers weren’t too happy about this.”\nThat incident set him thinking, about how there were people who “didn’t have the same access to resources (and) opportunities” as his family had.\n“That set things in perspective for me — that not everyone lives the same lifestyle, has the same level of comfort and that everyone has their own struggles,” he added.\nLater on, he decided to continue his father’s work in developing nations. He is now changing the way rice is planted in Myanmar with hybrid seed technology – and improving farmers’ livelihoods – as the programme On The Red Dot discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nA COUNTRY WITH POTENTIAL\nMyanmar was once the world’s top rice exporter, but its numbers plummeted under military rule as strict controls on prices and production effectively shut its farmers out of world markets.\nWhile its rice exports are now on the rise, these are mostly broken rice — fragmented versus whole grains — used for food manufacturing, Chen explained.\nIts population still depends on its most important crop as a staple food. And he feels that Myanmar, with its 7.2 million hectares of rice fields (100 times the size of Singapore) has the potential to produce “a lot more” than its current production level.\nThe graduate in molecular biology had initially wanted to go into the scientific aspect of improving farming yields.\nBut he got to where he is today in helping Myanmar’s rice farmers when he saw that more was needed — when his father returned from Africa to take a break from work, looking “defeated”.\n“(The family) had believed that what he was doing would definitely have an impact. But at that point … that impact wasn’t there yet,” said Chen. “The problem wasn’t with the technology; it was with the implementation, with the business model.”\nSmallholder farmers in developing nations lacked the resources to buy hybrid rice seeds every season. And during a research trip to Myanmar in 2013, he saw for himself how rice production there was heading towards an unsustainable future.\nIts farmers were also not updated on the latest farming practices, which resulted in low yields.\nIt took some time, but finally in 2016, he co-founded Golden Sunland, Singapore’s first rice-growing company, and partnered with Myanmar’s farmers to produce high-quality rice.\nThe company also promotes what it calls “responsible farming” by, for example, paying farmers a price above the market average.\n“Growing rice is the actual work that we do, but growing the lives of the people is equally important because they walk hand in hand with us,” said Chen.\nWATCH: Sowing the seeds of change (Dur 3:53)\nCLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGES\nWhen he first started, however, the farmers had doubts about this young city man trying to introduce them to hybrid rice technology to increase their productivity.\n“Coming from Singapore and you want to tell this agricultural nation how to grow rice — it sounds ridiculous, right?” he said.\nThe only way to gain their trust was to be on the ground, communicating with them. It was frustrating at first, he admitted, as he was “not in a position to tell the farmers that ‘we know better than you’”.\nHis solution was to find a farmer willing to give the programme a shot, and for that individual to be successful to inspire the rest. With that, he managed to build a trusted relationship with them.\nHe supplies the seeds first and recovers the cost only at harvest. And since 2016, his company has created a higher-yielding seed for the farmers.\nBut climate change remains a concern. Rising sea levels are one of the biggest threats to food security. And water can get pushed inland by powerful storms to deadly effect.\nIn 2008, Cyclone Nargis drenched Myanmar’s southern Ayeyarwady region with sea water, rendering more than half of its paddy land infertile — land that was producing about 30 per cent of the country’s rice needs.\nOne of the farmers whose fields were destroyed was Khin Htay Win. But a year after working with Chen’s hybrid seed technology, her crops started to thrive, better than before.\n“We can tell he’s empathetic, especially towards us agricultural people,” she said. “We also respect him. Everything worked out well … Both our yield and income have significantly increased. Crops were planted and exported, and we have surplus income for investments.”\nOne of the contributors to climate change, however, is fertiliser production — a source of carbon emission, noted Chen.\nThe solution here is to educate farmers to use less fertilisers and use them more efficiently to reduce emissions while increasing their rice yield.\nPERSONAL SACRIFICES\nChen moved to Myanmar in 2017, the same year he got married. His wife had planned to move with him, until she learnt that she was expecting their daughter.\nSo shuttling between Singapore and far into Myanmar’s rice bowl has been tiring for him.\n“Every month, I spend about 50 hours travelling. I go back home, I whine to my wife, and I complain about my backache. But weirdly, I keep doing it,” he said.\nHe told himself to be around for his child’s milestones, but that was easier said than done.\n“At the end of last year, she was just learning to stand up. And I missed that. So for two whole weeks when I was in Myanmar, I was in a grumpy mood,” he shared.\nDespite the sacrifices, he tries to focus on the bigger picture.\n“Ultimately, what I’m thinking about is who’s going to produce the food for my kid when she’s a lot older. And will my kid have that sense of appreciation for the producers of her food?” he cited.\nToday, 39 farmers spread across 200 acres of land are using his hybrid seeds. He estimates that their revenue has increased by 30 per cent — “at least a 30 per cent betterment of their livelihood”.\n“Maybe it seems as if we’re helping them. But honestly, I think they’re helping us as well,” he said. “By helping them to improve their livelihood, they give us quality products in return. So this is a win-win.”\nWatch this episode here.

""But of course, those are the skills that many companies are looking for.""\nNevertheless, Mr Rowan said he is confident of getting the right people with the right skills ""if we put (in) enough effort"", stating that competing\xa0for labour in Singapore is not tougher than, say, in the United Kingdom.\n""We can actually get the skills we need partly because the education levels in Singapore are so high,"" he said. ""We can get very high quality graduates that we can then probably train up.\n""So they come to Dyson with all the ingredients that we need: Cognitive intelligence, a degree in engineering disciplines that we need.""\nMr Rowan said Dyson could\xa0also tap on the fact that Singapore is a hub for the disk drive and semiconductor industries.\n""That’s driven a capability of precision engineering and mechatronics,"" he explained.

Already, we are seeing fewer Potterheads pouncing on the game - Wizards Unite was downloaded by under 3 million devices during the four-day launch period, but Pokemon Go was downloaded 24 million times.\xa0\nNumbers aside, here is how the two games compare against each other, based on game plot, game play and graphics.\xa0\nWHAT\'S THE STORY?\nIt\'s\xa0important to note early on that while there are similarities, these are two different games. In Pokemon Go, the player is a kind of bounty hunter, while Wizards Unite can be described as a sticker collecting adventure.\xa0\nThe story line in Wizards Unite is more complicated than Pokemon Go, which is expected because the Harry Potter franchise includes more than 15 books and films.\xa0\nIn the game, grown-up Harry Potter and Hermione Granger are working at the Ministry of Magic with Newt Scamander, a character from the Harry Potter film spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find them.\xa0\nA spell has been cast, causing what is referred to as the Calamity and putting the wizarding world at risk of being discovered by Muggles (non-magical humans).\xa0\nYour job, as a witch or wizard, is to rescue displaced people, objects and memories from sticky situations\xa0and return them to their rightful place. These are called Foundables and include characters like Harry\'s friends Ron Weasley and Luna Lovegood, as well as iconic items and creatures like the Golden Snitch\xa0and Hagrid\'s spider buddy Aragog.\xa0\nEach time you successfully rescue a Foundable, a ""sticker"" is entered into your Registry.\xa0\nThere is not much of a story in Pokemon Go, or at least not much that\'s\xa0crucial to the game anyway. The game is based on the popular television series and deck-building card game, and features many types of Pokemon that you merely have to ""catch"" in your PokeBall so you can add them to your Pokemon index, or Pokedex. As the catchphrases go, to\xa0be the ""very best"" trainer, you only have to ""catch \'em all"".\xa0\n\n\nThe more Pokemon you catch, the higher your chances of winning battles with other trainers\' Pokemon and the higher your chances of levelling up.\xa0\nIn a nutshell, if you\'re not a fan of the Harry Potter series, much of the game will probably mystify you. Pokemon Go is easier to digest, even if you know nothing beyond the adorable Pikachu.\xa0\nGAMEPLAY: SO MUCH GOING ON\nBoth games make use of your smartphone’s GPS in their gameplay.\nIn Pokemon Go, this happens: You see a pocket monster on the map. You tap it. Then you throw Pokeballs at it until it gets ""captured"". When you encounter a Pokestop, you ""spin"" it on your screen so it will throw up more Pokeballs for you to use. You have to wait five minutes between spins. Gyms in Pokemon Go are for battling your Pokemon with that of other real-life players.\xa0\nWizards Unite works in a similar way, but it is also so much more. The game has so many layers that your first few tries might feel like you have had a Confundus Charm put on you.\xa0\nThe game\'s main characters do pop up often\xa0to tell you what to expect next, but if you are anything like us, you\'re likely to tap the pop-ups away without reading.\xa0\nFirst, you set up your profile. In Pokemon Go, you can choose your basic uniform and username, and that\'s pretty much it. But in Wizards Unite, you can pick your profession and\xa0your House (those quizzes you did sorting you into Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw will come in useful here), customise your wand and put up a profile photo that is basically a selfie with Harry Potter-themed filters.\xa0\nWhen the game begins, illuminated icons will start appearing on your screen much like how the monsters do in Pokemon Go, representing Foundables waiting to be rescued. You then tap the icons, trace the shapes on your screen that imitate the wand movement of certain spells and watch if your spell is successful. Go back to your map and potion ingredients might pop up - tap these to add to your bag; they can be used to brew potions that will help in your duels.\nDuelling opportunities may come in the form of similar flashing icons on the map, but you can also engage in duels when you tap on Fortresses. A player may get the chance to duel with enemies ranging from monsters to Death Eaters, the Harry Potter gang\'s greatest rivals save for Voldemort.\xa0\nDuelling and rescuing can use up all your spell energy. This is like the Pokeballs in the other Niantic game. In Wizards Unite, you can replenish your spell energy when you tap on and ""dine at"" Inns. Like Pokestops, you have to wait a few minutes before there is enough food for another top-up.\nAs Niantic uses the same map for both games, Inns are located where Pokestops are if you are playing Pokemon Go.\xa0\nGRAPHICS: SO MUCH MORE ALIVE\nWhen Wizards Unite first launched, we were most excited about its graphic potential, again because the Harry Potter series is renowned for its rich imagery. Wizards Unite does not disappoint. It just feels so much more alive.\xa0\nJust staring at the map can be a mesmerising experience. The map in Pokemon Go is largely static - the only thing that is really moving is your avatar. In Wizards Unite, there are owls and paper planes (which is how memos are sent from each department to another in the Ministry of Magic) flying about.\xa0\nThe Foundables are also more interactive than the Pokemon you try to catch. For example, Peeves - the resident Hogwarts poltergeist - comes flying at you when you rescue him from a bell jar, before he is swiftly whisked away back to the school. The zombie-like Hag\xa0also tries to make a move at you, before she\xa0too is transported.\xa0\nWe don\'t remember being this engaged (or this frightened) when playing\xa0Pokemon Go.\xa0\nUSE OF AR: OUT OF THIS WORLD\nWizards Unite and Pokemon Go roughly use AR the same way. During spell-casting and Pokemon-catching, you can turn on the AR function so that it feels like you and your target are in the same place in real life.\xa0\xa0\nNiantic\'s latest, however, takes AR one step further with its Portkeys.\xa0\nIn the wizarding world, a Portkey is an enchanted item that when touched will teleport you to another location. Portkey Portmanteaus are yet another item that pop up on the map. You tap on them to store them and walk specific distances to have them unlocked.\xa0\nOnce unlocked, a Portmanteau turns up a Portkey, commonly an old shoe. When your Portkey is ripe for teleportation, it will appear on the ground in front of you and when tapped, will open you up to a ""different world"", say a magical hut. The experience is -\xa0for the lack of a better word -\xa0unreal.\xa0\nPAIN POINTS\nThe biggest turn-off in Wizards Unite is the way it almost baits you into spending money.\nThe spell energy runs out surprisingly fast and it\'s not always easy to replenish, considering the Pokestops in Pokemon Go have been split into Inns and Greenhouses, where spell energy isn\'t always available.\xa0\nIn Pokemon Go, Poke Balls are not needed when you\'re battling in Gyms, but get used up when you fight in the Fortresses of Wizards Unite. When this happens, you are prompted - in the middle of a duel - to buy more spell energy. If you don\'t, you may get kicked out of the Fortress and lose\xa0your rewards.\xa0\nBut this could be one of the ways that Wizards Unite continues to remain a challenge. In contrast, Pokemon Go is incredibly easy and straightforward - the only real challenge as\xa0time goes on is to go after the new Pokemon as and when Niantic produces them, and to catch country exclusives as you travel.\xa0\nAdmittedly, we still play Pokemon Go, but at this point, it is mostly to pass time.\xa0\nAll these factors considered, can Wizards Unite become as popular as Pokemon Go?\xa0\xa0\nOur guess is no.\xa0\nPokemon Go has attracted people of all ages, including seniors and those who don\'t identify as gamers. These people are unlikely to make the switch to Wizards Unite, simply because it is designed for Potterheads.\n\n\nWith that said, if you\'re planning to play, as the Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore would say: ""Let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      More than 500 food stalls at hawker centres, coffee shops have adopted e-payments
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: More than 500 food stalls at 44 hawker centres, coffee shops and industrial canteens have adopted a unified e-payments system, said Enterprise Singapore in a statement on Saturday (Jun 29).\nThe 10 hawker centres include Maxwell Food Centre, Chomp Chomp Food Centre and Zion Riverside Food Centre. The 22 coffee shops and 12 canteens are located across the island from Bukit Batok to Tampines. The full list can be found at http://www.epaysg.com.\nThe move, in line with the Government\'s Smart Nation push, allows both merchants and customers in the food establishments to make cashless transactions.\nThe stalls are currently able to accept a total of 23 payment schemes under one point-of-sales terminal.\nIn September 2018, Enterprise Singapore, together with the Housing and Development Board, National Environment Agency and JTC Corporation, appointed payment provider NETS to get small food outlets to adopt the unified payment solution.\nA pilot deployment of the e-payment initiative was carried out from December last year to end-May 2019. They found that the total value of e-transactions per stall grew at an average of 40 per cent per month, with the number of transactions increasing by nearly 30 per cent per month. On average, the value of each e-transaction was around S$6.\nMr Ted Tan, deputy CEO of Enterprise Singapore said that the response in the last six months has been encouraging and the scheme will be expanded to include more payment options such as Diners Club, Razer Pay and VIA by October.\n“Adoption of e-payment is a first step towards the digital transformation of small food businesses in our heartlands and industrial estates,"" said Mr Tan.\nTo further encourage the use of e-payments, incentives such as redeemable credits and cashback to consumers may be introduced, it said.\nMerchants participating in the initiative receive one-to-one training and support to learn how to operate the point-of-sales terminal, the agency added.\n""The unified e-payment model is interoperable, making available multiple payment options at one time, addressing the issue of limited food stall frontage space and facilitating the consolidation of transaction receipts,"" said Enterprise Singapore.\n""Through aggregation, businesses benefit from a lower merchant discount rate that is feasible for their cost structure and operations. The hassle of maintaining a daily cash float is also minimised.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      How China the copycat became a tech giant to rival the US
  </h1>, 'text': 'SHENZHEN and BEIJING: When Matthew Scott was transferred to China to work as an engineer at Microsoft in 2006, he never thought there would be an opportunity to build his own start-up there.\nBut, eschewing traditional innovation hub Silicon Valley, the American stayed on in China and is today the co-founder of an artificial intelligence start-up.\n“China’s a great place to do AI,” said the 37-year-old chief technology officer of Malong Technologies in Shenzhen, the southern Chinese city aiming to outdo Silicon Valley.\n“(Shenzhen) is one of the best places to do hardware. And I have the network, and it felt like the right thing to do.”\nOnce known as a cheap place to make copycat gadgets, the city has transformed into a tech hub that can do what Silicon Valley cannot: Combine innovation and entrepreneurship with manufacturing.\nTech workers like Scott say this is not the only way in which China is setting an example for the world.\n“Everyone doing AI would’ve used Chinese technology. Without Chinese AI, we wouldn’t be this far advanced,” he told the programme Insight. “China isn’t just sucking in innovation from the rest of the world; true innovation is being published in China.” (Watch the episode here.)\nThe rise of China’s high-tech prowess is one of the reasons it is locked in a trade war with the United States, and the technology sector, one of the main sticking points.\nBut how did this country get ahead in the technology race?\nMADE IN CHINA 2025\nOnce regarded as backward and undeveloped, China has overseen an economic and technological rise that the White House now sees as an existential challenge.\nBut for a long time, the country was perceived as a copycat, pointed out Edward Tse, the founder and chief executive of global strategy and management consultancy Gao Feng Advisory Company.\n“China began to learn — to develop — when it recognised that the outside world was so different,” he said. “So the first step was to see what was available outside of China and copy.”\nThe country discovered there was “plenty of room for innovation” along the way. “It took them about a decade or so to transition from a copycat nation to now, I think for most people, a pretty innovative nation,” he added.\nIn 2015, Beijing announced the Made in China 2025 strategy to turn China from being the world’s main factory for manufactured goods into a high-tech powerhouse.\nPart of the strategy was to work with private investors to buy overseas tech firms, and many of these happened to be in the US.\nChinese investments in US tech start-ups rose from US$2.3 billion (S$3.11 billion) in 2014 to almost US$10 billion in 2015 — more than a fourfold increase. This soon led to accusations that China was stealing technology and jeopardising US national security.\nBut Made in China 2025 is not just about strategic investments abroad; the plan also aims to move the country up the value chain in manufacturing, to make things at home and make them better than everyone else does.\nELECTRIC VEHICLE HUB\nIn one of the Made in China 2025 target industries, the country has raced far ahead of everyone else.\nShenzhen, once a sleepy fishing village and now the poster child for China’s opening up, recently became the first city in the world to have a 100 per cent electric bus fleet, despite coming late in the day.\n“We can’t catch up with others in the traditional-energy vehicle sector,” said China Automobile Dealers Association executive director Jia Xinguang.\nBut in the new-energy vehicle sector, there’s a more level playing field, so we have a better chance of beating the competition.\nMore than 16,000 electric buses ply the city’s roads, and almost all the 20,000-plus taxis are electric too.\nWhile electric buses cost about twice as much up front as normal ones, the local and central governments have provided more than eight billion yuan (S$1.58 billion) a year in subsidies.\nAcross the country, there are an estimated 421,000 electric buses, or 18 per cent of its bus fleet, compared with 300 electric buses in the US.\n“The US, Japan and Germany were the pioneers in electric vehicles. China started only in 2016 but has now become the biggest manufacturer, with over 1.2 million sold last year,” said Jia.\n“We should be able to produce every part of the electric vehicle locally … China has the biggest capacity for battery manufacturing, and we’re the biggest providers.”\nIt is little surprise that China is still the world’s largest market for electric vehicles. Shanghai, Beijing and Hangzhou are among more than 30 Chinese cities aiming for 100 per cent electric bus fleets by next year.\nFOUR SILICON VALLEYS\nChina also wants to be a world leader in AI, with the government pouring billions of dollars into AI research and applications.\nIn November, Chinese search engine giant Baidu opened a park in Beijing billed as the world’s first AI-based smart park. It comes with plenty of value-added data.\nFor example, face-recognition detectors on the pathways record and analyse data, so people can find out how far they have run, their average speed and how many calories they have burnt.\nThere are augmented reality lessons in tai chi — the system captures one’s movements and compares them with tai chi masters.\nThe park also has Xiaodu voice-recognition technology — a technology that has changed the lives of the visually impaired, like masseur Jiang Fan. Previously he found it hard to switch on his lights, the air conditioning and to draw the curtains.\n“With the voice-recognition technology, it’s easy. We just tell Xiaodu what to do,” he said. “Xiaodu can also adjust the room temperature and put on music.”\nThese are just some of the applications China is developing in its tech hubs. Today, the country has not just one Silicon Valley, but at least four.\nWATCH: Are China’s 4 Silicon Valleys overtaking the US? (7:51)\nOne of them, in Beijing’s Haidian district, is Zhongguancun. It is 488 square kilometres, or almost two-thirds the size of Singapore, and home to about 9,000 high-tech firms as well as more than 200 scientific institutions.\nIt is also the headquarters for some of China’s biggest tech firms as well as the regional offices for US tech giants like Google, IBM and Microsoft. Zhongguancun aims to be China’s national innovation centre, with global influence.\nAs many as 80 start-ups are born here each day, such as Zhen Robotics, which manufactures a small robot — nicknamed Little Yellow Horse — that makes deliveries to homes.\nThis robot is being developed with the backing of universities in Switzerland, Britain and China as well as Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. But its supply chain, from people to parts, is rooted in China.\nCompany founder Liu Zhiyong, who went overseas to study, is one of a growing number of Chinese tech workers who have returned home.\nExplaining why, he said: “I had job offers from Silicon Valley and other well-known international companies, but … I felt I’d be more at home in the Chinese environment. Also, there’d be more manpower (and) financial and policy support.”\nGOOD SUPPORT, BUT DIVERSITY LACKING\nCreating an environment for innovation to flourish is not only about getting the right people, but also about making the right connections.\nAnd some of that happens in Zhongguancun’s Garage Cafe, which was inspired by Silicon Valley’s tech ecosystem. Co-founder Wu Jianbo pointed out that “many great American start-ups were born in their founders’ home garages because the set-up cost was low”.\nSo we think the garage is a symbol of the entrepreneurship spirit. It’s a small space, where you can accomplish big dreams.\nMore than just a coffee establishment, his cafe connects angel investors and venture capitalists to Chinese entrepreneurs working on start-ups and looking for a meeting place.\nWu thinks the scale of China’s start-up environment is “unmatched”, with many opportunities for entrepreneurs and “very good government support”.\n“I always tell aspiring entrepreneurs that this is a great time to be around because of the favourable environment,” he added.\n""That’s why I feel that China’s entrepreneurs have great potential. And they’re being equipped with more and more entrepreneurial spirit and awareness.""\nBut while China’s tech ecosystem is full of talented and motivated people, it still lags behind the US in diversity, where an estimated 70 per cent of Silicon Valley tech workers are foreign-born.\nIn Zhongguancun, only 1 to 2 per cent are from overseas, of which seven in 10 are Chinese returnees. The imbalance shows that China’s opening up is still a work in progress.\nCentre for China and Globalisation president Wang Huiyao said China’s foreign population is proportionately among the lowest in the world, so “China, in that sense, has a lot of room to grow, to work on foreign talent”.\nIndeed, Beijing unveiled new initiatives last year to attract foreign tech talent, such as making it easier for them to get visas and even offering permanent residence to top hires.\nOVERBLOWN WAR?\nOn the global front, experts pointed out that despite the China-US trade war, Washington and Silicon Valley are two very different places.\n“(Firms in Silicon Valley) have those concerns about intellectual property protection and technology transfer,” said Alex Capri, a visiting senior fellow at the\xa0National University of Singapore Business School.\nBut they also see China as, rightly so, the largest market in the world and as the place where exciting things are happening, particularly around data.\nHe added that the geopolitical rivalry also “doesn’t mean the whole world needs to fall in line with this sort of binary either-or decision”.\nAnd the way politicians look at technology competition is different from the way technologists look at it, said resident senior fellow Sourabh Gupta from the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies.\nFor example, there are technologies invented and inspired by the Americans and the Koreans, and embedded in Chinese hardware. “We have AI researchers who span the globe and across universities on different continents,” he added.\n“This technology ecosystem is one that can’t be splintered and separated. People have been talking of an Iron Curtain descending — of a new Cold War. My view is that is just a little overblown.”\nWatch the episode here.

      New framework aims to better enable data sharing, increase trust in Singapore's digital economy
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A new framework to facilitate the ease of sharing data between organisations was introduced on Friday (Jun 28), as a means to increase trust in Singapore’s digital economy.\xa0\nSenior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Transport Janil Puthucheary introduced the Trusted Data Sharing Framework during his speech at the ongoing Innovfest Unbound tech event here on Friday.\nThe Info-communications Media Development (IMDA) said in its press release that it worked with the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) to speak with industry players before developing the new framework to create a common “data-sharing language”.\xa0\nSome of the challenges businesses face in this area today include a lack of guidance and systemic approaches to sharing\xa0data, establishing trust with partners when sharing data assets and concerns that data sharing could lead to exposing trade secrets or loss of competitiveness, it said.\xa0\n“While it is widely accepted that intangible assets such as data are valuable, organisations face specific challenges such as ensuring compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) or in accurately measuring the value of data assets,” IMDA said.\nThis, in turn, can impact their ability to maximise the use of data to develop and bring innovative products and services to market, the agency said.\xa0\nAn example could be a retailer and an e-payments service provider that wants to work together to create more customised shopping experiences and deals, but are unsure how much of their customer data to share with each other to achieve the outcome.\xa0\nThe new framework is thus intended to solve these, by incorporating content from existing PDPC guides on personal data anonymisation and sharing.\xa0\nIt also includes new materials like a guide to evaluating data assets for sharing and sample legal templates to enable the sharing process, it said.\xa0\nFurthermore, the Trusted Data Sharing Framework can also help improve industry norms by enabling better, trusted data flows for the digital economy - both in Singapore and globally.\xa0\nFor artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, the trusted data would mean more accountability and transparency from the beginning, it said.\xa0\nThis is the latest in a series of initiatives by Singapore to boost the development of AI here.\xa0\nMinister for Communications and Information S Iswaran had earlier this year introduced the Model AI Governance Framework to guide private sector players on how to use AI solutions ethically.\xa0\nThis initiative won a top award at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Forum this April.\xa0\nThe government had also said it will double down on its efforts to build the AI sector here. Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation Initiative said in Parliament an inter-agency taskforce will be formed this year to study how Singapore will develop AI as a strategic capability and become a trusted global hub for test-bedding, deploying and scaling AI solutions.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Singapore to spend S$40 million to build 5G ecosystem
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore has earmarked S$40 million to build an open, inclusive 5G ecosystem, and is looking to clusters like maritime operations and urban mobility for their export potential.\nThe funds will be used to support 5G tech trials for enterprise use, create new open testbeds and for R&D in areas like cybersecurity for the next-generation mobile network, said Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran at the opening of the Innovfest Unbound tech show at Marina Bay Sands on Thursday (Jun 27).\nFor a start, the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) will explore clusters such as maritime operations, urban mobility, smart estates, consumer and government applications and Industry 4.0.\n“These clusters have been identified based on their potential for export globally, reinforcing Singapore’s goal to be a global front-runner in impactful 5G use cases,” the agency said in a press release.\xa0\nIt also highlighted two industry partnerships to prepare for the eventual rollout of 5G, which is slated for 2020.\xa0\nA call by IMDA and PSA to explore the use of 5G tech for the maritime sector was awarded to Singtel and M1, with the aim of looking at how 5G could help PSA to boost productivity.\xa0\n“We see much potential in 5G augmenting our port operations – supporting remote tele-operation of equipment, complementing crane automation and enhancing Automated Guided Vehicle operations – through IoT (Internet of Things) adoption within the port,” said PSA’s regional CEO for Southeast Asia Ong Kim Pong.\nTrials will be conducted at the PSA Living Lab in Pasir Panjang Terminal from the third quarter of this year, and will last for 18 months.\nThe other partnership is in the Industry 4.0 arena. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), JTC and Singtel have signed a memorandum of understanding to deploy 5G at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre in Jurong Innovation District. It will look to integrate 5G with other cutting-edge tech like IoT and artificial intelligence to help businesses develop new manufacturing solutions, IMDA said.\xa0\nOne example is to improve the accuracy in tracking the location of automated guided vehicles on the factory floor, thus improving safety and productivity, it added.\nSingapore-based companies can apply to tap on the 5G funding, with applications open from now until May 2020.\xa0\nThe other local telco, StarHub, told CNA that\xa0it is interested in and will apply to tap on the grant.\xa0\n""This is as we are in discussions with a number of enterprise and government clients to conduct 5G trials and explore new business models,"" a spokesperson said.\nOf these developments, Mr Iswaran in his speech said: ""These are exciting developments. But this is only the beginning as we forge ahead in the digital economy by leveraging the potential of 5G – a key digital infrastructure of tomorrow.""\nThere will also be an open testbed site set up at PIXEL in one-north, so that more can experiment with the new mobile network.\xa0\nIMDA said this will be the first open testbed and is aimed at tech and media start-ups in one-north. It is expected to be ready in the first half of 2020 and will primarily facilitate use cases in immersive and casual or serious games, before progressively extending its support to others like content streaming, IoT and drones.\nAs for R&D, the agency said it will work with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and National Research Foundation to support efforts in the cybersecurity space. More research funding to support other areas like communications networks will be announced at a later date, it added.\nBUILDING SMART ESTATES\nOn Wednesday, IMDA also shed more light on its Call for Innovative Solutions (CFIS) with Ascendas-Singbridge and JTC. Eight projects were picked by the three parties, and a grant of S$1.5 million will be used to support these.\xa0\nOne such example is a 3D Digital Twin project by local start-up Graffiquo, which will allow for the development of capabilities like 3D model of an indoor environment as well as new security measures for data integrity, IMDA said.\nThe agency also said it is working with the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Frasers Property Singapore for a new smart estates\xa0CFIS.\nBesides looking at solutions for smart environment and estate management, the new call will focus on the community and people aspects in terms of living and working in the targeted estates like\xa0Alexandra Technopark and Punggol\'s Oasis Terraces.\n“In high-density cities like Singapore, innovation and technology are game-changers that can help provide a more livable environment for citizens,"" said HDB\'s group director for Building and Research Institute Johnny Wong, adding that more than 80 per cent of the population here live in HDB flats.\n""Through the CFIS, we hope to open doors to more innovative ideas and solutions that could further enhance the HDB living experience.""\nIMDA also said on Thursday it is looking to review the Electronic Transactions Act, which would include enabling more transactions under the Act such as property transactions, wills and Lasting Powers of Attorney.\xa0\nIt will also look to provide certainty on the use of new technologies like biometrics and smart contracts, it said.\xa0\xa0\nThe public consultation on the review was launched on Thursday and will run until Aug 27 this year, the agency added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      New office for digital industry aims to help create 10,000 tech jobs in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A new digital-focused office was launched by the Singapore Government on Wednesday (Jun 26), as it looks to work better with the private sector to unlock the opportunities\xa0in a “digital-as-usual age”, including the creation of an estimated 10,000 new jobs within the tech sector.\xa0\nThis was revealed by Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran in his opening speech at the Smart Nation Summit, the flagship event of this year’s Smart Nation Innovations Week.\xa0\nMr Iswaran said the digital economy is intertwined with the conventional one we know today, and technology is integral to the fabric of businesses here, as well as people’s jobs and everyday lives.\xa0\n“In Singapore, our vision is for a digital economy where every business is digitally empowered, every worker is digitally skilled, and every citizen is digitally connected,” he said.\nTo address this opportunity, the Government and the private sector must work together as “trusted partners and co-creators of solutions”, which is why it is setting up the new Digital Industry Singapore (DISG) office, the minister said.\xa0\nThe new office brings together 45 existing officers from the Economic Development Board, Enterprise Singapore and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA), according to a separate press release from DISG on Wednesday.\nThe new office is positioned as the first stop for digital industry-related matters, and will work with companies across the spectrum of enterprise needs like securing talent and market access, building capabilities and\xa0going international, Mr Iswaran said.\xa0\nHe pointed to how DISG supported the establishment of Grab’s new headquarters in Singapore, which will house up to 3,000 employees and its largest research and development (R&D) centre.\xa0\nThe new office also facilitated the collaboration between Grab, media company Vice and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) to discover and nurture local digital content creators. This allows content creators to reach a regional audience via Grab’s and Vice’s platforms, as well as a chance to enhance their skills with an immersion programme with the latter, he said.\xa0\nMr Iswaran added: “There are several other projects of similar ilk in the DISG pipeline, which will also bring broader benefits for Singapore’s digital ecosystem, including the creation of an estimated 10,000 new jobs over the next three years.”\nDISG said that beyond tech roles, jobs in areas like finance, human resources, innovation and business development will be created.\nREDUCING CROSS-BORDER DIGITAL BARRIERS\nThe minister in his speech also highlighted that companies have shared the current rules and policies do not adequately address new issues raised by the digital economy. Existing trade agreements are designed for trade in goods and services, but less suited for digital transactions, he said.\xa0\nAs such, Singapore mooted the idea of a Digital Economy Agreement, which Mr Iswaran said is a new form of agreement which anchors cooperation among like-minded countries on the digital economy.\xa0\n“Digital Economy Agreements will put in place clear and harmonised rules for greater interoperability between digital frameworks, and to guard against digital and data barriers,” he elaborated.\xa0\n“(These agreements) will also establish international rules and benchmarks, to address newer areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and digital identities.”\nFor instance, Singapore, Chile and New Zealand have initiated trilateral talks on a Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), while there are also talks with Australia to deepen cooperation for the digital economy, Mr Iswaran said.\n“We look forward to building more of such partnerships, to pave the way for this new model of economic engagement and trade,” he added.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     S Iswaran ', '     technology ']}"

      Eagles, lasers and nets: Options for dealing with rogue drone flights
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: For the second time in less than a week, operations at Changi Airport have been disrupted because of unauthorised drone activity in the area.\xa0\nThe Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)\xa0said that approximately 15 departures and three arrivals were delayed on Monday (Jun 24), while seven flights were diverted. Bad weather was also a factor in the disruptions.\nMonday's incident comes just days after\xa038 flights were affected when Changi Airport was forced to intermittently close one runway because of drone sightings in the vicinity.\xa0\nInvestigations into both incidents are continuing.\nWith\xa0potentially dangerous and illegal drone flights taking place in many countries, governments have been exploring\xa0a range of options to ensure that such incidents - whether malicious or accidental - can be dealt with quickly and efficiently.\n1. THE DRONE DOME\nAt the end of last year, operations at London's Gatwick Airport came to a standstill when multiple reports of drone sightings grounded all flights. Hundreds of thousands of people had their travel plans disrupted as the authorities scrambled to find a way to stop the drone incursions. Commercially available equipment did not help.\nIn the end, the military was called in, with the British Army reported to have deployed\xa0the Israeli-developed Drone Dome. The system uses radar and laser technology to locate drones, and then jams the radio signal between the user and the device, rendering it useless.\nInvestigations have yet to find out who was responsible for the drone flights.\n2. LASER SHOT\nThe US military is reported to be testing a prototype laser weapon to counter the threat from enemy drones.\xa0\nThe\xa0Compact Laser Weapons System - or CLaWS - is the first ground-based laser approved for use by US ground troops, Defense News reported on Friday.\nA number of countries and manufacturers are developing or deploying systems that use lasers to disable drones. For instance, the Silent Hunter is an anti-drone laser weapon developed in China by Poly Technologies that was deployed in 2016 at the G20 Summit in Hangzhou.\xa0\n3. EAGLE HUNTER\nIn a radical approach, police in the Netherlands experimented with eagles as a way of bringing down drones being flown illegally.\xa0\nAfter a series of tests in 2015, the Dutch police said they\xa0were putting into operation a flock of the birds of prey to take down drones believed to be posing a danger to the public, such as near airports.\xa0The birds had been purchased as chicks and trained by a specialist company Guard From Above.\nThe experiment was short-lived as the eagles did not always do\xa0what they had been trained to do, and the initiative was grounded in 2017.\n4. USE A DRONE TO CATCH A DRONE\nDroneCatcher is a drone armed with a net gun developed by Delft Dynamics. Once the rogue drone has been detected, DroneCatcher is able to quickly approach hovering or moving threats.\xa0\nThe company claims that with the use of multiple onboard sensors, the net gun can be locked on the target and then launched. After the catch, DroneCatcher can carry the captured drone on a cable to a harmless place and release it there. If the caught drone is too heavy to be carried, it can be dropped with a parachute to ensure low impact on the ground.\nThe SkyWall 100 also uses a net to catch errant drones - in this case, from a shoulder-mounted cannon.\n5. GUNNED DOWN\nDroneShield uses a gun to bring down a rogue drone in the final stage of its protection system.\xa0\nIn the initial phase, it uses\xa0multi-sensor\xa0technologies that work together to detect\xa0drones, with radar sensors tracking a\xa0moving object, separating it from the background clutter such as trees or birds. Further identification comes with cameras and thermal sensors, allowing for a visual confirmation to the user.\nOnce detected, a\xa0gun is used to send\xa0radio-jamming signals and frequencies to disrupt the errant drone's flight.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Changi Airport ', '     technology ']}"

      The ‘always on’ lives behind those popular Instagram posts and viral videos
  </h1>, 'text': ""Work for fashion influencer Andrea Chong, 27, takes her around the world from New York City to Seoul and even Marrakech. Ms Chong’s jet-setting life — mostly sponsored by brands and companies — is documented in a catalogue of highly-styled photos and videos on her Instagram.\nIn these visuals, Chong never fails to dress up in the latest fashion trend, set against the backdrop of postcard-perfect scenery designed for holiday envy and targeted at her more than 300,000 followers. But all that glam takes work — a lot of it.\nRest and relax are hardly on the itinerary when she arrives at any exotic foreign destination. “On photoshoot days, I get up as early as 5am to do my own makeup and hair, so we can catch the golden hour just after sunrise for the best lighting,” she said.\nThe content Chong produces has also evolved since she first started blogging in 2013. These days, she uploads styling videos in partnership with brands, and Instagram Stories of the hip fashion events she gets invited to in Singapore.\nThe same action-packed, ‘always on’\xa0lifestyle applies to sibling duo of YouTube channel UrbanXtremeMonkeys (UXM), who is currently producing a series of travel videos for AirAsia. The budget airline’s latest campaign, Holiday Quickies, stars YES 933 radio presenters and has taken the crew to cities across the region, including Yogyakarta, Phuket and Ipoh.\nHafiz Bin Mohamad Aziz, 27, and Shafie Bin Mohamad Aziz, 26, launched UXM about 10 years ago to showcase their parkour tricks and brand of humour. “The channel was just something we did for fun, but one day, our video got some over 4,000 views almost instantly,” Shafie said. The rest, as they say, is history.\nChallenge, in their case, comes in the form of unexpected hiccups like a malfunctioning equipment or worst, lack of connection when they are producing videos overseas. When Hafiz and Shafie were in Chiang Rai earlier this year, for example, a portable wifi device they had brought along ran out of battery power.\n“We ran around the town searching and begging for wifi connection so we can send across a video to our client,” said\xa0Shafie. And when they eventually found a café with wifi and paid for it, the connection turned out to be “choppy and utterly useless”.\n“We really learnt our lesson and now carry two fully-charged portable wifi devices on us when we travel for work,” said\xa0Hafiz, who counts the moment as his most stressful work experience thus far.\nChong too found herself in\xa0a similar situation — a case of shoddy connection — on a recent trip to South Korea.\xa0\n“Because we are so well-connected back home in Singapore, sometimes we don’t think too hard about such things when we are overseas,” said\xa0Chong. “But now I know better; always get my SIM card from a reliable telco, not just from any random convenience store!”\nFor Chong, Hafiz, Shafie and everyone in the business of content creation\xa0for that matter, wide mobile coverage and quick upload speed are a must-have.\xa0\nBecause we are so well-connected back home in Singapore, sometimes we don’t think too hard about such things when we are overseas.\nAnd when it comes to stable and fast mobile coverage, Singtel has bragging rights, and rightly so. Its mobile network is, after all, the most awarded. This year, Singtel has come\xa0out on top in speed tests conducted by IMDA, Ookla, which provides analysis of internet access performance metrics such as latency, and Opensignal — an independent global standard which analyses consumer mobile experience.\nThe telco also provides the widest coverage reaching 99.9 per cent of Singapore, and has consistently maintained this since the last quarter of 2014, according to the IMDA's 4G Outdoor Mobile Service Coverage Measurement Results.\nSingtel’s mobile network can also deliver upload speed of up to 90Mbps. This is more than what is required by most social networking apps, says Director of Singtel’s Radio Network Performance Kuan Wai Mun. To put it in perspective, Facebook Live requires an upload speed of 7.5MB per minute (based on 720p 30fps) and Instagram Stories require 8MB (per a 15-second story).\n“If the network upload speed is lower than the minimum speed required by the apps, the broadcast video quality will be pixelated and distorted,” explained\xa0Kuan. Luckily, users on Singtel’s mobile network enjoy consistent and stable upload speed, which in turn\xa0ensures high quality video broadcast.\n\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Instagram ', '     technology ', '     Singtel ']}"

      Netflix and chill, literally: Confessions of a TV and movies on-demand addict
  </h1>, 'text': ""Theatre actor Munah Bagharib’s rehearsal-packed days mean she only gets to unwind to her favourite TV shows in the dead of the night. “And luckily, these days I can,” said\xa0the 31-year-old, who admits to having “horrible sleeping habits” as a result of her long work hours.\n“More frequently than not, you will find me watching something on my laptop at 3am, while chowing down a box of 20-piece nuggets,” she said\xa0unabashedly. “In the past, I would not be able to catch my\xa0favourite shows\xa0at such odd hours!”\nMunah's TV watching habit is not unique, and certainly not among millennials. An inaugural survey conducted by the Media Development Authority to track the population's viewing habits found that online streaming of movies and shows has become common in Singapore, with the highest viewership among millennials.\nMany appreciate the ability to watch content on-demand, without being at the mercy of rigid schedules and programming. The diverse content options that come with the increasing availability of over-the-top (OTT) video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube and HBO Go are also appealing to today’s consumers.\nSPOILT FOR CHOICE\nAs Munah binges on Black Mirror in her home at Tampines, on the other end of Singapore, Yen Wong, 38, is halfway through the first season of La Casa De Las Flores, a steamy Mexican drama full of romance, betrayal and family feuds.\n“Things are so different from when I was growing up,” said\xa0Wong. “Back then, we had to watch what broadcasters thought we would enjoy such as Channel 8’s drama serial The Unbeatables. Full disclosure, I enjoyed it very much, but now, we have more choices and can decide what to watch for ourselves.”\n“I was really into popular ’90s sitcom FRIENDS and got really invested in each character, so it was annoying to have to wait to find out who the father of Rachel’s baby was,” she explained, referring to one of the series’ more compelling plot points involving its main character.\nIn contrast, someone watching Stranger Things on Netflix could discover what happened to its main protagonist with psychokinetic abilities, Eleven, pretty quickly, if they watch all eight episodes of season one in a single sitting.\nConsumers seem to prefer it this way. Since its launch, Netflix has grown to over 100 million subscribers in more than 190 countries.\nProbably best of all, the video quality during streaming is often uncompromised and the experience seamless. Said\xa0Munah:\xa0“I don’t need to wait much, if at all, for a 22-minute, crystal clear show to load. What’s there to complain?”\n1. It’s fast: Based on the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) IMconnected Report, Singtel’s mobile network is the fastest in Singapore. The telco also boasted Asia’s fastest LTE speeds last September, notching 1.5Gbps, said Director of Singtel’s Radio Network Quality arm\xa0Edmund Quek. “We are constantly investing in innovative technologies to boost network speeds to give our customers the best network experience,” he said.\n2. It’s stable: You know the feeling\xa0— you’re watching a video on your phone while on the MRT, hoping it doesn’t glitch? Singtel’s engineers combat this by investigating and analysing areas with high traffic load such as in MRT train tunnels and popular shopping malls like ION Orchard and VivoCity, as well as areas with weak coverage such as HDB flats located on lower floors. They will then design and plan for coverage enhancement and expand mobile capacity in those locations.\n3. It’s future-ready: Named Asia’s Best Mobile Carrier by Telecom Asia in 2018, Singtel is piloting 5G network in Singapore in partnership with Ericsson. Singtel strives to be ahead of the streaming game by continually improving its mobile service game, using network analytics and customer insights to design, plan and optimise its network.\n\n\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     TV ', '     Movies ', '     video ', '     Entertainment ', '     Netflix ', '     technology ', '     Singtel ']}"

      Phishing, ransomware cases drop in 2018, but SingHealth hack ‘stark reminder’ of cyberthreats: CSA
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The number of phishing attacks, ransomware incidents and website defacements in Singapore dropped in 2018, yet last July’s SingHealth hack - the country’s most serious data breach in its history - is a “stark reminder” not be lulled into false security.\nMr David Koh, CEO of the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), said in the foreword of the Singapore Cyber Landscape 2018 report released on Tuesday (Jun 18) that as cyberthreats grow in scale and sophistication, it is no longer a question of ""if""\xa0but ""when""\xa0an online attack will hit the country.\n“Even as we strive to make our systems as secure as possible, it is imperative that we respond to an incident swiftly, robustly and decisively,” Mr Koh wrote, adding that the SingHealth hack was a stark reminder to push further in Singapore’s cybersecurity efforts collectively as a nation.\nThat said, the latest CSA report showed that there were fewer incidents of certain forms of cyberattacks.\nWebsite defacement, for one, fell from 2,040 cases in 2017 to 605 last year - a 70 per cent decline, the agency said.\n“Defacements are indicative of vulnerabilities present in a website’s underlying infrastructure. This may be a harbinger of more damaging cyberattacks, such as hosting malicious content on the website or using it as a platform to launch attacks,” CSA said.\nThose affected belonged to a range of organisations such as businesses, media companies and two government agencies. One victim was the Singapore website of a major Japanese advertising firm, which was compromised and replaced by a message “Sec\xa0== ‘0’” in January last year, the report said.\nEXPLOITING VULNERABILITIES\nAdditionally, a spike in defacements took place last November, and it was likely caused by an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in an unpatched Web server, it said.\nWebsites published on WordPress remained the most targeted for defacements last year, continuing a trend observed since 2016, CSA said. It added that more than a third of websites defaced in Singapore were built on the platform.\nIn fact, even after WordPress released an updated version of its platform and SingCERT published an alert after to advise website owners and Web hosting providers to update to the latest version last July, about 40 per cent of defaced WordPress websites have yet to be patched as of this March.\nWhen asked to elaborate on the reason for the decline in the number of cases, CSA told CNA that it may be premature to attribute the decline to any single factor seeing that the downward trend has only been for one year. It would also be premature to expect the decline to continue, CSA added.\nCSA did say, however, that there has been greater awareness of cyberthreats among organisations and the public ""given the extensive media coverage of cyber breaches and cyber scams in Singapore and around the world"".\nBEWARE OF RANSOMWARE\nThere was also a 30 per cent drop in the number of phishing URLs with a Singapore link seen last year, or specifically 16,100, the report said.\nThere were spikes in the number of such phishing attempts during major events, with the biggest spike seen in May ahead of the United States-North Korea summit held in Singapore, it said.\n“(An) intelligence-gathering campaign targeted South Koreans with phishing emails. These contained malware that could be used for keylogging and executing malicious commands on compromised devices,” the report said.\nMeanwhile, the number of reported ransomware cases dropped from 25 in 2017 to 21 last year, CSA said, but it qualified that the actual number may be higher as “many go unreported”.\nIt added the ransomware attacks affected systems across multiple industries in Singapore, such as construction, education and food and beverage.\nOne particular variant of ransomware, GandCrab, was highlighted as it was used to infect a private financial institution in Singapore last February. The report said one of the institution’s employees surfed a compromised website and was duped into installing a “font update pack” for displaying the website properly, but it did not state if the ransom was paid in this instance.\n""Organisations have differing business needs and priorities, and many do not think that they are likely targets of a cyberattack,"" CSA said, explaining why some do not patch their IT systems as soon as possible.\n""Some organisations may also choose to delay system updates for fear of system slowdown or malfunction. But cyberthreats are here to stay. Anyone can be a victim, and the attackers are constantly probing for weaknesses,"" the agency cautioned.\nCSA also sounded a warning to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are going digital, saying that business email impersonation scams are expected to grow.\nThe Singapore Police Force saw 378 such cases last year, up from 332 cases in 2017, the report said. Businesses here lost close to S$58 million in total, up about 31 per cent from 2017, it added.\nMr Lim Yihao, senior threat intelligence analyst at FireEye, told CNA in an email that this finding was\xa0""most concerning"".\n""Businesses are still falling victim to common tactics like business email impersonation and e-commerce scams,"" Mr Lim said, adding his recommendation for SMEs is to shore up email security as it remains the top attack vector.\nCRYSTAL-BALL GAZING: 6 TRENDS TO WATCH OUT FOR\nBesides looking back at the year past, CSA also reached for its crystal ball to look at cybersecurity trends for the future, highlighting six to watch out for.\nThe six are:\n• More frequent data breaches\nData has become the most valued commodity online, which means cybercriminals will try even harder to breach computer databases, particularly those that hold large amounts of private and personal information.\n• Increased threat to global supply chains\nCyberattackers will focus on disrupting supply chains, which have become highly interconnected and automated. Industries dominated by a few companies are particularly vulnerable.\n• More disruptive attacks against the cloud\nAs more databases are hosted on cloud computing systems, threat actors will eye potential vulnerabilities in this space for stealing data as well as for other malicious aims.\n•\xa0Greater risks for smart buildings, connected systems\nWith the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and connected industrial control systems, the risk of smart buildings being attacked also increases.\n• Artificial intelligence a double-edged sword\nAI can significantly enhance security systems; capabilities such as detecting anomalies, but online criminals can similarly use the tech to search for weaknesses in computer systems.\n• Biometric data to get more valuable\nAs biometric authentication becomes increasingly common, threat actors will shift to target and manipulate these to build virtual identities and gain access to personal information.\xa0\nCSA chief David Koh said the report is intended to provide useful lessons so Singapore can better prepare itself for the digital future.\n“As we advance towards our vision of a Smart Nation, cybersecurity is a vital prerequisite and key enabler – the invisible glue that instils trust and confidence in our digital plans,” Mr Koh said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     cybersecurity ', '     SingHealth ']}"

      Check in to the future: Are robot receptionists the future of hospitality?
  </h1>, 'text': 'In Mallorca recently, I talked to a group of hotel managers from around the world about their current preoccupations. A manager from Shanghai told me he had gone to see his counterpart at a rival establishment and found a robot standing behind the reception desk.\nThe robot asked if it could help. “I’ve come to see your general manager,” he said – and the robot summoned the general manager on the phone. Robots in hotels would be a big trend, the group agreed.\nExcept that it seems to have collapsed almost as soon as it started. Henn na in Japan, which claimed in 2015 to be the world’s first robot-staffed hotel, has reportedly stood down more than half of its 243 robots because they didn’t work properly.\nOne guest was repeatedly woken by the digital assistant in his bedroom asking him to repeat his request. Eventually the guest realised it was being triggered by his snoring, the Wall Street Journal reported. (I attempted to get independent confirmation from Henn na, but no one, human or robot, replied.)\nOther hotels are still trialling robots. A 2017 McKinsey study reported food, drink and toiletries being delivered by robots at a hotel in the San Francisco Bay Area, with guests ordering toiletries they didn’t need just for the fun of it.\nAutomating hotel services actually goes back a long way. In the 1980s, I heard Gerard Pelisson, co-founder of Accor, the French hotel group, talk about its Formule 1 budget chain, which was almost staff-free. Guests let themselves in with a credit card and got their meals from a vending machine. The toilets and bathrooms were self-cleaning.\nAn entirely automated hotel would bother me more than a machine-run airport does\nHotel robots are really just a gimmick. Most of what we do today, from checking in and out to getting our room keys and having our passports scanned, can be done with a mobile phone app or a machine in the reception area. Much of what a concierge can tell us, from the best local restaurants to what’s on at the theatre, is a Google search away.\nMany of us already avoid most human contact at the airport, whether choosing seats, checking in, presenting our boarding passes at security or clearing immigration on arrival. All of that is now available online or is done by a machine reading our passports and recognising our faces with not a robot in sight.\nHotels can be the same. Some already offer app-based services. The issue is whether we want them.\nWe all have our preferences. I like to see a smiling (human) face when I check in but prefer not to talk to anyone when I leave. I appreciate the people who clean my room in the morning but feel intruded on if I return in the evening to discover that someone has turned down the corner of my sheet (surely the least needed of all hotel tasks) and left two chocolates on my pillow.\nAn entirely automated hotel would bother me more than a machine-run airport does. Hotels are, after all, homes away from home.\nBut in some parts of the world we may have no choice. It is no accident that the first robot hotel was in Japan. The country is a leader in robots to replace workers. It has an ageing population and restricted immigration.\nThe UK may be next. KPMG has estimated that EU nationals make up nearly one quarter of Britain’s hospitality workers. After Brexit, the UK plans strict immigration limitations on EU workers earning under £30,000 (S$52,130), which will include many hotel employees.\nI don’t know whether we will see robots taking their jobs, but we will probably see more automation and fewer humans.\nBy\xa0Michael Skapinker\xa0© The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Travel ', '     technology ']}"

      From finance undergrad to food waste warrior, with a made-in-Singapore invention
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: As a finance student at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, there was a time when Rayner Loi dreamed of a career in investment or private banking. But that changed with one fateful conversation about three years ago.\nThe then 22-year-old was working on a service learning project that involved befriending at-risk youth. He had taken a boy out for dinner and, while dropping him off at his doorstep, mentioned to the mother that there was no need to prepare dinner for her son.\n“She just broke down and started thanking me profusely,” Loi recounted. “I was like, Auntie, it’s one dinner. I can afford it.\n“But then she said that on most days, she can’t afford to put dinner on the table for herself and her son.”\nIt was this, said Loi, that broke his heart — and moved him to invent a solution to food waste.\n“As an ignorant 22-year-old, I didn’t realise that there were such families struggling so badly to the point where even having dinner was a challenge,” he added.\n“What made matters worse was that I was also reading about Singapore’s food waste situation, and I couldn’t reconcile (myself to) the fact that we could be throwing away so much good food as a country, when there are families like that struggling with food insecurity.”\nToday, Loi is on a leave of absence from school to work on his new project: A smart food waste tracker that uses artificial intelligence to measure and identify all the food waste that goes into dustbins.\nPOWERFUL INFORMATION\nThrough his start-up, Good For Food, he works with businesses such as hotels and dining halls to install his tracker, known as Insight, on top of their existing dustbins.\nWhen food is thrown into a bin, the tracker uses a built-in camera, sensors and image recognition technology to log the food waste generated.\nThe data collected is automatically sent to the cloud, which Good For Food uses to generate reports — actionable insights as Loi describes them — for clients to act on to reduce their food waste.\n“If we can tell a buffet restaurant that for the last 30 days, they’ve thrown away … maybe 10 kilogrammes of curry chicken, on average, for every lunch service, they can then use that information to better plan for future lunch services,” he explained.\n“Perhaps they could reduce the amount of curry chicken they put on their buffet line by 5 kg first, and then continue to monitor and see if there can be further optimisations.”\nThere are now 12 trackers installed, spread across hotels, central kitchens and catering kitchens. But Loi said he looked to hotels as his first market, as they face a unique challenge when it comes to preparing their buffet food.\nAs they must ensure that the lines are well stocked with food, they tend to err on the side of caution and prepare more than enough, resulting in leftovers.\n“The worst thing for (hotels) is to have guests complain that they paid S$80 or S$90 for a buffet and the food has run out, so what the hoteliers normally do is to overproduce,” he said.\n“The hoteliers and kitchens know they’re throwing away a lot of food, but they don’t really know how to go about dealing with it.”\nLoi said he has seen clients’ food waste fall, on average, by 30 to 40 per cent with the help of the Insight tracker, and their food costs go down by about 3 to 8 per cent.\nAndaz Singapore, for example, began trials on the Insight tracker last month, and while the hotel’s general manager Olivier Lenoir said it is early days, he expects a food waste reduction of at least 20 per cent.\nPrior to that, said Lenoir, the hotel had been manually weighing its food waste and recording the amounts generated. But the waste had not been classified into different categories, such as smoked salmon or orange peels.\n“It doesn’t tell us whether we’re throwing away things that are still good to eat or could’ve been kept in a better way,” he said. “The Good For Food system is super simple, and there are no extra steps required.”\nThe information generated can be powerful: Knowing the exact amounts and specification of what the hotel throws away can go a long way towards reducing its waste, even by making small changes such as reducing the size of its buffet plates.\n“Instead of putting all our smoked salmon out on the buffet line on a large platter, we could have three smaller plates, and put just one out at a time,” said Lenoir.\n“You’d rather have a small plate that’s full than a big platter that’s half full.”\nA LONG THREE YEARS\nToday, Good For Food is going from strength to strength, with international hotel brands among its clients, and growing interest from markets such as Jakarta and Macau.\nThe company, which Loi co-founded in 2017 with his current chief technology officer Keshav Sivakumar, also receives funding from the Temasek Foundations family.\n“We’re heartened to see young people like Rayner producing an innovative solution to deal with a food waste problem,” said Temasek Foundation Ecosperity chief executive Lim Hock Chuan.\n“We hope more young people will join the ranks of innovators and find solutions to make Singapore a more sustainable and liveable place.”\nIt may have been just three years since Loi’s life changed, but it was a long journey from finance undergraduate to CEO of his own technology start-up: A journey filled with learning experiences, setbacks and no small measure of hard work.\nHis first idea was a mobile app he started in late 2016 that allowed restaurants with surplus food to sell it to needy customers at a heavy discount.\nIt was easy to find customers, but he struggled to get restaurants on board, largely because he had been targeting mainly fast-casual restaurants.\n“A lot of them are à la carte and cook to order … so under those circumstances, they don’t really have a lot of waste to begin with, which I was pleasantly surprised by,” he said.\n“But sad to say, I think they also found that having such a platform was going to be a hassle.”\nThere were other people, he added, who had the same idea. His co-founder Keshav was one of them. The two met by chance the following year, on an incubator programme for budding entrepreneurs.\nWATCH: How they did it (3:53)\nWhen he realised they shared the same passion for solving the food waste problem, he seized the opportunity to get Keshav, then 18, to join him. “He’s an amazing engineer, and I think we complement each other quite well,” said Loi.\n“I’m super thankful to him because every business needs a CTO and a CEO … No tech start-up can flourish and grow without both, so it was a blessing from heaven that I could find him in that programme.”\nLoi was then juggling his schoolwork with his responsibilities in the start-up. But when the company received its first round of funding in the middle of 2017, he knew it was time to hit the pause button on school.\nIt was also around that time, he said, that he no longer dreamed of going into private or investment banking. “Previously, I was so excited about modules on portfolio management and finance,” he said.\n“But slowly, those things became boring to me. And all I could think about was how I was going to help hoteliers manage their food waste and how I was going to build Good For Food.”\n'LEGACY OVER CURRENCY'\nWith hopes of regional expansion, it is exciting times for Good For Food. But as Loi said, there are challenges aplenty and also times when the work can get monotonous.\nFor one thing, a lot of time is spent building the image recognition system in the tracker by training the AI to understand the different types of waste generated in any kitchen.\nThis process, said Loi, is similar to training a toddler to distinguish between a cat and a dog — by generating images of food waste to help the AI tell the difference between, say, roast beef and chicken.\n“We have tens of thousands of images in our data bank,” he said. “So you can imagine how many man hours we’re investing in this.”\nEvery food item thrown away by a restaurant must be manually tagged by a human and verified by another.\nAnd there Loi was, with lead product engineer Adriel Tan, hunched over their keyboards in the Good For Food office, fingers flying as they tagged image after image, oblivious to the flurry of activity around them.\nHis record? Tagging 700 images in one sitting. “That was all I did the entire day. Adriel was sitting there looking at me … and I was like, I’m not going home until I finish it,” he said, grinning.\n“There are 82 images today — I think it’s a good day.”\nFor now, the monotony of such work is par for the course. As his machine toddler grows up and recognises more images, he hopes that these tasks will take less time in future.\nBut like a proud parent, Loi said there is not a moment when he is not thinking about his work. While he tries to shut it out on Sundays, he admits it is a challenge.\n“As a parent, do you ever not think about your child? You want the best for it, you want to nurture it … have full control over it,” he said. “It’s the same for a start-up.”\nHe stopped suddenly. “Wah, I sound like a controlling parent,” he added, laughing.\nJust as he once dreamed of a high-flying financial career for himself, today he has big dreams for his baby. Beyond going regional, Loi believes there is great potential for working with airlines or cruise ships.\nBut over the years, he has also realised that his dreams and passion encompass far more than dollars and cents. “Today, what drives me is legacy over currency,” he said.\n“What do I want to be known for in 10, 20 years’ time? It’s not so much about me being able to draw a five-figure salary, or Good For Food becoming a billion-dollar unicorn.\n“I want to be remembered as someone who took action to tackle global problems and who brought about a serious reduction in carbon emissions by tackling food waste.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Google blocks Huawei’s access to Android updates: What you need to know
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Google is blocking Huawei from some updates to the Android operating system, in a blow to the world’s second-biggest smartphone maker.\nThe move comes after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring US companies from using foreign telecoms equipment deemed a security risk.\nGoogle on Monday (May 20) said: “We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications.”\xa0\nHOW WILL THIS AFFECT HUAWEI USERS?\nUsers of existing Huawei devices will not be affected for now - they will still be able to update apps and access the Google Play Store.\n""Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,"" a Google spokesperson said, without providing further details.\nHowever, when Google launches the next version of Android, it may not be available on Huawei devices.\nIt is also unclear what this means for future Huawei phones.\nDue to the business ban, Google will have to stop activities with Huawei that involve direct transfer of hardware, software and technical services that are not publicly available.\nThis means Huawei will only be able to use the version of Android that’s available through the open source licence, known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP).\nPopular Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube and the Chrome browser that are available through Google\'s Play Store will disappear from future Huawei handsets as those services are not covered by the open source licence and require a commercial agreement with Google.\nIn the latest blow to the Chinese tech giant, Facebook said in June that its app, along with WhatsApp and Instagram will no longer be pre-installed in new Huawei phones.\xa0\nHuawei customers will still be able to download Facebook from the Google Playstore - for now.\xa0\nWHAT’S THE IMPACT ON HUAWEI’S BUSINESS?\nThe impact is expected to be minimal in the Chinese market. Most Google mobile apps are banned in China, where alternatives are offered by domestic competitors such as Tencent and Baidu.\nBut the move will hugely damage the brand\'s appeal to consumers outside China.\nAlmost half of the 208 million phones Huawei shipped in 2018 went to outside mainland China, and Europe is the most important overseas market where its devices currently have 29 per cent market share, according to technology research firm IDC.\n""Having those apps is critical for smartphone makers to stay competitive in regions like Europe,"" said Geoff Blaber, vice president of research, CCS Insight.\nThe business ban may also affect Huawei’s 5G plans.\n“(It) may cause China to delay its 5G network build until the ban is lifted, having an impact on many global component suppliers,"" said Ryan Koontz, a Rosenblatt Securities analyst.\nWHAT CAN HUAWEI DO?\nTo get around the Google ban, Huawei would ultimately have to build its own operating system, as Apple has for its iPhones. That cannot be done in a hurry.\nSoftware developers might feel compelled to offer a Huawei-specific version of their apps. Or the Chinese manufacturer could start a new branch of the Android family based on the open source version available now.\nBut that will all take time.\nARE THERE RISKS FOR GOOGLE?\nThe widespread mobile usage of Maps, Gmail and Google\'s other services has helped the US company build a market-leading position with Android alongside its crushing dominance in desktop browsing.\nBut in cutting off Huawei, Google risks being deprived of the revenue-generating data of all those phone owners around the world.\nAnd other Chinese smartphone makers, such as Xiaomi, Oppo and OnePlus, will be watching closely.\nShould Huawei build its own system, it\'s conceivable that those companies might join it, in a bid to end their own vulnerability to future actions by the US government or companies.\nHOW DID THE BAN COME ABOUT?\nHuawei has been the target of an intense campaign by Washington, which has been trying to persuade allies not to allow China a role in building next-generation 5G mobile networks.\nHuawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei’s army background and his company’s opaque culture have fueled suspicions in some countries that the firm has links with the Chinese military and intelligence services.\nThe United States believes Huawei’s smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.\n""Chinese telecom companies like Huawei effectively serve as an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party,"" Senator Tom Cotton from the US Republican party had said after Trump\'s emergency declaration last week.\nWHAT’S BEEN HUAWEI’S RESPONSE?\nHuawei said on Monday it would continue to provide security updates and services for its smartphones and tablets.\n""We have made substantial contributions to the development and growth of Android around the world,"" a spokesman said.\n""Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally,"" he added, without touching on what would happen with phones it would sell in the future.\nHuawei previously said that the company has already been preparing a contingency plan by developing its own technology in case it is blocked from using Android. Some of this technology is already being used in products sold in China, the company said.\n""We have not done anything which violates the law,"" founder and CEO Ren told Japanese media on Saturday, adding the US measures would have a limited impact.\xa0\n""It is expected that Huawei\'s growth may slow, but only slightly.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Huawei ', '     Google ', '     technology ']}"

      Think you’re discreet online? Today's tech is more powerful than you thought
  </h1>, 'text': 'People concerned about privacy often try to be “careful” online. They stay off social media, or if they’re on it, they post cautiously. They don’t share information about their religious beliefs, personal life, health status or political views. By doing so, they think they are protecting their privacy.\nBut they are wrong. Because of technological advances and the sheer amount of data now available about billions of other people, discretion no longer suffices to protect your privacy. Computer algorithms and network analyses can now infer, with a sufficiently high degree of accuracy, a wide range of things about you that you may have never disclosed, including your moods, your political beliefs, your sexual orientation and your health.\n\n\nThere is no longer such a thing as individually “opting out” of our privacy-compromised world.\nThe basic idea of data inference is not new. Magazine subscriber lists have long been purchased by retailers, charities and politicians because they provide useful hints about people’s views. A subscriber to The Wall Street Journal is more likely to be a Republican voter than is a subscriber to The Nation, and so on.\nBut today’s technology works at a far higher level. Consider an example involving Facebook. In 2017, the newspaper The Australian published an article, based on a leaked document from Facebook, revealing that the company had told advertisers that it could predict when younger users, including teenagers, were feeling “insecure,” “worthless” or otherwise in need of a “confidence boost.” Facebook was apparently able to draw these inferences by monitoring photos, posts and other social media data.\nFacebook denied letting advertisers target people based on those characteristics, but it’s almost certainly true that it has that capacity. Indeed, academic researchers demonstrated last year that they were able to predict depression in Facebook users by analysing their social media data – and they had access to far less data than Facebook does. Even if Facebook does not now market its ability to glean your present or future mental health from your social media activity, the fact that it (and any number of other, less visible actors) can do this should worry you.\n\n\nIt is worth stressing that today’s computational inference does not merely check to see if Facebook users posted phrases like “I’m depressed” or “I feel terrible.” The technology is more sophisticated than that: Machine-learning algorithms are fed huge amounts of data, and the computer program itself categorises who is more likely to become depressed.\nConsider another example. In 2017, academic researchers, armed with data from more than 40,000 Instagram photos, used machine-learning tools to accurately identify signs of depression in a group of 166 Instagram users. Their computer models turned out to be better predictors of depression than humans who were asked to rate whether photos were happy or sad and so forth.\n\n\nUsed for honourable purposes, computational inference can be a wonderful thing. Predicting depression before the onset of clinical symptoms would be a boon for public health, which is why academics are researching these tools; they dream of early screening and prevention.\nBut these tools are worrisome, too. Few people posting photos on Instagram are aware that they may be revealing their mental health status to anyone with the right computational power.\nComputational inference can also be a tool of social control. The Chinese government, having gathered biometric data on its citizens, is trying to use big data and artificial intelligence to single out “threats” to Communist rule, including the country’s Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group.\nSuch tools are being marketed for use in hiring employees, for detecting shoppers’ moods and predicting criminal behaviour. Unless they are properly regulated, in the near future we could be hired, fired, granted or denied insurance, accepted to or rejected from college, rented housing and extended or denied credit based on facts that are inferred about us.\n\n\nThis is worrisome enough when it involves correct inferences. But because computational inference is a statistical technique, it also often gets things wrong – and it is hard, and perhaps impossible, to pinpoint the source of the error, for these algorithms offer little to no insights into how they operate. What happens when someone is denied a job on the basis of an inference that we aren’t even sure is correct?\nAnother troubling example of inference involves your phone number. It is increasingly an identifier that works like a Social Security number – it is unique to you. Even if you have stayed off Facebook and other social media, your phone number is almost certainly in many other people’s contact lists on their phones. If they use Facebook (or Instagram or WhatsApp), they have been prompted to upload their contacts to help find their “friends,” which many people do.\nOnce your number surfaces in a few uploads, Facebook can place you in a social network, which helps it infer things about you since we tend to resemble the people in our social set. (Facebook even keeps “shadow” profiles of nonusers and deploys “tracking pixels” situated all over the web – not just on Facebook – that transmit information about your behaviour to the company.)\nWhat is to be done? Designing phones and other devices to be more privacy-protected would be start, and government regulation of the collection and flow of data would help slow things down. But this is not the complete solution. We also need to start passing laws that directly regulate the use of computational inference: What will we allow to be inferred, and under what conditions, and subject to what kinds of accountability, disclosure, controls and penalties for misuse?\nUntil we have good answers to these questions, you can expect others to continue to know more and more about you – no matter how discreet you may have been.\nBy Zeynep Tufekci © 2019 The New York Times\nZeynep Tufekci is an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, the author of Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest and a contributing opinion writer.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Tech ', '     technology ', '     privacy ', '     Facebook ', '     Expert Advice ']}"

      New firefighting system, VR training among upcoming initiatives unveiled by SCDF
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Tackling large-scale fires will get easier for the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) from next year.\xa0\nAt its annual work plan seminar on Thursday (May 9), SCDF unveiled a new\xa0fire-fighting system - the\xa0modular oil tank firefighting system\xa0(MOTFS)\xa0-\xa0that can pump out\xa0100,000L\xa0of water per minute with two of its monitors.\xa0\nThe current system now deploys four monitors which can pump 60,000L of water, which mean the new MOTFS monitors will take up less space when they are deployed.\xa0Citing the 2018 fire on Pulau Busing which took six\xa0hours to extinguish, director of operations Assistant Commissioner Daniel Seet said that the MOTFS will help SCDF to fight fires involving large or multiple oil tanks.\n“Had this system been (introduced at) Pulau Busing, we would have had to deploy a lot lesser equipment on site. That actually helps tremendously because in any oil refinery system, space is a premium,” said Mr Seet.\n""The laying of equipment on site is always the most resource-intensive. So with the collapse of the entire system into largely two guns, we are able to then save time and resources needed to set up this system.""\nCurrently, a fixed number of large monitors and equipment is deployed to each incident, regardless of scale.\xa0\nThe MOTFS comprises pumps, hoses and monitors in a modular form, which can be quickly deployed in various combinations to match the scale of the incident.\xa0\nAn automated hose retrieval system will also reduce fatigue for firefighters, said SCDF.\nWater supply capabilities are also enhanced with a submersible pump unit that allows a large quantity of water to be drawn directly from an open water source, such as the sea, and supplied to a pump placed up to 50m away.\xa0\nCurrently, a large pump has to be confined to land not more than 3m away from the surface.\n“Once all the equipment is in place, we’ll start to train our personnel to orientate them to the new system and then conduct a series of exercises both internally, and also with the industry partners before we operationalise this equipment,” said Mr Seet.\nAERIAL FIRE-FIGHTING\nOther new technologies were also introduced to increase the range of tactical options for high-rise fire and rescue operations.\nFor example, the new Combined Platform Ladder 60m is able to extend up to the maximum height of a 20-storey building. It is also equipped with a water monitor capable of discharging water at a rate of 3,800L per minute, and a rescue cage that can hold up to 500kg of weight.\nNEW MEDICAL SUPPORT VEHICLE\nSCDF also announced enhancements to its\xa0medical support vehicle (MSV) which allows the provision of pre-hospital medical care during both peacetime and national emergencies.\nA new facility within the MSV provides a clean environment with the inclusion of an air evacuation system and surgical light that allows SCDF officers to perform on-site stabilisation and critical invasive treatments.\nIt also allows a single SCDF responder to transport an individual of up to 318kg with ease.\nUNLIMITED AIR SUPPLY FOR UNDERWATER RESCUE\nThe Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) unveiled its new surface supplied diving equipment, which provides an unlimited air supply to the diver, allowing for prolonged underwater search-and-rescue operations.\nPreviously, DART divers were limited to about 40 minutes of underwater operations with an air cylinder, before having to resurface for air.\nOnce deployed, a DART diver will be fully encapsulated in a dry suit and hard hat, and attached to a surface air supply system for his primary source of air. An accompanying air cylinder will be his backup air supply, said SCDF.\nSpeaking at the\xa0work plan seminar, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said SCDF is ""transforming its line of technology"" due to urban development and a more complex physical environment.\n""SCDF has been one of the organisations that have really incorporated tech into its day-to-day operations in a very significant way,"" the minister said.\xa0\nUSING VIRTUAL REALITY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN TRAINING\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) system that transcribes 995 calls in real time is another innovation\xa0being tested by\xa0the SCDF.\nMr Shanmugam said, ""The system has been trained to recognise speech, can transcribe and log emergency calls and it is programmed to recognise the four official languages plus the fifth, Singlish.""\nHe noted that the SCDF receives\xa0close to 200,000 calls a year.\n""If the trial is successful, it will significantly reduce the time taken to process emergency calls,"" he added.\nSCDF is also rolling out a series of initiatives using science and virtual reality to optimise the training of emergency responders such as paramedics.\nFor example, there will be new training facilities which simulate a realistic training environment for emergency medical services.\nPlans are also in the pipeline to use mixed reality, where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\xa0\nDiverse and complex scenarios can be created quickly and users are guided step-by-step through a self-directed learning platform, with instant feedback provided through colour queues, said SCDF.\nThe organisation is looking to explore the use of VR technology to put firefighter trainees in multiple mission environments, which can include a render of an existing building. This will also provide an objective during- and after action review that shows what can be improved upon.\nPARTNERING COMMUNITIES\nSCDF also signed a memorandum of intent\xa0with both Mercy Relief and Singapore Red Cross\xa0to provide humanitarian volunteering opportunities for Civil Defence Lionhearters and their schoolmates.\n“These youth volunteers are crucial to inspire and motivate their peers as well as the next generation towards volunteerism and community first response,” said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Health Amrin Amin.\nAs part of the work plan seminar, Mr Shanmugam also launched the Improvised First Aid Skills Plus to educate members of the public on how to use everyday items to stop excessive bleeding during emergencies.\xa0\nHe said that getting the public involved is ""very important"" as the SCDF\xa0will face more challenges, with rising medical needs from an ageing population and manpower constraints caused by low birth rates.\n""When the community gets involved, our work becomes easier. People who need help - their chances of survival also improve. So we want to encourage everyone to join SCDF on this journey,"" added Mr Shanmugam.\n', 'related_topics': ['     SCDF ', '     technology ']}"

Traditionally, tilapia have been grown in Singapore and around the region but they do not take to sea water well, so the survivability and growth rates here have not been high,” Dr Liew told Channel NewsAsia during a visit to his lab earlier this week.\nThrough the use of technology that can accurately identify fish with desired traits and select them for its selective breeding programme, TLL researchers have been able to breed good-quality and salt-tolerant tilapia, now in the fifth generation, without any genetic modification.\n“We will do mass cross-breeding for each batch of fish and after about 3 months, do a size selection where we will pick out those that have grown the fastest. We will find out the parents of these superior fish and use them to breed more fish. Their offspring will then be used for the next batch,” said Dr Liew who has been involved in the tilapia selection project since 2014.\n“We have been hoping to achieve high-yield, fast-growth tilapia that can survive in sea water. I think we have almost achieved that.”\nIn another TLL laboratory nearby, Dr Urano Daisuke is hoping to grow vegetables that are climate-proof and have improved agronomical traits and nutritional values.\nWhile an indoor setting allows researchers to come up with optimal conditions, it brings about a different set of challenges.\n“Unlike outdoor farms with problems like the weather or pathogens, we don’t have to consider these threats in indoor farms. But plants here need to grow at a high-density setting with low-light intensity.”\nThe latter stems from cost issues faced by many indoor farms. “Lighting makes up the biggest cost for the business of indoor farming. In Japan, for example, advanced indoor farms spend about 70 to 80 per cent of their costs on LED lights and the remaining on temperature control,” elaborated Dr Urano, who is the principal investigator for TLL’s research on vegetables.\nUnder low light conditions, plants tend to start growing longer stalks to help them fight for light. This usually results in smaller leaves.\xa0\n“But the plants we want is even under low light, they can still make big leaves which is what people eat … If the plants can grow nicely at low-light intensity, then we can reduce cost,” added Dr Urano.\n“The plants for indoor farming will have to be different so we need to modify some traits and breed new vegetables that have these unique traits.”\nSINGAPORE RAMPS UP AGRI-FOOD R&D BUDGET\nSuch research and development (R&D) projects are what Singapore is looking to pump in more money as it beefs up its agriculture and food production sector.\nIn line with the newly announced target to produce 30 per cent of the nation’s nutritional needs by 2030, the Government will invest S$144 million from its Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) plan to ramp up R&D in the agri-food industry.\nThe National Research Foundation (NRF), in a press release on Wednesday (Mar 27), said factors like climate change, rising sea levels and temperatures are risks to world food production. Given Singapore’s space and resource constraints, the country is vulnerable to these global trends that impact food supply and safety.\nCiting how the country has previously tapped on science and technology to tackle its water constraints, it needs to do the same for its food challenges.\nThe new funds will go to R&D efforts in three areas, namely sustainable urban food production with focus on tropical aquaculture and urban agriculture, development of “future foods” in the form of alternative proteins, as well as building new food safety standards and local capabilities to drive innovation in food production and manufacturing.\xa0\n“With the investments we are putting in place, it will help to raise productivity of some of the locally produced food sources,"" National Development\xa0Minister Lawrence Wong said at a press conference held after the 11th Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC) meeting on Wednesday.\n“We can also invest in the strengths we have in biotechnology and advanced manufacturing (to) help us look at new food sources emerging now.\n""This will also help us improve our understanding in how these food sources are evolving, strengthen our capabilities in regulating food and ensuring food safety for the future,"" he added.\nTo complement this, two Centres of Innovation focusing on aquaculture and energy will be set up in Temasek Polytechnic and the Nanyang Technological University by June and April, respectively.\nUSING TECH TO PRODUCE MORE\nTLL’s chief executive Peter Chia welcomes the increasing attention on the local agri-tech sector. More than just funds, he said he is excited about the growing awareness that has been created about the industry.\n“Rather than just approaching it from a biology point of view, which gives you only one side of the equation, we can now bring together people from multiple backgrounds, agencies to meet the ’30 by 30’ goal in a much more considered way.”\nSince founded in 2002, TLL has focused primarily on understanding the cellular mechanisms underpinning the development and physiology of plants, fungi and animals. Its selective breeding programme on fish genetics, for one, has successfully yielded a premium breed of sea bass that is less susceptible to disease and can be bred in 30 per cent less time.\nIts ongoing research on salt-tolerant tilapia and the climate-proofing of vegetables are other ways it hopes technology can help to bolster Singapore’s food security.\n“As aquaculture becomes more knowledge-intensive, the idea is for us to contribute with technology and knowledge to improve productivity overall,” said Mr Chia.\n“To produce more with less, and in a lower risk manner so that in general, we will have better-quality food and more affordable food, which is the definition of food security.”\nFor the tilapia selection project, outdoor trials will be the next step to take and researchers are currently looking to supply fingerlings to farmers in Singapore for a start.\n“We have transformed the tilapia to be able to grow in sea water so what’s next is to have farmers to be aware of this and get them to take our fish for trials in the real environment,” said Dr Liew.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     food ']}"

      Digital tech, food security among key areas to get more R&amp;D funding
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Following a mid-term review of its five-year science and technology plan, Singapore will pump in more money to boost research and development (R&D) efforts in three key areas, namely digital technologies, cell therapy manufacturing and food security.\n“Our investment in R&D is a long-term endeavor. It is not just for the short run and we must continue our investments in basic sciences,"" said Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat on Wednesday (Mar 27).\nMr Heng, who is also the chairman of the National Research Foundation (NRF), was speaking alongside Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference held at the end of the 11th Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC) meeting.\nIn his opening remarks, Mr Lee said the elements of research, innovation and enterprise are critical to Singapore\'s development.\nThere has been progress since the RIEC journey began in 2006 to deepen the nation\'s science and technology capabilities along the whole value chain. This includes\xa0international recognition and significant breakthroughs for local scientists, as well as foreign companies such as Dyson setting up their advanced product development facilities here.\nR&D efforts have also resulted in practical and useful products, including autonomous vehicles, he added.\xa0\nTo ensure success, Singapore will have to continue to emphasise science and technology throughout society, said the prime minister. For one, the country cannot afford “to have people fearful and distrustful of science, who are held captive by totally groundless anti-scientific beliefs”.\xa0\nIt will also have to develop a strong core of talented researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs, while forging international partnerships.\xa0\n""We must and we will continue to invest in science, technology and innovation in a balanced, sustained and sustainable manner. (This is) in order to keep Singapore competitive and relevant globally, and seed exciting new opportunities for our future economy,” said Mr Lee.\xa0\nINVESTING IN FUTURE GROWTH\nThe additional investments announced on Wednesday will build on the progress made under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020 (RIE2020) plan -\xa0the S$19 billion, five-year roadmap launched in early-2016.\xa0\nOn how RIE2020 plan has fared thus far, Mr Lee, who chairs the RIEC, said: “We have affirmed that we are on track, but we are sharpening our focus and making fine-tuning adjustments to our plans.”\nTo ensure that Singapore keeps pace with the digital revolution, the Government will invest an additional S$500 million under the RIE2020 plan to strengthen digital technologies and automation expertise here.\nOf that amount, S$200 million will go to boosting the nation’s supercomputing capability and network speed and quality, as announced by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat earlier this month.\nThe National Robotics Programme is set to receive about S$41 million to deploy more robotics technology, while the remaining funds will help to expand existing programmes like AI Singapore and foster new capabilities in digital trust, the social science of digital technologies, and computational law.\nAnother area earmarked for more investments is cell therapy – a form of therapy in which intact living cells are injected into a patient to help fight cancer, or enable the restoration of tissue or organ function.\xa0\nThe industry has seen accelerated growth in recent years on the back of related product launches, presenting high-value opportunities for the local biopharmaceutical manufacturing sector, according to the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).\xa0\n“When you look at the future, it’s beyond what we currently manufacture today. Small molecules, biologics and cell therapy will be part of the future and we want to anchor those investments here in Singapore,” said Dr Benjamin Seet, executive director at A*STAR’s biomedical research council.\nBy ploughing in S$80 million, Singapore hopes to address existing hurdles in the making of cell therapies. These include developing a commercially scalable platform and improved technology to assess the quality of cells manufactured.\nIn line with the newly announced target of producing 30 per cent of the nation’s nutritional needs by 2030, some S$144 million will also be allocated from the RIE2020 plan for R&D work in sustainable urban food production, future food, as well as food safety science and innovation.\xa0\nMORE TO BE DONE\nApart from increased funding, Mr Heng also touched on the need to position Singapore as a global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.\nHe noted that this year, a dedicated session on innovation and enterprise was held during the RIEC meeting for the first time. It involved venture capitalists and entrepreneurs from around the world, who “strongly endorsed” Singapore’s positioning strategy.\n“They feel very strongly that this is an excellent time for Singapore to position this way because the economies in Asia are growing and the global linkages are needed more than ever. At the same time, it will allow us to draw some of the best technology, innovation and talent into our region.”\xa0\nDeveloping talent across various areas in both basic R&D, as well as innovation and enterprise, is also an area that Singapore needs to do, said Mr Heng.\n“We need to create more opportunities for our people, young or old, to understand more about the markets in Asia, the possibilities, the tech or nature of innovation.”\nBuilding on that, Mr Chan, in a\xa0speech centered on the changes in the manufacturing sector, said Singapore must maintain its access to global talent networks. “That will become a crucial distinctive feature in our competitiveness.”\nThere are also areas that Singapore can do better, with private-sector RIE investments brought up as one example during the press conference.\xa0\nSingapore currently spends about 1 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on RIE, said Mr Lee. The private sector, on the other hand, spends between 1.2 per cent and 1.4 per cent of GDP.\xa0\n“It’s not quite what we had hoped because our aim is Government 1 and private sector 2,” said the prime minister, in response to questions from reporters.\xa0\nHe was, however, quick to add that in terms of dollar amount, RIE investment from the private sector\xa0has increased alongside growth in the economy. Mr Heng added that R&D investments from businesses have been growing at some 5.7 per cent per annum compounded.\xa0\n“But I think we need to do more,” said Mr Lee. “It is an area that we need to find partnership between the public and private sector.""\xa0\nElaborating on what the NRF can do to nudge more companies, both big and small, to try to incorporate R&D into their operations, its chief executive Low Teck Seng said: “The industry is not spending rapidly enough so we will need to keep pushing our tech consortia idea and others to see to get them more involved. In terms of tech deployment and diffusion, can we be more effective? I think we can.”\nAdditional reporting by Deborah Wong\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     technology ']}"

      If robots do everything, then what will we do? Will people marry robots in future?
  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING: As a journalist, I always try to ask smart questions. But I could not beat the questions that a group of five-year-olds posed to China’s top artificial intelligence (AI) guru, like the ones in the headline of this article.\nPeople pay attention to what Dr Lee Kai-Fu says – lots of people. Fifty million people in China follow him on social media, which means he has more fans than American talk show host Oprah Winfrey.\nOne of his tag lines is “AI is reshaping the world as we know it”. But beyond having a snappy turn of phrase, the 57-year-old possesses heavyweight credentials.\nHe was the founding president of Google China, from 2005 to 2009. And his early resume includes stints as vice president at top technology firms, like Microsoft and Apple.\nMicrosoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella calls Dr Lee’s book on the New York Times bestseller list – AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order – a “must-read”.\nThat is slightly ironic, since Microsoft actually sued Google in 2005 in an attempt to block the search engine giant from hiring Dr Lee. Of course, this was before Mr Nadella became CEO in 2014.\nBack to the clever questions.\nWhat worries Dr Lee is not human-robot marriages, because while a tiny minority of people might want to treat robots as humans, most of us – even children – know the difference between a toy or a pet and a human relationship.\n“But for elder care, I think it’s going exactly in the wrong direction. I believe that elder care is the job that we children must do for our parents. And when we don’t do it, we must hire a human,” he says.\n“Giving them (the elderly) primitive, fake and inanimate non-emotional robots to interact with is a cruel thing that we shouldn’t do as human beings.”\nHe acknowledges that AI can be used for mundane tasks, like reminding us to take our medicine or monitoring safety. But for this AI expert, the human warmth part is paramount.\n“My mother had dementia, and when she was alive the last 15 years, it was her children who spent probably five to 10 hours a day with her, which kept her dementia from worsening,” he recounts.\n“There’s no way a robot can do that.”\n40% OF JOBS WILL DISAPPEAR\nDr Lee predicts, however, that AI will make countless jobs redundant in a short time. He sees 40 per cent – which is hundreds of millions of jobs – disappearing in just 15 years perhaps.\nAnd he has been looking at many jobs and many companies as the founder and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of China’s earliest institutional angel investors.\nBut he says it is not all gloom, as AI will also create millions more jobs.\n“For example, when the Internet began, none of us could predict, 20 years later, there’d be 10 million Uber and Didi drivers in the world. And that’s a lot of jobs being created,” he cites.\nWhile many routine jobs will disappear, not all manual jobs will necessarily go.\n“For blue-collar jobs, the replacement won’t be that fast. The jobs that require minimal dexterity, like picking up items, is fairly easy … while making an iPhone, that’s actually quite hard,” he says.\n“One could put a spectrum. A plumber would be safe for many years, although car mechanics, not so safe. Assembly-line workers making an iPhone – okay. But assembly-line workers folding clothes and doing quality inspections? No.”\nWILL ROBOT CARS HURT PEOPLE?\nOn the question of autonomous vehicles, he thinks we should get them on the roads fast. Not that they will never make mistakes, but he argues that it is about making fewer mistakes than humans do and thereby saving lives.\n“That’s the most critical question we mustn’t forget. We mustn’t launch an autonomous vehicle until we know that it’s safe for the people, and furthermore, we know that AI gets better with data,” says Dr Lee.\n“Initially, it might be 5 per cent safer than people. But in five, 10, 20 years, it might be 90 per cent safer.”\n“So when you look at that much greater good over a period of time, I’d say don’t be too obsessed on the single issue of explaining why you did it and what’s the liability,"" he adds.\nJust this month, South Korea successfully tested a 5G-connected autonomous vehicle on the streets of Seoul, while Singapore launched a 12-metre autonomous electric bus.\n“A quick decision is better than a lengthy debate because the faster we can get the safer autonomous vehicle launched, the faster we’ll be saving lives,” Dr Lee says.\nONLY HUMAN AFTER ALL\nThe curious thing is that this AI guru keeps coming back to what one might call the warm-and-fuzzy stuff.\nDr Lee sees AI freeing humans from much of the drudgery of many jobs – and what would be in demand are jobs where creativity and compassion are key elements.\nHe says compassion means being able to work with others, that is, teamwork, communication, empathy and winning trust.\nAs a final question, I asked him if he thought his children would live in a better world because of AI.\nHis reply: While they probably would still go through a world in turmoil because of some people losing jobs and issues of privacy versus convenience, things would be pretty good for his grandchildren.\n“AI will displace most routine jobs, which is a challenge for the next 20 years. But once that’s done, it will liberate us from having to do routine jobs,” he says.\n“Humans will get to do things that we’re passionate about, things we’re good at, and have more time to do the things we love, spend time with the people we love and even time to think about what makes us human.”\nWatch the full exclusive interview on Channel NewsAsia’s Conversation With here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Eliminating paper documents, S$300m research fund top-up among MCI’s 2019 plans
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A slew of initiatives are being planned to further drive businesses in Singapore to go digital, including introducing digital documentation in previously paper-driven transactions and increasing the funding for research and development (R&D) in services and digital economy (SDE).\nThese were revealed by Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate in Parliament on Monday (Mar 4).\nOne of the key projects this year is to develop an interoperability framework known as TradeTrust, to facilitate the exchange of digital trade documentation, according to MCI’s factsheet. This would involve working with various agencies and industry partners, both local and international.\n“This framework aims to reduce inefficiencies and complexities of cross-border trade arising from the current usage of paper-based documentation, such as bills of lading,” it explained.\n“This lowers operating costs for businesses and the risk of fraud while accelerating the digitalisation of cross-border trade processes, thereby facilitating more efficient trade.”\nPAPERLESS MARITIME INDUSTRY\nThe first to potentially benefit from this is the maritime industry.\nThe Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) will partner the Maritime Port Authority (MPA) to lead TradeTrust development for electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs). They will be supported by Singapore Customs and Singapore Shipping Association, the ministry said, adding the four parties signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to affirm their support.\nThey will focus on developing the infrastructure for the exchange of such digital documents\xa0and conduct technical trials to demonstrate the interoperability of eBLs across different ecosystems, it said.\nIMDA will organise industry consultation workgroups with stakeholders from the maritime trade, logistics and finance sectors, before issuing a Request for Proposal to the industry to submit proposals on how to implement the TradeTrust infrastructure.\nThis is not the first initiative MCI has introduced to try and eliminate paper from business transactions. During the committee of supply debates last year, it announced a plan to develop a common electronic invoicing (e-invoicing) framework and modelled it after the Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line (PEPPOL) standard.\nThis was activated in January this year and interested companies can get on board via 11 local access point providers.\nINCREASE IN SDE FUNDING\nMr Iswaran also pointed out that the budget for SDE will be almost doubled to further Singapore’s innovation and to help it remain competitive globally. A total of S$360 million was originally committed to this segment under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 plan.\nEfforts in this domain have contributed to the growth in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data science, the Ministry of Communications and Information said in its factsheet.\nAs such, the SDE budget will be increased by an additional S$300 million to further boost the country’s Smart Nation and digital economy aspirations in the mid- to long-term.

      Singapore plans data portability requirement as part of PDPA update
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore on Monday (Feb 25) laid out its thoughts on introducing a data portability requirement as part of an ongoing review of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), in a move that could give users greater control over the movement of their information across service providers.\nThis was presented in a discussion paper discussing the benefits and impacts\xa0of a data portability requirement for business innovation, market competition and consumers, and announced by Communications and Information Minister S Iswaran at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain.\nThe discussion paper comes after the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and the Competition and Consumer Commission Singapore (CCCS) announced plans to study data portability last year.\n""Singapore believes that there could be greater clarity on how data portability can be introduced in support of a Smart Nation and a Digital Economy,"" the PDPC said in a press release on Monday.\n""Data portability, whereby users are empowered to authorise the movement of their personal data across organisations, can boost data flows and support greater data sharing in a digital economy both within and across sectors,"" it said.\n\xa0\nHOW DATA PORTABILITY BRINGS BENEFITS\nData portability allows people to request for a copy of their data held by an organisation in a commonly used and machine-readable format, and get them to send the data to another when switching service providers.\nFor the consumer, data portability could give them greater control and flexibility over their personal information.\nThis means that if they choose to move away from one telco to another, for example, they can do so without having to provide the same know-your-customer details repeatedly.\nAnother benefit would be to allow them to move from one service provider to another without losing past records and important histories built up with previous providers, PDPC said.\nThis means that online shoppers, for example, can have their shopping history at one e-commerce provider transferred to another platform, allowing the latter to offer better, customised offers from the get-go.\nBy allowing people to move their data more easily from one service provider to another, this helps them try new services or choose competing service offerings that best suit their needs, PDPC said.\n\nFor organisations, data portability would give them wider access to more diverse and larger datasets.\n\xa0\nThis would, in turn, allow them to develop better insights, optimise or develop products and services better tailored to customers’ needs, the PDPC said, adding that this could potentially lower barriers to entry for new businesses.\n\xa0\nMORE TALKS NEEDED\nThe discussion paper was introduced to act as a framework for data originators, data recipients and consumers to understand and discuss data portability, PDPC said.\nThis includes issues such as how organisations would provide consumers with sufficient information about how ported data will be used, as well as the need for standards on interoperability and security to allow for such data transfers.\n“Data is a key enabler of digital transformation, but a delicate balance must be struck between data protection and business innovation,” Mr Iswaran said in the press release.\n“Today, Singapore is issuing a discussion paper on data portability, which sets out our thoughts through the lens of personal data protection, competition and data flows to support services and innovation in the digital economy.\n“We hope more can join us in this international discourse and work together to build a trusted global environment for business innovation,” he added.\nSingapore is not the only one looking at data portability. The European Union, for one, has already included the right to data portability within its wider General Data Protection Regulation last May.\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

How a visit turns out, however, may not always be so obvious to the officers supervising the inmates.\nThat could change, as the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) is now exploring the use of video analytics\xa0to help its officers be more aware of inmates’ behaviours.\nIf the technology works accurately, the SPS envisions using it to improve the management of inmates throughout the Changi Prison Complex.\nIt would be the most comprehensive use of video analytics\xa0in the prison since the SPS set out in 2017 to transform its operations through technological initiatives.\nThis comes as Singapore goes into facial recognition technology in a big way, with a project lined up to fit cameras and sensors on more than 100,000 lamp-posts, to help authorities “perform crowd analytics” and support anti-terror operations.\nIn prison, the technology could play a similar analytics role, Deputy Superintendent of Prisons 2 (DSP 2) Neo Ming Feng disclosed to the programme Why It Matters in a web exclusive.\n“With more data coming in through sensors, through biometrics, through closed-circuit television, we can fuse the data and analyse it, and assist our officers through a better ground situation awareness of what’s going on,” said the 32-year-old.\nPICKING UP ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR\nFor example, one of the things officers look out for is “the way inmates respond to how their families are doing”.\n“Let’s say, after a visit and the inmates come back slightly depressed or looking unhappy, that’s when we can pick up signs of … the inmates behaving abnormally,” said DSP 2 Neo, the SPS’ assistant director of transformational projects.\n“Our officers can intervene to understand what’s happening or what the inmate is going through, and that can better help inmates.”\nVideo\xa0 analytics\xa0could help prison officers to better understand how inmates behave in general, for example in their cell or in the day room, which is the area right outside their cells.\n“Once we know the normal behaviour of the inmate, when the inmate behaves abnormally, we could then pick up the difference,” explained DSP 2 Neo.\nThe information could alert officers that they “probably need to pay more attention to the inmate, to pre-empt incidents that could happen”.\nThe technology could also identify more accurately whom an inmate communicates with usually. “With that, we can learn more about the dynamics of the inmates’ interactions … (and) the dynamics of the whole prison,” said DSP 2 Neo.\nDeploying video analytics\xa0would also assist officers in the control centre in identifying whether any inmates are going to an area of the prison where they are not supposed to be.\nThe prison staff are “generally very supportive of this project”, as they understand how it will help them, added DSP 2 Neo.\nAlthough the vision is clear, the SPS has not implemented this system just yet.\nSo far, Changi Prison has been doing trials on facial recognition to determine whether an automated system can replace the muster checks done manually by officers to account for inmates.\nUsing the technology, cameras in the cells capture the inmates’ facial images and verify them with the database. This allows the checks, which must be repeated a few times daily, to be done faster.\nDETECTING FIGHTS\nBesides that, a human behaviour detection system called Avatar is being tested. It uses video analytics to detect abnormal activities – such as fights – in the cells and to alert the officers.\nTo do this, the system must be taught to recognise aggression, explained Mr Benjamin Lee, the assistant director of human performance at the Home Affairs Ministry’s Office of the Chief Science and Technology Officer.\n“From a human perspective, we kind of understand what aggression is. So there’s motion … it’s chaotic, it has a high number of interaction points. So we try to translate that into what we think a computer should understand,” he said.\nAvatar is being tested in one prison cell, and it was reported in June that it has detected actual fights.\xa0 But there have also been false positives.\n“That’s one of the challenges that we see. So, for example, if an inmate’s doing jumping jacks in the cell, we see that being classified as … an act of aggression,” said Mr Lee.\n“What we can do is to take all these false positives and feed them back to the system, and teach it to recognise that these aren’t real acts of aggression.”\nVideos of fights are also fed into the system, and brawls are simulated, “to continually train the system to become more and more intelligent” and to test its accuracy.\n“We’re still in the process of fine-tuning the algorithm,” added Mr Lee, who admitted that there are still times when the computer does not pick up acts of aggression.\nWhen it is “accurate enough”, it will be put into full operation, said DSP 2 Neo, who highlighted that it will serve the SPS’ mission to ensure the “secure custody of the inmates” – besides rehabilitating them – “for a safer Singapore”.\nWatch the Why It Matters episode on facial recognition technology here.

      Commentary: The common, rare and weird reasons why people install smart home technology
  </h1>, 'text': 'MELBOURNE: Ever wondered what all the fuss is about when it comes to smart homes? You’re not alone.\nWhile the idea of networked entertainment systems, automated security, mood lights and voice-controlled thermostats is popular, the uptake of smart home technologies has been lower than anticipated.\nSome researchers say this is because of affordability and installation challenges. Others claim it’s because smart home technologies aren’t that desirable or useful.\nNew research we’ve released today identifies the benefits and problems smart home adopters actually experience, and compares them to the technological solutions on offer.\xa0\nOur report shows that while living in a smart home is appealing for early adopters, it also throws up some unexpected challenges.\nTHE 3PS\nThe smart home market is growing rapidly, but the industry is still frequently dubbed a “solution in search of a problem”.\xa0\nInterest in smart home technologies can be dismissed as “boys and their toys” because men are more often the instigators for bringing smart home technology into the home and managing their operation.\nCurrent US industry sales figures show consumers of smart home devices are slightly more likely to be male (57 per cent), while “smart home obsessives” (those who customise and fine-tune every aspect of their home automation systems beyond standard off-the-shelf offerings) are typically men.\nBut women – especially those 18 to 35 – are increasingly interested in smart home technology.\nIn our visit of over 30 households that were early adopters of smart home technology and interviews of over 40 people for between one and 2.5 hours, we found three primary categories of use:\n1. Security devices to facilitate care and protection\n2. Automated or multitasking tools to improve productivity\n3. Aesthetic and ambience enhancements that provide pleasure.\nWe refer to these as the 3Ps: Protection, productivity and pleasure.\n\n\nPROTECTION\nIn our study, technology users expressed a desire to care for and protect the home and its occupants. Smart cameras installed in the home allowed adults to monitor dependants – children and, increasingly, pets – while they were away.\nThese strategies of protection were also used in the homes of people living with disabilities. Smart technology provided safeguards against potential vulnerabilities by, for example, allowing people to remotely unlock doors for visitors, or monitor the room temperature and health of children with special needs.\nPRODUCTIVITY\nA commonly identified benefit of smart home technologies was their ability to generate “small conveniences” that reduced the physical or mental effort involved in daily tasks. These efficiencies allowed householders to offload the burden of mundane activities.\nAutomated or voice activated lights, heating, doors or blinds became significant and normal parts of everyday life. Householders doubted whether they could live well without these conveniences once they become accustomed to the benefits.\nSmart home technologies also improved productivity through coordination and multitasking. In particular, voice assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home, freed people’s hands to do other tasks, making households feel more productive.\nOne research participant was living with a disability that made small everyday tasks extremely difficult and exhausting. She described productivity as a way of conserving her energy for other tasks, making smart technologies “absolutely brilliant and invaluable” for people with disabilities.\n\n\nPLEASURE\nLiving in a smart home and experimenting with new devices also provided considerable amounts of fun and pleasure. Smart lighting and speakers were a major source of this enjoyment, generating sensory experiences to affect ambience and mood. Automated water features also generated sensory pleasure.\nWe found householders created a relaxing and pleasurable home environment to replicate the experience of going on holiday or living in a resort. Home cinemas, audiovisual systems, pools, and outdoor and indoor entertainment areas were all common pursuits seeking this vacation-style pleasure.\nFor the predominantly male smart home initiators we interviewed, pleasure also came from implementing and “tinkering” with their smart systems. Further enjoyment ensued when sharing these smart devices and experiences, and showing them off to others.\nPITFALLS\nWhile our research showed the potential benefits of smart home technologies, it also revealed a few pitfalls that are likely to limit market growth.\nThose adopting smart home technologies for the care of others are usually confident in their knowledge and skills in setting up new technology, but expressed concern for the security or privacy of other less aware or capable households.\nSomewhat ironically, smart home technologies can undermine productivity by creating extra “digital housekeeping” in the home. This included researching and setting up new devices, updating and synchronising software, fixing problems or glitches, or just tidying up the various cables and technologies required to keep it all running.\xa0\nMost of this extra work was being done by men, but it was also viewed as a pleasurable hobby.\nThe further downside of smart home technology is that potential new and enhanced forms of entertainment and ambience increase household energy consumption. This has a cost to both the household\xa0and planetary resources as a whole.\nFinally, many\xa0want to integrate smart technologies into their home to increase its value and desirability to others. While this is easy for homeowners, the ability of renters to make changes to the home are very restricted.\nYolande Strengers is senior research fellow and Larissa Nicholls is research fellow, both at the Centre for Urban Research at RMIT.

      Commentary: Technology makes surgical care a reality in distant lands
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Every 3 minutes, a child somewhere is born with a cleft lip or palate, a fairly common condition affecting 1 in every 500 to 750 newborn infants.\nIf left untreated, children with cleft conditions can suffer from difficulties in feeding, malnutrition, frequent ear infections leading to hearing loss, speech impairment, social isolation and bullying.\nThey face higher mortality rates due to higher risk of infections. Their family members are also burdened with the extra care that a child with the condition would require.\nIn the developed world, cleft lip is an easily treatable condition requiring only a 45-minute surgery, of which the cost is typically covered by insurance. The relatively affordable and easily accessible procedure means that most affected infants would have undergone this simple surgery during early childhood.\nThe reality however is starkly different in lower-income, rural communities in developing countries, where safe surgery is not an option due to the lack of proper medical facilities, a dearth of qualified medical professionals and limited financial resources.\nAccording to the World Bank, 5 billion people or two-thirds of the global population lack access to safe and affordable surgical care, and only 6 per cent of surgeries performed worldwide every year reach the poorest third of the global population.\nThat means there are hundreds of thousands of untreated cleft lip patients out there who are bereft of the ability to express a basic human emotion with a smile. As we commemorate World Smile Day on Friday (Oct 5), most of us do not realise that for some, smiles do not come easily, in a literal sense of the word.\nHARNESSING TECHNOLOGY FOR HOPE\nAt Operation Smile, we hope to bridge this gap, one smile at a time. Since 1982, we have been making inroads by extending medical missions to remote corners of the world, performing pro bono cleft lip reconstructive surgery for 270,000 children in villages and rural communities.\nIf you do the math, our work is far from done as there remain many more children out there who need surgical services. To this end, advancements in technology hold plenty of promise in amplifying our reach on a scale like never before.\nHowever, technology is no silver bullet that we can easily load into our armoury as we tackle the barriers to universal healthcare.\nWhile the possibilities of telemedicine are exciting, we cannot unleash the full potential without widespread internet connectivity, and many of our patients and volunteers live beyond the proverbial last mile of a reliable internet connection.\nThis means that deploying telemedicine must take on a creative and comprehensive approach in considering how to connect the disconnected to medical care. This includes public-private partnerships with companies, private and state-run telecommunications providers and government agencies who share a common vision.\nHOPE IN A FULLY CONNECTED FUTURE\nAlthough we cannot possibly connect to all patients in every remote village until the entirety of the globe is connected via internet, we can narrow the gap and explore avenues to bring post-surgery care closer to them.\nTogether with unified communications solutions provider Polycom, we are conducting a pilot programme in Morocco where post-surgery speech therapy and check-ups will be conducted remotely via video-conferencing.\nInstead of travelling miles to a major capital in order to gain access to care from specialists, patients from rural areas can travel to an Operation Smile centre nearest them, alleviating the financial burden imposed on patients and their families for long-distance travel.\nThe technology also allows us to train local medical officers or medical volunteers who are closer to the patients and collaborate on crucial activities such as mission planning and execution, impact analysis, quality assurance, medical oversight and even fundraising strategies.\nThis streamlines the mission planning process, bring about copious time and cost efficiencies and widens access to ancillary health services such as child life psychology and nutritional counselling.\xa0\nIt also enables us to connect with supporters in real time. While the before and after photos offer visually compelling reminders of the impact of the surgeries we provide, there is magic in directly experiencing it by meeting patients and their families.\nRecently, we used video conferencing technology to “transport” several hundred supporters and prospective donors at a fundraising event in New York to our centre in Bogota, Colombia where they were able to meet an infant patient, his anxious parents and the surgeon volunteer who would that evening heal their child. This simply is not possible without high quality video.\xa0\xa0\nWe are also exploring using this same technology to connect surgical experts with unique expertise to operating rooms worldwide, especially for complex cases that may require their input, but logistics do not allow them to be physically there.\nIn addition to unified communications technology, we are experimenting with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence by leveraging facial recognition and modelling to streamline facial symmetry analysis for post-surgery evaluation.\nPilots are also underway in the Philippines, Brazil and Ghana to use mobile apps for locating and recruiting patients.\nAll these paves the way for future scale in bringing essential treatment to more beneficiaries.\xa0\nTechnology, we believe, can provide that unique force multiplier that when combined with a dedicated and passionate medical volunteer workforce, will enable us to reach even more patients, bringing additional life changing surgery to tens of thousands of patients in the next five years.\nFACING THE FUTURE WITH A SMILE\nNo one should have to live with the burden of an untreated cleft lip or cleft palate. A simple procedure to repair the cleft can lead to huge improvements in the child’s quality of life and future development.\nAnd the benefits go beyond the individual – not only do treated patients experience higher lifetime individual income, they in turn are able to contribute actively to the economy.\nOne more smile won’t change the world, but World Smile Day’s vision to encourage individual acts of kindness can make it a better place.\nLikewise, technology will not end all the world’s healthcare problems tomorrow but deploying it in small and effective ways can narrow the access gap and bring us one step closer to achieving universal healthcare.\nChris Bryant is Senior Vice President, Enterprise Applications and Technology and Viet Nguyen, Vice President for Development, Asia Pacific, both from Operation Smile, a non-profit organisation that provides free surgeries for children and young adults with facial and dental deformities.\n', 'related_topics': ['     healthcare ', '     video ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Seven habits of highly secure digital natives
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When it comes to cybersecurity, humans are the weakest link.\xa0Attackers often leverage on this weakness to gain access to sensitive data, carry out scams and perform fraud.\nLiving in Singapore, with our low crime, effective security and strong legal system, people are often fooled into thinking the same of the internet world. Or they adopt the “who would target me?” syndrome. But, the connected digital world means anonymous attackers can target anyone in the world.\nWhile the recent Singhealth breach made people aware of cybersecurity attacks, most still view cybersecurity as an organisational or state issue – not an individual one.\xa0\nHowever, cybersecurity is a personal issue. The cyber safety of organisations and a nation depends on individuals staying safe.\nAttackers will continue to create new forms of attack, which exploit new vulnerabilities. In the past, we feared the IloveYou virus, Conficker worm and Wannacry ransomware.\xa0\nCrypto-jacking malware (which is the unauthorised use of someone else’s computer to mine cryptocurrency) have made headlines today. There will surely be new ones next year.\nSo what is the best way to stay safe? In today’s digital era, just about every aspect of our lives – from paying for food, to taking transport or connecting with friends – are somehow connected to the digital world.\nA personal cyberattack is no longer a minor inconvenience, but something that could compromise your daily lifestyle. Fortunately, there are habits that you can cultivate to protect your digital lifestyle.\n\n\nThe first set of habits is to get your house in order. Your “house” refers to your computers and mobile devices.\nHABIT #1: UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS IMMEDIATELY\nTurn on automatic updates and whenever you see a pop up, telling you to update, save what you are doing, run the update immediately and go for a break.\nThere are no perfect systems and software, as security researchers and attackers find vulnerabilities on a daily basis. But too many people put off system updates for another time, which exposes themselves to potential attackers.\n\n\nHABIT #2: ALWAYS INSTALL AN ANTI-VIRUS \nWhenever you get a new computer or devices, download and install anti-virus as your first software if they are not pre-installed. This applies to Microsoft PCs, Macs and Android devices.\nAnti-virus prices are much cheaper these days with lots of good choices and bundle options. It’s a small investment compared to the price of your devices and the value of your personal information in these devices.\nOnce your house is in order, the next two habits safeguard the “keys” to your house – the passwords.\nHABIT #3: USE LONG PASSWORDS\nPasswords are meant to be secret, something only you know and are hard for others to find out. So avoid using easy-to-guess passwords like “123456”, common words from the dictionary or your personal information, like your date of birth. Good passwords are long and something only you can remember.\nOne recommendation is to use three words related to a special memory. For example, “bedokrainingdurian” would be easy for you to remember, if you tasted the best durian at Bedok on a rainy day.\n\n\nHABIT #4: DON’T REUSE PASSWORDS\nJust as we don’t share a secret with everyone, don’t reuse your password for different applications. This protects you against the scenario where attackers steal your login password from one website in a data breach, and subsequently use the collected data to login to other websites.\nFamous data breaches where user login credentials are stolen include Yahoo!, Adobe and LinkedIn. You can check online if your email address has been compromised in a data breach.\xa0\nAnd finally, you need to watch who is going in and out of your house. The remaining habits focus on cultivating safe web habits to keep away from unsavoury characters.\nHABIT #5: WHEN NOT EXPECTED, DON’T CLICK\nThe most common way attackers target their victim is through sending phishing emails or messages. These are fraudulent attempts by attackers pretending to be someone else in an attempt to bait you to click links and download malicious software on your devices.\nIf you have not ordered a TV and a delivery man turns up with one, most people will be suspicious. Likewise, if you get an unexpected email address to a generic “dear sir/mdm”, the sender’s email address does not look right and he is asking you to click on links, don’t click. Don’t let them into your house.\nHABIT #6: WATCH WHERE YOU SURF\nWhen you visit a foreign country, good safety habits include staying on the main street, avoiding the alleys and dodgy establishments, and sticking with safe food choices. The same applies when surfing the web.\nOnly download software from official app stores by Microsoft, Google and Apple or legitimate sites. If you are unsure if it’s a legitimate site, Google the topic and legitimate sites will appear top.\nMost legitimate sites will have HTTPS enabled (green padlock on browser bar) and the site will look professionally-built. If the site looks like a dodgy establishment, avoid it.\nBe\xa0suspicious of sites with lots of pop-ups asking you to download and “Buy Now”. If a website tells you that you are infected with virus, don’t believe them.\xa0\nTurn on safe browsing features on your web browser, which will warn you of fraudulent or unsafe sites.\nHABIT #7: KEEP YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT SMALL\nVisiting social media platforms leaves behind your digital footprints. Whenever you share on social media, these digital footprints tell others who you are, where you are, how you can be contacted, whom you know and what you are doing.\nAttackers collect your digital footprint to be more effective in their attack against you or the people you know. For example, a fraudster may use your children’s names, and their known whereabouts to conduct a scam against you.\nNowadays, people often share information on relationships, location data and contact numbers freely on social media sites.\xa0\nUnderstand the settings on social media sites and make a conscious decision on who can see your posts – whether it’s your friends, your friends’ friends or the public. Keep your digital footprint as small as possible.\nFor those that want to stay safe online, get your house in order, safeguard the keys, and be careful of who you invite in.\nNg Pan Yong is founder of The Cyber Assembly, a cybersecurity startup that provides active learning platforms to help organisations and individuals connect to cyber skills. \n', 'related_topics': ['     cybersecurity ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: When should children be allowed to have their own mobile phones?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Recent news about the French issuing a nationwide ban on mobile phone use in schools created a slight uproar, with ripples reaching here in Singapore where it is not uncommon to see children as young as those in Primary 1 brandishing their own mobile phones.\nWe all know the pros and cons of having a phone – the convenience of being able to contact your children versus the danger of falling into different forms of cyber addiction. So how do we balance these out?\nHow should we be making our decisions as to whether or not to give our kids a phone, when to give it, and how to control it?\nIS THERE EVER A GOOD AGE?\nIs age a good gauge for when to give a child a phone?\xa0\nChildren develop and mature at their own individual pace. While my daughter may be emotionally and mentally ready to bear the responsibility for an expensive item like a phone by a certain age, I may not be able to say the same for her younger brothers, who may need a couple more years to catch up to a similar level of maturity.\xa0\nSome people would say it’s not wise for a child in lower primary to carry a phone as they may misplace it. My own son who started Primary 1 this year has already lost an umbrella, a water bottle and a wallet (although this was later retrieved), so I cannot yet fathom placing a mobile phone in his care at this stage.\nThere is also no need for him to have one as I pick him from school every day. However, some kids start to travel home alone at an early age, so it’s understandable that their parents would prefer for them to hold on to a phone so they can contact them if there is an emergency.\n\n\nSo individual needs have to be considered too – or the whys of having a phone.\nHowever, we have to bear in mind that the younger the child’s age, the more controls need to be set in place.\nSETTING THE STAGE FOR RESPONSIBLE USE \nMaybe the question shouldn’t be when or why to give your child a phone, but how?\nIf you haven’t set clear boundaries about technology use or had conversations about it with your child, then passing junior a phone is likely to be premature.\nGiving a child a phone without prior training is like putting him on a table with 10 marshmallows, telling him not to eat them, and then leaving the room. It doesn’t take much to know what’ll happen next.\nI’m referring to the Stanford marshmallow experiment of course, which is a series of studies on delayed gratification. Its findings suggest that children who are able to delay their gratification in order to receive an even better reward – two marshmallows instead of one – go on to do better in life.\nSeeing that the phone is about as tempting for little fingers as a fluffy white marshmallow, what we want to do with children is this: Before letting them loose with the phone, educate them on the benefits of having one, and provide some handles on how to manage potential pitfalls such as addictive behaviour\xa0and frequent notifications.\nIt is this process of equipping them with the necessary skills to master technology that will enable them not to be enslaved to it in the future.\n\n\nWe often underestimate the temptation\xa0that come in this 5"" by 3"" gadget. Even adults get hooked on phones and our time and energy often get sucked away as we scroll mindlessly through apps and websites. So what more for children?\nA friend gave her daughter her own phone when she began using public transport at Primary 6.\xa0\nAbout a year before that, she had started to actively introduce her to various apps, while taking care to mention the ways she manages phone distractions whenever she’s working. She also allowed her daughter to use her phone’s Whatsapp for school-related group chats.\nIn other words, she has been setting the stage for responsible use, using her own media habits as a model for her daughter.\nThere are also other controls we can put in place – such as setting a phone curfew so that the gadgets can be “retired” for the day and recharged, limiting time spent on games, and restricting social media use until the child is of a certain age and maturity.\nEXAMINING OUR OWN VALUES \nWhat do we value as a family? What are our own digital habits?\nAsking such questions can help us set the tone for how technology is used in our homes.\nIf we value relationships, we will take pains to lay gadgets aside before any social gathering.\nIf we value family time, we will establish some tech-free zones and times in the house, so that we can catch up properly at least once or twice a week.\nIf respect for elders is a big thing in our households, then we would encourage our young to interact with their seniors rather than stare at their screens the moment they step into grandma’s house.\nOur values determine to some extent the way we (and our offspring) interact with technology.\nOnce set, these habits can be hard to change, so it makes sense to think about them early when our children are still open to instruction.\xa0It is a conversation that we need to keep going, not just at the point of handing our children a phone.\xa0\nAnd as our kids grow, the rules and routines may evolve with time, but the values behind them usually don’t change. \xa0\nJUST ANOTHER SKILL ON THE LIST?\nAs parents, we are responsible for teaching our children multiple skills, from life skills such as learning how to button a shirt, to literacy and social skills.\nToday, we also need to teach technology skills, not so much the technicalities of how to work a phone, but rather wise and responsible usage.\nJust like how we teach a child to ride a bicycle, we start with the basics and set some ground rules to ensure safety.\nPerhaps we should give provisional licences to our kids when they start having their own phones, or do up a family tech-time contract together. It will remind us to maintain strict controls and close supervision, while also watching our own behaviour.\nThe more our children can prove that they are able to handle the distractions and temptations that come with phone ownership, the more trust we can offer in return.\nTechnology, minus the skills and maturity to handle it, can be dangerous. But if we give our kids the skills to manage technology, we can be more confident in handing over a phone too – with a P-plate on it.\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of\xa0Mama Wear Papa Shirt,\xa0a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     technology ', '     children ']}"

      Food services industry needs to be smart about embracing technology: Chee Hong Tat
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Imagine going to a restaurant for a meal, but instead of a waiter, a robot takes your order, gives you recommendations, serves your food, and collects your payment.\xa0\nThis may well become a reality in the future of Singapore’s food services industry.\xa0\nSenior Minister of State for Education and Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat said on Friday (Aug 31) there is ""no other alternative""\xa0for the food services industry except to embrace technology to survive, and added\xa0they also have to be smart about doing so.\nHe was speaking at the Food Services Transformation Conference, held at the Asian Culinary Institute.\xa0\nThe event is aimed at\xa0encouraging\xa0food businesses\xa0to\xa0adopt technology and digitalisation as a key means to meet the challenges of manpower constraints and rising costs within the sector.\nMr Chee said the appropriate use of technology can help improve various processes in food services, ranging from customer relations to inventory and procurement processes.\nHowever, he also warned of the pitfalls of chasing technology blindly, citing a personal experience he had at\xa0a bak\xa0kut teh restaurant that used e-menus via tablets.\xa0\n“When a tablet was not working, either because the system hanged or someone accidentally spilt soup on it, customers could not sit at that table because there was no alternative channel to order their food,” Mr Chee said.\n“Like all tools, we need to apply technology smartly to support new business models and process re-engineering. The objective is not to chase technology as an end in itself.”\nHe also gave a positive example of Creative Eateries, a company which\xa0has implemented a digital internal system to facilitate\xa0the ordering of ingredients such as sauces, soups and par-cooked meat from the central kitchen.\xa0\nThis allows the company to better predict production levels and tap on live information on inventory levels, which has led to better management of product shelf-life and lower storage costs.\nThe push for greater technology adoption comes as food services remain\xa0a key part of Singapore’s economy.\xa0\nIn 2016, the sector contributed almost S$9 billion in operating receipts and contributed over 180,000 jobs.\nA number of upcoming technology trends relevant to the F&B industry were also showcased as part of the conference. This includes the Kawada robot, which can take customers’ food orders.\xa0\nThe robot\'s programme software was developed by a team from Nanyang Polytechnic’s (NYP) School of Engineering, with the long-term\xa0goal for it to be used in real-world restaurants.\xa0\nNYP is also working with China tech firm IIM on a facial recognition service robot\xa0that is able to give customer food recommendations based on certain aspects of a person\'s\xa0profile such as age and gender.\xa0\nOther restaurant-related technology include\xa0a cashless self-service payment kiosk, as well as Dining Butler, which is a mobile ordering solution for\xa0customers to place their food orders directly on their own devices.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

      Strong pool of engineering talent key for Smart Nation push: Vivian Balakrishnan
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Nine recipients were awarded the inaugural Smart Nation Scholarship on Friday (Aug 17).\nThe scholarship was launched in March this year to develop and nurture a pool of next-generation leaders who will spearhead the national digital transformation.\nIt is jointly offered by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Government Technology Agency (GovTech), and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).\n“We will invest in our long-term engineering capabilities, to ensure that we have a core group of passionate innovators to lead and drive technology change, both within the civil service and across the private sector,” said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative.\nHe pointed out that the Government had outsourced much of its software development services to other countries a decade ago, but that has since changed.\nDr Balakrishnan added that attracting and retaining local talent was necessary as global competition for talent has never been stronger.\nThe Smart Nation Scholarship recipients were selected through a rigorous assessment process comprising aptitude tests, management interviews, and agency-specific assessments.\nThey will pursue undergraduate studies in information and communications technology (ICT)-related disciplines such as computer science, information security and mathematics at local and overseas universities.\nWOMEN IN TECH\nMs Ong Jing Yin is one of two women awarded the scholarship. Noting that the industry is conventionally male-dominated, she revealed that people are usually surprised to find out her area of study.\n“Most people would say: ‘Why would a female join this field? Isn’t it for guys?’. But I would like to correct this stereotype because after studying\xa0computer science and learning more about it, women can be equally capable and contribute to this field too.""\nShe added that as cybersecurity becomes increasingly important, the ratio between men and women in her computer science course has improved.\nMs Ong - who won the bronze award in the Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp Competition last year - become cognizant of the immeasurable threats associated with hacking during the contest when her team’s assets were hijacked and used to infect all the other participants’ without their knowledge.\n“What if the hack was not just on my team, but a greater scale like an attack on Singapore? Many people could lose money, industries could be impacted,” she said.\xa0\nANSWERING A CYBER CALLING\nLess than stellar grades in secondary school derailed Mr Alan Low’s plans to go to a Junior College.\xa0\nNoting his natural inclination towards technical subjects, his secondary school teacher advised Mr Low to consider the polytechnic route.\n""In a way you could say this was a silver lining, because given that I had a very strong passion in IT, why not take a career in IT? This is the time where cybersecurity is the \'in\'\xa0thing, with all the recent cyberattacks,"" he said.\nSo Mr Low joined the information security diploma in Republic Polytechnic (RP), where he excelled and was on the RP Director’s Roll of Honours every year.\nHe will enrol in NUS’s Information Security course and intends to pursue a career with the CSA.\nWhile data science, artificial intelligence and software development count among the hottest skills today, Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that a strong cyber ecosystem needs to be fortified with lawyers and scientists as well.\nUnlike the rest of his peers, Mr Marcus Ho\xa0chose\xa0an unconventional path under the Smart Nation scholarship.\nHe will read law at Cambridge, instead of pursuing an ICT-related degree. His choice of study comes after being inspired during his internship at Rajah & Tann.\nBut Mr Ho admits that tech is still his first love.\n""Growing up, tech was one of my passions. This has driven me to a critical intersection where I’d like to engage in a very niche area related to technology law and regulations,” he said.\nHe will join IMDA after graduation, where he hopes to use his skills to tackle legislation issues and craft public policies.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Smart Nation ', '     technology ', '     education ']}"

      Samsung launches new smart speaker and watch, partners with Spotify
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s a scenario that sounds perfect for music lovers. Imagine listening to a Spotify playlist on your smartphone on the way home from work, then stepping inside to find the next track playing on the smart TV in the living room – and all the way to a smart speaker in the kitchen as you cook dinner.\nAt the Samsung Unpacked event in New York on Thursday (Aug 9), the South Korean tech giant announced a new long-term partnership with Spotify to create a seamless listening experience across Samsung devices through its SmartThings app.\nSpotify CEO Daniel Ek, who dropped by the event, said: “We think music should be easy to access on all the devices. We have designed Spotify to deliver personalised music to consumers around the world, where they are on as many devices as possible.” This ranges from smartphones to TVs to speakers, watches and even refrigerators, he said.\nDescribing Spotify as Samsung’s “go-to music partner for our multi-device ecosystem”, product manager Drew Blackard said: “The music follows me everywhere I go (in) one seamless interaction”.\nThe partnership was one of a handful of announcements on a day where the spotlight was primarily on the new Galaxy Note 9 smartphone. Samsung also announced its new Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Home speaker.\nThe latter, which looks like a small vase on three legs, is seen as Samsung’s response to the likes of Google’s Home, Apple’s HomePod and Amazon’s Echo devices. It will be supported by its own smart assistant, Bixby, which responds to requests ranging from playing music to any other number of tasks, similar to what it already does on Samsung phones.\nGalaxy Home will have full-range speakers, and among its features is Harman’s Sound Steer technology that can detect where you are in a room and shift the sound in your direction. More details will be shared at a later date, said Ji Soo Yi, Samsung’s VP of AI Strategy.\nSamsung also announced its new line of smartwatches. The Galaxy Watch, a name which also looks to be a shift from its previous Gear branding to its Galaxy line of products, comes in a 46mm silver version and a 42mm midnight black and rose gold versions.\nIt boasts of improved battery life of up to 80 hours. Among its features are a stress management tracker that offers breathing exercises to users when it detects high levels of stress, and a new sleep tracker to monitor one’s levels of sleep. It also offers a total of 39 workouts that allow a variety of options that users can customise for their respective routines.\nThe watch will be available in the US and Korea this month, and in select markets in September.\nCNA Lifestyle was in New York at the invitation of Samsung.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Once the Pearl of the Orient, Hong Kong poised to regain its shine
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Hong Kong holds one of the highest concentrations of banks and financial institutions worldwide.\nWhile it houses around 70 of the top 100 global banks, this global financial centre is viewed by some industry observers to be losing its shine.\nDespite its position as one of only two special administrative region of\xa0China, the world’s second largest economy, Hong Kong fell behind Singapore to fourth place in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) in 2016.\nIndeed, Hong Kong’s banking sector has faced strong headwinds in recent years, with Moody's Investors Service downgrading it\xa0in 2016 and for the most part of 2017, citing material imbalances in the city’s economy weighing down banks’ credit profiles.\nKey factors such as rising corporate and household debt and inflated property prices were said to pose latent risks to its operating environment.\nBut Hong Kong managed to get back on track with a strong growth momentum against a backdrop of sustained economic expansion during a critical 6-month period wrapping up the year. This not only saw Moody's lifting its outlook to positive in December 2017, but also restoring Hong Kong’s GFCI ranking back to third place.\nLOOKING TO TECHNOLOGY\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam signaled back in October 2017 in her first policy address since taking office, that technology and innovation would be key growth drivers for the city’s “too traditional” economy.\nThe city plans to increase spending on research and development by nearly two-fold to 1.5 per cent of its GDP, and has acknowledged the urgent need to charge up new engines of growth. HK$700million (US$89 million) has been allocated to transform the global financial centre into a smart city.\nOn the back of economic recovery, there is plenty of room for Hong Kong to make headway in the innovation and technology race. There are more opportunities for banks to take on a central role to finance the city’s growth, afforded by growing interest in the Belt and Road Initiative and integration of the city into the development of the Greater Bay Area.\nGiven Hong Kong’s proximity to China, it should be occupying a leadership position on the digital money front, a global driver of inclusive growth identified by experts. Afterall, it was among the region’s pioneers of digital wallets with the launch of the Octopus card in 1997.\nBut Hong Kong continues to struggle to keep pace with FinTech, compared with other markets. Some industry observers argue that Hong Kong’s past success has led to a complacency towards innovation; while others observe that it did not manage to keep pace with other FinTech hubs in this region, thus losing its competitive advantage.\nRAMPING UP PACE OF INNOVATION \nHowever, the pace of innovation in Hong Kong’s banking sector has ramped up. Global consultancy firm KPMG has said that 2018 will be the year “where FinTech goes mainstream in Hong Kong”.\nAs part of a series of initiatives to boost the banking sector, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\xa0recently announced it would issue licenses to virtual banks this year.\nThese virtual banks have no physical presence (except in fulfilling regulatory requirements for at least one physical branch in the city to handle complaints) and would offer banking services primarily through the Internet or other digital channels, as opposed to traditional banks offering digital services.\nThe move is in line with similar initiatives in other advanced economies, including Britain and Australia, which are opening their ecosystems to digital banks in a bid to raise the competitiveness of their respective banking sectors.\nHong Kong’s lacklustre banking sector could benefit from intensifying competition with the arrival of new entrants in the form of virtual banks.\nBy offering lower cost options, greater visibility and control as well as direct convenience for today’s digital-savvy banking customers, virtual banks are giving established banks in Hong Kong a run for their money. Traditional banks are forced to play catch-up to attract or retain customers.\xa0\nAt the same time, virtual banks are also subjected to the same stringent capital requirements as traditional banks. They will need to have at least HK$300million in capital, similar to conventional banks, and cannot implement a minimum balance requirement. They must also join the deposit protection scheme, which offers depositors compensation of up to HK$500,000, to minimise risks for customers.\nBy expanding its traditional banking ecosystem to include digital players, Hong Kong’s role of facilitating capital flows and investment growth as a global wealth and investment hub may be strengthened.\nWINNING BACK HONG KONG’S CUSTOMERS \nBanking customers in the global financial centre now have access to more information about banking services from a wider range of channels such as social media and are in a stronger position to make an informed decision which better reflects their needs.\xa0\xa0\nNearly one-third of customers in Hong Kong are contemplating switching out their main bank for better customer experience, according to data from the JD Power 2018 Hong Kong Retail Banking Satisfaction Study.\nThis is considerably higher than Singapore (18 per cent) and Australia (16 per cent), placing the city’s banks in a more precarious position for client retention than others.\nMore than half (57 per cent) of respondents have expressed their readiness to embrace virtual banking with their main financial institution, despite the current shortfall in digital user experience, with technology and security glitches. 71 per cent of respondents also said they have used online banking to interact with their main bank.\nHONG KONG’S BANKING SCENE SET TO CHANGE\nAll is set to change with the imminent entry of Hong Kong’s first virtual banks into the ecosystem dominated by traditional tech giants and current banking leaders. With over 50 companies (including established players such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of China) having expressed their interest in applying for virtual banking licenses, this new regulation will be a major game changer for Hong Kong.\nThe successful growth of virtual banks may eventually contribute significantly to the long-term success of Hong Kong’s banking sector by boosting competitiveness and elevating the customer experience.\nWith the wider adoption of FinTech, the Pearl of the Orient may outshine other global financial centres once again.\nAnthony Chiam is J D Power’s Regional Head of Financial Services.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Hong Kong ', '     technology ']}"

      Young Cambodian women on green mission to build roads with plastic waste
  </h1>, 'text': 'PHNOM PENH: The Cambodian capital Phnom Penh was once fondly known\xa0as\xa0the ""Pearl of Asia”, with\xa0pretty post-colonial Khmer architecture, immaculate parks and tree-lined avenues. Today, it is a\xa0city of garbage, where mountains of\xa0rubbish\xa0engulf acres of\xa0landfills and grimy streets reek of waste and decay.\nBut one day, it\xa0could see new roads built with trash if\xa0the Ministry of Public Works and Transport takes up the suggestion\xa0of two Cambodian female students - Sokanha Ly and Bunhourng Tan\xa0- whose green creation could turn plastic waste into cheaper and\xa0better roadways.\nThe pair are graduates\xa0from Harpswell, a Phnom Penh-based foundation that teaches\xa0young Cambodian women to be leaders through\xa0debates and civic engagement in English and French. In 2016, they\xa0co-founded a start-up called\xa0Eco-Plastic to\xa0transform trash into roads.\nWorried about Cambodia\'s waste problem,\xa0the young entrepreneurs spent years researching how they could\xa0turn ""plastic hell"" into a green product.\xa0\nTheir endeavour has led to the creation of PAC - Plastic Asphalt Concrete - a combination of plastic scraps\xa0and bitumen, which is a\xa0black mixture\xa0of\xa0hydrocarbons\xa0used\xa0for\xa0road surfacing.\xa0The difference between PAC and traditional asphalt concrete is that the former costs less and produces stronger, more durable roads.\nCAMBODIA: THE KINGDOM OF PLASTIC\nThe female duo’s green creation owes its birth to\xa0plastic waste that is fast engulfing their country. Data from the Environment Ministry showed Cambodia produces more than 4,000 tonnes of waste on a daily basis.\xa0Its capital alone\xa0generates more than 2,000 tonnes of waste each day,\xa017 per cent of which is plastic.\n“We’re extremely worried,"" said Dy Kiden,\xa0director of the ministry’s Solid Waste Department. ""Our landfills are not up to standard; they’re open-air facilities. So, people living nearby suffer from the smell and flies.”\nSolid waste from more than 1.5 million residents in Phnom Penh ends up at\xa0two landfills – one in Dangkao district and the other in Steung Menchey, which is already full. In Dangkao, the facility spans 310,000 sq m and is designed for 25-year operation. Today, nine years into the service, it is close to reaching full\xa0capacity.\n“If we don’t cut down on waste or reprocess it more, the impact will be huge,” Kiden told Channel NewsAsia, adding the high cost of reprocessing plants often discourages investors from the green business and that trash collection for exports remains a “competitive” industry in Cambodia.\nAs the nation grows more urbanised, plastic waste continues to amass at its landfills. In Phnom Penh, some 10 million plastic bags are consumed every day, based on a\xa0study by sustainable development foundation ACRA. Each year, the foundation estimated, an average urban Cambodian uses more than 2,000 plastic bags - ten times higher the amount in China and countries in the European Union.\nThe situation is similar in other urban areas such as Siem Reap,\xa0home to UNESCO World Heritage Site Angkor Wat which attracted more than 2 million visitors last year. According to the Environment Ministry, more than 20 per cent of its waste comes from plastic. The number is even higher – 34 per cent – in the popular coastal resort of Sihanoukville, where plastic bags and bottles pollute its beaches and sea.\nTo reduce plastic waste, the Cambodian government has recently banned the production, distribution and imports of plastic bags smaller than 25 cm in width and thinner than 0.03 cm. Supermarkets and shopping centres are also required to charge customers for plastic bags at checkout tills.\nThe government aims to cut the use of plastic by half within 2019 and by 70 per cent in the next seven years.\nDRASTIC PLASTIC\nIn their fight against plastic waste, Sokanha and Bunhourng have won recognition from business contests both within Cambodia and beyond.\xa0\nThe pair recently clinched silver at the Mekong Business Challenge in Bhutan, where their Eco-Plastic beat nine entrepreneurial teams from six nations.\xa0In May, they\xa0received an honourable mention at the 2018 International Business Model Competition in Utah, United States, after Eco-Plastic made it into the top ten. The\xa0start-up contest is an annual event joined by thousands of student teams from hundreds of schools worldwide.\n""Our next step is Research and Development (R&D). We\'re exploring new materials to add to PAC to make our product more unique, cost-efficient and well-functioning,"" said 21-year-old\xa0Sokanha, a\xa0civil\xa0engineering student at Zaman University of Cambodia.\xa0\nPlastic waste is not just a Cambodian problem. As of 2015, some 6.3 billion\xa0tonnes of plastic waste had been generated globally, according to a report by researchers from the University of California, University of Georgia, and Woods Hole Institute in Massachusetts, USA.\n""Around 9 per cent of which had been recycled, 12 per cent\xa0was incinerated, and 79 per cent\xa0was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment,"" the report said. If\xa0current production and waste management trends continue, it added, the figure\xa0could\xa0hit 12 billion tonnes by 2050.\xa0\nCompared to the rest of the world, Asia accounts for more than 49 per cent of global plastic production, an industry report by the association of plastic manufacturers\xa0PlasticsEurope showed, with China leading at 28 per cent.\xa0\n\'PLASTIC ROADS\'\nAs countries around the world attempt\xa0to go greener, the concept of building roads with recycled plastic has attracted growing attention.\nIndia has constructed more than 30,000 km of roads with shredded plastic. Last year,\xa0Dutch firm\xa0VolkerWessels\xa0said it plans to use plastic waste in the ocean to build highways in Rotterdam. The idea is being explored in various areas around\xa0the United Kingdom.\nIn Cambodia, the female duo\xa0is working hard to improve their business product and save the environment. Although the Ministry of Public World and Transport has offered\xa0them ""tremendous support""\xa0to build and test their prototypes, they said there\xa0are still challenges, from a lack of local investment opportunities to limited technical expertise and facilities for experiments.\nYet\xa0they see a bright prospect of introducing innovative engineering technology to their homeland and helping the government tackle social problems, not to mention a chance to inspire and empower Cambodian women in\xa0science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\n""Technology can solve almost every social issue as long as we\'re committed, persistent, and passionate about it. Technology can turn fantasy into reality,""\xa0Sokanha said.\n""The key message is \'Never give up and hard work pays off\'.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Cambodia ', '     technology ', '     startup ']}"

      Powerful, cheap and Cambodian: Computer dreams being born in the kingdom
  </h1>, 'text': 'PHNOM PENH: When Thul Rithy first moved to Phnom Penh as a young man he lived in a simple pagoda with monks and exercised his keen thirst for knowledge.\xa0\n“I read a lot of books. I went to a university and in a year I read nearly every book in the library,” he said.\xa0\nThis was back in 2004, a time before smartphones and easy internet access in Cambodia. But Rithy was already starting to understand the depths and possibilities of learning on the Internet.\xa0\n“I would download books and print them. But I could never read all of Wikipedia.”\xa0\nHis eager adoption of technology opened up a career revolving around start-up ecosystems, tinkering with software coding and, more recently, experiments with blockchain technology.\xa0\nHe started SmallWorld, a co-working space and tech incubator for young entrepreneurs in the Cambodian capital in 2011. And now SmallWorld is taking big steps towards a new technological frontier - building its own computers to encourage the next wave of learners, coders and engineers.\nThe concept is to provide a low-cost, high-performance laptop equipped with ready-to-run open source software. Rithy will initially target “students that have maybe never touched a computer before,” but is open to selling to the wider public under his new Koompi brand, which means book of knowledge in Khmer.\xa0\nThe product - to be available for purchase in August - is an aesthetic, compact computer that closely resembles an Apple Macbook Air. Its desktop is a hybrid of Window and Apple software and is designed to be clean and easily accessible for new users.\nOpen source is central to the philosophy of Koompi. Proprietary software, such as Windows or Adobe Creative Suite, is often too expensive for the typical Cambodian, whereas development-focused applications are free.\xa0\nRithy’s computer is loaded up with such free software and in the future he hopes it will be complemented by learning materials, particularly in coding. One of the visions of this project is to ignite more curiosity in young Cambodians to learn computer languages, a potentially key future job skill.\xa0\n“The concept of open source fosters a lot more innovation, a lot more development from the ground up,” he said. “If they’re curious and they want to explore the technology they can go into the source code and figure out how it works, learn how to compile, learn how to re-code, re-engineer the applications or the project.”\xa0\n“If you can speak one or two computer languages you can speak to the world of computers and digital and maybe the universe and space,” he laughed.\nCambodia has largely skipped the PC era - its technological rush of connectivity has come courtesy of smartphones and cheap internet. A 2016 study found that 96 per cent of Cambodians own a mobile phone, about half of which were ‘smart’. In comparison, only 13 per cent of people surveyed owned a computer.\n\xa0Cambodia’s youth has proven fast at adapting to available new technology, but Rithy wants to accelerate their passion and open up alternative paths to learning, outside of the country’s rickety traditional education system.\n\xa0“Technology is taking over the world by a tsunami, a technology wave. Kids are like white paper. They can learn anything,” he said.\n\xa0“Education systems in the past don’t open enough for the curiosities of the user. The world will go dark and scary if they cannot adapt.\nThe initial roll-out of 500 computers will cost US$369 each, placing them at the cheaper end of the local market. SmallWorld has also teamed up with microfinance institutions and will absorb any interest costs accrued by students investing in a laptop.\xa0\n“The idea of making a lot of money is not the goal. Bringing something of value to the community is our goal,” he said.\xa0\nWithin three years or so, Rithy hopes to have sold half a million units in the Cambodian market. By 2020 he also wants the computers assembled in a local hardware manufacturing industry, which does not yet exist at all in the country.\xa0\n“It’s a big challenge. Cambodia is going that way but how long will it take? We don’t know. But hopefully we can ignite the first wave,” he said.\xa0\nIt is a brave decision to invest a future in what some consider a peripheral technology, particularly in developing countries. Rithy disagrees.\xa0\nHe has eyes on regional expansion too in the coming years- namely markets in Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Myanmar where computers are also hard to access for ordinary people but huge potential exists to build a powerhouse technology industry. He has a target of reaching 4.5 million new computer users by 2021.\xa0\nIt is a massive task for a team of five people in Cambodia with no patented hardware or software.\nBut contrary to the feeling of being a small, isolated outfit, Rithy’s commitment to open source gives SmallWorld access to tens of millions of developers around the world who are constantly uploading and tinkering with new projects.\nNothing SmallWorld is doing or making is original. But in this age of appropriated innovation, it does not really matter.\n\xa0“We consider ourselves chefs. Chefs invent new types of food but they don’t invent the ingredients. You take the ingredients, put it together and make delicious food,” he said.\n“People will think we’re crazy and that it’s impossible. It’s good to play a game of impossibility.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Cambodia ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Singapore shows data can be a force for good
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore topped the 2017 Global Smart City Performance Index, a study of smart city initiatives for residents in 20 cities including San Francisco, Seoul, London and New York.\xa0\nIt measured how technology improved the quality of life across four areas namely mobility, health, safety and productivity.\nTechnology has permeated almost every facet of Singaporeans’ daily life.\n“I think people don’t realise that 80 per cent of what a smart city offers … is not going to be anything that looks like an interface,” said Jacqueline Poh, chief executive of the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).\nMs Poh also\xa0explained in a Channel NewsAsia programme that in its ideal form, a smart city delivers value to its citizens in subtle and intuitive ways “because they are so embedded within the fabric of society” – one that is fueled by data ubiquity.\nDATA IS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR SMART NATION \nSingapore has done well in sharing, interpreting and acting on both new and existing data.\nThrough sensors, cameras, receptors installed across the island, connected to a Heterogenous Network that gathers streams of data every day, coupled with a growing community of education institutions that teach data analytics in tertiary school curriculum, and\xa0an open portal that offers anyone access to data sets from over 70 public agencies, Singapore is well on its way to establishing a culture where data literacy is becoming sine qua non.\xa0\nSome of Singapore’s institutions are taking the lead in establishing robust systems for tracking outcomes across their enterprises and drawing useful conclusions about evidence and impact.\nIn 2017, the country’s National Volunteers and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) embarked on using visual analytics to connect and visualise governed data quickly, combine multiple views of data, gain actionable insights and share secured information with key NVPC staff for data-guided decision making on the go.\nOne of several areas where data has already made an impact on NVPC is in donor marketing. By embracing analytics for targeted fund-raising efforts, NVPC managed to yield a significant 56 per cent increase in donation amounts on giving.sg between April 2016 and April 2017.\nNURTURING ATHLETES\nData has also been instrumental in helping to nurture high-performance athletes in Singapore’s bid to become a sporting nation.\xa0\nThe Singapore Sports Institute (SSI) uses visual analytics to keep tabs on the performances of over 70 of its athletes across different sports including swimming, badminton and table tennis.\nTracking athletes’ diets, sharing data between athletes and coaches and analysing past performances powered by data analytics surely trumps the old practice of manually keying and analysing data on spreadsheets, which comes with a high degree of variation and inaccuracy.\nSimilarly, private education institution PSB Academy announced a partnership with sporting devices company VX Sports this year to train students in its School of Life and Physical Sciences to harness data analytics.\xa0\nThey are able to track the physical conditions of their test subjects, arrive at more precise prognoses, and formulate specific actions that athletes could take to sustain levels of peak performance and benefit more from their training.\nMOVING TOWARDS VISUAL ANALYTICS\nBy moving away from decisions based on opinion and toward decisions based on data, Singapore organisations like these have uncovered new opportunities\xa0to offer invaluable insights to help their stakeholders –\xa0whether budding sports scientists or volunteers – raise their game and become forces for positive social impact.\nOn the global stage, the United Nations recently announced an agreement establishing visual analytics platform Tableau Software, as its business intelligence standard across the United Nations system while simplifying the acquisition of analytics capabilities for all its 193-member states and affiliated entities.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres emphasised the growing importance of data analytics, especially for disaster response and in addressing social development issues, when he said:\nAccurate data is the lifeblood of good policy and decision-making. Obtaining it, and sharing it across hundreds of organisations, in the middle of a humanitarian emergency, is complicated and time‑consuming, but it is absolutely crucial.\nDATA AS A FORCE FOR GOOD\nWhile data has been shown to be a force for good, serious questions have arisen recently about how data can also be manipulated for nefarious ends.\nFacebook, a 2.2 billion user platform, admitted to a breach of trust when the personal data of over 87 million users was illegally used by Cambridge Analytica for purposes of targeted political campaigning.\nIn his book Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari commented presciently three years ago that some governments have not been keeping pace with the changing rules of the digital world.\n""We need to recognise that our current democratic structures\xa0simply cannot collect and process the relevant data fast enough, and most voters don’t understand biology and cybernetics well enough to form any pertinent opinions,"" he said.\nYuval concluded that regulators have thus fallen behind in spite of being able to collect more data than ever. He said:\xa0\nIt’s like a poker player who knows what cards his opponents\xa0hold,\xa0yet somehow still manages to lose round after round.\nWhile Facebook’s massive breach reveals the inadequacy of regulatory frameworks in safeguarding data privacy, what is just as concerning is if there is a lack of interest people have over how their personal data are mined, shared and used by these third parties before this disaster was uncovered.\nOne observer explains: “Likes and preferences are a currency open to be used by Facebook by default. This scandal goes to show how few people realise the tacit agreement in the digital exchange of data for services (let alone read the terms and conditions that enable this transaction).”\nDays after Facebook’s testimony at Singapore’s Parliamentary Select Committee for Deliberate Online Falsehoods (DOFs), we saw a surge of commentators calling for more regulation in how data is being handled by social media platforms.\nBut a strident focus on greater regulation alone presents the broader public with a false dichotomy, that all data should either be left open but vulnerable to exploitation or kept closed but safeguarded.\nA NEW DAY FOR DATA\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nYes, there will always be the need for greater data governance to keep pace with the velocity of data use and production. But I would argue that retreating completely into walled gardens cannot be the way forward.\nIn fact, given how pervasive data already is in virtually every aspect of our lives, we must double-down on our efforts to empower more people to be both interested in their data and in acquiring skillsets to see and understand data for themselves, so that they are able to securely benefit from Singapore’s thriving open data environment.\nWe should recognise that as much as Singapore is already benefiting from the invisible hand of technology, we have also ushered a new day for data.\nWhereas previously data analytics used to be reserved for a band of “high priests” in an enterprise who had to be trained in programing and coding to access, analyse and draw data reports for various lines-of-business, today everyone should be able to see and understand data with the availability of self-service analytics platforms.\nIn spite of the great strides that we have made in Singapore’s Smart Nation movement, there is still much left to do for this same movement to be compelling for everybody else and inspire more people to see data as a force for good.\nMarcus Loh is director, Asia Pacific\xa0Communication\xa0at visual analytics company Tableau Software.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Smart Nation ', '     data ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Facebook’s fake news crisis is a product of Silicon Valley culture
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: All the elements were in place to create the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\nFirst, there’s Facebook’s corporate culture. Facebook chose the name of the street in Silicon Valley where its headquarters are located: “Hacker Way”.\xa0\nWhat’s the hacker way? Facebook’s internal motto illustrates it: “Move fast and break things”. Don’t be constrained by current norms, like privacy. Norms can change.\nA recently leaked memo by top Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth urges colleagues to focus on growth and connecting more people regardless of occasional “ugly” side effects like bullying and terrorism.\nSecond, there’s American regulators’ approach to the information technology sector: Wait and see before passing regulations, so as not to stifle innovators.\nThird, there’s American freedom of speech, the “marketplace of ideas” approach: Let everyone say what they will, even if it’s false. Truth will eventually prevail.\nCombine the elements, and here’s the result emerging from the allegations.\xa0\nWhile no one was watching, British data firm Cambridge Analytica illicitly obtained data harvested from Facebook to target millions of voters with political messages, including fake news, matched to their psychological profiles.\nIts clients included the Trump campaign, the Brexit campaign, Kenyan politicians and others.\nNow, the fallout. American legislators contemplate next steps. Singapore’s Parliament is acting swiftly, having already concluded hearings on deliberate online falsehoods, a possible prelude to legislation.\nWHO'S LOOKING ANYWAY?\nThe story of Cambridge Analytica, and reactions from American and Singapore lawmakers, make sense when seen in context.\nA close look at Facebook shows Mark Zuckerberg was never one to follow rules. When he founded Facebook’s predecessor in his Harvard dorm, he faced a university disciplinary board for breaches of security, privacy and copyright.\nWhat does Facebook’s “move fast and break things” mean? Roll out the innovation quickly, even with missteps.\xa0\n'Iterate', as innovators say. Get feedback.\xa0Do it again.\nEmblematic of Facebook’s approach is its 2006 introduction of the news feed, the list of your friends’ updates. Before then, you logged in and saw your homepage. If you wanted to see friends’ updates, you sought them by visiting their pages.\nThough it’s hard to imagine now, when the news feed first appeared, some protested that it was intrusive for Facebook to broadcast a user’s updates to their friends. Zuckerberg was unrelenting. Users adapted. The news feed quickly became an indispensable feature, adopted by other social networks.\nFast forward to 2014. For years, developers had created games and other apps that plug into Facebook.\xa0\nCambridge University’s Aleksandr Kogan developed a personality test app. Hundreds of thousands of Facebook users took the test. It also harvested their friends’ data, which Kogan had permission to collect for academic purposes.\nKogan allegedly passed all this data\xa0on millions of users\xa0to the company Cambridge Analytica, which eventually worked for the Trump campaign.\xa0\nA Cambridge Analytica former employee, whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, told the BBC that the firm “absolutely” planted fake news stories. \xa0\nKogan’s alleged disclosure of data to Cambridge Analytica violated Facebook terms and conditions on transfer of the data to a third party. But who was looking?\xa0\nIn 2015, after the Guardian reported that Kogan transferred data to Cambridge Analytica, Facebook banned the app and asked all parties to delete data from it.\xa0\nWylie says Facebook did nothing to enforce the\xa0request\xa0except to ask Cambridge Analytica to check a box on a form saying they deleted it.\nUNREGULATED, HANDS-OFF APPROACH\nFacebook and other new media firms thrived in a largely unregulated American communication technology sector.\xa0\nLawmakers’ hands-off approach wasn’t new. They had taken steps to ensure platforms could grow with minimal threats of liability. In the 1990s, one of the first Internet regulations Congress passed was to insulate platforms from liability for defamation that users posted.\xa0\nAnother law insulated platforms from liability for users’ copyright infringement unless the platforms are notified of infringing material.\nNowhere is America’s wait-and-see approach to regulating tech more evident than in data privacy, where there is still no comprehensive law, despite years of debate.\nTechnology companies opposed to privacy regulations have a loud voice, backed by campaign contributions. Public pressure for such regulation is not high.\nWhen answering surveys, Americans say data protection is important, but their conduct suggests otherwise. Like people everywhere, Americans are quick to click “agree” to terms and conditions without reading them, and to exchange privacy for convenience.\nPROTECTING DATA\nIn Singapore, Parliament passed the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) back in 2012. It’s a comprehensive data protection regulation for the private sector, including social media companies.\nSingapore’s PDPA is actually quite simple. Among its core provisions: An organisation like Facebook must notify users of how it uses their data, including whether data will be disclosed to third parties. Users must consent to such uses.\nWithout a PDPA counterpart, American regulators may instead be left to proceed under broad Federal Trade Commission (FTC) prohibitions of “unfair” or “deceptive” practices. Another possibility is law regulating political campaigns.\nThe FTC is investigating whether Facebook broke a 2011 promise, made to settle legal action for sharing more information than it notified users it shared. In this “consent decree”, Facebook promised that for 20 years, it would get users’ consent before sharing their data with third parties.\nIt’s notable, however, that American law lacks a standard way to proceed in such cases. Zuckerberg is set to testify before Congress. Lawmakers may craft more targeted measures to address a crisis generating global public outrage.\nOPEN PUBLIC DEBATE?\nThe final piece of the fake news puzzle is America’s approach to freedom of expression.\nIn the hearings of Singapore’s Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, Professor Thio Li-Ann disputed the marketplace of ideas model’s proposition that truth will emerge when all voices contend in an unregulated, open debate.\nTo many Americans, that approach to open public debate is, ironically, not open to debate. America set its standard with the adoption of the Constitution’s First Amendment in 1791, which says Congress “shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press”.\nFew exceptions to the First Amendment are made. Determining truth, about fake news or anything else, is considered the public’s job.\xa0\nGovernment is seen as having no role in determining what’s true in political news, since government is a central actor in that news.\nAmerica’s central principles have contributed to a crisis with global implications. Its freedom of commerce and speech opened the door for freewheeling Facebook to allow Cambridge Analytica to exploit user data and craft whatever messages it chose with its clients.\nSingapore’s proactive, “better safe than sorry” stance was on display in recent weeks, as it moved quickly to prevent similar crises from erupting in Singapore.\nSocial media companies will continue to iterate using the “hacker way”. America will likely continue to abide by principles of openness in commerce and expression that have, in many ways, served it well.\nIt remains to be seen if American lawmakers, and others around the world, can agree on penalties for abuses of those freedoms, or ways to prevent abuses.\nMark Cenite teaches communication law at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and\xa0Information, Nanyang Technological University, where he is Associate Chair (Academic).\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Facebook ', '     social media ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: The real culprit making our children dumb isn’t e-learning
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: “Technology cannot fix education,” said Steve Jobs in 1996 when asked about his spearheading of initiatives that give computer equipment to schools.\nThose four words uttered more than 20 years ago provide a guidepost for how we should think about e-learning and educational apps.\nIndeed, mobile technology has become pervasive and entrenched for most aspects of our lives today. From getting up to read the news on your phone, to scrolling through social media to see what your friends have been up to, the real world is merging with the one online.\nFor our children, this means that the traditional classroom will increasingly be complemented by the use of smartphones, as well as tablets and laptops.\nWhile the emergence of mobile learning apps has generated optimism about the opportunities they present for children to learn at their own pace and through their preferred learning styles, there has also been panic over children’s dependency on handheld digital gadgets at such a tender age.\nA recent news report from Channel NewsAsia asked to this effect if e-learning is making our kids dumb, and highlighted experts sounding a warning bell.\nLearning apps may not teach children anything but instead, mess with their brains in the long run, hooking children, getting them to stay the course for as long as possible, and eroding human connections with those around them, said the report.\nThe report also included a video showing four-year-old twins performing basic tasks to test their executive functional skills after drawing or using a learning app on a tablet, with the latter twin experiencing more difficulty after.\nWhile the report highlights the dangers of an overreliance on technology, it misses the mark on e-learning entirely for many reasons.\nTHE NEW SOCIAL REALITY\nAs our world becomes increasingly digital, the use of digital platforms to augment real life chores and activities will be a reality.\nMost of us are spending more time on our phones in the last few years alone. According to Yahoo’s Flurry Analytics, Americans spent on average 2 hours 42 minutes per day on their mobile devices in the fourth quarter of 2014. By the second quarter of 2015, an average of 3 hours 40 minutes was recorded – an astounding 35 per cent increase in just six short months.\nChildren are today’s digital natives, whose lives revolve around technology and media, and for whom the real and online worlds have little distinct boundaries. They reach out instinctively to these platforms – and most probably know how to swipe before they can walk.\nAs workplaces too increasingly migrate towards online meetings and discussions, isn’t it intuitive that the classroom uses similar tools to engage learners? Where too much screen time is obviously bad, did our parents tell us not to read because too much reading was causing short-sightedness?\nTo wish e-learning away in this context is therefore not only grossly myopic but naive. It is not a matter of if but how, when and where digital platforms are employed to augment our children’s learning journey.\nThe question then becomes what is a sensible and prudent approach to incorporating these tools into our homes and classrooms. Even as we ourselves are coming to terms with how to do so, one thing is certain - we should stop approaching online and offline learning as two separate spheres, and come up with a coherent, comprehensive approach to learning that considers this new social reality.\nIn a world where food, shopping and entertainment are at our fingertips, to tell our children to avoid mobile devices is to do as I say, not as I do. We surely cannot let our nostalgia for the pencil and paper override the inevitability of what education and learning in a digital world will entail\nENGAGEMENT STILL HAS TO BE HUMAN\nOne thing to bear in mind is that digital platforms are precisely just that – tools to be used for a purpose.\nTechnology cannot be a panacea for a well-rounded education with strong foundations, and certainly will not do anything in of itself to ensure our children develop a love for learning.\nComputers and apps cannot shoulder the responsibility that falls squarely on parents and educators alike.\nThe upside to digital technology has often been about how it promotes a less instructive, more explorative approach to learning via communication and collaboration.\nSocial media pages where students can share information related to the course and add to discussion threads, class polls for teachers to gain quick insights into students’ engagement and understanding, and live online documents for collaborative note-taking and editing are some examples where mobile technology, with careful thought and planning, can be effectively utilised for education.\nA further benefit lies in how technology can help boost participation. Where school lessons are constrained by time, tools like online boards allow discussions and debates to extend beyond the classroom and school hours. Shyer individuals can still have their feedback captured through polls or online forms.\nAt EduEdge, for example, online technology helps to boost student engagement through sharing viewpoints, raising disputes and analysing various current affairs issues.\nTherein lies the crux of the issue. With the right digital tools, a participatory and collaborative learning culture becomes possible. But the use of the “right” digital tools boils down to how educators use these tools to achieve specific ends. The thoughtfulness in which they incorporate these platforms and devices into their lessons, and their ability to mediate these discussions are ultimately key.\nParents too, have a role. It is their responsibility to have cultivated in their children respect for others’ opinions, online or offline as well as respect for quality family time without the use of technology.\nGOOD OUTCOMES \nMany studies attest to the fact that carefully designed educational apps do improve students’ learning. New evidence also show that early incorporation of such educational technology into the classroom can produce immense learning benefits later on.\nA 2010 study on an educational gaming app showed a 30 per cent improvement in the width of vocabulary of three-to-seven-year old kids who used it.\nOther studies have shown improvement in skillsets including arithmetic, communications, speech, articulation as well as motivation and engagement levels when using certain apps. These include studies on mobile learning for students with learning difficulties and special needs.\nWe can cite more studies, but that isn’t the point because it all depends on what skillsets apps are designed to hone and how they’re used.\nNOT A SILVER BULLET\nThe most important thing to remember is that mobile technology complements not substitutes teaching and learning; it is not a silver bullet.\nThis means that a concerted effort from all stakeholders in education namely, policy makers, schools, parents and students, is required to make e-learning viable so as to reap its full benefits.\nEffective teachers cannot be IT savvy without being pedagogically sound and vice versa. Yet when policymakers and educational institutes relook their curricula with a view to incorporating mobile technology, it should not be for the sole reason of moving with the changing times.\nThought must go into adjusting policies such as class participation assessment, to ensure the goal remains the students’ learning, instead of incentivising them to summarise and rephrase a random article off the Internet.\nParents should also take note that not all learning apps are made equal or will deliver what they promise. So-called educational videos that only serve to narrate at children for instance, will not be as impactful as programmes that encourage interaction. The fine line between games and educational tools must also be treaded carefully.\nParents should also check whether an app’s publisher is a credible provider of quality educational learning resources and for positive reviews before downloading the app.\nThe most important thing to do is to observe and engage your kids from time to time, to see if these learning apps and platforms are doing them good, instead of handing them the tablet before turning back to your Korean drama.\nLearning apps are poor babysitters.\n""Socialness"" is becoming a huge part of the learning experience characterised by peer-to-peer support and interaction, mentoring and knowledge sharing.\nWe would do our children a disservice if it were otherwise.\nEdwin Edangelus Cheng is founder and principal of EduEdge learning hub.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: The future of work – new underclass, dystopian reality?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The dust will take decades to settle on the key issue of precisely how much technology and artificial intelligence (AI) will displace human labour.\nBut it is already clear the coming decades will see a sizeable proportion of jobs worldwide threatened and substituted by automation, machine learning, or a combination of both.\nIt is increasingly apparent too that jobs commonly reckoned to be “safe” at present may in fact be candidates for an AI takeover, with many knowledge workers themselves candidates for displacement.\nResearch by McKinsey from 2015 suggests that current technologies alone could automate 45 per cent of the activities people are paid to perform.\nThe effect, as some experts have pointed out, will be comparable to the industrial revolution.\nAt the same time, workers are demanding, and companies are offering, greater flexibility in work arrangements.\nUnlike the past, when the vast majority of work was full-time employment, bundled with benefits such as pension and healthcare, the future will be much more varied.\nContractually, there will be full-timers, part-timers, freelancers, contract workers, and other forms of relationship between companies and the people that supply them with labour.\nWork hours may be shift-based, flexible, self-determined, or totally undefined, so long as agreed output is delivered on time.\nThe upshot: What people do and how they are contracted to do it will be very different from the old models, and the very concepts of “jobs” and “careers” will need to evolve.\nPeople have throughout history moved to new jobs as old ones are destroyed. Some believe this will happen again, while others suggest that this time the outlook is actually far less positive.\nWe should all ponder the future not just for the winners of the employment stakes of the future, but the losers too, particularly if the intensity of disruption increases.\nTHE HAVES\nThe future will see a great deal of knowledge work automated. IBM’s Watson computer, which won the American TV quiz Jeopardy in 2011, is now being used to devise treatments for some cancer patients in the US.\nAI is even making inroads into fields like journalism, with some attempts showing that machine efforts are almost on par with that of human writers.\nThis does not necessarily spell disaster for humankind. There will be an elite that manages to ride the AI wave.\xa0\nIndividuals in this group will have skills - creativity, abstract thinking, intercultural sensitivity, and the ability to thrive in ambiguity – that computers and AI will take a great deal of time to master.\xa0\nThere will also be opportunities for individuals in tech-enabled growth areas like computer science, robotics, education and healthcare, in particular opportunities in catering for an ageing population, possibly working alongside AI.\nTHE HAVE NOTS\nShifts in wealth will invariably continue as AI and automation technology enable robots and algorithms to do an increasingly wide range of tasks.\nThe likelihood is that those who control and shape AI will gain power and wealth.\nOne noted AI expert Yoshua Bengio has spoken of “AI worsening the effects and concentration of power and wealth that we’ve seen in the last 30 years.”\nThere are two groups of people we should be concerned about.\nFirst, those who risk seeing their skills become obsolete and have difficulty picking up new skills. Learning new skills is likely to be more challenging for older workers, as well as those with lower education levels.\nThe focus for these individuals needs to be on retraining, to enable them to take on new jobs, either in the same industry or in a new one.\nThe Singapore Government has already put in place significant infrastructure to support training, and to empower individuals to shape their own training journey through the SkillsFuture programme.\nThis recognises that companies alone cannot be responsible for all the post-education skill creation in the economy. Instead, individuals must take charge and drive their own development.\nSecondly, we should also look closely at the seeming promise of jobs in “the gig economy”.\xa0\nThe gig economy does have its benefits – in supplementing income, buffering against unemployment, and providing flexible work options. More broadly, the sharing economy, enabled through platforms like AirBnB allows the monetisation of assets.\nThe story in the long run may be different.\xa0\nWebsites that match employers with freelancers are growing fast – but so is the potential for lower wages and inequality.\nWhile the gig economy might bring to mind images of professionals choosing to freelance from the comfort of their penthouse lofts, the reality is that the majority are at the opposite end of the spectrum.\nCompanies are turning to these arrangements to cut costs – both in terms of salaries, since they only pay when they need work done, and in terms of benefits.\nMost gig economy workers do not qualify for statutory benefits such as paid leave, medical leave and health insurance.\nThe net effect is a transfer of risk and cost from corporations to individuals - unfortunately, often the most vulnerable individuals who are least well-placed to bear them.\nThis group – particularly those for whom such gigs are their sole source of income – are badly hit by the combination of volatility in the income stream, since suitable work may not be found in a timely fashion, and the lack of statutory benefits that typically accompany permanent employment.\n\nBesides the loss of perks such as health benefits, individuals caught in these jobs often have less incentive to upskill themselves.\nIt is not without reason that Guy Standing, professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, has pointed to the dangers of a coming “precariat”, which he defines as an emerging global class with no financial security, job stability or prospect of career progression.\nThe irony: Far from delivering utopia, technology and flexibility in how we work could potentially perpetuate an underclass.\nCREATING A PERMANENT UNDERCLASS\nA rising gig economy has national security implications.\nResearch into the roots of radicalism has shown that in some cases, a loss of hope and sense of progress for the future can play a part in an individual’s descent.\nThe risk is that the gig economy creates a permanent underclass of people who do not see any way out of the gig economy - just endless stasis.\nThere are no prospects of advancement, and the moment they try to stop, they get thrown off the treadmill.\nFor people who have been displaced by technology from full-time work into the gig economy, with low pay, no prospects, no fixed schedule, and limited social engagement, a sense of anomie is one plausible outcome. Their futures, from their own vantage point, will be debilitating, plagued by uncertainty.\nFor how long will these people continue to be in the gig economy, coming to fix your wifi or driving you around for minimum wage?\nAt the macro level, we may face a future where there will be a permanent strata of rights-based movements or groups campaigning in the name of\xa0 social justice – under the banner for example of those who have been left out of the very bright technologically-enabled future.\nThere are already people arguing for universal basic income as a response to this change.\nSome of these movements need not necessarily be violent, but are certainly socially destabilising.\xa0\nConsider for example recent protests over local politics, gentrification, and the cost of living that have surfaced in San Francisco, targeting the giant tech companies based in Silicon Valley.\nThese have seen loosely organised activist groups blocking shuttle buses used by tech employees, breaking windows and picketing the homes of Google executives.\nMight we also see a revanche to the Luddites of the nineteenth century – individuals seeking to wreak revenge on technology?\nThe Luddites of the early nineteenth century lived in an era of “reassuringly clear-cut targets—machines one could still destroy with a sledgehammer”, notes Steven E. Jones in his 2006 book Against Technology.\nBut the technology that takes over jobs and runs most of our lives will not present such a clear-cut target, potentially resulting in the unhappiness being channelled toward other targets instead.\nIt is also not too far-fetched to see these forces allying with other ideologies\xa0 - even metastasising into violent protest and action. Security officials tend to ignore these sorts of possibilities, preoccupied as they are in the Islamic State age by the jihadist threat.\nBut the threat is real. In 2010, Swiss police intercepted a car filled with explosives destined for an IBM nanotechnology facility near Zurich. The individuals apprehended were green activists.\nIn 2012, shadowy anarchists claimed responsibility for the shooting of Roberto Adinolfi, an Italian nuclear engineering executive.\nThe faint but growing signals of anarchists coming back onto the national security radar should concern us.\xa0\nThey are not necessarily thrown out of work by automation, but convinced, perhaps, that existing forms of government have failed in the globalised and technologically enabled age.\nJohn Maynard Keynes took the view that technology and machines would increase productivity to such a degree that the main challenge people would face was what to do with a surfeit of leisure time. That utopia has yet to materialise.\nHe also theorised that as a greater proportion of the population found themselves liberated from the “economic problem” of struggling for subsistence, society might suffer from a “general nervous breakdown”, not knowing how to readjust.\xa0\nA sort of breakdown might come to pass, but not the one Keynes envisioned.\nInstead, one of the real issues of our times may well be what people involuntarily displaced by technology and unable to adapt to new ways of working do with the time they have on their hands, and the implications this has for the rest of society.\nShashi Jayakumar is head of the Centre of Excellence for National Security and executive coordinator, Future Issues and Technology at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\xa0Eugene Goh is chief operating officer of a leading shift-worker hiring and management software startup based in Singapore.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     technology ']}"

Singaporeans can really make great cakes’,” said Mr Tay, 46, during an interview at his 14,000 sq ft central kitchen in Kampong Ampat.\nThe kitchen is home to his wholesale manufacturing and baked goods supplying company Foodgnostic, and its sister company Cat And The Fiddle, the online retail arm of his cheesecake business.\nWithin its walls lies the technology that has enabled him to produce his cheesecakes in enough quantity and consistency to supply to regional markets. Since April, Mr Tay has been testing the China market, sending samples to restaurants and hotels there.\n“We’re taking things slow in China. Our strawberry and coffee-flavoured cheesecakes are doing well. We have one restaurant ready to deal with us. Things are too early to tell, but if they (the consumers) like it, it will be massive,"" he said.\nFoodgnostic also has a factory in Malaysia which produces halal cakes under the Cat And The Fiddle brand. It\'s still at the stage of ""testing the waters"" of the Malaysian market and studying the logistical challenges.\nMr Tay says he is also looking to produce cheesecakes for markets in Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam.\nWatch: The story behind Daniel Tay’s global ambition\nWith 500 to 1,000 cheesecakes being produced a day from his Foodgnostic kitchen floor, Mr Tay said: “We are trying to ramp it up to 2,000 or 3,000 in the next year, and hopefully when we get our new line, we maybe (could bake) 10,000 a day.”\nThis year alone, ""S$600,000 to S$700,000” has been invested in Foodgnostic’s technology as he seeks to innovate and leverage on robotics, he revealed at a recent panel discussion for Channel NewsAsia’s year-end special, Singapore Review 2016 (which airs Friday, Dec 30, at 8pm).\nMr Tay established his name on the local culinary scene when he founded patisserie-café chain Bakerzin in 1998, after a stint as pastry chef at French restaurant Les Amis. He sold off Bakerzin in 2007 and resigned as its chief executive in 2013 to start Foodgnostic.\nSTILL A JOB FOR HUMANS\nBut Mr Tay’s investment in kitchen automation at Foodgnostic has been viewed by some with jaundiced eyes.\n“There are times when I talk about robotics, there are some negative comments, like, ‘Oh, so you are not paying, so you are retrenching people’, he said.\n“I said, ‘No, we never retrench unless someone did something very bad to the company. We never ask people to leave. And we would not replace humans with machines. We will never, never replace.’”\nHe added: “This company is definitely not buying a machine and saying, ‘Hey, I think you do not have a job.’ That’s definitely a no-no.”\nRather, he said, he embraces technology with the aim of improving the productivity and efficiency of each worker. “It is just an addition for them to produce more.\n“If I buy the machine with the same amount of staff that I have, (the question is) how much more can I produce? Can I produce three times more, four times more, and still sell?\n“A reduction of staff and an increase in productivity are two different things. We have to make it clear that buying machines is not to replace humans. It is to make our employees more productive.”\nIF HAAGEN-DAZS CAN DO IT...\nAnd he’s pushing ahead with the confidence that there will be a receptive international market for his uniquely-flavoured cheesecakes.\n“It is like if Häagen-Dazs can ship their ice cream all over the world and sell their brand, then it is the same thing that I want to do. I want to sell the Singapore taste,” he said.\n“I believe we can now use the ‘Made In Singapore’ brand… because we are popular enough to sell our local-flavoured cheesecake overseas and educate (others) about our country’s unique flavours.”\nAlthough, he admits that Americans might not be quite ready for durian cheesecake yet. But, “Milo Dinosaur, that is very Asian. So we are going to make it a little bit louder, a little bit bolder and tell them, ‘Hey this is our cheesecake, try it’.”\nSingapore Review 2016 looks at the economic challenges and opportunities for entrepreneurs.
