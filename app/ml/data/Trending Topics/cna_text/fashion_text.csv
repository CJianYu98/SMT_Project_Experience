The sneakers were available in a range of sizes from five to 18.\xa0\nAfter two weeks on the auction block, 200 pairs of the sneakers have sold for a grand total of US$25.3 million (S$34\xa0million), Sotheby's has revealed.\nThis\xa0figure is eight times the overall US$3 million high estimate. The auction has shattered records, including the highest known public record for the most valuable sneaker and fashion auctions ever staged, and the most valuable charity auction at Sotheby’s in nearly ten years. \nAccording to the wishes of the late designer Virgil Abloh, all proceeds from the sale will benefit Abloh’s Post-Modern Scholarship Fund, supporting the education of academically promising students of Black, African-American or African descent. \nCOMPETITION FOR RARE SIZES\nThere was strong competition for rare sizes. The highest bid received was for Lot 1, a size five, which achieved US$352,800, more than 23 times its US$15,000 estimate. Size nine achieved the highest total value by size, totalling US$3.4 million across 26 lots. \nSize eight achieved the most competition, with a total number of 1,400 bids for the size. Lot 181, a size 11, had the highest number of bids in the sale, registering 68 total bids. \nSTRONG ASIAN INTEREST\nThe auction garnered widespread global interest, with more than 1,200 bidders from more than 50 countries. In addition, collectors from Asia comprised 40 per cent of total buyers, Sotheby’s said. \nBidders from Asia also accounted for 44 per cent of all bid value. The average age of collectors from Asia was 35. \nOverall, new and younger bidders drove the auction. More than 75 per cent of buyers were new to Sotheby’s, the auction house said. More than two-thirds of all bidders were under 40. More than half of all buyers were also under 40. \nCharles F Stewart, chief executive officer of Sotheby’s, called the auction “a testament to Virgil Abloh’s legacy as one of the most visionary artists and designers of his generation whose widespread influence and impact is still palpable”. \n“We are thrilled that the record-breaking fundraising auction for Virgil Abloh’s Post-Modern Scholarship Fund has generated such exceptional results,” said Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton. “We are proud that thousands of students will be able to benefit from the proceeds, allowing us to continue to uphold Virgil’s mission to inspire and support future generations.” \xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Louis Vuitton ']}"

      The Singapore cheongsam maker who dresses dignitaries, socialites, celebrities
  </h1>, 'text': 'The traditional cheongsam is enjoying a renaissance in Singapore, thanks in no small part to fashion designers like couturier Goh Lai Chan.\nHis eponymous boutique is well-known for its gowns and especially, its modern renditions of the cheongsam, or qipao, as it is known in Mandarin. The traditionally loose-fitting robe was first worn by women in the Qing dynasty. Its figure-hugging version was popularised in Shanghai in the 1920s and it evolved into a fashionable garment after that.\n“I see a lot of women trying to wear qipaos now,” Goh observed. “It should not be a costume that you wear only for one occasion. I try to make it more contemporary so that you can pair it with sneakers and mix it with jeans. It reaches out to the younger generation so that they don’t feel like they are wearing old-fashioned clothes.”\nGoh, who has dressed international public figures and created costumes for films, musicals and theatre, has developed a unique and practical style that resonates with the modern woman. His cheongsams are figure-hugging yet not so tight that they restrict movement. He achieves that by using a bias cut, a western technique where fabrics are draped and cut diagonally, which helps to sculpt a woman’s silhouette while making it comfortable for the wearer.\n“My modern clothes must be comfortable so that they can drive, run around, go grocery shopping, pick up the kids and such,” said Goh, who feels that it is important to reach out to both younger and older customers because there are very few traditional clothes like the qipao. \nAt the same time, Goh feels that the style of a traditional garment must adapt to the times to survive for the future, whether it is the colour, fabric and proportions or making the cheongsam length more contemporary. \nFor example, a distinct Lai Chan style is the use of gemstones such as quartz and turquoise for the 18 buttons at the side of a qipao, inspired by the jade buttons found on the imperial garments of Chinese emperors.\nGoh also creates capes for customers who want to look more dressed up. He explained: “They can wear it with double collars inside which the Chinese used to do in the olden times. You can also style it with collared qipaos and the cape without the collar.”\nOne of Goh’s pieces for Singapore Fashion Week 2017 inspired a customer to tailor her wedding dress with him. They decided on a clean floral style where a mandarin collar is complemented by details such as French lace, trimmings, beadings and flowers incorporated into the silhouette. \nGoh was just 14 years old when he made his first cheongsam, a very traditional piece with eight buttons and trimmings, for his mother. In the 90s, his younger brother, Eddie, left his full-time job in metalwork to join him in his boutique. Since then, they have been working side by side for over 20 years to craft stunning one-of-a-kind pieces. While Goh designs the cheongsams, his brother works on the embroidery and other intricate details.\n“He always gives me strange and difficult ideas and I will say, ‘How can this be done?’” said the younger Goh. “I will definitely find a way to do it because in the end, it really can be done. That is why I admire him. It is just up to how you go about doing it.”\nChallenging ideas aside, there is much affection between the two siblings, who are number 13 and number 15 respectively in a close-knit family of 15 children. Goh’s parents were very supportive of his ambition to be a designer, and he has always cherished the close family bonds, foregoing an opportunity to study fashion overseas lest he didn’t want to return to Singapore after that. Even now, he spends a lot of time with Eddie’s family, where they’d eat together and Goh would play with his niece and nephew.\nGoh opened his first boutique in the 80s at the now-defunct Liang Court shopping mall, where he sold cheongsams and evening wear. In 1991, he moved to Raffles Hotel where he stayed for 25 years before re-locating to Paragon, which is along Singapore’s main shopping belt. \nBesides the cheongsam, Goh has also designed a “man-pao”, his personal take on the changshan, a traditional long tunic for men.\n“It can pair with whatever you want. I would pair it with full suits but my brother, Eddie, wears it with his pants and pairs it with his leather boots,” he shared.\nGoh hopes that the Chinese qipao would be relevant and wearable even beyond his lifetime.\n“I’m trying to look for people from the next generation who are interested to design, not just with computers, they must also be able to think and draw with their hands. This needs to be something that touches their souls and that they can feel with their fingers as well; they have to use their hearts. \n“Design is no longer just about fashion, it is also about connecting our past and future.” \nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 4).

      Xiao Zhan, Lay Zhang: 5 Asian celebs who became brand ambassadors since 2022 began 
  </h1>, 'text': 'For years, we’ve gotten accustomed to seeing Hollywood celebrities as the face of the world’s top brands. But in recent times, a slew of Asian celebrities have steadily picked up brand endorsements, signifying the growing importance of the Asian market. \nSince the year began, it almost seems as if a new Asian star is chosen every week as the face of a new brand or campaign. Here’s a look at all the latest announcements. \nXIAO ZHAN FOR SAIC AUDI\nThe year was off to a roaring start for fans of Chinese actor and singer Xiao Zhan as the star was announced as brand spokesperson of SAIC Audi on Jan 1. SAIC is China’s largest carmaker by sales and Audi’s second Chinese partner to produce vehicles in the country. \nXiao Zhan became the face of a campaign featuring the new domestically made Audi A7L. Zhan is known for sparking shopping sprees every time an endorsement is announced. Shortly after SAIC Audi’s announcement, reports claimed that fans of the singer began posting their orders for the sedan online. \nAside from Audi, Xiao Zhan is also brand ambassador for luxury houses Gucci and Tod’s, as well as watchmaker Zenith. \nKRYSTAL JUNG FOR CHARLES & KEITH\nSingaporean footwear, handbags and accessories brand Charles & Keith announced its first-ever global ambassador on Jan 3, picking none other than K-pop singer Krystal Jung. Jung was formerly a member of girl group f(x) but has since gone solo and branched out to acting. \nThe ambassadorship kicked off with Jung fronting the brand’s Spring 22 campaign, which highlighted key footwear and bags from the Blooming Spring collection. “I am truly honoured and proud to be the first global ambassador of Charles & Keith. I appreciate the brand’s consistent endeavour to empower women through fashion over its 25-year history – creating beautifully crafted collections that feature a wonderful balance between on-trend styles and classic wardrobe styles,” the star said of her new role. \nPreviously, the brand had worked with A-list celebrities such as Hailey Bieber and Lily McMenamy to front campaigns. \nKEITA MACHIDA FOR TOD’S\nAlso in the same month, Japanese actor Keita Machida snagged an endorsement for Italian luxury shoes and leather goods brand Tod’s. Machida is a member of theatre group Gekidan Exile and recently shot to fame with Netflix’s hit thriller, Alice In Borderland. His new film, Cherry Magic The Movie, is also scheduled for release later this year. \n“I’m very glad to have the opportunity to get to know Tod’s and its Italian charm. I feel that I have so much in common with Tod’s because I grew up in a place with abundant nature.\xa0I feel an innate intimacy with nature. I’m looking forward to enjoying Italian rays of sunshine in Japan through Tod’s,” Machida said of his new appointment. \nSON HEUNG-MIN FOR TUMI\nAside from entertainers, sporting celebrities are having their moment with luxury brands too. Celebrated footballer Son Heung-min, who plays for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and is also the captain of the South Korean national football team, was tapped by TUMI to launch its new Alpha Brava collection. \nThe athlete starred in the brand’s Life In Forward Motion campaign, carrying key pieces from the collection. “Being a professional footballer, travelling is naturally a big part of my life. It means I need versatile and reliable bags when I’m off the field – and TUMI delivers,” said Son. \nSon has had quite an award-winning start to the year. In early January, he received his seventh Best Footballer in Asia award, marking his fifth consecutive year winning the title. Son was also the highest-scoring Asian player in the Champion’s League in 2019, and was the first Asian player to score more than 50 goals in the Premier League in 2020. \nLAY ZHANG FOR HUBLOT\nEXO’s Lay Zhang is proving to be a brand favourite, steadily snapping up brand endorsements. Most recently, the Chinese pop star was announced as the newest ambassador for Swiss watchmaker Hublot. \nZhang, a member of K-pop boy band EXO, is one of the biggest stars in the region. Following Hublot’s announcement, the star became the No 1 trending topic on Chinese social media platform, Weibo. \nFans have even dubbed the star the “king of endorsements”. Aside from Hublot, Zhang is the face of French jewellery brand Chaumet as well as luxury house Valentino. He also fronts other lifestyle brands such as Bang & Olufsen, MAC Cosmetics and Calvin Klein. \n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     fashion ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Women's clothing store bans men in Brazil: ‘Please wait on the bench outside’
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sick and tired of men harassing her clients and employees, the owner of a women\'s clothing store in Brazil decided to take matters into her own hands and ban them from her shop.\n""No men allowed,"" reads the sign that entrepreneur and model Andrea Costa hung in the window of her store in a shopping mall in Sao Jose dos Campos, a city of 700,000 people in the southeastern state of Sao Paulo.\n""Your pet is welcome,"" it adds.\nAnother sign posted in the store, Mr Luxos, asks men: ""Please contribute to women\'s privacy and wait on the bench outside the store.""\nCosta told AFP she made the decision after countless cases of men making untoward comments and casting lascivious looks at clients and employees in her store, including when she and her staff would shoot photos for online sales in a small studio inside the shop.\n""Ninety-nine per cent of men behave inappropriately, and it\'s impossible to tell which ones just by looking at them.

      Luxury items will get more expensive in 2022, say experts
  </h1>, 'text': 'The past two years should have been horrible for the €283 billion (S$428 billion) luxury goods sector. Many of the usual triggers for high discretionary spending – confidence in the economy, international travel, social occasions – have been in short supply. Stores have closed, reopened and closed again; fashion shows and other key marketing events have been nixed or migrated online; supply chains have been squeezed; prices of materials and labour have gone up.\nAnd yet global sales of luxury goods made a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, according to analysts, as sector stocks – up 40 per cent year-on-year – outperformed the wider equity market for the sixth consecutive year. (Profits also made a full rebound thanks to rental renegotiations and other cost savings made early in the pandemic.)\nFiscal stimulus, a strong stock market and increased household savings buoyed spending in the US, and with fewer opportunities to splash out on dining or travel, many consumers funnelled what they would have spent on luxury services into luxury goods.\nBut the recovery has not been even. It is the large, conglomerate-backed brands with their vast geographic reach that have gained as smaller players have struggled, sold up or gone bankrupt. And though luxury spending has returned to 2019 levels in the US, China and Korea, sales in Europe and Japan remain depressed (due to a lack of tourists for the former and slow vaccine adoption for the latter).\nWith the spread of the Omicron variant, new lockdowns in Europe and economic headwinds in China, the picture for 2022 is cloudier than it was a year ago. Here’s what to watch for.\nLUXURY GOODS SPENDING WILL HIT RECORD LEVELS\nDespite the ongoing challenges posed by COVID-19, analysts are confident that revenues in 2022 will continue to surpass pre-pandemic levels. After growing 4 per cent between 2019 and 2021, Bain estimates sales will increase from €283 billion in 2021 to between €300 billion and €310 billion in 2022.\nBut who is spending on what – and where – looks quite different from 2019, says Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods research at Citi. Chinese tourists who used to open their wallets in Paris and Hong Kong are now buying luxury goods at home; in the US, there has been a surge of buying among Americans in Austin, Pittsburgh and other non-coastal cities, as many people have migrated from larger metropolises during the pandemic.\nWith travel and social gatherings still limited in many parts of the world, the shift from spending on experiences to goods is likely to stick around for another year; eventually “this will normalise,” said Federica Levato, Milan-based partner at Bain & Company.\nSome analysts have sounded a note of caution, however. In November Goldman Sachs cut its 2022 forecast for luxury goods growth from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent, citing concerns around China’s GDP, property prices and “Common Prosperity” policy. There has also been a country-wide crackdown on showing off wealth, with regulators censoring such content on social platforms.\nPRODUCTS WILL GET MORE EXPENSIVE\nAfter remaining stable for years, luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Chanel raised prices during the pandemic (in the UK Chanel’s classic flap bag is now £6,630, or S$12,066, up 40 per cent from early 2020).\nWith material and labour costs rising, Citi’s Chauvet said price hikes will continue into 2022, with some brands “even talking about double-digit price increases, Moncler in particular”. Those increases “should deliver double-digit revenue growth for the industry even if volume growth normalises”, he said.BRANDS WILL TAKE GREATER OWNERSHIP OF SUPPLY CHAINS\nBrands including Chanel, Prada and Zegna have begun to acquire more of their suppliers as access to the best materials and manufacturers is becoming more difficult and costly, and customers demand greater transparency about where and how products are made.\nThat trend is set to continue in 2022: Zegna chief executive Gildo Zegna tells the FT the brand plans to use funds from its recent public listing to make more acquisitions across its supply chain, and Chanel president Bruno Pavlovsky says the company is planning additional investments in its supply chain after having bought up about two dozen of its suppliers last year.SECONDHAND WILL OUTPACE THE OVERALL LUXURY GOODS MARKET\nThe secondhand market continued to grow throughout the pandemic, reaching estimated sales of €33 billion last year. Having formerly ignored the segment, brands keen to embrace more circular business models – and serve the niche but growing cohort of customers who no longer want to buy new products – have begun to partner with secondhand platforms such as Vestiaire Collective and The RealReal to offer authentication services and incentivise customers to consign their past purchases via store credit. Some smaller brands, including Rachel Comey and Marques’ Almeida, are using their websites to facilitate secondhand sales directly. Expect larger brands to follow suit.\nTHE INDUSTRY WILL BE LESS SUSTAINABLE\nThe luxury goods industry has made significant strides on sustainability in recent years: Environmental profit and loss statements have become standard among major groups and brands, and designers have embraced certified-sustainable fabrics and upcycling to an unprecedented degree. But with demand for luxury goods reaching all-time highs, product volumes are going up and the industry’s environmental footprint is consequently becoming worse.NFTs WILL REACH A TIPPING POINT\nBy 2025, Gen Z will account for more than one in five luxury purchases, according to Bain. To reach them, brands will invest further in gaming partnerships (Fortnite, Honor of Kings) and NFTs, the latter of which is becoming a revenue stream in its own right.\nDolce & Gabbana set a record when it auctioned off a nine-piece collection of NFTs for US$6 million (S$8 million) in September; a Morgan Stanley report boldly predicts that metaverse gaming and NFTs is a €50 billion annual revenue opportunity for luxury companies, and could offer a 25 per cent uplift to industry profits by 2030.BRANDS WILL INVEST MORE IN ECOMMERCE\nThe online share of luxury sales nearly doubled from 12 to 22 per cent during the pandemic, a figure that is expected to rise to as much as 30 per cent by 2025, per Bain. Having previously relied on online department stores and other wholesale channels for the majority of their online sales, brands such as Gucci and Alexander McQueen are migrating to consignment models and improving their own websites, giving them greater control over inventory, pricing and customer relationships.NEW CHAPTERS AT BURBERRY, FERRAGAMO AND BOTTEGA VENETA\nThe pandemic has been challenging for independent brands, and 2022 will see the installation of former Burberry chief executive Marco Gobbetti at shoemaker Ferragamo, where the first order of business will be the appointment of a creative director to replace Paul Andrew.\nFormer Versace chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd will succeed Gobbetti at Burberry in April, where he’ll be tasked with evolving – or redirecting – Gobbetti’s five-year plan to take Burberry upmarket and make it a serious player in leather goods.\nRaf Simons’ former right-hand-man Matthieu Blazy will make his debut at Bottega Veneta in February, following the departure of Daniel Lee in November. Don’t expect a major creative overhaul here: The minimalist, industrial aesthetic Lee brought to Bottega over his three-year tenure has been a success, and Blazy is expected to continue to iterate on it.\nElsewhere, London-based Phoebe Philo is expected to unveil her first collection for her LVMH-backed namesake label; A Bathing Ape founder Nigo will show his first designs for LVMH-owned Kenzo (the brand also has a new chief executive in Sylvain Blanc); and former Louis Vuitton accessories creative director Camille Miceli will make her debut at Emilio Pucci.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2022 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

I was begging them to open the safe for me so I could discover what was inside.”\nAfter obtaining degrees in business and fashion management in Italy, Kiroglu pursued a master’s in Chinese culture in Shanghai before working in a Chinese state-owned company. It was then that she started her jewellery brand as a sideline. Begum Khan was launched in 2012, with the first pair of custom cufflinks for her brother’s wedding.\n“I’ve always loved cufflinks. When you look at a gentleman\'s jacket, sometimes you see the cufflinks, sometimes you don\'t. It\'s somehow a little surprising element,” Kiroglu shared.\nWhen business took off, Kiroglu decided to move back to Istanbul. Her creations have grown into a treasure trove of fantastical pieces, all housed in a wonderland-like showroom, located in Istanbul’s bustling Nisantasi neighbourhood. A giant neon beetle flutters its wings at the front window, welcoming visitors to Begum Khan’s glamorous and whimsical world of Ottoman antiques, modern art and artisanal jewellery.\n“We didn\'t want to just display jewellery because in a way, we don\'t sell jewellery, we sell art, we sell dreams,” Kiroglu explained. “I live in a dream world. Life is a stage for me, when I\'m sleeping, I see full scenes, I see rooms decorated, the people, the hair, dresses and I see jewellery on people.""\nThe Art-Deco inspired boudoir displays pieces from gold-plated and diamond-paved brooches to statement earrings. Designs with scarabs, turtles and evil eyes are among the more popular ones. “I want to create pieces that are really contemporary, but at the same time, I want them to be timeless,” shared Kiroglu.\nHer style is very unique, but her pieces are as suitable for everyday wear as they are for special occasions such as a ball or a wedding. She is especially fond of insect motifs. “Insects are similar to me in character, because I find myself strong, determined. At the same time, I\'m really fragile emotionally. Insects are just like that; you can crush them in a second but at the same time, they have survived for millions of years,” she said.\nIn 2021, Begum Khan rose to international fame with several luxury brand collaborations. Kiroglu created a capsule collection for Italian womenswear brand Aquazzura, featuring earrings and necklaces with motifs of hearts, pineapples and beetles. For French perfume powerhouse Guerlain, she produced a special fragrance in a bottle wrapped in gold-plated bronze and adorned with the house’s imperial bee symbol encircled by four orchids. Kiroglu shared: “It was limited edition and was sold out on the first day. It was a romantic collaboration for me.""\nAsian arts and aesthetics have a significant influence on Kiroglu’s works of art and she often combines Chinese and Ottoman influences in her designs. She said: “They’re both really important ancient empires. A lot of traditions and cultures are shared. We all come from Central Asia. In a way, [we] are sisters and brothers; it just works together perfectly.”\nHer ideas are materialised in her workshop through a family of traditional jewellery artisans, who handcraft each intricately bejewelled piece. “Istanbul is a really beautiful and magical place to create jewellery because we have centuries-old craftsmanship and that’s my ambition to keep this handcrafting [alive],” said Kiroglu. “I really like that transference of emotions and thoughts from my thoughts to their brains, their brains to their hands, from their hands… it\'s an amazing process.”\nKiroglu’s latest collection is dominated by evil eyes, which is traditionally seen as symbols of spiritual protection. It is an apt and timely one as the world continues to battle a pandemic. “With this collection, during COVID-19 and all these world difficulties, I wanted to create a protective shield around myself. With all these evil eyes, I feel better.""\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 4).

      In China, millennials are rejecting luxury fashion brands in favour of niche labels
  </h1>, 'text': 'Keira Kong, a millennial Shanghai-based agent for South Korean music artists, is trying to explain her newfound love for French brand Coperni. “I hate looking like a million dollars. I want to look independent and smart – like I’m different, but not too different.” \nSince designers Arnaud Vaillant and Sebastien Meyer relaunched the label in 2019, Kong has built a small wardrobe of Coperni staples, including two dresses, two tops, three jackets and a pair of trousers. She commends the brand’s tailoring, its signature asymmetric cuts and its prices (T-shirts sell for about 839 yuan on farfetch.cn, or S$178).\n“The fabrics are never going to be at Chanel’s level but their cut, their concept and the way they see women is never too girly,” continued Kong. “They like strong, independent women and that’s who I am trying to be.”\nLike Kong, a growing number of Chinese consumers, often part of the Gen Z and millennial cohorts, are using clothing and luxury purchases to differentiate themselves from their peers. Purchases are less motivated by the older generation’s paradigm of “status” and more influenced by elements such as “identity statement”, says Federica Levato, partner at Bain & Company in Milan. This shift has opened the way for lesser-known and edgier brands to provide a point of difference from the big luxury labels now ubiquitous in the country.\nIt’s a trend that hasn’t gone unnoticed by Wenyan Jiao, director of Shanghai and Wuxi-based multi-brand boutique Mushion, which stocks brands such as Cult Gaia, By Far and Nanushka. “[Young consumers] in first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are showing increasingly personal characteristics in their fashion styles,” she said. “The previous generations may not have such a high level of acceptance when it comes to trying things outside of their comfort zone.”\nIndependent multi-brand boutiques, which have been expanding in the country since the late 2000s, have contributed to this shift. Their owners, such as Jiao, often studied abroad and are particularly attuned to international influences. Meimei Ding, chief executive of showroom DFO International, describes a new generation of buyers that are less attached to institutional logos and luxury brands and more interested in being tastemakers. “They want to be the selector of what’s cool, rather than being led by very large brands,” she said.\nNiche foreign labels have been gaining traction in the country for at least the past five years, but recently their appeal has accelerated. The arrival of foreign e-commerce platforms hosting a wide variety of smaller labels have made these brands much more accessible across the country. Farfetch opened a digital storefront on Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com in 2019, and is now also available on Tmall, and Ssense launched its Mandarin site in 2018.\nBut a larger shift in consumer culture is also under way, says Adam Knight, co-founder of China-focused marketing agency Tong Digital. He points to how more nuanced ways of defining success are emerging in the country, beyond how much money one makes or what luxury brands one owns, and sees countercultural movements such as “lying flat”, with young people pushing back against overwork and the country’s gruelling “996” culture (working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week), as a sign of changing priorities and values. \n“Young consumers are looking for more meaningful forms of creating self-identity through luxury purchases,” he said. “It’s an exciting time for a lot of smaller brands to get in and start building reputable businesses from the ground up.”\nThis was the case for London-based Yuzefi, which was founded in 2016 and is known for its sculptural handbags. The label makes 15 per cent of its £5 million (S$9.2 million) in annual sales in China, but expects that share to grow to 25 per cent in the next 12 months on the back of its recent launches on e-commerce platforms Tmall and JD.com, and on social platform Xiaohongshu. \nFounder Naza Yousefi credits the label’s Chinese success to a combination of product uniqueness and good timing, with a bit of help from Atlanta-based Chinese blogger Savi of @savislook, who independently started to wear the brand in 2017, exposing the label to her four million Weibo followers.\n“We do well in that territory because our products look so different from other brands and that gives us an edge,” said Yousefi. Similarly, Beste Manastir, co-founder of Turkish leather goods brand Manu Atelier, says Chinese consumers were attracted by the unusual design and bright colours of her Pristine handbags. \nThe label launched in 2014 and quickly gained a following in the country, despite not having a direct presence in the market at that time (the brand is now sold on Tmall and JD.com, as well as six offline retailers). China now represents 34 per cent of Manu Atelier’s wholesale sales and is head to head with the US as the brand’s largest market.\n\xa0\nTo have a shot with China’s new savvy fashion consumers, uniqueness of design is paramount, but Ding of DFO Showroom stresses that it needs to be combined with good fit, price point, brand awareness and availability. \nPascal Conte-Jodra, managing director of Mugler, seems to have followed this formula when he approached the Chinese market three-and-a-half years ago as part of the larger relaunch of the brand under creative director Casey Cadwallader. The brand partnered with six stockists in key locations and focused on building relationships with local talents, such as creative consultant Leaf Greener and singers Jike Junyi, Bibi Zhou and Cai Xukun.\n“More than in other countries, in China is about taking the time to build relationships with local insiders to really become that indie fashion brand that everyone talks about on a very personal level,” said Conte-Jodra.\nJamie Freed, global vice-president, private client, at Farfetch, says the e-commerce site’s highest-spending clients, who spend at least 100,000 yuan a year, have been particularly interested in niche South Korean and western brands since the start of the pandemic. \n“They are starting to abandon what was the hot genre of fashion pre-pandemic – luxury streetwear – and we are seeing more of a diversification of the fashion portfolio, shifting towards typically feminine brands like Alessandra Rich and subdued minimalistic brands like Rick Owens and The Row.”\nThese changes in consumer behaviour are most evident across first and second-tier cities, where luxury consumption has already matured, but Danni Liu, managing director of iBlue Communications and a former media strategist at Chanel, says social media are breaking down barriers between city tiers, with trends seeping through more easily. “It’s not only sophisticated groups, it’s a wider trend,” she said.\n“I definitely think that there has been a very strong trend going into this direction down to everyday consumers,” added DFO’s Ding, noticing how posts about niche brands on Xiaohongshu, a popular social commerce platform with more than 300 million users, are on the rise.\nSimilarly, Knight says that rather than trickling down from well-off, fashionable shoppers to a wider set of consumers, these changes are a generational shift happening across the board. Brands that rest on their laurels are set to suffer, he believes. “It’s this generation and these consumers who are going to power all consumption for the next decade,” he said.\nBy Annachiara Biondi and Sherry Fei Ju © 2022 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     luxury fashion ']}"

      Joanne Peh on Last Madame cheongsams, getting back into acting and reno nightmares
  </h1>, 'text': 'The year has barely begun, and Joanne Peh is already hard at work – flexing her modelling chops for our camera, while dressed in stunning cheongsams from an array of designer labels. \nClearly, the actress is in her element, having worn so many variations of the traditional Chinese garment as brothel mamasan\xa0Fung Lan in local drama Last Madame, which first aired on Toggle (now meWATCH) in 2019. \nThe series marked two firsts for Peh – it featured her most daring (and first bare-all) bed scene to date, and scored the actress her first Asian Television Awards win for Best Leading Female Performance (Digital) in 2020. \nIt also left many viewers with a deep impression of the period costumes she wore as the lead character in the show, which explains why it was naturally apt to put her in a stylish selection of modern cheongsams for this CNA Lifestyle shoot.\nON THE COSTUMES SHE WORE IN LAST MADAME\nFashion has always been an integral part of drama, no matter on stage or a film set, and plays an ever more critical role in period productions. It’s not solely about accurately portraying a certain time of the past either – the right costumes help actors get into character and also communicate subtle nuances of each and every different role.\nPeh agreed: “On Last Madame, it wasn’t just the outfits – the hair was also something we spent a lot of time on to get right. We pored through references and tried them out, but while they may be right for that era, they didn’t feel right for Fung Lan.”\n“Everything, from the hair, to the makeup and costumes, was crucial in helping me ‘feel’ the character. Fung Lan was powerful, but she’s also a woman trapped in a period where she needed to use her feminine charm to navigate society. This meant she had to be sexy and desirable but, at the same time, vulnerable when it came to love. All the (final)\xa0costumes were beautiful and perfect for her, right down to the fur stoles,” she explained.\nWhile the svelte actress loved wearing them all on set and looked great in them, they aren’t clothes that she’d “wear as Joanne Peh”, even though the traditional garment does make her feel poised and feminine. On that note, she also pointed out how wearing one, interestingly, helped her maintain a good posture. \n“I wore some really high-collared ones in A Song To Remember (a 2011 Mediacorp Channel 8 drama she starred in) and that gave me a stiff neck, because I couldn’t slouch or move my head around much,” she shared.\nDespite not really having worn a cheongsam outside of filming, she certainly is still in a good position to offer some tips on how to pull one off stylishly. For those who are thinking of adding one to their wardrobe, she recommended getting it tailored. While most people would think that a super-slim figure is required to carry off the fitted garment, she doesn’t completely agree. \n“If it is made to size and the proportion is right, then half the battle is won. The other half is having confidence. It really isn’t about our shape or size! Off-the-rack clothes fit the mannequin but may not be suitable for us because all our bodies are different,” she said.\nSWEEPING UP CONSECUTIVE ACCOLADES \nAfter garnering the ATA win for her performance for Last Madame, Peh went on to receive the same award in December last year for Mediacorp drama Mind Jumper, in which she plays an accountant who’s diagnosed with a brain tumour and acquires mind-reading abilities after going through radiotherapy.\nTwo consecutive wins in the same category – it’s not an achievement most other actors can claim to have under their belt. “It’s a huge honour and I’m very flattered. Both wins were for roles that I found strong connections with and to be given the honours is icing on the cake. I’m also thankful to Ochre Pictures for entrusting me with these challenging roles, forcing me to step out of my comfort zone and push my craft to another level,” she acknowledged.\nTo prep for the role of Kai Le in Mind Jumper, she had sometimes practised getting into the character off-camera, “feeding” her mind with stimulations she thought were appropriate for it. “I play a high-functioning individual, so I’d imagine (what kind of triggers my character would be sensitive to)\xa0in my daily commute and interactions with people (off-camera), and the stimming behaviours that would be most comfortable and natural for her. I practised until they became second nature, so that it happened naturally on camera,” she divulged.\nADDRESSING THOSE RENOVATION TROUBLES\nThe award win, then, must have been a sweet reward for her efforts, and put a fabulous end to 2021 for the actress. In truth, however, the year was actually a tiring one for her, even though she is happy about her professional achievements. \n“Towards the end of the year, I felt really burnt-out – probably due to the culmination of events. We were hustling the remaining renovation work (for her new home), hoping to move in before the year ends, while trying to create a sense of normal for the children (she has a daughter and son with actor husband Qi Yuwu) with year-end festivities,"" she divulged.\n""But we were hit with obstacles that we kept rehashing whenever friends and family ask about the progress of our renovations, so much so that all the negative energy became very toxic and I just didn’t want to meet anyone and talk about it anymore.""\nIt’s no secret by now that the couple ran into renovation issues and delays while doing up their new home, which Peh had mentioned via her Instagram posts. Her comments, while brief, had also sparked a lengthy conversation with her followers on the topic of the troubles encountered from working with contractors. \nWhile the renovation process – which took more than a year – was far from being a breeze, Peh is glad that the work is finally almost complete and to be able to put everything behind her. All that is left to do is perhaps moving in and settling in with the kids.\nShe explained that there was a combination of factors behind the delay – it certainly wasn’t entirely due to the pandemic. \n“To put it simply, we didn’t know what we needed to know about home renovation, because it’s one of those things you don’t do frequently. We learnt that a lot of detail goes into a home and if we don’t know what to ask, the information is not always volunteered. Sometimes, it is intentionally withheld, while at other times, it’s just a blind spot,” she said frankly.\nLOOKING AHEAD TO A FRUITFUL YEAR\n“My new year resolution for 2021 was actually to #donothing because I kept myself so busy during circuit breaker in 2020, I felt like I should have rested. For me, #donothing meant a shift in mindset, of not using \'busy\'\xa0as a measure of my self worth. I’ve always been a very curious and passionate person, so instead of being led by all the things I wanted to do, I allowed myself pockets of time where I had no plans. It turned out that the year was just as busy, but I made time for myself, which was different from 2020,” Peh said, as she looked back on the past year.\nPerhaps it was a timely coincidence that she had no acting projects in 2021. “If there was something I missed, it’s acting. I do hope something comes along this year,” she said. \nShe also revealed that being a self-managed actor in Singapore can be very passive, in terms of getting work. “Many assume that I have offers piled up high and I get to pick and choose, but Singapore’s TV and film industry operates differently, and so the reality is that I have to wait for an executive producer to think I’m suitable for a role before I get a chance to act,” she explained.\nNot one to rest on her laurels or wait around for things to happen, Peh has decided to take a more active role in her work. For 2022, she hopes to kick-start some personal projects that are interest-driven. \n“A mini drama series or a season podcast perhaps – and I’m looking for interested partners to collaborate and take this further. Find my email on my Instagram account if anyone wants to chat more about this, please!” she quipped.\n(Photos: Reuben Foong, styling: Joshua Cheung, fashion assistance: Kelly Hsu, hair: Ryan Yap/Passion Hair Salon, assisted by Louis Lim, makeup: Sha Shamsi using Chanel Beauty, manicure: Ann Lim, location: The Nitty Gritty Studio, flowers:\xa0Floral Kokoro.)\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     fashion ', '     cheongsam ']}"

      Huat colours should you wear this Chinese New Year beyond red? 
  </h1>, 'text': ""Chinese New Year is the perfect time to embrace long-held traditions. That includes wearing the most favourable colours in accordance to Chinese customs to bring about luck, wealth, happiness and pretty much anything one desires.\xa0\nIf you think the colour red is the be-all-and-end-all shade to gather positive vibes, read on.\xa0\nChris de Burgh’s Lady In Red may have left an indelible mark but\xa0so did many other celebrities who defied tradition by commemorating their significant moments dressed\xa0in their lucky colours.\xa0Sarah Jessica Parker said 'Yes' to Matthew Broderick in a stunning black gown, Elizabeth Taylor wore a canary yellow frock when she got hitched to her fourth husband Richard Burton,\xa0and who can forget Jennifer Lopez's iconic green\xa0Versace dress\xa0that broke the Internet.\nThese anything but minimalist shades\xa0just happen to be some of the\xa0most 'huat' hues\xa0to add groove to your repertoire. Exactly which colours are most likely to give your Chinese zodiac a boost, and at the same time,\xa0inch you closer towards\xa0Spring Summer's hottest\xa0shades? CNA Lifestyle breaks it down for you.\nTHE RAT: RED AND BLUE\nRed and blue are said to be auspicious colours for luck and career, respectively. If roleplaying the lady in red for the next 365 days is simply too daunting, you could up the “heng” factor, by subscribing to a red bag, like this Amazona bag\xa0from Loewe or working in\xa0accents of red such as a red watch, a sapphire, ruby or carnelian piece of jewellery.\nAs for blue, anything from Yves Klein blue to Tiffany blue\xa0will work like a charm.\xa0Blue-coloured prints will also do the trick.\nTHE OX: RED AND YELLOW\nIf yellow is your favourite colour then you're supposedly in luck. The colour is said to help in the romance department. From pastel yellow to canary yellow to neon yellow, don’t hold back, the brighter it is, the easier you'll stand out in the crowd.\xa0Meanwhile, red's the colour for career-minded Oxen. For the best of both worlds, this red and yellow sweater from Kenzo can be a source of fashion inspo.\nTHE TIGER: ORANGE AND BLACK\nWell, it is the Year of the Tiger so colours associated with the majestic animal are particularly coveted. Wealth and career beliefs are tied to orange and black, respectively, and you’ve got that entire package in this Lola bag from Burberry’s capsule collection of tiger inspired pieces.\nTHE RABBIT:\xa0ORANGE\nInstead of conventional red, set\xa0your sights on a\xa0tangerine hue. It can be as simple as incorporating this Longchamp bucket bag into regular wear to ensure that luck is always within easy reach.\nTHE DRAGON:\xa0WHITE\nWhite isn't traditionally a colour anyone would want to associate with during Chinese New Year.\xa0Wearing pure white might lead to disapproving looks from the elders,\xa0but what if we told you that white is the colour that might just help fan\xa0the flames of love. You can easily put a sporty spin like adding coloured stripes or picking out a cropped style like this Prada jacket that will keep you toasty in airconditioned settings.\nTHE SNAKE: GOLD AND SILVER\nYou're in luck if you're a fan of yellow gold and silver because these are supposedly auspicious when it comes to anything career- or money-related. Style-wise, if you're not sure how to mix your golds, take a cue from\xa0Blackpink's Jennie and stack up these Chanel Coco Crush rings for a K-pop approved take.\nTHE HORSE: BLUE AND RED\nIf you've been in loungewear for most of 2021, it's high time to spruce things up (at least for the Chinese New Year festive period). This Louis Vuitton shawl\xa0will make a chic addition to your wardrobe and its colour combo is said to be good for Horses: Red for luck, of course, and blue for good health.\nTHE GOAT: CANARY YELLOW\nSimilar to the Ox folks, yellow's the colour of romance for Goats. All shades of yellow will do, but canary yellow seems to be the best bet. This Moschino\xa0tiger-inspired getup\xa0is a good place to start.\xa0\nTHE MONKEY:\xa0BABY BLUE\nIt tends to get really hot and sunny in the week of Chinese New Year. So why not make sunnies a part of your look? If you're a Monkey, pick a pair in a colour that works to your zodiac advantage, which would be baby blue. Miu Miu's oversized style is so comfy, you wouldn't want to take them off. At least until your reunion dinner.\nTHE ROOSTER: YELLOW\nAnother yellow pick, this time for Roosters.\xa0Yes, we know that it isn't exactly the easiest colour to wear but you can still make it work with the right pieces and attitude, such as\xa0this cute, tongue-in-cheek take with Kellogg's Tony the Tiger by\xa0Moschino.\nTHE DOG: BLACK\nThe colour black has earned its stripes as an all-season MVP colour. You'll likely be forgiven for wearing it throughout Chinese New Year but if grandma insists on\xa0giving\xa0you a hard time, break it gently to\xa0her that black is your lucky colour this year.\xa0And more\xa0importantly, it's not just any black tee, it's\xa0a Balenciaga.\nTHE PIG: GREEN\nGreen is one of those colours that you either love or hate (and not always the most cooperative colour tone when it comes to one's complexion). But it\xa0is\xa0the lucky colour for Pigs this year, so you'll just have to make it work. Just a hint should do the trick. We suggest something like this matelesse Miu Miu hobo bag that is equal parts chic and practical.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     CNY ', '     fashion ', '     colours ', '     Clothes ', '     Shoes ', '     Bags ', '     Accessories ']}"

      A Bathing Ape and Human Made's Nigo makes historic debut for Kenzo at Paris Fashion Week
  </h1>, 'text': ""It was a fashion history-making moment in Paris for Kenzo on Sunday (Jan 23) as it unveiled the debut for its first Japanese designer since house founder Kenzo Takada.\nNigo, 51, thus becomes only the second Asian designer at the head of a European high fashion label, alongside Bally’s Filipino-American Rhuigi Villasenor. His appointment represents a milestone as the luxury industry wrestles more broadly with questions over racism and diversity.\nThe show venue of Galerie Vivienne underlined the historic importance of the debut collection, teasing out parallels between the Nigo and Takada. Both are Japanese, both studied at the same Tokyo fashion college decades apart, both have an East-meets-West artistic vision and are considered fashion code breakers. The arcade is the very location where Takada held his inaugural fashion show in 1970.\nNigo’s close friend Pharrell Williams and Kanye West applauded amid the ancient bookshops alongside an audibly enthusiastic audience after his vibrant creations were revealed.\nHere are some highlights of Sunday’s fall-winter menswear shows at Paris Fashion Week:\nKENZO’S FULL CIRCLE\nNigo first drew global renown with the streetwear brand A Bathing Ape that he began in 1993. Several decades later at the helm of one of LVMH luxury giant’s biggest labels Kenzo, those vibrant colors and streetwise prints were evident in creative fusion with some traditional Kenzo themes such the red poppy print.\nBoth designers, the house said, had “an understanding of the synthesis between Japanese and Western wardrobe traditions.” Nigo is “envisioning it as a tunnel toward the future and beyond the borders of fashion.”\nThus, exaggeratedly oversize berets mixed with clashing-color prints on silk, standout loose wool coats in maize, printed silk neck scarves, chunky sheeny leather loafers, and high-waisted chino pants. Stripes followed checks, tassels, straps and gold-buckled belts. There were even a series of finely tailored sartorial preppy looks with loose proportions, one of which nicely evoked the cross-over styles of Japanese clothing.\nNigo went all out, sending myriad styles and silhouettes – as well as men and women’s designs – down this unusual runway. Sheer vibrancy was the one unifying theme.\nWOOYOUNGMI GOES TO 1920s MOSCOW\nMoscow’s glittering St. Basel’s cathedral seeded the colors and styles for menswear brand Wooyoungmi on Sunday to produce a collection that glistened with jewel tones of pinks, greens, blues and oranges.\nThe novel A Gentleman In Moscow by Amor Towles was what the South Korean brand said inspired its Russian musing – with references to the ornate city and its famous churches peppering the show.\nScarves with frontal fastenings seemed to be the brand’s take on ecclesiastical headwear, while black patent statement boots that sported a chunky sole were a hip way of managing Russia's famed winter snow.\nLoose proportions, layers and sumptuous material defined the collection that was carefully thought out and executed.\nThe best moment? When an unexpected decorated strap – evoking the military – appeared out of a beautiful, tailored minimalist bronze wool coat. It was subtle yet effective.\nSACAI’S BOOTS ARE MADE FOR POSING\nGargantuan statement boots made from puffer jacket material were the leitmotif of Sacai’s show by Chitose Abe.\nWith hoops, zippers, laces, ribbing and toggles, the original footwear looked ready for a Moon landing, laying out a fashion forward aesthetic for the fall-winter season.\nElsewhere, an artistic collaboration with Japanese-born, New York-dwelling artist Madsaki produced some food for thought in the form of large spray paint prints and embroideries across sweatshirts and the back of jackets.\n“Sheeple Zombies and Kool-Aid,” it read, referencing how people following the trends are unable to think independently.\nIt was a fine message for the house that prides itself on originality.\nAbe was in nostalgic mood too – reworking themes she had introduced in her earliest shows such as lingerie, which was integrated here as bra-cup seams tailored into jackets.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     luxury fashion ']}"

      A showman at heart: Fashion designer Thierry Mugler dies aged 73
  </h1>, 'text': 'French designer Thierry Mugler, who reigned over fashion in the 1980s and died on Sunday, was as famous for his fantastical couture as for his blockbuster fashion shows. He was 73.\nMugler\'s daring collections came to define the decade\'s power dressing, with his clothes noted for their structured and sophisticated silhouettes, showcased by his extravagant shows.\n""I always thought that fashion was not enough on its own and that it had to be shown in its musical and theatrical environment,"" he once said.\nIn later years, he dressed Beyonce and Lady Gaga – and in 2019 came out of retirement to create Kim Kardashian\'s Met Gala look.\n""We are devastated to announce the passing of Mr Manfred Thierry Mugler on Sunday January 23rd 2022,"" said a post on the designer\'s official Facebook account.\nHis agent Jean-Baptiste Rougeot, who said the designer had died of ""natural causes"", added he had been due to announce new collaborations early this week.\nSHOWMAN AT HEART\nBorn in Strasbourg in December 1948, as a young teen Mugler joined the Opera du Rhin\'s ballet company before studying at the School of Decorative Arts.\nFrom a young age he created his own clothes, adapting items bought at nearby flea markets. He moved to Paris aged 20, initially to work with another ballet company – but was more successful with his own wardrobe.\nMugler soon became a freelance stylist and worked for various fashion houses in Paris, London and Milan.\nIn 1973, he took the plunge and created his own label Cafe de Paris, before founding Thierry Mugler a year later.\nHis designs exacerbated and celebrated women\'s forms: Shoulders accentuated by padding, plunging necklines, constricted waists and rounded hips.\n""Dancing taught me a lot about posture, the organisation of clothing, the importance of the shoulders, the head carriage, the play and rhythm of the legs,"" said Mugler.\nA showman at heart, he organised spectacular presentations of his creations pioneering the modern spectacle of the 21st century fashion show.\n""Today\'s fashion shows are a continuation of what Mugler invented. The collections were pretexts for fashion shows,"" recalled Didier Grumbach, former CEO of Thierry Mugler.\nHe had showmanship in his blood: For the 10th anniversary of his label in 1984, he organised the first public fashion show in Europe with 6,000 attending the rock concert-like show.\nBut nothing compared to the 20th anniversary celebration in 1995, staged at the Cirque d\'Hiver.\nModels including Jerry Hall, Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigova and Kate Moss paraded alongside stars such as Tippi Hedren and Julie Newmar with the spectacle culminating in a performance from James Brown.\nLATER YEARS\nThe 1992 launch of his company\'s first perfume Angel – in collaboration with Clarins, which acquired a stake in the company before taking control in 1997 – was a runaway success.\nClarins shuttered Thierry Mugler ready-to-wear in 2003, a year after the designer reportedly left the brand, but continued the scent business with Angel rivalling Chanel\'s No.5 for the top spot in sales.\nRenowned for his work with celebrities, he counted Grace Jones and Hall among his muses, and had a long-running creative collaboration with David Bowie – even dressing him for his wedding to Iman.\nDespite seemingly retiring from fashion\'s frontlines in the early 2000s, Mugler continued to impact culture and worked with Beyonce on her ""I am..."" world tour. \nIn later years the designer suffered a series of accidents requiring facial surgery, and rebuilt his body with intensive bodybuilding while engaging in meditation and yoga.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     celebrity ']}"

      What to wear this Chinese New Year: Orange, black and stripes all over
  </h1>, 'text': ""The Chinese zodiac sign of the tiger has long symbolised positive qualities of courage, confidence, and ambition. And these attributes are clearly reflected in the variety of bold styles presented by fashion designers this season.\nGiven the animal’s iconic striped coat, the holiday has inspired plenty of labels to release capsule collections featuring the motif. From evocative and unmissable tiger-striped accessories such as jewellery and bags, to unabashedly bright red or orange garments that include shirts, sweaters and dresses, there is no surer sign that the big striped cat has arrived.\nItalian label Fendi for instance presents its Spring Festival 2022 Capsule Collection that features a vibrant twist to signature Fendi elements. An orange tiger print animalier motif inspired by the Siberian tigers of China runs through the collection and brings to life the courageous and active personality of the zodiac sign.\nLikewise, the house of Gucci presents Gucci Tiger, a wide-ranging selection of ready-to-wear and accessories. The designs feature various renditions of the animal – incidentally already a mainstay of Creative Director Alessandro Michele’s collections and a reflection of his fascination with nature. \nA new print, however, has been introduced: A reinterpretation of a late 1960s archival design that depicts the tiger against a colourful backdrop of greenery and flowers in a pastel palette. \nJust like Gucci, the tiger has long been the signature animal for Kenzo. This year, the label launched a capsule collection featuring an exclusive vibrant print with the tiger naturally taking the spotlight. Presented as powerful and brave, the totem animal is incarnated in various forms across a complete line that includes accessories and garments for men and women.\nLuxury stalwart Louis Vuitton has also jumped on the bandwagon and is ushering in the Year of the Tiger with a Precious Tiger capsule collection that is made up of textiles, fashion jewellery and myriad objets d'art for the home. While the French house has not delved into ready-to-wear for this collection, its accessories such as bracelets and bag charms will no doubt find their way onto outfits.\nThis Chinese New Year also sees Italian fashion house Dolce & Gabbana paying tribute to the animal long regarded as a symbol of good fortune in Chinese mythology. It is showcasing a selection of new prints that intertwine the iconic Dolce & Gabbana leopard print with the tiger pattern in different colours. Exuding a contemporary and dynamic vibe, the palette recalls the vivid colours of wild nature. \nWith the excellent array of options available, this Chinese New Year looks set to be a roaring success in the style stakes.\nKEEPING IT DISCREET: FOR WOMEN\nWhile the tiger may be all about boldness, ladies can keep things restrained by wearing just one tiger-themed item as part of their ensemble. \nA pair of tiger-print denim shorts from Dolce & Gabbana is smart yet casual, making it perfect for a cosy reunion dinner. Those who prefer something more feminine can go for the tiger-print pleated silk skirt from Burberry. Patterned with an illustrated graphic, it is delicate and fluid, and can be easily dressed up or down.\nFeaturing a similar look is a tie-neck blouse with a tiger and floral print from Hugo Boss. Distinctive yet demure, its pattern is contemporary without being overly bold. Not just pretty to look at but ethically responsible too, it is made from at least 60 per cent certified cellulose fibres that are sourced from responsibly managed forests.\nFor a dressier option, an outfit from Saint Laurent in lame velvet jacquard is a discreet adherence to the New Year dress code. Featuring a round neck and three-quarter length sleeves, it is modest yet eye-catching and adds a much-deserved dash of glamour to the festivities.\nFor something delicate and feminine, there’s the Gucci Tiger Horsebit 1955 mini bag in off-white leather and rendered in Gucci’s new print. The tiger, a motif often seen in Alessandro Michele’s collections, is an expression of the House's fascination with the wild beauty of the natural world. \nOn the other hand, you’ve got a tote with a bit of oomph: A shoulder bag made from calfskin from Saint Laurent that is decorated with a distinctive tiger pattern and interlaced metal YSL initials. The chain shoulder strap gives it a modern look, and the interior is perfectly sized to hold hongbaos.\nEschewing prints or patterns is Bottega Veneta’s subtle nod to the festive season. Its Arco bag crafted out of intrecciato slouchy leather and in a vivid tangerine hue is an unmistakable acknowledgment of the auspiciousness of the season.\nAnd finally, the elegant My LV Tiger necklace pays tribute to the revered symbol of the Chinese New Year with the gold-coloured hardware signed with LV Initials, while an LV Circle adds a subtle signature to the adjustable chain. This pendant necklace is especially striking when paired with the matching bracelet.\n\xa0\nKEEPING IT DISCREET: FOR MEN\nFor Saint Laurent’s Chinese New Year capsule collection, designer Anthony Vaccarello shows his stripes by playing with the motif of The Pink Panther masquerading as a tiger, swapping the cartoon character’s famous pink body with an orange and black colourway. Should your festivities be a casual affair, this humorous take on the zodiac will be a definite conversation starter.\nHowever, should street style be frowned upon, opt for the mandarin-collar shirt from Louis Vuitton, which is cut from Oxford cloth and adorned with tiger motifs on the chest and back hits the mark. \nThe designs are screen-printed for added texture and a more authentic finish, and the look can take you from visiting your in-laws to the bar (which will be much needed afterwards, we know). Finish the look with a pair of straight-cut denim trousers from Kenzo. The discreet tiger print keeps it versatile so you can easily dress this up or down while still sticking with the theme.\nMaintain the casual yet smart vibe with a pair of Lunar New Year edition Rhyton sneakers from Gucci. Characterised by the printed motto “Gucci Tiger”, these kicks are crafted out of leather and celebrate the animal of the year with a dollop of fun. Just like the Arco bag, Bottega Veneta changed its signature green to an orange hue and added a subtle tiger pattern to its Cassette intrecciato leather bag for its Chinese New Year capsule. \nLikewise, you can opt for the orange coloured leather card holder from Bulgari. To celebrate the season, the brand has introduced an exclusive embossing service featuring a brand new symbol of a tiger. This hot stamping service is available for embossing on selected leather goods and accessories, and makes for a cute way to update your wardrobe essential.\nAnd if you want to raise the style stakes without being loud, you can't go wrong with a bomber jacket from BOSS. Cut to a regular fit, this zip-up jacket is crafted in cotton-blend velvet with stretch and embossed with a discreet yet distinctive tiger pattern for impact. Gold-tone trims and a zipped sleeve pocket complete the look. \nAs for Balenciaga’s super cute socks in beige with black tiger stripes – well, not more needs to be said.\nLOUD AND PROUD: FOR WOMEN\nThere are times that call for a statement to be made – or for your authority to be asserted. And what better reason than the Year of the Tiger to leave a memorable impression? \nFor a casual get-up, you can ensure that your family reunion dinner this year will be immortalised with Burberry’s Tiger Graphic Technical Wool Jacquard Dress. Essentially a short-sleeved knitted polo shirt dress in technical wool, it is patterned with a fun illustrated graphic of the tiger.\nOr go all out with a ferocious roar with a Kenzo sweater. Featuring a powerful depiction of an orange tiger against red, even your grandmother will surely approve of its auspiciousness.\nIf you prefer to go with a striped pattern, an outrageously bold yellow and black tiger print skirt from Saint Laurent will fit the bill. Featuring a high rise, a tie waist and a straight fit, it not only commands attention but feels comfortable as well.\nIf separates aren’t your cup of tea, you can opt for a short tiger-design brocade dress by Dolce & Gabbana. While it may be modest with its hemline and silhouette, its daring print is not for the faint-hearted and is perfect for those hoping to make a stand with their in-laws.\nBut what’s an outfit without a bag? A tiger themed hourglass mini handbag with chain from Balenciaga comes in bold orange and black stripes printed on Arena lambskin and is given an edge with the aged silver hardware. \nIf, however, a classic Fendi baguette is your thing, you’ll adore its iconic medium size version made of jacquard fabric featuring a tiger motif in black and yellow. Embellished with an FF fastening with black plexiglass insert, the bag can be carried by hand, or worn across the body, freeing up your hands for handing out mandarins and hongbaos.\nRound off the look with tiger-print pony effect leather peep-toe mules from Saint Laurent made of calfskin. Sexy without being vulgar, it is surprisingly versatile and will continue to work well with the rest of your wardrobe once the Lunar New Year is long past.\nLOUD AND PROUD: FOR MEN\nThe Chinese New Year isn’t a time for subtlety, and this casual Kenzo sweater makes that point clearly with its vibrant red tiger motif contrasted against a dark navy. If you want to make an even bigger impact, go with a T-shirt from Dolce & Gabbana. Featuring a realistic tiger motif, it is accompanied by a neon green leopard print on one half. A part of the capsule collection for the season, it also features a matching trouser.\nKeep your essentials handy in a 3D Tiger Motif Leather Crossbody Bag from Burberry. Delightfully playful, it features a tiger face made of different coloured leather and will no doubt be a hit with the nephews and nieces, so you might want to hold on to it tight. If you need more storage you can go for a tiger striped backpack from Versace, crafted from coated canvas with an exclusive tiger print. It is finished with leather trim and adjustable shoulder straps. \nHowever, if shirts are the only accepted dress code at your grandmother’s, you can opt for an eye-catching buttoned short-sleeve shirt from Saint Laurent. Made entirely of silk and embellished with metallic coloured dots, it will ensure you stay cool in spite of the barrage of invasive personal questions you’ll have to endure from relatives.\nLouis Vuitton also pays homage to the Chinese New Year with the Precious Tiger square in silk. The majestic animal is depicted in a stately pose resting on the iconic LV trunk, surrounded by a swirl of jungle leaves. This delicate silk design has been crafted using an innovative double-sided print technique.\nAnd should anyone get too annoying, kick them aside in style with a pair of Tiger Print Cotton High-top Sneakers in cotton and sheep leather from Burberry. It’s so bold, no one will dare step on your toes. Should you require a dressier option for nicking off to meet friends after the day is done, Derby shoes in patent and tiger-print pony effect leather lace ups definitely will do the trick.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     luxury fashion ', '     Chinese New Year ']}"

      Commentary: Why I break with tradition and wear secondhand outfits for Chinese New Year
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: My family used to detest my insistence on wearing secondhand clothes for the Chinese New Year.\nMy mother would ask:\xa0“Why don’t you wear new clothes?” My grandmother would chime in, in dialect:\xa0“Who knows where these came from?” Their voices would be laced with disapproval but mostly disappointment. \nThe first time I defied the longstanding – and as I learned, unspoken until you break it – tradition of wearing new clothes for Chinese New Year was in 2019. That year, I had thrifted a dress from the local thrift shop New2U, described, quite aptly, on Google Maps as an “unpretentious boutique”. \nThe dress was a soft cotton blend, white and strapless, lined with pink satin across the top and bottom. It had a watercolour print of a pink flower, repeated several times all over the dress, with spots of green for the leaves and abstract, gentle black lines. Truth be told, it didn’t fit me perfectly, but I liked it very much.\nAt the time, my family hadn’t quite warmed up to the idea of me wearing secondhand clothes, and when it came to (inauspiciously) wearing it on the Chinese New Year, even less so.\nWearing new clothes, as we all know, symbolises a fresh start, a herald for good fortunes in the new year. That’s the reason they gave me, at least, for the disapproval.\nBut looking back now, I think there were other reasons for that. One of them is the fact that they grew up poor. Choosing not to wear new clothes when we could afford them was an affront of sorts.\nAnother reason – probably the bigger one – was that they simply stigmatised secondhand clothing. \nBut we live in a world of ridiculous overconsumption and overproduction. It’s absurd that we make or buy new clothes when there’s an excess of them.\nIf the fashion industry stopped producing clothes now, it’s likely we still would have enough clothes for a few generations at least. \nThe evidence? Mountains of discarded, unwanted clothing piling up across the world.\nIn November last year, photos of clothes piling up in the driest desert in the world, Chile’s Atacama, went viral on Instagram. According to Al Jazeera, secondhand and unsold clothing from Europe, Asia and the United States, arrive in Chile to be resold around Latin America. These mounds of clothing in the desert are leftovers that nobody wants. \nWhen we “donate” to “charity”, unfortunately, not all clothes are repurposed “for good”. When there’s an excess of donations (which happens much more often than you think), the wearable but unwanted clothes are exported to countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa\xa0and more. \nThe secondhand markets that have proliferated in these regions in response to our waste crisis aren’t good news.\nThe sheer volumes in which these clothes arrive have made the clothing virtually valueless, and because of the infant state of the textile recycling industry and technology, there’s a lot of waste that we don’t know what to do with.\nThis waste ultimately destabilises entire economies and puts families and communities who have to deal with it in precarious economic situations.\nThis is an incredibly big problem, of course, and the solutions required for that are big too. But in the meantime, what’s within our reach is small.\nWe can ask ourselves questions like: Do we really need new clothes? How can I better love and care for the garments I do have? How can we keep more of these garments in circulation within our communities, and not irresponsibly dumped to other countries via the global secondhand trade? \nAll of this is not to say that we should start the conversation on Chinese New Year with all this information about the truth behind fashion’s waste crisis. I didn’t dump all these facts on my relatives over reunion dinner, nor did I attempt to argue that the tradition didn’t make sense. I don’t imagine that either of those would have worked out well.\nInstead, our best bet this festive season is seeing it as an opportune time to engage our families in some accidental environmentalism.\nOver the years, I kept showing up to subsequent family occasions in secondhand clothes that I procured from all over Singapore, and made it a point to say that they were secondhand.\nWith every outfit – a red dress with a vintage-looking print, a two-layered dress with dainty flowers and a pretty neckline, a navy jumpsuit, and many more – they asked fewer and fewer questions, and eventually came around.\nWith the exorbitant amounts of clothing that exists, the truth is beautiful, more-than-wearable secondhand clothes can be found easily.\nMy greatest finds have come from The Fashion Pulpit, an especially suitable location to bring your entire family to be convinced that secondhand doesn’t have to mean second-best. There’s also Carousell – which takes a fair amount of digging, but remains an affordable option always – and various, smaller local thrift shops.\nWhat helped me make my case, too, was my suggestion one year that I should just wear a hand-me-down cheongsam from my mother, who has a habit of buying new ones every Chinese New Year.\nComing from her daughter that she had expected to ditch tradition, the idea was more than welcome, and I did eventually wear one of hers.\nI guess all of my efforts eventually paid off because even though they haven’t quite understood the overproduction and overconsumption crisis quite yet, at least my secondhand outfits aren’t met with disapproval nor disappointment.\nI asked my mother about her cheongsam-buying habit this year and she said that maybe she wouldn’t buy a new one this year.\xa0“Not like I get any luckier with a new cheongsam anyway,” she said. It’s a start.\nTammy Gan is a freelance writer and self-proclaimed activist-in-progress focused on getting people to think deeper about environmental and social justice issues, in service of more just futures.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Chinese New Year ', '     sustainable fashion ', '     sustainability ', '     fashion ']}"

      Influential fashion journalist Andre Leon Talley of Vogue magazine dies at 73
  </h1>, 'text': ""Andre\xa0Leon Talley, the towering former creative director and editor at large of Vogue magazine, has died. He was 73.\nTalley’s literary agent David Vigliano confirmed Talley’s death to USA Today late Tuesday (Jan 18), but no additional details were immediately available.\nTalley was an influential fashion journalist who worked at Women's Wear Daily and Vogue and was a regular in the front row of fashion shows in New York and Europe. At 6-feet-6 inches tall (1.98m), Talley cut an imposing figure wherever he went, with his stature, his considerable influence on the fashion world, and his bold looks.\nIn a 2013 Vanity Fair spread titled “The Eyeful Tower,” Talley was described as “perhaps the industry’s most important link to the past”. Designer Tom Ford told the magazine Talley was “one of the last great fashion editors who has an incredible sense of fashion history. … He can see through everything you do to the original reference, predict what was on your inspiration board”.\nDesigner Diane von Furstenberg praised Talley on Instagram, writing: “No one saw the world in a more glamorous way than you did … no one was grander and more soulful than you were”.\nIn his 2003 memoir, A.L.T.: A Memoir,\xa0Talley focused on two of the most important women in his life: His maternal grandmother, Bennie Frances Davis and the late fashion editor Diana Vreeland.\n“Bennie Frances Davis may have looked like a typical, African American domestic worker to many of the people who saw her on an ordinary day, but I, who could see her soul, could also see her secret: That even while she wore a hair net and work clothes to scrub toilets and floors, she wore an invisible diadem,” he wrote.\nHis relationship with Vogue started at Duke University, where his grandmother cleaned dorms; Talley would walk to campus in his youth to read the magazine.\nTalley was also a familiar figure to TV audiences, serving as a judge on America's Top Model\xa0and appearing on Sex And The City\xa0and Empire.\nRaised in Durham, North Carolina, Talley worked assorted jobs before arriving in New York in the 1970s, soon meeting Vreeland striking up a friendship that lasted until her death in 1989.\nTalley worked as a park ranger in Washington, DC, and Maryland, where he told visitors about slaves who built Fort Washington and dressed up like a Civil War soldier, he told The Associated Press in 2003.\nAfter stints with Interview magazine and Women's Wear Daily, Talley was hired at Vogue in 1983 by Editor in Chief Anna Wintour and was appointed its creative director in 1988.\nTalley released another memoir in 2020, The Chiffon Trenches,\xa0that included gossipy behind-the-scenes tales about Wintour and other fashion figures like the late designer Karl Lagerfeld.\nOf all the elements of a person’s apparel, Talley considered shoes to be most important.\n“You can tell everything about a person by what he puts on his feet,” Talley told the AP.\n“If it’s a man and you can see the reflection of his face on the top of his black shoes, it means they’ve been polished to perfection. … If it’s a woman and she’s wearing shoes that hurt … well, shoes that hurt are very fashionable!”\nTalley’s death was first reported by celebrity website TMZ.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     fashion ']}"

      A day in the life of … Singapore Watch Club founder Tom Chng
  </h1>, 'text': ""Singapore Watch Club (SWC) founder Tom Chng (@tom.chng) is one of the fortunate few who have turned their passions into professions. He started off his career investigating financial crimes, and now, the watch specialist is immersed in his hobby full-time, including building a friendly community of enthusiastic collectors on Instagram (@SingaporeWatchClub).\nChng started the account with a few horological-minded buddies in 2015, and has since amassed more than 37,000 followers.\nIt helps that fiancee, photographer Hosanna Swee (@hforhozzie), shares the same appreciation for time. Besides relaxing over an aromatic brew in their home located in the Bukit Timah area, the couple spends their free time shopping for timepieces and attending watch exhibitions and auctions.\nChng added: “We also share a common interest in photography, with Hosanna, of course, much deeper in this craft than me. We enjoy documenting our travels as much as working on meaningful social media campaigns together.”\nAlthough he has a penchant for mechanical watches, any extraordinary timepiece still fascinates him, such as Louis Vuitton’s latest smart dazzler, the Tambour Horizon Light Up. Chng takes it out to play one weekend and discovers surprising aspects about the smartwatch.\n9AM\nI'm usually up at this time, and the best start to it would be a glass of iced latte. Hosanna and I both love a classic iced latte; we might be biased but we like our homemade ones best.\nAfter that I’m catching up on watch news on websites such as Revolution Watch. I’m currently also reading Watchmaking by George Daniels, considered by many to be one of the finest horologists in the world during his lifetime. I love reading about watches, learning about them, and meeting new people who share that same attraction to these mechanical marvels.\n11AM\nI start creating content for Singapore Watch Club, including taking pictures. Recently, we’ve been focusing on interesting vintage watches with amazing histories.\nMy iPhone is not with me but the Tambour Horizon Light Up reminds me of my afternoon appointments, which I easily acknowledge with a swipe on the screen. I would have liked to access more iOS apps through the watch, but the generic notifications such as calendar and messages are sufficient for now.\n1PM\nHosanna and I usually lunch together on weekends. Today, we head to Zion Food Centre for char kway teow. I love local hawker classics and we often explore the options in different hawker centres around Singapore.\nWhen I go out, I like to pair my accessories with my outfit. The Tambour Horizon Light Up’s matte black strap with subtle Louis Vuitton monograms was a no brainer as I’m often dressed in minimalist grey, blue or black.\nThe rounded bezel presents a stylish endless screen feel and I like the vivid animated lighting in the “Blossom” mode whenever I hold up my wrist. I love mechanical watches but I can appreciate the offerings of this smartwatch without compromising on my preferences.\nThe LV 24 watch face that displays all the time zones is an iconic LV design that I particularly appreciate – I was pleasantly surprised that they brought it to life digitally.\n2PM\nI meet my friend Kin after lunch to work on the designs of the next limited edition SWC watch. Awfully nice of him to pick me up in his swanky new ride today!\nUsually, I’d call a ride for my commutes and use the time to kick back and relax to clear my mind for the next appointment. It’s deep house music like Lane 8 for the best results.\n5PM\nI switch out the matte black strap for a blue rubber option and hit the gym – it took only seconds with the nifty strap-change system. I go to the gym every other day on a moderate strength training routine with high repetitions. I work on a different muscle group every session, and I’m flat out by the end of the hour.\nOn days when I feel more motivated, I’ll end the session with 15 minutes of cardio, but it doesn’t happen as often as I wish. Accompanying me would be my classic rock Spotify playlist of Motley Crue, Motorhead and Guns N’ Roses, which I can easily control from my watch without the need to reach out for my phone especially during cardio. I can also monitor my heart rate and time my rest.\n7PM\nDinner is again at a hawker stall or restaurant. I love prawn mee, chilli crab and chicken rice and we’ve been to the hawker centres at Old Airport Road and Hong Lim Complex. We like steamboat, too, especially the ones at Coca and Beauty in a Pot.\n9PM\nWe unwind at home by watching TV or listening to music. We put on some mellow tunes from my iPhone to the Louis Vuitton Horizon Lightup Speaker, which can be controlled via the LV Connect app.\nAs for a wind-down beauty or wellness regimen, I don’t have any! I’m super low maintenance and Hosanna’s always wishing I’d take better care of myself. A glass of whisky to power down is how I like to end my day.\nVisit the Tambour Horizon Light Up Pop-In at the Louis Vuitton Ion Orchard store from Jan 14 to Jan 28 to experience the newly launched Tambour Horizon Light Up, Horizon Light Up Speaker and the Horizon Wireless Earphones. No registration is required. Walk in or make an appointment by calling +65 6788 3888 or visiting louisvuitton.com\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      ‘Kecil kecil cili padi’: The young Singaporean designing stylish clothes for people who ‘pack a punch’
  </h1>, 'text': 'We all know the saying, when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. When life throws a pandemic at you just as you are launching your business, you need to pivot, and pivot really smartly. That\'s what happened with 25-year-old Lina Osman, who was preparing to launch her own fashion line. What was originally a ready-to-wear line has now morphed into an occasion wear brand\xa0that fuses Malay heritage nuances with modern, contemporary design. \nHI LINA, WERE YOU ALWAYS INTO FASHION FROM YOUNG?\nMy mum told me I have always loved picking out my own outfits since young. I was also the kind of student who would rush everything else and stay up late just to put 110 per cent effort into my art homework – not a good example but I think it shows how invested I am in all things creative. I’ve always wanted to be an artist since young, one who paints and creates conceptual work. But I figured later I could do something similar by using fashion as a medium. \nWHEN DID YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO BE A DESIGNER? \nBack when I was in primary school, there was ‘Be Yourself Day’ where everyone came to school dressed up as the career of our choice. I wore a pink beret, pink frilly sailor tie T-shirt and floral embroidered jeans. I picked out the outfit myself and labelled it as a ""fashionista""\xa0outfit. I was about 10 at that time and probably didn’t quite understand what ""fashionista""\xa0meant but I knew it had something to do with clothes and design. I believe I made the decision to be a designer at that moment. \nHOW SUPPORTIVE HAS YOUR FAMILY BEEN OF YOUR PROFESSION? \nFun fact: My\xa0mum dreamt of becoming a tailor when she was younger, but she didn’t have the chance to study fashion back then. She’s always been very supportive of my career even though it’s an unusual path.\nYOU INTERNED FOR FASHION DESIGNER MAX TAN AND THEN WAS BRAND AMBASSADOR FOR HIM. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT FROM TAN THAT YOU WANT TO APPLY TO YOUR OWN CAREER?\nI did and that was about six years ago. I’ve always been in awe of his thought process behind a collection. To me, I think that is the part customers or the public don’t always see but it is, without a doubt, a very important part behind a collection. Apart from that, Max really prioritised quality finishing, regardless of how minimal or complex the finished product is. That is something that has subconsciously stayed with me, even six\xa0years later. For all my custom orders, I always strive for the best and most seamless finishing, even if it takes more time and effort.\nTELL ME ABOUT YOUR OWN LABEL.\nLINAOTH is an occasion wear label. As of now, I only accept custom orders but am branching out to other lines. Our designs have always been a seamless marriage between clean silhouettes and unexpected elements of romance. Traditional couture details such as heavy beadwork are eschewed in favour of quiet luxury and fine attention to details. There are no hiding flaws in simple clothes, which makes simple clothes difficult to achieve. As for LINAOTH Custom, it is a sincere, warm and personal experience between the client, designer and artisans. \nHOW DID THE PANDEMIC AFFECT YOUR BUSINESS?\nI launched a ready-to-wear Eid collection in 2020 to test the market. The original plan was to continue working closely with a small team of tailors in Indonesia to produce seasonal ready-to-wear pieces for the next few years. However, the pandemic and travel situation delayed the plan which made me change my brand’s direction.\nWHO DO YOU DESIGN FOR? WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER DO YOU HAVE IN MIND WHEN YOU ARE DESIGNING?\nThe message I try to deliver in my clothes has always a balance between boldness and softness. A bold look is not just about being or looking strong, but it can also have elements of tenderness and romance.\nThere’s this proverb in the Malay language ""kecil kecil cili padi""\xa0(translates to small like bird’s eye chilies) which I think about every now and then. It means someone who is really unassuming but packs a punch. I think that is the kind of person I design for. She’s confident and daring yet there’s this beautiful strength in her softness that shines the most.\xa0 \nWHAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST PART OF STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS? \nI think one of the hardest part is figuring out how much my craft is worth and sticking with it. Some of the customers are unaware of the hours and effort that goes behind a custom order, especially one with an experimental cut or unique design. \nOther than the construction and workmanship, it is also very challenging to combine my artistic flair with another individual’s personal style, which is different every time. I work towards making the outcome unique so that’s where the value is. Some info about the custom process: For my custom orders, it begins with an initial consultation with my client. I’ll ask them to share about themselves, starting with their personal style, how they want to look like on the event day – for example a wedding or presentation day\xad – as well as favourite features to highlight, favourite outfit and more.\nWHO OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU?\nWhen it comes to designing, most of the concept naturally comes from the conversations I have with my loved ones, especially with my mum. I also draw inspirations from the brands I love and my own wardrobe.\xa0\nRecently, I’ve been obsessed with looking at vintage tailored and second-hand pieces on Carousell. I think some of the pieces have been made by local tailors, and they depict the style and fashion of the 80s and 90s. I am very inspired by the unique and sometimes bold fabric pairings. \nDO YOU FEEL LOCAL CONSUMERS PREFER TO BUY FOREIGN LABELS OR SUPPORT LOCAL?\nI think there’s a growing pool of people who appreciate and are willing to invest in local designer brands.\xa0 \nDO YOU FEEL THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LOCAL AESTHETICS IN DESIGN AND FASHION THAT YOU ARE ALSO TAPPING INTO?\nI’m not too sure about ""local aesthetics""\xa0because my approach in design has always been conceptual. I design whatever I want to and not based on a trend or colour palette that is already trendy amongst the local consumers.\nI LOVE THAT SOME OF THE DRESSES I HAVE SEEN IN YOUR INSTAGRAM FEED ARE ROOTED IN LOCAL TRADITIONS OR CULTURE. DO YOU FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT TO REFLECT YOUR ROOTS IN YOUR WORK? \nI think it is important, but it is not a priority. Actually it all depends on the collection and occasions. For example, for Hari Raya collections, I’ll always prioritise modesty and draw inspiration from traditional clothes like baju kurung and kebaya in my construction. These are expressed in terms of fabrication and the pattern-making techniques. \nWHAT IS THE DREAM FOR LINAOTH?\nThe dream is for LINAOTH to be a luxury occasion wear label. Under the same house label, I’m branching out to a demi-custom line where customers can order my designs for weddings, events and special occasions. I am hoping to launch this by February or March. There’ll also be Asian-influenced designs for RTW collections like Chinese New Year and Hari Raya, which I hope to launch in March. Lastly, LINAOTH Customisation will remain as an exclusive option where possibilities are endless. \nThe ultimate dream is for the brand to break into the international market and get sold on major multi-label stores like Net-A-Porter. I think it’s going to be a long journey but hopefully, one day, I will get there. \n', 'related_topics': ['     couture ', '     fashion ', '     Ready-to-wear ', '     Singapore ']}"

      Has the pandemic emboldened men to embrace a more feminine silhouette, including skirts and mini-dresses?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Milan menswear designers seem to have decided on the answer, but the question remains: Have the pandemic lockdowns emboldened men to embrace a more feminine silhouette, including skirts, mini-dresses and cape coats?\nThe Milan Fashion Week of previews for next winter and fall continued for the second day Saturday (Jan 15), with guests enjoying the pandemic norm of social distancing compared to previous cramped shoulder-to-shoulder seating. The calendar was slimmed down after the omicron variant started its surge in Italy last month, but that live shows went ahead at all was a sign of optimism after January 2021\'s digital-only Milan Fashion Week. \nEager fans again crowded sidewalks outside runway shows, hoping for a glimpse of Italian rapper Mahmoud at Fendi, or Machine Gun Kelly and fiancee Megan Fox at Dolce & Gabbana. As a rule, men\'s collections on Milan\'s runways this season have so far hewed conservative on the colour palette, leaving the risk-taking to the silhouette.\nFendi\'s collection for next fall and winter was infused with the fashion house\'s disciplined tailoring and elegance – with some welcome eccentricities to lighten things up. They included a leather aviator cap with the flair of a Moroccan fez.\nThe toned-down coluor palette in grey, black and ivory with flashes of red seemed to suggest that the collection was business as usual, but then Silvia Venturini Fendi threw in some surprising silhouettes, starting with a men\'s Bermuda short with the tailoring and flow of a skirt, worn with sheer knee-highs and buckled two-tone pointed Mary Janes. She then proposed wide-leg dress trousers that only from the back showed to be skirted. They were paired with jackets, or knitwear that had a feminine peek-a-boo V on the chest. \nLeaning in on the femininity, voluminous, trapezoidal outerwear with loose, slotted sleeves built to a crescendo with pretty, layered cape coats in black and-white check, or ivory. \nThe accessories were never exaggerated, even when tripled: Bucket hat, cross-body bag and overnight bag aligned in a perfect geometry. Fendi is not the first to put pearls on men, theirs anchored dickie collars. The fashion house also continued the trend of tiny bags – forget the wallet and find a pocket for your phone -- which men carried on chains. \nWhile womenswear at Fendi has been taken over by British designer Kim Jones, who has launched a buzzy collaboration with Versace, the menswear collection still carries Silvia Venturini Fendi\'s signature, representing the third Fendi generation. \nMachine Gun Kelly headlined at Dolce & Gabbana, making at least three wardrobe changes during the runway show, and handing his jacket to Fox in the front row before performing at the close of the show. The rapper is known for his flamboyant dressing, and no doubt found much to shop on the runway. \nDolce & Gabbana\'s puffer coats and matching trousers make the Michelin man look slim, in bubble gum pink or scrawled with the season\'s graffiti print. Warmth was so guaranteed that at least one model wore just branded briefs. As a cold-weather alternative, there were abominable snowman-worthy shaggy eco-furs with matching boots and earmuffs. \nThe jackets of the season have exaggerated shoulders, paired with leggings and worn with visor glasses and molded sneakers. A silver sequined suit was stage-worthy, with skinny eyeglass frames perched on the nose in a way more suggestive of sci-fi lasers than reading glasses. A bold graffiti-emblazoned streetwear ensemble was finished with a tall knit cap in blue that gave a Marge Simpson vibe. \nWhile flash is part of the Dolce & Gabbana repertoire as much as its tailoring, what was more unexpected were the skirts for men. One tweed midi belted with a gold chain was worn with a ripped DG T-shirt and leather collar. A black kilt had a DG graffiti-scrawled sweater. A shimmering pink-to-gold minidress or long tunic, depending on your spin, was paired with matching leggings. \nNothing about this season\'s skirt silhouette on Milan menswear runways is surprising for the designers at the London-based JordanLuca brand, which made its Milan debut. \n""I think the spectrum of menswear is so broad now,\'\' said Jordan Brown, who launched the label with Luca Marchetto four years ago. ""We are so post, post, post, what is menswear and womenswear.""\nTailored kilts, some with tulle panels, are a season mainstay at JordanLuca. \n""The thing about the kilt, is it is 4 or 5 meters (yards) of fabric. It is really technical, it is an engineered garment. Why wouldn\'t a man wear it? The folding, the pleating, the stitching. It is quite tough to make,"" Brown said backstage. \nThe brand\'s exciting long-lean silhouette was accentuated by long, dragging wing-like hems on close-fitting trousers. The looks had a rock-n-roll vibe, fusing elements inspired by punk, glam and grunge. They included trousers purposely ripped open above the knee and fastened with a rhinestone brooch or soft mohair sweaters accented with a trailing spiky strand draped around the neck. \nThe collection showed a strong desire to be out in the world, liberated from pandemic restrictions. \n""The more that we return to physical shows, the more we felt we are returning to our physicality, our kind of human spirit, that kind of visceral instinct,\'\' Brown said. \n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     menswear ', '     Milan ', '     Fendi ', '     Dolce & Gabbana ']}"

      Italian menswear innovator Nino Cerruti dies at 91
  </h1>, 'text': 'Nino Cerruti, the Italian fashion designer credited with revolutionising menswear in the 1960s and who gave Giorgio Armani his first fashion break, has died, Italian media reported Saturday (Jan 15). He was 91. \nCerruti died in northwestern Italy, where his family has operated a textile company since 1881, the Italian news agency LaPresse reported. The Italian daily Corriere said he had been hospitalised for hip surgery. \nCerutti inherited the family business, based in the city of Biella in the Piedmont region, at age 20 upon his father\'s death in 1950. He launched his first menswear company, Hitman, in 1957 near Milan, dedicated to creating sartorial elegance on an industrial scale and becoming part of the nascent men\'s ready-to-wear sector. \nArmani was hired as a young talent at the Hitman factory in the mid-1960s. \nArmani recalled Cerruti as a creative entrepreneur with ""an acute eye, a true curiosity, the ability to dare,\'\' adding that ""his gentle way of being authoritative, even authoritarian"" would be missed.\n""Even if our contacts thinned with the years, I have always considered him one of the people who have had a real and positive influence on my life,\'\' Armani said in a statement. ""From him, I learned not only the taste for sartorial softness, but also the importance of a well-rounded vision, as a designer and as an entrepreneur.""\nIn 1967, Cerruti founded the luxury menswear fashion house Cerruti 1881 in Paris, then the international fashion capital, while maintaining production in Italy. The softened silhouette, use of colors and the attention to both innovative design and tradition won clients like French film star Jean-Paul Belmondo. Soon, Cerruti was in demand in Hollywood, with his designs worn on and off screen by such stars as Michael Douglas, Richard Gere, Jack Nicholson and Robert Redford. \nCerutti also launched a womenswear line as well as perfumes, watches, accessories and leather goods. He also at one point was the designer for the Ferrari Formula 1 team.\nCerruti sold the company in the early 2000s and designed his last collection for Spring-Summer 2020. But he never severed ties with the fashion house, even as he turned his focus to the textile business, taking a front-row seat at Paris runway shows. \nNews of his death spread through the fashion world during Milan Fashion Week menswear previews. \nCarlo Capasa, president of Italy\'s fashion chamber, remembered Cerruti as ""a great innovator"" who was also ""one of Italy\'s chicest men.""\n""He was the first to understand the importance of creativity in menswear and to give space to a young designer of immense talent like Giorgio Armani, changing the very criteria of how to dress,\'\' Capasa said.

      Is your closet a mess? How to sort clothes properly so nothing gets lost in the clutter
  </h1>, 'text': 'Unless you are one of the\xa0rare few who have mastered the art of\xa0maintaining a capsule wardrobe that works across occasions, you know what it feels like to have ""nothing"" to wear. \nResist\xa0the urge to shop\xa0for more clothes and instead, try reorganising your wardrobe.\xa0\nYour overflowing closet\xa0holds more prospect than you\'re willing to admit.\xa0We don\'t mean garments you’re hanging on to that no longer fit\xa0you but\xa0the pieces\xa0you used to love to wear that\xa0are hidden from view and thus\xa0forgotten. \nYou’d be surprised at how many gems\xa0you can\xa0find when reorganising\xa0your wardrobe. And while you\'re at it, make it a priority to categorise clothes, bags, accessories and whatever bits and bobs for easy access. This fine-tuning will no doubt make getting\xa0dressed\xa0a much more efficient process. \nWhere to\xa0begin? Follow the advice from\xa0professional organisers\xa0Esther Tan from Your Tidy Half, and the team behind Orderly, Rae Zhang and Vanessa Yip.\nSTART BY DECLUTTERING\nPurge. This is the\xa0first and very necessary step to\xa0achieving\xa0an easily accessible wardrobe. Remove everything you no longer like or that no longer fits you well. You will never be able to find exactly what you need from a closet that’s bursting at the seams or is occupied mostly by items that are no longer of use.\nTan, a KonMari-certified consultant, said that these are the garments that no longer support your lifestyle or, in Marie Kondo’s famous words, no longer spark joy. She is of the opinion that the decluttering\xa0process is not necessarily about setting a certain number of things one can keep (although the size of your closet does determine this), but should instead be guided by one’s lifestyle and habits.\nYip pointed out a side benefit that decluttering brings. “By going through all of your clothes, you will definitely be reminded of certain pieces that have been neglected, and may want to wear now, since fashion trends change every so often,” she commented. In other words, the process will give you clearer view of your current needs, fashion-wise, and can also guide you in terms of adjusting your shopping habits.""\nShe added: “If you’re having a hard time deciding if a certain item should stay or go, put it in a ‘to-be-decided’ pile. Then, set a reminder to revisit this pile in three to six months. If you’ve not worn any piece of clothing from there, it’s a sign that it has to go. At the end of the day, we should only keep what our space (or number of hangers) allows for. Remember, too, that no amount of purging will help if we keep buying.""\nTo keep a compulsive shopping habit in check, she suggested this: “Only allow yourself to purchase a new piece of clothing if you plan to discard or donate an older item. This way, your wardrobe will always be at its optimum capacity and you’re able to see and access all of your clothing comfortably.”\nPLAN AND ORGANISE WISELY \nAfter decluttering, you should have a better idea of the items you have on hand and can then start categorising and planning how best to store them. Decide which clothes you’d like to fold and which others you’d like to hang up – this will depend on the fabric and even your personal preference. Generally speaking, most knitwear is better folded as putting them on hangers will leave shoulder marks and also cause the knit to stretch.\nFor those who happen to be getting a new wardrobe designed and built, Zhang recommended\xa0including more drawers than deep shelves for better visibility and accessibility.\n“Clothes tend to get lost easily at the back of shelves, while drawers allow for an easy overview of everything in them. If you prefer having some display shelves, opt for a pull out shelf so that items at the back are still within reach,” she explained. \nThis is why it’s a good idea to reserve deep shelves for storing items that you use or wear less often – for example, thick knits, winter wear or even bedlinen.\nREARRANGE CONTENTS OF DRAWERS\nDon’t just stack folded garments one on top of another when storing them in drawers. When you do so, you can only see those that are at the very top, which means you’re likely to forget about the rest that are underneath. To keep them all within sight and easily accessible, the pros suggest “file-folding” them – a well-known KonMari method of folding clothes in a way that allow them to be stored “upright” so that each and every piece is visible at a glance.\n“Drawers are great in supporting the file-folding method and also to house other small items like socks and undergarments. Organisers are recommended only after tidying (up the items in your closet),” said Tan.\nDrawer dividers and inserts are ideal for storing items that are difficult to fold (like socks, undergarments or scarves). You can also use them to segregate your garments – doing so will allow you to quickly locate and access items that you are looking for. \n“They can be very useful in creating sections within a big drawer, and are also great for people who dislike folding as they can simply pop items into the right compartment,” said Zhang.\nA SMARTER WAY TO HANG YOUR CLOTHES\nWhen it comes to hanging garments, there are a couple of techniques to employ for better visibility too. Tan suggested arranging the garments by length first, with the shortest piece at the front; then, sort them out further by type and colour. Doing so will provide some form of categorisation, while ensuring that the shorter pieces won’t be obscured from view.\nColour-coding your clothes will help increase visibility and ease of access too, as it’ll make it easier for you to locate the item you have in mind. At the same time, it’ll also make coordinating outfits a breeze, since you can quickly see what you have in every colour at a glance.\nMAKE USE OF EVERY SPACE\nBoxes and baskets can help you utilise nooks in your closet for storage and also corral items like belts or small bags together. Label each container clearly for easy identification and access.\nYou can even utilise the doors of your closet for storage. By putting up over-the-door hooks or removable 3M hooks (which won’t damage your closet), you can hang up flat items such as belts, scarves or even necklaces on the interior surface of the doors. This will put them in full view when you open your closet, which means you’ll find it easier to pick out the accessories to go with your outfit of the day. \nSTORING SHOES, BAGS & JEWELLERY\nShould shoes be stored in the boxes or dust bags that they came in? It would be a good way to protect them from dust, but doing so can make locating that particular pair you want a frustrating process, unless you label each and every pair of them. \nPlacing them on open shoe shelves would be great, but this is limited by space constraints. Which is why Zhang suggested storing shoes in clear shoe boxes instead (these can be easily purchased online). They’ll improve the visibility of your shoe collection and, also, are a space-saving solution since they can be stacked.\nAs for jewellery, you don’t necessarily have to keep them in the boxes they came in. However, take note that you’ll need to store them in a way that keeps each piece separate, so as to prevent scratches (especially for fine jewellery with pearls or gemstones).\n“You can purchase stackable acrylic drawers with padded or lined inserts for storing different types of jewellery. All these will help you to see your collection at a glance, thus helping you to make decisions more quickly and easily. Putting them away at the end of the day will also be a breeze,” said Zhang.\nFor bags, she recommended grouping similar types of them together and placing them in separate boxes, while bigger statement handbags can be displayed on open shelving or cubby holes, if you have them. This way, you’ll know exactly where to go to find a bag that you have in mind.\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     shopping ', '     Bags ', '     Shoes ', '     Accessories ', '     homes ']}"

      Luxury fashion must stop producing leather goods to be truly ethical
  </h1>, 'text': 'At Milan Fashion Week last September, Kering, the €13 billion (S$20 billion)-revenue luxury group behind Gucci and Bottega Veneta, announced that it would go “entirely fur free” by the end of 2022, following similar pledges made by Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings and Chanel in 2017-18.\nThe announcement was chiefly symbolic, an easy win for a company keen to woo young shoppers who say their purchasing decisions are increasingly being driven by environmental and ethical concerns – and one that will have little impact on the bottom line. When Gucci announced it was giving up fur in 2017, it accounted for less than 0.2 per cent of revenues, and of the group’s six fashion and leather goods brands, only Saint Laurent and Brioni have yet to eliminate the stuff.\nMarie-Claire Daveu, Kering’s chief sustainability officer, framed the announcement as a commitment to “ethical luxury”, describing it to Vogue Business as “another step forward in our commitment to animal welfare and is in line with our commitment to sustainability”.\nYet the ban does not extend to precious skins such as crocodile and python nor to lamb fur (shearling) or, perhaps most importantly, to leather – and its impact on the group’s Environmental Profit & Loss statement will be negligible.\nRenouncing fur is the right thing to do. Animals should not have to live in cages and be slaughtered so that rich people can have new fur coats. The same goes for the reptiles who are farmed or captured so that their skins can be made into handbags and belts.\nBut where does this leave leather? If Kering truly wants to reduce its environmental footprint, cutting back on this mainstay of the industry would be the place to start. By the company’s own estimates, leather scoops up more of its resources than all of the other materials combined.\nBut it is also the single most important driver of revenue and profits for the company, and the soft luxury goods sector at large. It is responsible for about half of sales at Kering, Hermes and Prada. Bio-based alternatives are limited, and unlike precious skins and most kinds of fur, leather is generally agreed to be a byproduct of the meat and dairy industries.\nMost luxury handbags and shoes are made from the skins of young calves, which are smoother and more supple than those of mature cows. Calf skin is worth about 10-15 per cent of the total value of the animal when it arrives at a slaughterhouse – significant, but not enough to reduce the number of calves killed if luxury houses were suddenly to go plant-based.\nBrands argue that leather is a “sustainable” choice: That hides generated by the meat and dairy industries would otherwise rot in landfills, generating more methane as they decompose.\nBut Circumfauna, a research and advocacy group, claims that sending hides to landfills and producing alternatives, even if plastics-based, is a better option, because the energy and chemicals required to turn them into shoes and handbags is so environmentally damaging.\nEither way, luxury brands are helping to fuel a demand for animal products at a time when scientists say we should cut down their use. Animal agriculture accounts for an estimated 15-18 per cent of total green house emissions as well as a great deal of animal suffering.\nAs a vegan and an animal lover, I am quietly horrified when I step into a brand showroom and see rows of bags and shoes made from their hides; my Instagram feed often juxtaposes images of women showing off their new Bottega Veneta calf leather shoes with activist videos of a struggling calf being shot in the head.\nPerhaps the fashion industry might look to emulate Volvo, which announced that it would eliminate leather from its electric cars by 2030, citing “the negative environmental impacts of cattle farming, including deforestation” and a desire to “do what it can to help stop animal harm, by contributing to a reduced demand for these materials containing animal product”.\nLuxury brands have enormous cultural clout. If they were fully to promote a plant-based lifestyle, it could go a long way towards persuading the rest of the world to eat less meat and dairy. That, truly, would be “ethical luxury”.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2021 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      What is this hybrid workleisure trend and would you wear it to the office? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Emily Tan, a relationship manager with a local bank, used to wear fitted dresses with heels along with a nice bag and a full face of make-up to work. Then the pandemic and months of working from home happened, and when she returns to the office (like how some of us have slowly started to do this year), her dressing won’t quite be the same as before. \n“I think I’ll wear looser-fitting dresses with flats, maybe even sneakers, and will probably carry a tote bag and just use light make-up,” she told\xa0CNA Lifestyle. \n“When I was last in the office earlier (in 2021), there were no formal meetings, and many of the meetings were virtual. And with masks on, nobody really knows who you are, and there’s less point in dressing up. For a recent client meeting, I wore my previous OL (Office Lady) attire, but my boss just wore a polo tee. I think it’s definitely acceptable to dress more casually these days.”\nThe style powers that be have bestowed a new fashion term upon this new way of dressing for work – it’s called workleisure. \nIt’s part athleisure (itself a portmanteau of “athletic” and “leisure”; something you can wear both to the gym and to go out) and part traditional work attire. A sporty component with some kind of stretchy material is usually involved – think sporty leggings, a yoga top, a sports jacket or a hoodie. \nAnother key feature is comfort. After a couple of years working from home for many, and rolling up to Zoom meetings in T-shirts and loungewear, it’s become acceptable to see your colleagues and bosses in more casual attire. It’s also hard to go back to stiff shirts, ties, pressed pants and pencil skirts, when you know you can be so much more comfortable in looser dresses, stretch pants\xa0and polo tees.\nLai Han Sam, a life coach and founder of Lifework Coaching, said: “WFH has exposed us to the possibility of comfort while working, and made us push the boundaries of being comfortable yet professional. I do observe the relaxing of the typical corporate formal attire to a slightly more casual way of dressing. Folks are dropping the ties and dress pants and opting for different materials and a more relaxed style. The boundaries of dressing more casually really depends on the culture of your organisation, your industry, the role you are holding and the image you want to project.”\nShe added: “For a start, it may be better to follow the guidelines for workplace attire, and adjust that over time. One must take into account the appropriateness and acceptance in your specific workplace. I know some clients who prefer to dress formally as it is a way to cue their brains to shift into work mode. A few questions to ask yourself to help you decide are: Will it affect your professional brand adversely? Is there a framework of attire in your specific workplace and role? How will dressing differently affect your working style or productivity?”\nFor Serene Lim, a communications professional, the workleisure trend is a welcome change. “I’m lucky to have been in the media and communications industry for my career, where we get more flexibility and creativity around what we wear,” she said. \n“As long as you look presentable and carry yourself professionally, there is no harm in carrying a gym bag or wearing tailored-looking sweat pants instead of a power suit. I can\'t speak for every industry, but even in my previous MNC, there were men wearing casual and sporty shirts to work,"" she said.\n“I think most outfits are good, as long as you don\'t look sloppy or like you\'ve just rolled out of bed. I could wear a Lululemon tank top, a nice cardi, joggers and sneakers to work. And some pajamas can look really chic as separates. Shorts are probably still a no-no at most offices, though,"" she added.\xa0\n""The influence of tech companies has already made it acceptable to dress down, or wear a hoodie to work, even if you\'re a CEO. The pandemic and WFH mandate accelerated this trend. Moreover, attitudes around the office and the role it plays in our lives have shifted. Many companies are adopting a hybrid model, so there is also less expectation to dress up to the nines on the day you do go back to the office.”\nIt seems that workleisure doesn’t just make more sense in our new normal and is more comfortable, it\'s already been trending. Neo Lirong, fashion stylist and founder of White Trousseau, a fashion and lifestyle brand, said\xa0that celebrities like Hailey Beiber and Kendall Jenner and their extremely stylish takes on athleisure and workleisure have pushed the trend to new heights.\n“People are influenced by Hailey Beiber’s style of wearing sweatpants with blazers, and Kendall Jenner’s sporty chic vibe,"" she said. \n“Workleisure can be a very cute trend – a cropped top with track pants and a blazer is chic, but you can still look office-appropriate and professional. A sweat shirt with more formal pants is also a good hybrid look. At the same time, you will be so comfortable at work. Wearing yoga pants out can also be stylish – pair them with an oversized shirt, which is on trend right now. The look can still be quite formal as it has a collar. T-shirts with a blazer or a button-up shirt can look quite okay for the office as well.”\nNeo added: “Even if you work in a bank, high-waisted wide-leg pants would be appropriate, and more comfortable than the old pencil skirts or tight-fit dresses. If you want to wear dresses when you go back to work, people are choosing looser and more casual dresses, compared to figure-hugging frocks. Materials that are soft and loungey like silk or satin are in as well. \n""As for shoes, people are living in sneakers. With no events and fewer formal gatherings, heels are dead. Even if you want to go for more formal shoes, you can choose leather loafers, which are still appropriate for work. Bigger bags are on trend too, for all our pandemic essentials like masks and hand sanitisers. These are the looks that are trending. If you wear your old stuff back to work, it might look like you did not update your wardrobe and didn’t get with the pandemic programme.”\nThe folks who work over at local fast fashion label Love, Bonito fully understand the trendiness and benefits of being utterly comfortable at work, and are embracing this perhaps irreversible change in work culture. Last year, they had an HR initiative where Wednesdays are ‘Wear-Lounge-to-Work Day’, with their 153 employees in Singapore encouraged to take a midweek-break and let it all hang loose.\nAccording to Liu Tingzhi, Head of Design at Love, Bonito, “Workleisure is a newfound expression of workwear that pairs both comfort and style. It is the perfect balance that allows one to go from calls to couch. Materials that make up workleisure apparel tend to lean towards cotton and rayon as people are on the lookout for more breathable, easy-to-throw-on materials.” \nShe added:\xa0“The trend brings about the sensibility of comfort dressing to suit the occasion, with an unspoken rule of looking presentable. We are definitely not expecting someone to rock up to the office looking like they just got out of bed. Too much is when one looks unkempt, sloppy and generally ungroomed. I would suggest building your workleisure wardrobe\xa0with quality pieces that are versatile enough to be paired with jeans, pants, skirts, and yes, you guessed it, loungewear.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     athleisure ', '     workwear ', '     fashion ']}"

      The Singaporean 'club kid' who's his own walking artwork: 'I am a full-time visual spectacle'
  </h1>, 'text': ""I love that Aaron Han describes himself as a visual spectacle. This colourful and iconoclastic 35-year-old Singaporean is well-known to anyone who used to dance the night away at The Butter Factory. Han was the in-house visual artist there, designing gloriously flamboyant sets and costumes to the delight of friends and fans alike.\nToday, Han still dresses as wonderfully unique as ever. From one perspective, similar to artists like Cindy Sherman, he is his own artwork. He teaches fashion as well. And finds the time to collaborate with other artists while pursuing his own projects. \nHI AARON, WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT PROFESSION?\nI teach Fashion part-time at TaF.tc, but I am a full-time visual spectacle.\nWEN YOU SAY VISUAL SPECTACLE, DO YOU MEAN VISUAL ARTIST? I HAVE SEEN YOU DESCRIBED THAT WAY.\nVisual artist is a simplification of what I do. At some point, I was doing stage costumes and fashion styling. I have done set design. I am also a milliner, a graphic designer, and an occasional photographer. \nNormally people love multiple hyphenates, but it gets very self-obsessed\xa0when you are trying to tell people what you do. Ultimately, everything I do revolves around visuals of some sort. I know what power a strong visual can impose upon the viewer.\nWERE YOU CREATIVE EVEN WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG?\nI think everyone is creative. But I will say that I was infinitely curious. I was always in the library reading or I was out exploring, catching insects, and\xa0observing nature. Also breaking things up and putting stuff together again. I did like working with my hands a lot, from arts and craft projects to design and technology. I’ve always been very hands on.\nSince young, I have always been interested in how one visually communicates who he/she/they are as a\xa0person\xa0by what they wear. And from a young age, I was very aware of how I wanted to present myself, and how it made other adults uncomfortable. \nThat curiosity with everything made me look at everything, including how people\xa0interacted\xa0with one another, and their self-image. I understood this from a very young age.\nYOU’RE WELL-KNOWN FOR HAVING BEEN A “CLUB KID”. CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW YOU EARNED THAT REPUTATION?\nYou get drunk one time and suddenly you are a “club kid”! I'm kidding. \nIn a simplified sense, the club kids were a movement of people during the 80s to 90s who wanted to break free from societal expectations, gender norms et cetera and just have fun. \nA big part of fun back then was the nightlife. So people came dressed as\xa0irreverently as they could, to party with wild abandon with no cares or worries – like kids. \nWhen I was the in-house visual artist of the now defunct The Butter Factory, my fairy godparents, Bobby Lou and Ritz Lim, who were co-owners and the OG club kids in Singapore, would throw the wildest parties ever, and they would dress up in the most amazing clothes – I say\xa0clothes because they’ll get angry when\xa0you call what they wore a costume as that’s how they would normally dress. \nAnd so did I, the dressing I mean. I love fashion, and the club kid reputation just happened because I was working in a club.\nWHAT’S YOUR FAVOURITE MEMORY FROM THOSE DAYS?\nHaving a memory implies I was sober. Kidding again. \nI don't have any particular memory that is my favourite. But I will say the most memorable ones are the really big events we had at The Butter Factory. \nI don't think people realise that when it was Halloween or our anniversary, and we would do the set design and costumes and images for marketing and so on, it was a six-month journey of anxiety and panic, and we could only do the set design on the day itself. \nOur big parties were always on Saturday. The club was open on Friday night, meaning everything had to go up during the day on\xa0Saturday. We would be in the club at 9am working non-stop until the door opened at 11pm, and then party all the way till 5am the next morning. To see the final setup in the club\xa0lighting and everyone's reaction, the sense of\xa0satisfaction was amazing.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE TOUGHEST PART OF YOUR OWN CREATIVE JOURNEY?\nCrippling self-doubt. Like Michelle Yeoh (in Crazy Rich Asians) on a staircase whispering “you will never be enough” in your ear, self-doubt will scare you thoroughly and sometimes you will never ever start projects because of it.\nWHAT DOES FASHION MEAN TO YOU?\nFashion means many things to me. But most importantly a way of self-expression.\nWHO OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU?\nPeople inspire me. There was a period in my life where I would take pictures of man-made places, but devoid of people. I didn’t like people in the pictures because they were this element of chaos that could not be controlled.\nEventually when I look back at those images, I realised how much character and culture people are to a place. Bangkok is not Bangkok without its people. Hong Kong is not Hong Kong without some aunty behind you aggressively asking you to move faster. \nPeople’s relationship to themselves and their image, culture and\xa0perceived notions of self is also something that inspires me a lot. We juggle a lot of different voices in our heads, some ours, some manufactured by the media, and everyone reacts so differently to them. That reaction is inspiring in many ways.\nARE YOU WORKING ON ANY EXCITING SHOWS OR PROJECTS NOW THAT YOU CAN SHARE?\nI just ended a virtual\xa0experience\xa0with Pan Pan Gong, or as she is known on Instagram, @Hanfugirl. She is an independent researcher on ancient Chinese history.\xa0We were initially working on some workshops about the Tang Dynasty, but then COVID-19 happened. \nThe plans for the workshop were obviously shelved but she had this idea to create an online experience about the Tang Courtesan house, with interactive elements and a dramatic storyline. So throughout the pandemic, she filmed multiple parts of the interactive video with her collective of girls (adhering to social distance guide lines of course) with the support of National Arts Council. \nI play a small role in the\xa0experience, but this was two years of filming and a work of love. The online experience has just ended its first run but we will be looking to do more in the future, including the proposed workshops. \nRight now, I am also in the midst of my own personal photographic project, capturing the Chinese diaspora imagination and exploring the theme of romanticised Chinese-ness.\nIF YOU HAD THE FREEDOM – BUDGET, SPACE, ETC – TO PRESENT A DREAM ARTWORK, WHAT WOULD YOU PLAN?\nI would give the “freedom” to people to express what they aren’t able to through conventional means, to share their\xa0experiences. What are we but all of our experiences combined? \nThat being said, the hedonistic me would also love to recreate Studio 54, in which everyone is a one-off unique piece of transcendental artwork eating a hamburger. Disco forever baby!\nDO YOU FEEL THAT CREATIVITY IS STIFLED IN SINGAPORE?\nThere will always be\xa0boundaries\xa0to push, barriers to be broken. And like\xa0Jurassic\xa0Park, art will find a way.\nI\xa0think that a lot of things that creatives do here do not have a measurable KPI, which makes it hard for the government to support it. To find some impossible way to measure creativity, to be able to justify a business grant, helps no one but the\xa0bureaucratic audit process and the people who approve and\xa0manage it. \n\xa0\nWe need to rethink how and why we want to give out grants. Are we really fostering a creative culture? How can we make creatives accountable without them having to jump through hoops of fire?\nIF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN BORN IN ANY PLACE AND ANY ERA, WHERE AND WHEN?\nI would not be anywhere but here. I have been really fortunate to have been born in a time where I saw technology crawl at speeds governed by\xa056kb modems and can now witness people dancing for TikToks. Imagine, we grew up in a time when parents would tell you not to board cars with strangers in it but now we book a car driven by a stranger with a phone app. Good times.\nDID YOU MAKE ANY NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS?\nNo. Never had, never will. Who needs the pressure of setting yourself up for failure?\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Creative Capital ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     creativity ', '     Career ']}"

      'Normalise re-wearing clothes': Experts urge consumers to reduce impact of fashion on environment
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Ms\xa0Taahira Mohamed Ayoob stopped buying fast fashion in an attempt to stand out from the crowd.\xa0\nShe still wanted a variety of clothes to wear, so she turned to clothes swapping. But it has now become a way of life for her, fuelled by a desire to be more environmentally conscious.\nA marketing and branding officer in the travel industry, the 29-year-old said she came to realise\xa0she doesn\'t need as many clothes as she had. And that she doesn\'t need something different to wear on each occasion.\xa0\n""When the pandemic hit,\xa0I realised how little clothes I needed to survive,” Ms Taahira said.\nWhen she needs to freshen up her look, she adds an accessory or something to jazz up her outfit.\n“It’s possible to add on elements –\xa0a scarf, a jacket. I borrow from a friend, then return it. I accepted that I don’t have to own something new to wear it.”\nShe said that while it is normal to feel self-conscious about\xa0being seen in the same clothes repeatedly, being okay with doing so comes from a place of confidence.\n“Actually, nobody cares (whether you’re wearing the same outfit). It’s our perception of what people think of us,” Ms Taahira\xa0said.\xa0\nEnvironmental experts\xa0said that the best way for people to be sustainable is to wear what they already have in their wardrobes. Swapping and renting clothes are the next best alternative, they said, and buying new clothes the last resort.\nMr Raye Padit, founder and chief executive of swapping platform The Fashion Pulpit, said there is “no shame” in repeating outfits.\n“Normalise re-wearing clothes,” he said.\n“We have that passed-on belief that it’s not okay to repeat clothes, that it’s not sexy. We need to change that kind of mindset.”\nThe most sustainable thing to do is to wear what is already in your wardrobe, said marketing associate director of Zero Waste SG Jasmine Tuan.\n“We have more than enough clothes in our existing wardrobes. Do we really need to buy another T-shirt, another dress, another pair of jeans?” she asked. “When you look at your wardrobe, you maybe already have these items. The next step is to wear it.”\nOtherwise, people can consider re-gifting the items to friends and family or donate to organisations that will recirculate them responsibly, she said.\nMs Xingyun Shen, country coordinator of Fashion Revolution Singapore –\xa0a global group that calls for greater transparency, sustainability and ethics in the fashion industry – suggested that people reconsider how they want to relate to their clothing.\nWhat would happen if clothes were not as cheap or readily accessible as they are now, she asked.\n“How would we be shopping or acquiring \'new\'\xa0clothes? The first place we would probably be looking at is our wardrobes,” she said, adding that people could also look at friends’ and family members’ wardrobes.\n“Can we borrow and swap clothing from our circle of friends and family? Can we ask our local seamstresses and tailors to fix a split seam or alter something to fit our bodies again?”\nRenting and swapping clothes is growing in popularity and acceptance by consumers in their choice of fashion, said Ms Carolyn Poon, sustainability director at the Textile and Fashion Federation,\xa0Singapore.\nThese alternatives to buying clothes make the “take-make-dispose” linear fashion economy more circular, she said.\n“This is the most direct way renting and swapping help the environment. They extend the lifetime use of clothes that are already produced and consumed,” she said.\nStyle Theory, which offers customers subscription-based plans for renting clothes, has more than 200,000 registered users, said its founder Raena Lim.\nThe firm has done more than 2.3 million rentals and saved more than 600,000 preloved designer wear from “prematurely entering landfills” in the span of five years, she said.\xa0\nSustainability is one of the main pillars driving the firm, Ms Lim added.\n“We know that 60 per cent\xa0of clothing produced ends up in the landfill every year. With the rental model, we have shown that items are kept longer within the fashion ecosystem, which reduces the need to overproduce.”\nAn item is rented an average of 30 times each,\xa0while an item in a women\'s wardrobe is used far less, she said.\nMs Lim acknowledged that the logistics and operations of a fashion rental business also have\xa0a carbon footprint. She said Style Theory has found a good partner who uses environmentally friendly cleaning chemicals.\nThe firm also tries to reduce the number of delivery trips made, she said, adding that it is looking to become more sustainable over time.\nFashion Pulpit has also helped the environment, said Mr Padit. Since opening in 2018, the platform has saved 120,000 items with\xa0swapping, he said. The swapping community has also grown, from 115 members to 2,500\xa0currently.\xa0\nWhile renting and swapping\xa0are touted as environmentally friendly solutions to buying, Ms Shen from Fashion Revolution cautioned against doing too much of these as well.\n“Like how one is prone to over-buy or shop too much, one can over-rent or over-swap,” she said.\xa0\nIn Singapore, fashion and textile products account for 137,000 tonnes of waste, of which “merely” 4 per cent is recycled, said the Textile and Fashion Federation\'s Ms Poon, citing 2020 statistics by the National Environment Agency.\n“We see this somewhat as an urgent priority to develop a whole-of-ecosystems approach in circularity and towards zero fashion waste,” she said.\nOther experts broke down some of the global impact fashion has on the environment. For instance, cotton, one of the most commonly used fabrics, is also one of the most destructive, said Style Theory’s Ms Lim.\n“It can take 2,700 litres (of water) to produce the cotton needed to make a single T-shirt,” she said.\nResearch also shows that 64 per cent of the 32 billion garments produced yearly go to landfills, she added.\nGarment manufacturing also releases 4 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, she said. Chemicals are required to treat and dye textiles,\xa0which contributes 20 per cent of global industrial water pollution.\xa0\nGiven the amount of clothes swapping platforms are collecting, Zero Waste SG’s Ms Tuan questioned if more new clothes even need to be produced.\xa0\nShe said that fashion giants and beauty magazines “tap on the confidence of shoppers”, telling them what is in\xa0and what to wear in which season.\n“But who sets these rules? Who says so? Fashion comes and goes but style is eternal,” she said, quoting fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent.\n“A confident person will wear whatever, and doesn\'t care about trends or what fashion giants manipulate us into wearing.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     sustainability ', '     sustainable fashion ', '     Clothes ']}"

      Going ahead with a VTL vacation? Essentials for your tropical getaway
  </h1>, 'text': ""There is no question that Singaporeans love to travel, and while the recent announcement of the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) freeze from Dec 23 to Jan 20 might have thrown a spanner in the works, there are those who are forging ahead with their travel plans.\nWhether you’ve booked a beach luxe getaway in Fiji to switch off, or a transcendental cultural immersion in Cambodia, or simply just indulging in an eating spree in Malaysia, there’s no reason not to be upbeat.\nWhile it is wise to remain cautious, there is no reason not to open up our wallets. And that includes fattening up our dated wardrobes with the best and latest vacation threads. So relax and let luggage space be the only thing you have to worry about.\nBAGGAGE ALLOWANCE\nThe great thing about packing for a beach vacation is that everything essential tends to be lightweight, so even a week’s sojourn in Fiji doesn’t require more than a carry-on. One of the best travel bags around, this Keepall Bandouliere 55 from Louis Vuitton is part of the Everyday LV capsule. Made from Vintage Monogram canvas on which the Monogram pattern is reminiscent of the stamping technique, it features designer Virgil Abloh’s “louis vuitton!” signature, which is inspired by the ubiquitous branding of chain stores.\nFor daily excursions whether you’re exploring Siem Reap or Colombo, guys can count on this Low Robin Bag from Burberry. Sculpted from natural grainy calf leather with a semi-matte finish, the unobtrusive slim design is punctuated with a Thomas Burberry Monogram clasp and perfectly sized to hold essentials like your wallet and sunglasses.\nLadies on the other hand can opt for the Le Monogrammed Bucket Bag from Saint Laurent. Crafted from canvas and calfskin leather in a gorgeously dark chestnut colour, it has a cord tie closure with adjustable leather strap. The best part is that it manages to be voluminous without being bulky, so there’s plenty of space to throw in the souvenirs you pick up along the way.\nACTION ACCESSORIES\nWe imagine that nothing smells more like a seaside holiday than a fragrance that’s literally named Afternoon Swim. Featuring key notes of Bergamot, Mandarin, and Ginger, this refreshing scent from Louis Vuitton feels like cool, crisp waves crashing on your body on a searingly hot day. Wear it and nothing else while you soak up the rays at your floating Maldivian private villa with just a couple of Mai Tais and satay sticks – and of course, your significant other – for company.\nAnd while you’re sipping on your midday cocktail, keep the sun out of your eyes with this Nylon Bucket Hat from Burberry that is highlighted with a graphic monogram print. Because while a bronzed tan is enviable, you don’t want to risk your face looking red like a beetroot in all your holiday snaps.\nWrist candy always works when you’re on a vacation, because nothing says you’ve switched off like replacing your watch with a leather bracelet. This classy Rivale Double Tour bracelet from Hermes features two rose gold plated Medor studs and a ring on a double-tour calfskin leather strap and is a perfect accoutrement to both casual and formal wear.\nHowever, if you are the type who needs to keep your eye on the clock (so as not to miss the hotel bar’s happy hour, of course), you’ll appreciate this G-Timeless watch from Gucci. Crafted with a steel case and featuring a white dial with planetarium decor, this casual but sleek timepiece is accentuated by a recycled nylon strap with an allover monogram motif and exudes a casually stylish vibe.\nFANCY AND FOOTLOOSE\nWhether you are traipsing along the boardwalks in the Maldives or Fiji, you won’t go wrong with this sleek pair of Izmir sandals from Hermes. Crafted out of calfskin with the iconic “H” cut-out, this silhouette is an essential piece in every wardrobe, and pretty much pairs with any vacation outfit you can think of. If you need to upgrade your footwear for a nice dinner out, simply opt for this espadrille in grain calfskin with rope sole, also from Hermes. The breezy design allows you to be stylish without compromising comfort.\nLadies looking to indulge in extended strolls exploring the coastal cities of Galle or Sihanoukville followed by sessions on the beach will require feet-friendly and waterproof gear. And it is guaranteed that these featherweight Marshmallow flat mule sandals made of moulded rubber from Givenchy will be kind to your feet. The thick graphic sole adds some welcomed height, while the powder pink hue injects dollops of fun.\nFor a stylish night out, keep the pink (incidentally the colour most seen on runways this season) by pairing up your summer dress with this pair of grosgrain sandals from Chanel. The sleek straps lend a sophisticated air, and allow you to dress up your feet without confining them.\nWANDERING WATERBODIES\nThere is no doubt that dips in the pool or sea will be the order of the day, so swim shorts are arguably the most important item to pack, and these turquoise monogram board shorts from Louis Vuitton are discreet without being boring. Tailored from embossed 3D monogram polyester fabric with a textured effect, they feature tone-on-tone eyelets and a signed palladium staple on the back.\nIf you prefer to go bold (and why not while on holiday!), you’ll love these swim shorts featuring one of the iconic camouflage prints of the season from Dolce & Gabbana. You’ll find the side pockets and small zipped pocket on the back infinitely useful when you need some place to store your credit card when you’re ordering drinks at the sunken bar inside the pool.\nMeanwhile, keep the sun out of your eyes with Louis Vuitton’s Escape sunglasses that have a black acetate frame and beautiful rose-tinted lenses. Fans of the brand will appreciate the signature touches, including the iconic Damier pattern on the front and the House’s signature on the side.\nLadies on the other hand can opt for this halter-neck triangle bikini from Burberry which is perfect for poolside lounging. This design features removable padded cups and exaggerated ties for a figure-sculpting fit.\nBut should you be feeling a little bloated from your buffet breakfast, you can conceal the tummy with this understated one-piece V-neck swimsuit from Gucci. With a style reminiscent of the 70s, the subtle ivory hue is livened up by the sparkling stretch jersey and features the distinctive Double G hardware on a removable belt. Top off the look with this gorgeous pair of butterfly sunglasses from Chanel that carries a vintage vibe albeit in a modern interpretation.\nDANDY DAYTRIPPING \nFor days that you do venture out of the resort, a lightweight polo shirt is the perfect vacation staple because it doesn’t look out of place whether on a beach, on a tuk-tuk or at a hip bar like Potatohead. Gucci’s version in green stretch cotton piquet featuring a button-through placket is modern yet casual, and it has an Interlocking G patch that is complemented by a vintage-style contrast collar and sleeve cuffs.\nIf you’re looking for something smarter for an evening out, you can’t go wrong with a well-cut denim shirt. This short-sleeved version in a pale indigo blue from Louis Vuitton is tailored in a slightly loose fit, and specially washed for a faded effect. Pair it with this pair of pleated bermuda shorts from Dior, which showcases an elegant and slim silhouette that is both modern and timeless.\nOr raise the style ante even further without compromising comfort with this pair of pleated trousers from Loewe’s capsule with Paula's Ibiza. Made of lightweight linen and cotton toile in a sand hue, it comes with a removable herringbone belt and loads of louche attitude.\nFor the ladies, nothing is more important than feeling comfortable while on holiday. And this cinched balloon dress from Louis Vuitton couldn’t be more perfect for exploring the colonial streets of Suva. An understated interpretation of a statement dress, it is cut from double wool crepe in a voluminous balloon silhouette that is exaggerated with a cinched hem. An essential chunky chain detail from the collection adds a sculptural embellishment to the neckline.\nEqually light and comfy is this GG embroidered silk duchesse skirt from Gucci. From the Gucci Aria collection, familiar lingerie silhouettes are reimagined as unconventional ready-to-wear pieces, exploring the concept of fashion as a means of self-expression. Pair this daringly with a bralette for some breezy relief in the blazing heat.\nFor a special night out, put on this asymmetric midi dress in silk from Loewe. In cheery tones of beige and yellow, this loose-fit one sleeve midi dress has a gathered waistband at the back and side pockets for your ultimate comfort and convenience.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      Thai artisans revive old crafts to weave new fashion and stories for modern market
  </h1>, 'text': 'PHU PHAN, Thailand: Drawing was a matter of secrecy for Tavee Meboot when she was a little girl. The more she drew, the more money her father had to fork out to buy new notebooks.\nHer family could not afford to keep doing that. So the young Tavee used each notebook sparingly and kept her art secret or until she ran out of pages for her childhood imagination.\n“I liked drawing but we were poor. Each time I needed a new notebook, my dad would ask ‘Why do you buy it so often?’. The notebook was actually for art assignments from school,” Tavee, now 43, reminisced with a smile.\n""I sneakily used it for my own drawings.""\nTavee’s love for art was tucked away in her heart. She grew into a farmer in her hometown of Sakon Nakhon, northeastern Thailand. Her life revolves around the seasons on the Phu Phan mountains, her paddy fields, cassava farm and rubber plantation.\nA few years ago, a motorbike accident kept her immobile for months. That was when she got to know Bhukram - a clothing brand from her small village of Nang Toeng.\nOver the past seven years, Bhukram has revived the disappearing art of cotton weaving in the community. Its artisans are local villagers who grow, weave and dye cotton by hand. With needles and threads, they then tell the story of local livelihoods through intricate embroidery that has given Bhukram its unique character.\nThis is a creation of Pilan ‘Meaw’ Thaisuang, a Thai historian who is passionate about nature and the traditional way of life on the hills of Phu Phan.\xa0\nMeaw grew up in Nang Toeng, where generations of residents have lived a simple life close to nature. Her childhood was shaped by the richness of the forest, where children played and looked for food with their parents.\n“I love this place very much,” said Meaw, who had left home to pursue a university degree and work in Bangkok, 600 km away, for ten years.\xa0\n“I always wanted to come home after finishing my education. I wanted to come back to do something and stay with my parents.”\nBehind her, different kinds of cotton garments fill a new studio. The two-storey wooden building is a place where artisans meet to discuss designs and submit their work for review. The space also functions as a shop and is open to the public every Saturday.\nInitially, Meaw worked as a historian in Bangkok with architects and communities. Her love for local fabrics and history, and longing for nature back home made her study the past of Nang Toeng village.\xa0\nShe discovered that cotton used to be grown along the farmland and harvested for weaving simple garments. It was then handspun into yarn and soaked in natural blue dye from the local indigo plant.\nThen Bhukram was born. Meaw left her regular job for an uncertain career path in the village. Little by little, she worked with local women to breathe new life into the old artform, infusing it with hand embroidery that depicts their livelihoods and the nature around them.\nColourful flowers and trees, streams, farms and paddy fields make up the designs of Bhukram’s products. They range from scarves to jackets, dresses and shirts - all made from cotton by hand.\nEach of them is unique with its own embroidery design that is only produced once to reflect the artisan’s perception of the surroundings. Prices start from about US$45 for a scarf but can go beyond US$500 for a dress.\n“I’m thankful to Meaw for giving me an opportunity to work like this,” said Tavee, who embroiders garments for Bhukram when she is not working on farm chores.\n“This is what I wanted to do when I was little.”\nTo her left, an indigo-dyed cotton jacket shows a beautiful scene of a season change, when flowers bloom on Phu Phan and turn its hills into a colourful palette of red, pink and white. Some of them have fallen into a stream, where white storks search for fish among groups of rocks.\nThe embroidery was inspired by a car ride up the Phu Phan mountains, when her eyes were amazed by the vivid display of colours, and her favourite place at the foot of a hill where her grandmother used to take her to look for mushrooms.\nIn the village of Nang Toeng, 45 embroiderers work with Bhukram. They are relatives, neighbours and friends who mainly farm for a living.\nEmbroidery is usually done when they are free and each piece can take weeks or months to complete.\xa0\nThe artisans are paid when they submit their work. The amount varies according to the intricacy and quality of the needlework.\nFor local women, this is a source of additional income for their families - one that does not require them to change their way of life.\n“The income may not be regular like US$600-900 every month and there is no overtime. But by working from home and doing embroidery, I can sweep the floor, look after my child and my dogs, water my plants, tidy up my house and cook. My work stays with me,” Tavee told CNA.\nMany people her age had to leave home to find jobs in Bangkok, she said, “but I don’t need to do that”.\nGradually, extra income from the commercial handicraft production has improved the life of many women in Nang Toeng.\xa0\nBesides being able to support their families, they also feel a sense of pride and appreciate their financial independence. Being able to earn also means more bargaining power in family discussions and for stay-at-home mothers, the ability to stand on their own feet.\n“When my child asks me for money, the money comes from me - his mother,” Tavee said.\xa0\n“We don’t have to wait for the men.”\nBefore the opening of the studio, Bhukram operated almost exclusively online through its Facebook page, which now has more than 33,000 followers.\nEach collection contains a limited number of items. They are all unique and come with name tags and photographs of the artisans who created them - weavers, dyers, seamstresses and embroiderers.\nA few days before the sale, photos of the garments will be posted online for customers to browse. Most of the products are usually taken within minutes once the sale begins.\nCustomers who cannot buy in time have to wait for weeks or months before a new collection is launched.\n“I’m proud, especially when I receive compliments from customers. I’m even more proud when they want my work,” said embroiderer Areena Tabonglek.\nFive years ago, she moved to Nang Toeng to take care of her mother. At that time, she had no job and only basic sewing skills. But working with Bhukram has changed that.\n“Whenever Meaw posts our work online, I’ll keep checking it. When customers comment ‘Oh wow! It’s so beautiful!’ or write ‘Reserve’,” she said with a broad smile, “I’m proud, so very proud.”\nBesides operating as a clothing brand, Bhukram also tries to communicate with society about preserving nature and the local way of life.\xa0\nAccording to Meaw, the brand does it through its intricate designs, environmentally-friendly materials from nature and traditional production process that engages people in the community.\n“I want people who see our clothes to think ‘the forest of Phu Phan is so beautiful and I want to tell others about it’. I want people in Sakon Nakhon to see how others appreciate it and how our brand is trying to talk about it,” she told CNA.\nThe message is also for its artisans - the local residents of Phu Phan. Their job requires them to closely observe the natural surroundings and use them as inspiration to create work.\nFor embroiderers like Tavee and Areena, they have to come up with their own design once they are assigned a concept for a piece of clothing. It could be a plain dress, jacket or scarf, which still needs to be decorated.\nThis is their canvas, where they tell a story of their home with needles and threads, feelings and imagination.\n“Whether it would be the forest on the hills, the trees or wild daisies, I now spend more time looking at them. In the past, if I saw a tree, I’d think it could be cut. Now, I’ve grown to realise it’s fertility and if possible, I don’t want it to be cut,” said Areena.\nThe wild daisy is her favourite flower because she used to make a crown out of them when she was a little girl.\xa0\nHer embroidery may not exactly mirror its shape, she added, but she always tries to replicate its delicate petals and leaves, curves and gentleness when she works.\n“I try to imitate nature as much as I can.”\nIn its early days, Bhukram had about 130 embroiderers. But as the brand grew, the number of its artisans has dropped to 45.\xa0\nAccording to Meaw, every step of the production is time-consuming and requires attention to detail. Not only that, she added, the artisans also need to enjoy translating ideas into designs and keep improving their work.\n“So, we only have perfectionists who stayed because they really love it,” she said.\nIn Thailand, Bhukram is popular among people who value nature-friendly handicrafts, as opposed to fast fashion.\nFast fashion refers to the mass production of inexpensive, trendy garments that are low-quality and disposable. The business model is common in Thailand and often employs low-paid workers.\nEach year, various practices in the fashion industry have devastating impacts on the environment.\nAccording to the UN, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned every second and if nothing changes, “by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget”.\n“Speed destroys many things,” Maew said. “Slowness, on the other hand, destroys the environment less.”\nFor seven years, Bhukram’s time-consuming production, limited merchandise and unique designs have continued to attract customers from across the country. Many of them flew or drove for hours to attend the opening of its studio in Nang Toeng village.\xa0\n“I’m amazed by their embroidery, which requires a lot of attention and care. Their work isn’t produced en masse like other brands,” said Nitaya Onhan.\nShe took a flight from Bangkok to Sakon Nakhon with her friends and drove for an hour to the village so that she could meet the artisans and buy their work.\n“There is plenty of apparel with embroidery but for many brands, it doesn’t tell a story,” said another customer, Chalunthorn Boonwattanaphon.\xa0\n“What I really like about Bhukram is their stories, which often have animals like buffaloes and paddy fields. It’s like I was transported there and got to share the experience with the embroiderer.”\nThe new studio in Nang Toeng is full of people.\nA hum of conversation can be heard on the ground floor, where customers gather around rows and shelves of garments.\nOutside, a man in an indigo jacket fills the air with his music from a bamboo mouth organ. Above him, a curtain of raw cotton on white strings flutters in the breeze.\nA group of local women sit in a circle on the grass. Their wrinkled hands move with precision as they work with cotton from the fields, turning it into fine threads.\xa0\nOne day, these thin fibres will turn into clothes and echo the story of nature and the small village where they grew.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     fashion ', '     environment ']}"

      This young mum taught herself to sew and started a sustainable kids clothing shop
  </h1>, 'text': 'Some have suggested that raising children can take a tremendous toll on the planet, even when it comes to basic necessities like clothing. And as a mother of two and a founder of a sustainable children’s clothing shop, Raeann Heng is well aware of the natural resources it takes to raise them.\n“A child between the ages of two and four may go through two clothing sizes each year. Multiply that by the number of pieces they own and you may be disposing 60 to 100 clothing items for a single child alone yearly,” said the 27-year-old.\nThe problem is compounded when fast fashion items are priced so cheaply that parents don’t think twice about buying multiple items with similar designs and functions. Some of these items may only be worn a few times and are not made to last.\nDetermined to break the cycle of mindless consumption and careless wastage, Heng launched her online children’s clothing shop Cheeky Feys\xa0in April this year. The clothes are made from locally sourced natural fabric such as cotton, linen and bamboo, as well as upcycled pre-loved fabric. \nUnlike fast fashion brands that produce clothes in large quantities, Heng makes these for Cheeky Feys in small batches, which can also be customised for each child’s body shape. Steering away from fads, it offers more evergreen designs with a vintage touch and a lifetime guarantee on seams for longevity.\nHER MUMPRENEURSHIP JOURNEY\nYou could say Heng’s small business was propelled by the demands of motherhood. The former freelance wardrobe stylist stopped work in 2019 after the birth of her second child, when her 12-hour work days became unsustainable. She has two daughters, five-year-old Ava and two-year-old Brianna.\nWith a passion for the environment, the stay-at-home mother decided to pick up sewing to test her theory that well-thought designs, and customised, comfortable and durable clothes would substantially reduce fabric wastage.\nThe resourceful young mum taught herself to sew via YouTube and later took a class at a community centre. Then, during the early days of COVID-19 in 2020, she used her newly acquired sewing skills to launch a Kickstarter campaign to make a thermal insulated reusable sandwich bag to reduce plastic use.\nOver a period of two years, she also sewed some 30 pieces of clothing for her daughters. When friends expressed interest in her designs, she launched Cheeky Feys.\nSLOW FASHION FOR CHILDREN\nTapping into her styling experience, she curates patterns from indie designers, makes fun edits such as adding bubble sleeves to a particular design, and sources for fabrics with interesting textures and prints. \nAfter orders are placed, she takes one to two weeks to complete the order, often working from 10pm to 2am when her children are asleep.\nHeng generally produces five pieces per design with each fabric. After the fabric runs out, she uses a different fabric. This makes her pieces more unique than mass-produced brands. Prices start from S$28.90 for a pair of shorts to S$55.90 for a limited edition custom-made shirt.\nDefining her business as slow fashion, Heng explained: “Slow fashion generally helps you buy slower. When you make items slower, people will have to buy slower. When you give people time to think about what they are buying, chances are, they will not fall into the trap of impulse buying. If they buy slow, they are also more likely to throw slow.”\nShe added: “There is a surge of fast-fashion brands because it is convenient – you just walk in and buy something because it is cheap. According to BBC, the average American throws away 37kg of clothing each year.""\nHeng continued: “I used to think that mass produced items are cheaper because they are made by machines. But did you know they are actually produced by workers who rush through five pieces an hour at sweatshops, usually in very bad conditions? If you know why it is so cheap, would you still buy it? Or would you choose to change your lifestyle? I did.""\nSUSTAINABLE FABRICS SOURCING\nTo support a circular economy, Heng sources for most of her fabric from small local shops in Chinatown. This ensures that the money and material circulates within the country and strengthens the local economy, she explained.\xa0\xa0\nShe uses natural fibres exclusively. “Natural fibres are more comfortable and also more biodegradable than most synthetic fibres. Some synthetic fibres like polyester or rayon also release toxic substances when produced,” she said.\nWhere possible, Heng sources for pre-loved or unwanted fabric with interesting prints at Goodness Me! Fabric Destash Facebook Group. \nOne of her more interesting finds was a textured ivory cotton costume, which she turned into unique pieces of children’s clothing. To deep clean such upcycled fabric, she soaks them in boiling water, detergent and baking soda.\nTo ensure that even scraps don’t go to waste, Heng also started a Scrap Fabric Swap Facebook group. “As a seamstress, you end up with pieces of odd-sized fabric that might be too small for you to use, or you just don’t want to make a second shirt with the same fabric. \n""This group allows us to swap fabric with no money involved,” she said.\nShe uses the bigger pieces to make clothes and smaller scraps to make reusable dish sponges, which she sells at her shop as well.\nSUSTAINABLE SEWING PRACTICES\nAs a rule of thumb, Heng doesn’t stockpile clothes and only produces each piece when she receives an order.\n“I don’t make in advance to prevent over-production. You never know if a style is going to be a hit or flop. If you have unused fabric, there are so many other possibilities – you can make it into a bag or hat. However, it is harder to repurpose ready-made clothes without wastage,” she explained.\nCheeky Feys also offers customised blended sizes – Heng can lengthen clothes for taller children, or shorten them and increase the waist size for sturdier children who may not be comfortable in the standard styling chart that store-bought clothes come in.\nEach piece is sewn to last. Heng doubles French seams in some cases and physically stretches each piece to stress test it. She also offers a lifetime seams warranty.\n“I realised fast fashion children’s clothes didn’t last when my second child got hand-me-downs from her sister. While the fabric seems fine, the waistbands and hems were coming apart,” she noted.\n“That is why I offer a lifetime warranty on seams. I don’t want people to toss clothes out when the fabric is fine. I want my clothes to not only last for the child, but also be passed down to siblings or friends to reduce the amount of fabric that reaches incinerators,” she added.\nMINDFUL CONSUMPTION STARTS WITH CHILDREN\nSince Heng generally only sews up to 20 pieces a month, she admitted that her production is not large enough to make a significant dent on carbon emissions. But she hopes that teaching children healthy consumption habits can have a ripple effect.\n“As a parent, this is a good time to start teaching children that more is not always better, and that it is important to think about their purchases,” she said. \n“My daughters choose the fabrics and styles they want before I make them. I don’t buy things on impulse that they don’t like and get stuck in the back of the wardrobe. When they like the piece, the same dress can be worn three to four times a week,” she said.\nComfort is paramount. “Some clothes look good but are not practical for the weather or for play. When I was young, my mother made me wear dresses that I could not play in and always asked me to sit properly, hence I did not like dresses. I want to make clothes that children can play freely in,” she said.\nTo teach the value of quality over quantity, Heng has even built a capsule wardrobe for her daughters. \nHer tips: “All you need are three shirts, three pants, two dresses (for girls) and five sets of pyjamas. The design should be simple and timeless, but can be embellished with buttons, folded hems and other special touches. For easy matching, pieces can also be colour coordinated.”\n“As a mother, I see how important it is to preserve the Earth’s resources for the next generation. If we use all these resources in our generation, there may be no unpolluted land, oceans and air. Is this the kind of life we want to leave behind for our children?” she asked.\nIf parents teach children about mindful consumption, sustainability, and encourage them to think before buying, this can reshape the way these children consume for life, she said. \n“This child will go on to live for 80 to 90 years. Imagine the impact their daily choices will have on the environment over decades.”\nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      What to expect in Chanel’s newly renovated flagship in Ngee Ann City 
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’re a regular visitor to Takashimaya Shopping Centre in Ngee Ann City, you would have noticed that Chanel’s boutique has been undergoing a renovation for some time now. \nGood news for fashion lovers and luxury bag enthusiasts – the boutique has now reopened its doors. While the store retains its original units across Level 1 and Level 2 of the mall, it is now expanded to become bigger, measuring 865 sq m in total. The boutique houses all the latest creations of the house, from ready-to-wear, handbags, shoes, accessories and a selection of watches and fine jewellery. \nDesigned by renowned New York architect Peter Marino, the boutique draws inspiration from Coco Chanel’s apartment on 31, Rue Cambon, Paris. Contrasting materials of soft gold metal, bronze and polished surfaces, iconic tweed furnishings blend seamlessly with the house’s emblematic colours of white, beige and black. \nWhat you’ll notice from the sidewalk at first is the boutique’s striking black and white facade. Stepping into the boutique on the first floor, you’ll be greeted with a lavish space dedicated to accessories – from handbags such as the iconic 2.55 and classic flap bag, to small leather goods, costume jewellery and eyewear. \xa0\nA selection of watches and fine jewellery, including the iconic J12 watch and Coco Crush collection, is showcased here. Love Chanel’s iconic two-tone shoes? There’s an intimate shoe salon furnished with a pair of iron, glass and granite console tables and elegant tweed sofas, to try them on in comfort. \nA staircase made of a mirror-like pleated material leads to the second floor of the boutique. Here, a series of rooms allows guests to discover the house’s ready-to-wear collection. In the fitting rooms, you’ll find an enamelled stone sculpture with gold lustre designed by sculptor John Creten, along with paintings of the camellia, also known as Coco Chanel’s favourite flower, by New York-based artist, Peter Dayton. \nSee more photos of the refreshed boutique below. \n\xa0\nFair warning: The boutique attracts quite a bit of a crowd on weekends, so patience is key. We promise the wait is worth it!\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      The hottest Asian celebrity fashion icons of 2021: Jung Ho-yeon, Blackpink, Xiao Zhan, BTS
  </h1>, 'text': ""Style is but a fleeting moment. Thankfully we have the paparazzi (or Instagram) to capture the best moments of 2021. \nFrom Squid Game’s irrepressible Jung Ho-yeon to China’s most popular star Xiao Zhan to Singapore’s very own Aisyah Aziz, not to mention\xa0the hugely popular BTS and Blackpink, CNA Lifestyle rounds up Asia's cool set. \nAre your favourites on the list? Scroll on to find out.\nJUNG HO-YEON\nFrom Squid Game player 067 to Louis Vuitton’s unofficial player 001 of the year. The 27-year-old actress-model exchanged her blood-stained green tracksuit for shiny monogrammed ensembles dreamt up by fashion great Nicolas Ghesquiere, who's known for\xa0dressing up the likes of\xa0Alicia Vikander, Nicole Kidman and\xa0Emma Stone, after being named the global ambassador of French luxury label in October.\nEXO’S KAI\nStar of\xa0new Netflix series New World, Kai, who made the cut for GQ UK’s 50 Best Dressed Men of 2020, is known for pushing fashion frontiers with his ever-changing hair colours and cutting-edge style. \nThe member of K-pop boy band EXO went down in fashion history as the first Korean male ambassador for Gucci. The Italian marque even launched a capsule collection, Kai x Gucci, inspired by the singer earlier this year. The star recently starred in a special Aria campaign for the brand. And if you’re wondering how he gets his flawless complexion, well, Kai is the first male muse for Bobbi Brown.\nBLACKPINK \nIt’s fashion, darling. And the fashion set has its sights set on Blackpink: Lisa fronts Celine, Chanel snapped up Jennie, Rose is associated with Saint Laurent while Jisoo is linked to Dior. No prizes for guessing which is the best-dressed K-pop girl group.\nJACKSON WANG\nThe 27-year-old China-based singer-host has style running through his veins. A friend of top luxury houses such as Cartier, Fendi and Armani, Wang is also creative director of Team Wang Design, a streetwear label he founded. \nEverything in his collection comes in his favourite colour: Black. But Wang doesn’t limit his fashion outings to just Team Wang merchandise. The ex-fencer doesn’t shy away from colours. Wang stole the show in a fiery red suit at GQ China’s Men Of The Year event in November. \xa0\xa0\nSAMMI CHENG\n2021 was\xa0a big year for Cheng. She released a new music album, played ambassador to Lancome and even found time to cameo in a yet-to-be-released movie directed by Hong Kong actor-director Stephen Fung. \nBesides staying abreast of the star’s career, her 836,000 followers on Instagram are regularly updated on the latest in the curious and wonderful world of fashion. Luxury and sports labels alike shower the 49-year-old singer with fresh kicks, new must-have bags and clothes, sometimes even ahead of drops at the stores. \nSo, if you must know what’s the latest fashion trend, head on over to Cheng’s Instagram (@sammi_chengsauman) to stay up to the minute.\nG-DRAGON\nKorea’s best-dressed OG celeb, G-Dragon is a firm favourite with top fashion houses like Givenchy, Balmain and of course, Chanel – the singer has been an ambassador of the French fashion house since 2017. \nThe 33-year-old\xa0who owns fashion label\xa0PEACEMINUSONE,\xa0has been creating style ripples with a slew of sold-out sneaker collaborations with Nike. \nThe Air Force 1 Para-Noise and Para-Noise 2.0 kicks got snapped up faster than you can say ‘go’. The recent follow-up PEACEMINUSONE x Nike Kwondo 1 shoe that launched on\xa0Dec 3 expectedly sold out in a blink of an\xa0eye.\nNAOMI WATANABE\nKnown as the Japanese Beyonce, the 34-year-old shot to fame after impersonating the queen of pop. The curvy comedian may not be your conventional Japanese celebrity but instead of trying to fit into stereotypes, Watanabe actively champions body positivity,\xa0taking\xa0pains in\xa0dressing to the nines for every on-screen appearance.\nShe started Punyus, a women’s fashion label that stocks sizes from a Japanese S to 6XL. Watanabe didn’t just want to cater to the plus-sized as she said that would be “discriminatory”. The face of Kate Spade, Watanabe is a self-confessed fashion addict who has a taste for Gucci, Chanel and Louis Vuitton. She told Vogue that she is glad that most high-end brands don’t make things in plus-size. “If I were skinnier, I’d be completely broke.” \nXIAO ZHAN\nOne of China’s shiniest stars, the singer-actor is arguably one of the most sought-after celebrities. His 29.6 million followers on Weibo love him, but not nearly as much as the luxury labels. \nThe 30-year-old is credited for sparking major shopping sprees with fans coveting everything the star endorses. The Untamed actor signed with Tod’s as brand ambassador in May causing sales to rocket and items endorsed by the star to sell out almost immediately after news of his endorsement broke. The same happened when he signed with Swiss watchmaker Zenith in July and Gucci in October.\nGIANNA JUN\nSince the hit K-drama series My Love From The Star, in which Jun played Cheon Song-yi, an A-list actress with the\xa0chicest wardrobe known to mankind,\xa0the 40-year-old has been acclaimed as one of South Korea’s most stylish actress. Jun was handpicked by British luxury label Alexander McQueen as its first Korean ambassador earlier this year.\nSIMU LIU\nIn case you haven’t already noticed, the Shang-Chi star is ripped. With a body like his, it’s hard to go wrong when it comes to getting dressed. The Canadian Chinese actor is known to stick to handsome fashion classics like fitted suits, snug tees and casual sweats, that are all better to show off his six-feet-tall physique.\nDILRABA DILMURAT\nA red-carpet favourite, the gorgeous Chinese star recently made headlines for turning\xa0heads once again for her impeccable style at Elle China’s annual event. The 29-year-old showed up in an Haute Couture gown by China’s foremost fashion designer Guo Pei. \nThe heavily embellished dress was so heavy and restrictive that it required a few assistants to help the You Are My Glory star walk down the red carpet. The star was heard apologising to the media for moving\xa0slowly. \nWhile waiting for the star to slowly make her way to the photo wall, the media noticed two nearby ushers\xa0gazing intently at the star, smiling to themselves and\xa0clocking\xa0their heads as Dilraba\xa0inched by.\xa0The video clip of the star-struck ushers subsequently went viral.\nBTS\nThe seven-piece K-pop boy band is undoubtedly\xa0the most watched celebrity set in the world.\xa0They took a little over three hours to amass one million followers on popular social media platform TikTok.\xa0What they do, say and wear clearly matters.\nThe boy band's\xa0versatile\xa0style\xa0caught the eye of the late designer extraordinaire Virgil Abloh, who\xa0snagged them\xa0as brand ambassadors for Louis Vuitton to showcase Abloh's unique brand of elevated streetstyle.\xa0\nAISYAH AZIZ\nKnown for her velvety pipes, singer-songwriter Aisyah is also hailed as a fashion icon in her own right. Associated with labels like Valentino, Gucci, Balenciaga, Loewe, Calvin Klein, Timberland and\xa0Onitsuka Tiger, just to name a few, the Sugar singer doesn’t give two hoots about conventions and stereotypes, preferring\xa0to march to her own fashion beat. She has carved out a distinctive cool girl vibe. \n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     celebrity ', '     K-pop ', '     K-drama ']}"

      You may now kiss the avatar: What's it like to get married in the metaverse?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Traci and Dave Gagnon met in the cloud, so it only made sense that their wedding took place in it. On Labour Day weekend, the couple – or rather, their digital avatars – held a ceremony staged by Virbela, a company that builds virtual environments for work, learning and events.\nTraci Gagnon’s avatar was walked down the aisle by the avatar of her close friend. Dave Gagnon’s avatar watched as his buddy’s avatar ambled up to the stage and delivered a toast. And seven-year-old twin avatars (the ring bearer and flower girl) danced at the reception.\nHow the immersive virtual world known as the metaverse, which few of us understand, will change the traditional wedding is, at the moment, anyone’s guess. But the possibilities of having an event unfettered by the bounds of reality are interesting enough to consider.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology is already being incorporated into ceremonies more than ever. Zoom weddings have taken place, and some in-person ceremonies now feature a livestream component for guests who cannot be there. Last year, a couple whose wedding was cancelled because of the pandemic staged a (non legal) ceremony within Animal Crossing, a popular video game.\nLike a ceremony within a video game, any weddings that occur solely in the metaverse are currently not legal. (Even virtual weddings by videoconference, which many states allowed during the height of the pandemic shutdowns, have since been outlawed in New York state and elsewhere.) Still, the metaverse will take these virtual celebrations much, much further, experts say, and offer almost boundless possibilities to couples.\n“There’s no limitations,” said Sandy Hammer, a founder of Allseated, which creates digital planning tools for weddings. The company is investing in the metaverse by creating virtual versions of real-world event spaces like the Plaza Hotel in New York. “If you really want to do something different, in the metaverse you might as well let your creativity go wild.”\nThink guest lists that number in the thousands. Gift registries that feature NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. Maybe even destination weddings in space.\n“They’re going to take their friends on a space rocket,” Hammer said, adding that she envisions wedding parties globe-trotting virtually. “A bride can transport her guests into the metaverse: ‘I want my morning session to be in Italy, my evening session to be in Paris.’”\nNathalie Cadet-James, a wedding planner and designer based in Miami, is approaching the metaverse with “a beginner’s mind of excitement,” and trying to anticipate how her role will change. “I think my role might be more like a producer or film director,” Cadet-James said. “I could create a set that I’ve enhanced. Flowers might come out of the ground as you’re walking into the space. I would add whimsy and fantasy to it – because we could.”\nOf course, this would require the skills of a software engineer, a role not in any typical wedding budget at the moment.\nThe Gagnons had a hybrid wedding of sorts. The two were married in person Sept\xa04 at Atkinson Resort; Country Club in New Hampshire, where they live, in a ceremony officiated by David Oleary, a friend and colleague of theirs ordained by the Universal Life Church, while simultaneously hosting a virtual ceremony in Virbela.\nThey livestreamed their nuptials for those who could not be there in person. Guests of the virtual ceremony attended via computer, which required downloading software and then creating an avatar.\nBoth Traci Gagnon, 52, and her husband, 60, work as agents at eXp Realty. The brokerage has embraced virtual work and the metaverse and is part of eXp World Holdings, which also owns Virbela.\nBefore the couple met in person, their avatars met at a company event in Las Vegas in 2015. And when they announced their engagement in 2019, their co-workers offered to remake Virbela’s cloud campus into a wedding venue, free of charge. (Traci Gagnon estimated that it would have cost US$30,000 (S$40,850) had they paid for it; representatives for Virbela declined to disclose a price for the event.)\nThe Gagnons sent pictures of themselves and their wedding decor to Virbela’s events team and software engineers, who incorporated personalised details like bird of paradise flowers and images of their in-person venue into the virtual ceremony.\xa0\n“They were able to take my wedding dress and customide it, and take a little flower halo and put it on my hair,” Traci Gagnon said.\nPatrick Perry, director of event sales and partnerships for Virbela, said the cost of holding an event in the metaverse “depends on what you want,” adding, “if there’s an engineer building out an MGM ballroom or something of that nature, then the cost goes up,” ranging from a few thousand dollars to well over US$10,000.\nBut, Perry said, as the metaverse gets built out, “there’s going to be more plug and play assets.” Wedding couples will be able to select from predesigned venues, flowers, tablescapes, dresses, musical entertainment and other elements.\nVirbela was designed to be an immersive platform for organisations to host events and build a sense of community in the metaverse. But users have asked the company to host graduations, bar mitzvahs, weddings and other celebrations. Lately, Perry said, Virbela has started to explore the wedding market and is in the planning stages with a few couples.\nHammer said Allseated has not yet worked with a couple interested in having a wedding that only takes place in the metaverse. In addition to the legality of such a ceremony, a hybrid event like the Gagnons’ is “much more in-demand and realistic,” she said, “because couples want both in-person and virtual experiences.”\nFor Traci Gagnon, who hired two videographers, one to capture the in-person event and another to simulcast the ceremony to the cloud, the whole point of the metaverse element was the connection it offered.\nHer maid of honor, who is ill, was still able to walk her down the aisle, if virtually. And Dave Gagnon’s friend, who was unable to attend because his wife has preexisting health conditions, could deliver his toast. The experience of moving through a virtual world as an avatar – a kind of idealised version of yourself – creates a more immersive, emotionally satisfying experience than Zoom, Traci Gagnon said.\n“There is a different level of connection” with the metaverse, she said.\nBeing a metaverse bride had other benefits, too.\n“I’m always a size 4, even in January,” she said, laughing. “And I never have a bad hair day.”\nBy Steven Kurutz © The New York Times.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n', 'related_topics': ['     weddings ', '     metaverse ', '     fashion ', '     technology ', '     Tech ']}"

      The woman building a retail community around sustainable fashion and beauty brands
  </h1>, 'text': ""The global market for sustainable products is growing fast. Big brands have begun to realise how important it is to manufacture sustainably, using eco-friendly materials and ethical processes. At the same time, an ever-growing roster of young entrepreneurs, driven to make their marks and make a difference are launching small businesses, selling everything from cruelty-free beauty products to zero waste clothing. With so many brands, big and small, getting into the space, it can sometimes be difficult to find and decide which to support.\nEnter ZERRIN, launched at the end of 2017 by Susannah Jaffer, who has been based here for the last nine years. Formerly a magazine editor, Jaffer grew disenchanted with her own profession, and fuelled by a belief in sustainable fashion and retail, launched ZERRIN, which is both a retailer for sustainable brands as well as a creative agency that can help these brands better market themselves. \nWith the rise in conscious consumerism, and Christmas just around the corner, I thought it was a perfect time to check in with Susannah.\nWHAT FIRST BROUGHT YOU TO SINGAPORE?\nI moved to Singapore in 2012 – I was 21 at the time – with an offer to teach English in a language school. Unfortunately, the visa fell through when I arrived. I was able to get a pass as a university graduate to work in Singapore for six months and ended up in a PR internship, and that was followed by a full-time role in magazines and media. \nWHEN DID YOU START REALLY GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY?\nI think it came about through a cumulative realisation of how the industry really works, coupled with a sense of longing to participate in fashion in a more meaningful way; beyond the pretentiousness, beyond the “latest trends”. It was more so in late 2015/2016 when I grew the most tired of the typical narrative of mainstream brands… and even, media. \nI learnt most about the impact of fashion and its complex supply chain through independent brands I came to support. That led me to doing more research which really lifted the veil for me on the impact clothing production and consumption has on the planet. For me, discovering fashion done in a better way, which is what sustainability encompasses, was a vehicle for mindfulness in my life, maybe in the same way as yoga, meditation or veganism may be for someone else.\nWHAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR STARTING ZERRIN?\nI started ZERRIN because I wanted to help streamline the process for an everyday citizen like me to find stylish, quality sustainable brands. My research and interactions with brand owners had also shown me that they struggled with marketing, creating content and finding sales channels that truly added value.\nI also wanted ZERRIN to be a resource and a hub of inspiration, and to cultivate a different narrative around consumption; one that felt inclusive and uplifting versus exclusive and toxic. Fashion has played a huge part in shaping culture, but so has the way we write and share about it. To create systemic change, I think all of us who put out communications; brands, PR, journalists, broadcasters, influencers, all have the power to shape a whole new narrative around fashion consumption for the next generation. With culture change comes systemic change.\nHOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GO FROM IDEA TO ACTUALLY LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS?\nIt took about a year. I first sent a pitch deck out to brands at the end of 2016, and I built the business on the side all throughout 2017, evenings and weekends. As a sole founder, I found it tough at times, with limited resources or individuals to soundboard ideas off, but got there in the end.\nHOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO SOURCE BRANDS THAT YOU CAN TRULY SAY ARE SUSTAINABLE?\nIt’s not easy. Sustainability is now such an overused word. It’s become nebulous. Different brands and founders interpret sustainability in different ways. When it comes to smaller, independent businesses, which is the area we play in, many are limited by resources and the right connections to create a completely sustainable supply chain. \nTo help guide us internally, we created a framework (the Better Brand Framework) that analyses a brands approach to five core areas: People, planet, product, packaging and principles. If they have made (and are making) solid, tangible moves in those areas, combined with a quality, original product, we’re interested; I see it as our role to also help them develop along the way. We’re also very transparent about this; all brands we work with are at different stages of their sustainable journey. There’s no such thing as perfection, no matter how circular your model or recyclable your product.\nWHEN SOMEONE SAYS A BRAND IS CONSCIOUS OR SUSTAINABLE, DOES THAT ALSO MEAN IT’S CRUELTY-FREE/VEGAN/PLANT-BASED AS WELL?\nNo. You can have vegan beauty products that aren’t cruelty-free – of course, it’s hypocritical if they’re not but it happens – and you can have more sustainable fabrics that aren’t plant-based, like recycled polyester. It’s important for consumers to have a more nuanced understanding of this so that they’re supporting brands that are actually doing what they say they are. At the same time, companies should avoid being vague and be straightforward with the actions they are taking, and what their claims actually mean.\nI UNDERSTAND THERE IS A LOT OF GREENWASHING IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY TOO.\nThere are organisations that believe sustainability will give their company a competitive edge, so will jump on the bandwagon in whatever way they can. I think some of the biggest greenwashing is coming from the fast fashion industry – from companies that are producing millions of items each year, and a huge portion of the world’s waste, while saying they are creating conscious lines and recycling to mitigate their impact. They aren’t focusing on the crux of the problem, which is overproduction. The cycle is exhausting and needs disrupting. Thanks to social media, more and more citizens are seeing through this.\nOn the flip side, given today's cancel culture, there’s also companies that are afraid to implement sustainability practices because they are too scared to make mistakes and get torn down. What cancel culture has also done is completely eliminate empathy and the capacity everyone has for change from the conversation. That’s wrong. Ultimately, I think companies shouldn’t be afraid to make a start, as long as they are being transparent, honest and upfront about where they are and want to go. More than anything, I feel like consumers are just looking for honesty and authenticity from brands today, whatever moves they’re making.\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THRIFTING VERSUS SELLING NEW PRODUCTS?\nI think there’s a place for all alternative means of consumption, from thrifting to swapping to renting, to buying from a more sustainable brand. People need options, for different reasons. If I look at the consumption habits of my friends or customers, they’re not exclusively loyal or tied to one means of acquiring products. They’re sometimes motivated to buy new, sometimes swap, or rent a dress when they know they’re not going to wear something more than once. We need all of these options to build a more ethical, equitable fashion system. We’re all multifaceted as human beings, and so are our sartorial choices.\nOf course, options like thrifting are more cost effective, i.e. cheaper or the same price as new fast fashion items, but just like any means of consumption it’s not perfect. A lot of items in thrift stores are starting to be lower quality as they’re effectively second-hand fast fashion and reflective of what’s currently circulating in the market. It’s a great way of experimenting with trends in a more circular way, but not every thrifting trip will be successful, nor will you necessarily find clothing that will last you a long time.\nI also think it’s important to remember that the second-hand market wouldn’t exist without the first-hand market. From rental platforms driving revenue by hiring out the latest cult designer dresses, to pre-loved marketplaces selling bags on consignment, to swap stores building inventory through people’s unwanted clothes; all of this ‘inventory’ came from people buying new stuff in the first place. \nWhile there’s already plenty of products in existence – and I believe if you’re going to create something new, you should have a jolly good reason to and make it count – if people stopped producing new products, within a few years or less this would have repercussions for the second-hand market. For example, everyone that’s thrifting Y2K fashion looks right now; they were all new clothes produced and circulating when I was growing up. In a way, both second-hand and first-hand markets are actually reliant on each other for survival.\nHOW DID YOU LAUNCH ZERRIN? \nI did the typical; doing market research, gathering data, speaking to business owners and potential partners. But honestly, a lot of the business was also built on gut feel and I knew I would learn and pivot as I went. We started our marketplace with 14 brands, and I set the website live at my kitchen table.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR YOU AND THE BUSINESS?\nMentorship, growth and lack of resources. Ultimately, we’re a bootstrapped startup, so everything has been built on a shoestring budget; I’m quite proud of how far we’ve come despite the odds and the way we’ve developed. Letting people in; as I’m not one to usually ask for help. Finally, support and mentorship has been a big one; I think if I'd had mentors around to soundboard ideas and get advice, I could have pivoted in certain ways faster than I did. \nAS THE FOUNDER, WHAT PART OF THE BUSINESS DO YOU FOCUS ON THE MOST?\nOh, it’s everything at the moment. As I’ve hired on the retail side this year, I’m able to spend more time looking at partnerships and content and our agency clients. \nHOW BIG IS THE BUSINESS TODAY? DO YOU HAVE A BIG TEAM?\nWe’re a team of two\xa0plus one intern. So, we’re small but mighty!\nWHAT DO YOU WISH YOU KNEW BACK IN 2017/2018 THAT YOU KNOW NOW?\nI’d tell myself to stop wasting time on self-doubt, and to remember that building a business is going to be an exceptionally lonely journey at times; but also rewarding. I’d also tell myself to build a team earlier and say ‘yes’ to any offers of help and not let my pride or guilt get in the way. \nHOW MUCH OF THE BUSINESS IS FROM THE STUDIO ARM VS THE RETAIL SIDE?\nIt really varies from month to month. Retail has busier months and quieter months; natural ebbs and flows that most in the industry experience. It’s usually about 55 per cent studio, 45 per cent retail on any given month. But then, there are some months that retail is 60 per cent, studio is 40 per cent.\nHOW CAN CONSCIOUS BRANDS BETTER MARKET THEMSELVES? WHAT MISTAKES DO YOU FREQUENTLY SEE?\nBrands should look more at how effectively they’re sharing their product and its key USPs and how they’re balancing that messaging with the sustainability and social impact side of what they do. \nMy observation is that most designers aren’t marketers; they’re creatives at heart that want to focus on the making rather than the marketing strategy, content roll out and community building.\nActually, some of the best performing brands at ZERRIN are not founded by trained designers, but those from other backgrounds and skill sets, for example marketing, communications, and advertising. It just goes to show that having a great product is only part of the equation. My other observation is that you can’t flog a poor quality product, no matter how sustainable it is.\nDO YOU HAVE ANY PERSONAL FAVOURITE BRANDS OR PRODUCTS ON THE PLATFORM?\nHaha. I don’t do personal favourites, but I’m proud of labels and founders who really get it together and are constantly looking to improve. \nI love the label Wray Crafted; they have a special place in my heart because of the fact I’ve watched them grow; from meeting the founders at a ZERRIN event to stocking their label in our store. They’ve consistently been one of our best performing brands. \nI also love Dorsu, a label we carry from Cambodia, which are upcycling local quality deadstock from big nearby factories into their capsule of evergreen, versatile basics. They create an infinitely better working environment and value proposition for female garment workers in the context of the country too, which is a well-known hub of fast fashion production and labour rights abuses.\nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC BEEN FOR YOU GUYS?\nIf I look back, the pandemic has really been about growth for us, and a big learning curve for me personally. I made my first hire in 2020, which was a big step, and having someone else’s perspective has really helped to shape and lay so many great foundations for the business. \nI think an increased focus on sustainability has also really made people locally and internationally discover and pay attention to our business. We’ve seen our customer base, following, and inbound enquiries significantly increase during the last two years. But with that comes additional challenges; how do we grow purposefully? In a way that’s still of radical value to our community? \nDO YOU SEE ZERRIN AS A COMMUNITY OR AS A RETAILER?\nGood question! It’s always been a goal to create a like-minded community at the heart of our concept; of customers and readers, of brands. We’ve definitely been doing that, but are looking to focus on this even more in 2022.

      Where to buy plus-size lingerie: 8 of the best brands to embrace those curves
  </h1>, 'text': 'Shopping for lingerie is serious hard work, especially for plus-sized women who often lament a lack of options. \nTake a look around and you will soon realise that there either isn’t a plus-sized extension or the options are, unsurprisingly, very limited or mostly frumpy-looking, making browsing the available choices downright depressing. \nAnd this\xa0completely runs counter to why women enjoy wearing lingerie in the first place – to feel confident and look amazing. \nBut plus-size lingerie needn’t be an oxymoron if you know where to look. So before you throw in the towel for what seems to be a futile pursuit, CNA Lifestyle rounds up eight lingerie purveyors who made it their business to help curvy women look and feel like a bona fide queen.\nASOS CURVE\nIt’s no secret that Asos carries one of the widest selections of plus-sized apparel among online retailers, and that includes an impressively varied range of stylish lingerie made for curvy women. Besides its in-house label, it also stocks designs by a number of other lingerie brands – in other words, there will truly be something for everyone, whether they prefer their lingerie trendy, sexy, comfy-casual or basic. \nhttps://www.asos.com/ \nSAVAGE X FENTY\nWhen inclusivity icon and mega-celebrity Rihanna launches something, one can safely assume she’ll go all out, as well as pull out all the stops. Like her beauty line, Fenty Beauty, her lingerie brand is awe-inspiringly diverse when it comes to size inclusivity and design variety.\nBand sizes go up to 46, cup sizes go up to a H, while slips and loungewear go up to 3X – an impressively extended size range that’s hardly seen in the women’s undergarment industry. The designs veer – in true Rihanna fashion – towards the more adventurous and provocative, and will appeal to those who identify with her bold personality and sense of style. \nhttps://www.savagex.com/ \nADORE ME\nChemises, bodysuits, babydolls and bustiers in plus sizes are challenging to find – particularly tasteful ones of a reasonable quality and affordable price. This US-based lingerie brand has a pretty selection of them, available in sizes up to 4X. At prices like these, you can easily purchase quite a number of sets. Best of all, they ship direct to Singapore for a low fee.\nhttps://www.adoreme.com/\nTORRID CURVE INTIMATES\n\xa0\nThis US plus-size apparel brand is where many women head to for trendy clothing that fit and flatter their curves. Its lingerie department is filled with similarly stylish and youthful essentials, as well as sexy pieces reserved for special occasions.\nhttps://www.torrid.com/ \nCACIQUE INTIMATES\nA lingerie offshoot by Lane Bryant (also a US plus-sized apparel brand), Cacique Intimates combines modern design with an elegant French-inspired twist. Here, you’ll be able to find playful lingerie styles that are tastefully designed, and also foundation bras and undies in silhouettes and fabrics that look stylish and well-made.\nhttps://cacique.lanebryant.com/ \nSHEIN\nFor those who are on a budget, head to fast-fashion favourite Shein for one of the most affordable plus-size lingerie collections around. There’s practically nothing that’s over S$40 in its lingerie section, while some pieces cost under S$10, which means you can go ahead and add a few more picks to your cart. The range is pretty impressive, in terms of styles available – you can find shapewear, everyday bras and undies, as well as sexy lingerie.\nhttps://sg.shein.com/ \nAERIE\nEven if it doesn’t have the most extensive plus-size lingerie collections out there, Aerie makes an effort to be inclusive by producing sizes up to XXL and a DD cup. Plus, it has a great selection of bralette and wireless bra styles, which are pretty, comfy and affordable to boot. Pieces in plus sizes are also made to provide with higher coverage for a better fit.\nhttps://www.ae.com/us/en\nASHLEY STEWART\n\xa0\nAnother American apparel maker that caters to the plus-size market, Ashley Stewart stocks every wardrobe essential, from casual wear, evening wear to sportswear, shapewear and, of course, lingerie. There’s a solid selection of full-coverage bras that don’t look frumpy, as well as babydoll, bodysuits and other undergarment basics.\nhttps://www.ashleystewart.com/\n', 'related_topics': ['     shopping ', '     fashion ', '     women ', '     Lingerie ', '     plus size ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Travelling to a ‘cold country’? Here’s what you need to stay warm – and stylish
  </h1>, 'text': ""You’ve been counting down the days for almost two years. Finally it’s possible to leave our tropical island and return without having to endure painfully long quarantines – at least not for some places you’ll hopefully be returning from.\nWhile the pandemic may have taught us to religiously add face masks and hand sanitisers to our daily mental checklist, it hasn’t dampened our enthusiasm for escaping to foreign lands. In fact, it is plainly clear that Singaporeans are yearning to travel with airline websites crashing and travel agents facing snaking queues.\nBut before you round the year off with festive carolling on the streets, strolls in wintry gardens, gluhwein at Christmas markets and snow fights in the countryside (and dare we say, nights out in a club!), don’t forget to update your wardrobe. Because we know the last time you bought winter wear was in 2019.\nHere’s to not feeling isolated from the rest of the world any more.\nSWEATER WEATHER\nThe portion of any vacation where feeling comfortable is of utmost importance is on the flights to your destination and back. Spending 12 hours in a tight shirt during which it bunches up around your waist is hardly advisable. Stick to a combination of a T-shirt and sweater, such as this Lignes Graphiques zipped high-collar version from Hermes. Made from wool and cashmere, its rib-trim collar keeps your neck feeling cosy on the plane and can be conveniently zipped open should it get too warm in your seat.\nLadies can go for this beautiful and unique shetland wool jumper from Bottega Veneta. Its relaxed fit and gaping arms allow for mobility while still keeping you feeling fuzzily warm as if you’re wearing a hug. The neutral cement grey hue means it can easily be dressed up or down with pants or a skirt, and take you from the plane seat directly to Harrods.\nAlternatively, opt for this Fendi cropped cardigan with V-neck and ribbed edges and fastened with customised FF buttons. Made of beige velvet and viscose, it is embellished all over with a jacquard FF Karligraphy motif and will keep you feeling snug yet sexy.\nBOOT CAMP\nWearing boots in Singapore’s warm weather is simply impractical, so what better opportunity to break them out than when you’re traipsing through the wintry season. Inspired by biker boots, these iconic ones from Prada’s Monolith line are a sight to behold with straps that hold nylon pouches. They look great paired with a wool dress or cashmere coat and will fit right in when you’re sauntering through Camden Market.\nMen can opt for the Rivoli Sneaker Boot from Louis Vuitton. This version comes in supple leather embossed with Louis Vuitton's iconic Monogram pattern, and the classic hi-top is enhanced by refined detailing, including a metallic calf leather trim, so you can be on trend whether you are in Manhattan or Munich.\nWET SEASON\nYou may be praying for snow when you’re travelling during wintertime, but what you’re more likely to encounter is rain – very cold rain. Stay warm and dry while crossing Central Park with this hooded raincoat from Prada that reinterprets bomber jacket details on an oversized parka-style silhouette. Made of Re-Nylon – an industrial-inspired fabric that is emblematic of the brand and made from recycled plastic trash collected in the ocean – the garment is unquestionably warm and functional.\nLadies can repel the wetness with this boldly chic stretch nylon hooded parka from Bottega Veneta that’s been crafted in an unmissable lollipop pink (so you can still look like a bright beacon of style in your Instagram photos amidst the grey and gloom of your surroundings). Its relaxed fit allows for mobility – and for you to tuck your handbag within, because we all know how disastrous it can be to get your essentials damp.\nTHE JACKET\nIf you’re lucky, you’ll have sunny days with blue skies. But the crisp weather will still call for snug outerwear, and men never can go wrong with a well-cut bomber jacket. This version from Prada is crafted in beautiful forest green nappa leather and is finished by hand to create a vintage effect. It also boasts an all-enveloping oversized design that emphasises a streetwear aesthetic and will seamlessly take you from The Louvre to Le Marais. Reinterpreted in a conceptual way, the iconic Prada triangle assumes a structural role in the garment, and is here transformed into a removable pouch applied to the sleeve.\nFor the ladies, this Prada velvet puffer jacket with goose down padding has a contemporary boxy silhouette, so you can easily fit in with the uber stylish locals while you are exploring hip neighbourhoods such as Harajuku and Gangnam. Aside from the stand-up collar that not only oozes attitude but keeps your neck warm, what sets this apart is the detachable sleeves so you can easily turn this into a vest.\nBAGGING RIGHTS\nKeep your hands free for photo-taking while strolling cobblestoned streets with the Fendiness backpack from Fendi. Made from neon blue ECONYL® regenerated nylon (which is obtained from scrap material), its eye-catching hue means your travel partner will never lose you in the crowd. The black leather details and brushed black ruthenium-finish metalware keep it chic, while multiple zip pockets mean you can conveniently stash away your maps and gloves.\nLadies can leave the heavy lifting to their partners and just focus on sightseeing and style – which will be easy with this Gucci Horsebit 1955 shoulder bag that features black leather with bright and colourful geometric motifs. A cheery bag in freezing weather never hurt anyone, and this is spacious enough to hold much more than just a lip balm and hand sanitiser.\nCOAT CHECK\nWhether you are visiting Tokyo, Paris or New York City, dining out at a Michelin-starred restaurant definitely has to be on the agenda — which calls for the right togs. This belted Damier coat for men from Louis Vuitton takes it up a few notches with its beautiful silhouette, gorgeous caramel hue, and luxurious double-face wool. The removable belt conveniently incorporates two patch pockets, which adds functionality without compromising form.\nLadies can push the envelope by going boldly glam with this head-turning metallic lambskin trench coat from Chanel. The soft gold tone makes it versatile and easily compatible with any outfit, whether a pantsuit or dress, and the pliable leather makes it easy to wear. Just be sure to tip the coat check attendant so they store it carefully.\nTHE GLAM FACTOR\nAnd what’s a vacation without a glamorous night out? The gents can pull out all the stops with this impeccable and stylish suit from Gucci that will take you from that posh restaurant in SoHo to the speakeasy in the Meatpacking District. Check patterns pull inspiration from classic equestrian blankets, while the peak label lends it a formal air to balance out the playful checks.\nLadies can up the style ante with this classy yet modern ensemble from Chanel, featuring a cropped jacket in dark pink and matching pleated trousers in a loose cut. Sexy without being provocative, the wool tweed fabric will ensure you feel warm and snug even while baring your midriff.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     luxury fashion ', '     fashion ', '     style & fashion ']}"

      What makes a good luxury bag? 7 important things to look out for before buying one
  </h1>, 'text': ""As with any big-ticket item, the decision to splash out on a luxury bag comes wrapped in all kinds of deliberations and feelings. Of course it does. Whether you’re breaking the bank for the first time (and tossing up if you should), or nervous about how good an investment it is, there’s no denying that luxury bags represent a big step up from your average buy. \nThat is why you’ll want to make sure the bag you get has all the qualities that make it worth shelling out for. \nThese could range from tangible traits – expensive materials, fine workmanship – to more idiosyncratic, emotion-based allure such as the brand’s cache or the feel-good boost the bag gives you when you carry it. \nRemember, too, that the right luxury bag should be effortless to use – something that captures your personality and suits your needs. No point splurging on an it bag if it’s the complete opposite of your tastes and habits. \nTo ensure you get the most from your buy – and offset those worries about spending big – here are some hallmarks of a luxury bag that make it worthwhile. \n1. IT’S A VERSATILE STAPLE \nA well-designed bag can pull off the fine balancing act of being classy, trendy, sporty and chic all at once. This means it complements most outfits in your wardrobe, and you can whip it out for just about any occasion.\nTake one of Burberry’s signature line of carriers, for instance – the Lola. A shoulder bag with a quilted leather design and chain strap, its classic but youthful appearance makes it highly adaptable. Whether you’re using it for work, date night, posh dinners or casual luncheons, the bag looks the part. \nThere are a few variations on the classic Lola design, all of which share the original’s versatility and are similarly easy on the eye. These include the cute-leaning Camera Bag, as well as the more sophisticated-looking Satchel Bag which has a top handle and foldover flap.\nAnother upside to a luxury bag that’s a staple in your get-up – you get plenty of use out of it, which balances the price tag.\xa0 \xa0\n2. IT’S EASY TO CARRY\xa0 \xa0\nOne feature of a well-made bag is how effortless and comfortable it is to have on you.\nThoughtful touches like magnetic closure, slip pockets and card slots provide convenient access to frequently needed items.\nChain straps that can be worn on the shoulder or across the body give an added element of flexibility, not to mention a touch of glitz.\n3. IT'S PRACTICAL BUT STYLISH \nAgain, it’s about excellent design. A good luxury bag is worth its premium price because it’s constructed in a way that offers practicality without compromising on aesthetics – big enough to hold what you need, but no unnecessary bulk that would cramp your style and silhouette.\n4. IT USES TOP-GRADE MATERIALS\nA big part of what makes a bag luxe has to do with what it’s made of. Materials like exotic skins and superior leathers are highly prized not only because they’re hard to come by, but also because of the artisan skills needed to handle and craft them. \nOne leather that’s popular in luxury bags is lambskin, which is known for its fine-grain surface, ultra-soft texture and lightweight feel. In the case of the Lola, its quality is boosted further with the lambskin given an aniline finish. \nUnlike topcoat paint, aniline dyes are water-soluble and do not produce a uniform surface on the leather. This means that any variations or blemishes like scars and markings will remain visible on the hide, which is why only the finest, smoothest leather is chosen for the process. \n5. IT HAS AN EYE-CATCHING FIGURE \nSometimes, it’s the seemingly basic things that set the posh apart from the pedestrian. In the case of luxury bags, just their very shape could be a distinguishing feature, with some of the most famous ones recognisable by their outline alone. \nFor those who are in the market for a bag with a shape that’s a little atypical, a little unconventional without being outlandish, carriers like the Burberry Crescent Lola Bag and Lola Bucket Bag are among the ones which strike that fine balance. \nWith its curved top, gently inward-slanting sides and oval base, the Crescent Lola has an almost cowhead-like form that stands out from the rectangles and squares we usually see. \nAnd though the Lola Bucket Bag has the sort of tall, upright shape that defines bucket bags, it’s far more slender, compact and elegant. Much closer to a slim vase than a stumpy pail. \n6. IT COMES IN CLASSY STATEMENT COLOURS AND DESIGNS \nPeople often think they should only spend big on bags with classic designs and trend-proof shades. But if what you love are colourful, quirky or elaborate stuff, then by all means invest in something that fits the bill which you will be happy using. \nIn fact, a luxury label may actually be a more worthwhile buy because of the tasteful, refined takes on trends and novelty designs that it can offer. \xa0\nIn the case of Burberry’s Lola line, being the more rebellious, playful little sister of the brand’s classic TB bag means it comes with a younger, more vibrant palette featuring colours like Deep Saffron, Soft Violet, Marsh Green and Primrose Pink. \nFashion-adventurous souls can also opt for Lola iterations with eye-catching designs and materials like Horseferry print, camouflage print, quilted cashmere and knitted check.\n7. IT HAS HERITAGE \nThis may seem like one of those intangible factors that contribute to a bag’s high-end status. But there are actually good reasons to connect heritage with luxury.\xa0 \nEstablished, storied brands like Burberry have been making their bags for a long while now. They have had the benefit of time to hone their craft and perfect their processes, as well as recruit the best artisans to realise their designs. \nIn addition, their longevity in a fast-changing, highly competitive fashion scene points to the quality of their products. \nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      #Cheapestthing Christmas edition: 10 most affordable designer gifts from Hermes, Chanel, Louis Vuitton
  </h1>, 'text': 'There’s something hilarious and strangely poignant about taking an expensive-looking box out of a high-end paper bag, undoing the shiny ribbons and wading through swathes of crisp paper and packaging, to unveil... a tiny luxury product. \nThis fad of buying the most affordable items, usually between S$50 and S$250, from designer brands with products mostly priced in the thousands, has captured the imaginations of millions around the world, as the #cheapestthings trended, and continues to trend, on social media.\nFor some, it’s funny and eye-opening to see what you can buy on the “cheap” from the world’s most lauded designer labels like Hermes, Chanel, Loewe, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Cheap being relative, of course, as these seemingly everyday items – think keychains, cotton pads and notebooks – are still staggeringly expensive compared to the same items from ""regular"" brands.\nFor others, it’s essentially luxury on a budget, a way to get a minuscule piece of the big brands, an aspirational act until you can afford the actual Spring/Summer key pieces. \nThen there’s the excitement of watching an unboxing – with the glam factor and anticipation ramped up because it’s a luxury brand, especially for a younger audience with no means yet to purchase luxury items. Seeing the designer box and expensive packaging – designer products are wrapped with as much meticulousness whether they’re S$70 keychain charms or S$7,000 leather bags – is part of the fun, and the product that appears at the end is the icing on the cake.\nAs can be expected, many of the #cheapestthing items are beauty products. Beauty buys have always been one of the most affordable ways to ride the designer train. Think lip gloss from Dior and body lotion from Chanel, for example.\nThere are also small fashion and lifestyle accessories, such as a scarf from Gucci, cufflinks from Prada, a wine glass from Tiffany & Co, socks from Loewe and notebooks from Louis Vuitton. \nFYI: The Chanel Le Coton cotton pads, which cost US$20 (S$27) for 100 pieces and are embossed with the double C monogram, were out of stock for a while on the Chanel website, as many flocked to buy the product after several unboxing Tik Toks went viral. \nTo boot: You get free samples with every Chanel purchase (“choose up to 2 complimentary with every order” and these samples include perfume\xa0spray, cleansing foam, serum and mascara, that may even cost more than the initial purchase of cotton pads).\nHere then are 10 #cheapestthing items we found from some of the most expensive designer labels, available in Singapore. \nWhile they may not be the exact cheapest thing these brands sell, the idea is that these represent affordable luxury, and make great gifts (complete with amazing packaging and personalised gift notes), whether they’re for yourself or a loved one this festive season.\n1.

      Look back: Virgil Abloh's career highs from Louis Vuitton to Off-White to iconic collabs
  </h1>, 'text': 'Louis Vuitton’s artistic director for menswear Virgil Abloh has died at age 41. The founder of Milan-based label Off-White had been privately battling a rare aggressive form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma.\nThe announcement of his death was shared on his official Instagram page on Sunday (Nov 28).\n“Through it all, his work ethic, infinite curiosity, and optimism never wavered. Virgil was driven by his dedication to his craft and to his mission to open doors for others and create pathways for greater equality in art and design,” the statement read. “He often said, ‘Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself,’ believing deeply in the power of art to inspire future generations.”\nThe late designer’s zest for life was palpable in his creative endeavours. He once told The Cut that fashion is a kind of a “joke”. \n“I don’t get too bogged down in the clothes. For me, it’s one big art project, just a canvas to show that fashion should have a brand which has someone behind it who cares about different contexts. Social things,” he said.\nCNA Lifestyle looks back at the self-taught designer’s rise and rise in fashion and art.\n2009: Abloh’s first taste of fashion was at Fendi in Rome, where he interned alongside Kanye West. The pair were spotted at Paris Fashion Week that year at the Comme des Garcon show.\n2010: Abloh became the creative director of West’s creative agency, Donda.\n2011: Abloh\'s artwork for West and Jay-Z’s Watch The Throne album picked up a Grammy nomination.\n2012: Abloh cut his teeth in fashion by founding fashion brand Pyrex Vision. The brand’s first garments were reimagined Ralph Lauren flannel shirts that bore the word “Pyrex” and the number 23 – an homage to Michael Jordan. The deadstock shirts were bought at US$40 (S$55) and resold for US$550.\n2013: Pyrex Vision was repositioned as menswear brand Off-White. Abloh described the grey area between black and white as the ""Off-White"" colour.\n2014: Off-White launched a womenswear line and showed at Paris Fashion Week, alongside its menswear collection.\n2016: Abloh debuted a furniture collection, Grey Area, at Off-White’s first concept store in the Aoyama district in\xa0Tokyo, Japan.\n2017: Abloh won the British Fashion Award for Urban Luxe Brand.\n2018: The designer was appointed the artistic director for Louis Vuitton’s menswear division. Abloh replaced his mentor Kim Jones.\n2018: Abloh collaborated with Nike to launch Queen,\xa0a collection inspired by tennis ace\xa0Serena Williams that included\xa0tennis dresses, sparkling sneakers, and Abloh\'s signature quotation graphics reading ""LOGO"" and ""SERENA."" A close collaborator of\xa0Nike\'s, Abloh\'s Off-White\xa0also released many reiterations of classic shoe styles.\xa0\n2019: Abloh collaborated with IKEA to release MARKERAD, a limited collection elevating\xa0everyday designs. Of the effort, the designer said, ""It’s about elevating the anonymous, everyday icons that we use without noticing. When we put a doorstop on one of the legs of an ordinary chair we create something unexpected – an interruption.""\n2020: Abloh put a spin on a classic Mercedes-Benz, reimagining the company\'s G-Class as a streamlined racing car.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     celebrity ']}"

      7 reasons why this all-occasion luxury handbag is sweeping women off their feet
  </h1>, 'text': ""It’s a common refrain that there’s no way to please everyone. Maybe so, but there are some things that come pretty darn close. We think that Burberry’s Olympia bag pretty much checks all the boxes for a handbag that even the most finicky woman (or her bestie) would love, from its size to colourways and craftsmanship. Here’s why:\n1. YOU JUST CAN'T DO TINY BAGS\nNot everyone is down with heading out carrying nothing but a phone and credit card. For those who want a roomier bag without adding bulk, the small and medium Olympia are sized just right. \nAt 26cm x 15cm and 30cm x 18cm respectively, they’re big enough to hold essentials – say, wallet, phone, lipstick, compact, hand sanitiser and extra masks – yet still look sleek and elegant. No frumpy bulges to ruin your outline. \n2. YOU HAVE ENOUGH CROSSBODIES AND CLUTCHES \nYes, there will be outfits and occasions that call for bags with a long strap or no strap. But it’s always a good idea to have something in your wardrobe that’s more versatile and able to complement various get-ups, whether it’s an office skirt and blouse, jeans and tee, or a date night dress. \nAs a structured short shoulder bag, the Olympia fills that role perfectly – it’s an easy pick-up-and-go option when you’re heading out. \nSitting snugly at the midpoint by your side, its strap is fashioned at an ideal length – easy to slip on, hugs close to the body, and not overly long as to get in the way. On top of that, it’s also adjustable, expanding from short shoulder to crossbody for times when you’d like a little more leeway.\n3. YOU LIKE TO HAVE YOUR FAVOURITE THINGS IN DIFFERENT COLOURS \nJust as some women might want to own a beautiful top or dress in a range of shades, so too when they find their perfect bag. And with the Olympia, there is no shortage of variations to pick from. \nIn addition to colours from Burberry’s classic palette, such as Warm Tan, Light Biscuit and Burgundy, new ones are added every season. \nFor the festive season, Burberry presents the Mini Leather Zip Olympia Bag in Soft Violet, Small Leather Olympia Bag in Bronze, Small Leather Olympia Bag in Camel and Vintage Check Cotton Olympia Pouch in Archive Beige to the lineup.\nAdventurous souls, too, have more unusual options like gold lambskin and faux fur (both in mini size), camouflage print and striking colour-block designs (both in medium size). \n4. YOU LOVE LITTLE SECRET TOUCHES \nAs the saying goes, the devil’s in the details, and the Olympia packs quite a few subtle, well thought-out ones in its sleek frame. \nThe hidden magnet closure, for instance, allows for easy access so you don’t have to fumble or fuss. On the front is an external zip pocket where you can stow frequently-needed items, while at the back is a slot that fits a phone comfortably. \nInside the bag, there are multiple flat pockets that lend extra practicality. And a closer look at the gold-plated hardware on each side of the strap will reveal a discreetly engraved Burberry logo.\n5. YOU’RE A STICKLER FOR FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP...\nItaly is famous for leather tanning and crafting. In particular, the region of Tuscany has forged a reputation as the go-to place for fashion brands to create leather goods, thanks to the experience and skill of the artisans there. \nAnd that is why Burberry has made it the centre of its bag production, working with a longstanding Tuscan partner to ensure quality and tapping the best tanneries in Italy for their leathers. \nCrafted from two of the world’s most luxurious leathers, the Olympia comprises more than 20 individual pieces, all painstakingly cut to precise shapes. Each bag is hand-moulded by a Tuscan artisan on a wooden block to create its distinctive curved form, and three coats of paint are applied to the edges to protect them from damage. \n6. ...AND ARCHITECTURAL LINES\nThe Olympia is brand chief creative officer Ricardo Tisci’s tribute to Olympia London, a historic exhibition space and event venue that dates back to 1886. \nAnd it is the building’s soaring curved glass roof and iron-framed dome window that inspired the bag’s sculpted crescent moon shape and arcing shoulder strap, creating a silhouette that’s clean but dramatic.\n7. YOU’RE INTO CLASSY CHIC\nThe Olympia’s clean minimalism doesn’t hamper it from making a statement. In fact, it’s what enables the bag to be timeless and trendy all at once. Besides its modern, unfussy shape, the shoulder strap also works to subtly embellish your ensemble. \nAvailable in leather or chain, the former complements smart-casual and sophisticated looks while the latter doubles as an accessory that adds a touch of glamour and flash. \nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      How to put a capsule wardrobe together: Dressing to impress with fewer outfits 
  </h1>, 'text': 'When it comes to buying new clothes, the pandemic has certainly changed consumer trends and behaviour. It has, for one, significantly curbed my appetite for shopping.\nIt has also pushed me to reflect on what I really need – and what I don’t.\xa0\nIt’s no surprise that others – from fashion designers to consumers – also feel the same way. We’re falling back on a few quality pieces that take us seamlessly from work-from-home Zoom meetings to wellness activities like yoga.\xa0\nAnd we’re happy with these pared down options.\nIn a podcast by management consulting firm McKinsey & Company discussing the post-pandemic state of fashion, Achim Berg, a senior partner at the organisation, uses the term “casualisation” – where dresses have become “much more casual”.\n“But that is not an invention of COVID-19. It’s a trend we’ve seen for a long while: Moving away from more formal wear, having casual Fridays not only on Fridays but also from Monday to Thursday,” said Berg in the podcast.\xa0\nBerg added that the pandemic has resulted in us “lacking many occasions” which we used to dress up for, such as weddings and concerts.\xa0\n“All of that has an impact on how we dress, what we shop for, and how we shop for it.”\nPerhaps this is the reason why people are turning to pieces that are practical and comfortable, pieces not to wear and carry just once but again and again, and accessories that they will turn to regularly, said Jaime Lee, the creative director and co-founder of The Paper Bunny.\xa0\nThe brand’s latest ""wear""\xa0category includes comfort wear and accessories such as muscle tees, resort-style shirts and bottoms, caps, bucket hats and statement earrings.\xa0\nBEING MORE CONSCIOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU BUY\nThe pandemic has motivated us to make clearer choices about what we buy, from clothes to beauty products and food – and to consciously look for brands that champion sustainability.\nWhere our wardrobes are concerned, people are questioning if they truly need that many clothes, said Raena Lim, the chief operating officer and co-founder of Style Theory, a designer clothes and bag rental service in Singapore.\nPerhaps that is also due to findings that an estimated 73 per cent of consumers around the world are willing to change their consumption habits to reduce environmental impact, according to a 2019 Nielsen report.\nAlicia Tsi, the founder of Singapore conscious womenswear label Esse, told CNA Women that her brand is transitioning to a new business model in 2022, moving away from launching a capsule collection every other month and focusing on “key pieces of wardrobe staples” instead.\nIn this regard, a capsule collection refers to a “very small drop” of approximately two to three designs.\xa0\n“As we move away from launching capsule collections, we can put even more time and effort into designing each piece that we put out. It also allows us to further lower our environmental footprint and waste when we put our focus into launching a few core staples every year,” Tsi added.\nAs people become more conscious about their impact on the environment, there’s been a rise in the sharing economy, fuelling a general acceptance of pre-loved luxury, said Lim.\nShe added that people understand the value of clothing and bags in the sharing, circular economy, where goods go beyond one-time use, utilising the reusability of each item.\xa0\nWHAT’S A CAPSULE WARDROBE?\xa0\nA good capsule wardrobe is one that’s been edited – and curated intentionally, said Tsi. These are items that you’re willing to wear on repeat.\nWe wear only about 20 per cent of what’s in our closet, 80 per cent of the time, so having a capsule wardrobe encourages you to wear the clothing you select more often, said Susannah Jaffer, the founder of Zerrin, a marketplace that curates sustainable fashion labels.\xa0\nThe pared down approach of a capsule wardrobe limits the clothing choices you have. So what you end up with are clothes that fit your personal style and body, and are complementary and interchangeable, allowing you to create a variety of outfits with a limited number of clothes, explained Tsi.\xa0\nADAPTING TO CHANGING STYLES AND PREFERENCES\xa0\nCreating a capsule wardrobe doesn’t mean getting rid of every piece of clothing you have and starting from scratch. “It means pruning items that no longer work for you and replacing them mindfully,” advised Jaffer.\xa0\nYou shouldn’t feel the need to change up your capsule wardrobe every season. Neither should it be about being “on-trend”.\xa0\n“I would try to steer away from trendy items as they will go out of style and they counter the whole concept of having a capsule wardrobe,” Tsi said.\xa0\nShe advised that you stay away from seasonal colours too, as they are more likely to go out of style. Opt for a neutral colour palette, such as white, black, grey, navy, brown and earth tones.\nWhat is key is investing in high-quality and timeless pieces. These allow you to wear them for a longer period of time, reducing the cost per wear of all your clothes, said Jaffer.\nFewer clothes to plan outfits around also means less decision fatigue – you don’t have to struggle with a wardrobe full of clothes, yet still feel like you have nothing to wear, Tsi explained.\nWHAT SHOULD GO INTO A CAPSULE WARDROBE?\xa0\nThere isn’t a hard and fast rule but experts recommend sticking to well-known formulas such as the 10 x 10 challenge, especially if you’re new to it.\nThe challenge involves you picking out 10 items (for example, a jacket, a dress, a few versatile tops and two pairs of shoes), and creating 10 different outfits out of them, for a period of 10 days.\xa0\n“Doing a 10 x 10 capsule wardrobe challenge back in 2017 helped me train myself to organise my wardrobe and curb my shopping habit,” Tsi recounted.\nNote that your capsule wardrobe is “deeply personal” and there is no “one size fits all” solution, Jaffer advised.\xa0\nUltimately, it has to work for the person wearing it. So if you are mainly working from home (where you attend many Zoom meetings), yours may include more home and comfort wear, and fewer bags and shoes.\nAnother challenge you can consider is Project 333 by author Courtney Carver that requires you to select 33 items – and make the pieces work for you over the next three months.\xa0\nWhichever approach you choose, building a capsule wardrobe forces you to work with what you have, reducing both the space you need in your closet and the time needed to assemble an outfit.\xa0\xa0\nTsi suggested the following basics for a capsule wardrobe:\nAnd no, your capsule wardrobe doesn’t have to be boring – even if you’ll be repeating and restyling your clothing as a rule.\xa0\xa0\n“You don’t have to be a minimalist to create a capsule wardrobe,” said Jaffer. Go ahead and get as creative as you want, even incorporating prints and patterns into your capsule.\nYou should still be able to express your personal style and fill it with items you love wearing such as a classic pair of hoop earrings that pair with anything, or a vintage-looking shoulder bag that transcends seasons, she added. \nGETTING STARTED AND LEVELLING UP\nTsi said that her favourite part of curating a capsule wardrobe is the idea that it’s a “slow and dynamic” process, where people can shop with intention and look for clothes that they absolutely love.\n“The goal of building a capsule wardrobe is not to be an expert at it. It’s to help you become more mindful of what you’re wearing,” Jaffer said.\xa0\nBefore you click “add to cart” to buy new pieces for your wardrobe, Tsi recommends taking the following steps first:\nOnce you start the process of curating your capsule wardrobe, you’ll realise that your shopping habits will change as well, where you’re likely to buy only interchangeable items to match what you already have.\n“(It) will help you to inherently save money because you do not have to go shopping often – to find a top to match a bottom, for example,” said Tsi.\xa0\nAnd when you do shop, consider the UOB Lady’s Card to score more savings in the form of UNI$, earning 10 times UNI$ for every S$5 spent on your purchases.\xa0\nThe credit card, which caters to women, not only allows you to earn rebates, it also offers privileges such as an interest-free installment plan for six or 12 months, and protection coverage for your online purchases.\nMAKE RENTING PART OF YOUR PLAN\xa0\nWhile a capsule wardrobe is usually versatile enough to cover a wide variety of needs and occasions, dressing up for one-off events like a wedding, concert, or even a theme party (when COVID-19 social restrictions ease) may prove trickier.\nConsider clothes rental, which gives you more opportunities to explore and experiment with different styles to complement your wardrobe, said Lim of Style Theory.\n“Clothes no longer have limited lifespans – giving the flexibility to rent outfits that are more elaborate in nature and suited for formal occasions, but may not be suited for everyday use,” she added.\nFor more great ideas for you and your money, visit www.uob.com.sg/women.\nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      3 glamorous new women’s watches for your year-end festivities
  </h1>, 'text': 'Jaeger-LeCoultre has a lot going for it. It has years of marketable history, a reputation for superior movements, and it even has a few iconic designs under its belt. This year’s feminine offerings showcase all of those things, but they also lean heavily into rare handcrafts to provide a generous helping of loveliness.\nA HEAVENLY SIGHT\nThere have been so many variations of the Rendez-Vous Jewellery Moon watches that it’s hard to imagine new ways for it to stand out. And yet somehow Jaeger-LeCoultre has managed to create the starriest one yet.\nThe Rendez-Vous Jewellery Dazzling Moon Lazura follows the same eye-catching template as its forebears, with dramatic, graduated numerals forming an arc over an extra-large moon phase display.\nWhat makes this reference so breathtaking is its vivid lapis lazuli dial and an exceptionally brilliant bezel made of 36 larger diamonds on the outer ring and 73 smaller ones on the inside. This prong- and grain-set diamond bezel is what characterises the Dazzling models in the Rendez-Vous collection.\nThe rest of the sparkle comes from the 36mm rose gold case, gilt hands, numerals and constellations, and a mother-of-pearl moon. The moon phase isn’t just impressive in size – it is also accurate for 972 years (the average in fine watchmaking is 122 years).\nAn additional hand-polished gold star, also known as the Rendez-Vous indicator, can be adjusted via the crown at 2 o’clock to mark the time of a special appointment. The manufacture Calibre 935 is self-winding, with Cotes de Geneve decoration on the plates and rotor.\nIN THE LOOP\nThese days, with watchmakers touting the interchangeability of their straps and bracelets, the real novelty is a wristlet you don’t want to swap out.\nBack in the early 1930s, early examples of Reverso watches for women featured little silk ropes and leather cords to help fasten the watches to dainty wrists. These inspired the contemporary Reverso One Cordonnet watches, launched in celebration of the Reverso’s 85th anniversary in 2016.\nCordonnet means “fine braid” in French, and for the collection’s 90th anniversary this year, that braid has returned in a livery of gold and diamonds. The Reverso One Cordonnet Jewellery is encrusted with 1,104 diamonds totalling 7.84 carats. Grain-setting was used to set the stones in the case, a technique that uses tiny gold beads to hold the gems closely in place. Since Jaeger-LeCoultre has its own Ateliers des Metiers Rares (Rare Handcrafts workshop), it has access to artisans skilled enough to set the diamonds on the watch’s many sloping sides.\nThe front-facing dial features gold Arabic numerals on a mother-of-pearl base, framed by diamond-set brackets and a geometric cut-out centre paved with even more diamonds. The other side has an onyx face and diamond-set sunbeams to act as hour markers. This petite piece is powered by the manually wound Calibre 844 with a 38-hour power reserve.\nGARDEN PARTY\nLike most metiers d’art watches, the Reverso One Precious Flowers series is a culmination of several artistic disciplines. This time, the Ateliers des Metiers Rares relied on engraving and enamelling on top of gem-setting to create the luscious leaves and petals of lilies and arums in four stunning models.\nThe two slightly less glittery models are the White Lilies in white gold and the Pink Arums in pink gold. For the White Lilies, the soothing shades of blue and white were achieved by filling the hand-engraved foliage with enamel, and filling the background with precisely cut slivers of mother-of-pearl.\nThe petals of the Pink Arums are executed in the same way, but diamonds fill in its leaves and black lacquer was used to create its dramatically contrasting background. Both of these images are framed in grain-set diamonds that cover the entire case.\nThe Purple Arums and Blue Arums (in pink gold and white gold respectively) pile on far more diamonds. The flowers and leaves are engraved in relief and filled with richly coloured enamel, but the backgrounds are fully paved with snow-set diamonds. Because of how tedious the snow-setting technique is, where seemingly randomly sized stones fit snugly together for a shimmering blanket effect, the setting alone took 95 hours. And unlike the White Lilies and Pink Arums, these two references have floral designs that extend into the case sides.\nEach version is a limited edition of 10 and uses the hand-wound Calibre 846.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Timepieces & Jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     luxury fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      5 best strapless bras for different bust sizes that won't slip or pinch
  </h1>, 'text': ""They slip, pinch, shift about, or sometimes fit so tightly that they feel almost suffocating. Strapless bras are notoriously difficult to get right, particularly for those with a fuller bust.\nStill, they are a wardrobe essential for anyone who enjoys wearing the occasional tube, strappy or off-shouldered outfit, and are also necessary for special-occasion garments like cocktail dresses or bridal gowns. \nPerhaps you’ve given up hope on finding the right strapless bra for your size and shape, or have resigned to putting up with the discomfort and unsightliness of wearing an ill-fitting or unflattering one?\nCNA Lifestyle lists five in a variety of styles that will answer your needs. These are designed to better withstand gravity and also counter other fit issues that concern comfort, shape and coverage.\nBEST CLASSIC: CHANTELLE'S ABSOLUTE INVISIBLE SMOOTH STRAPLESS BRA, S$165\nYes, a bra can actually be “visible” under clothes, especially if the edges along the top of the cups are thick and do not lie flat against the chest. It’s often a bugbear for those who favour body-con clothes or garments in fabrics through which such “bra lines” easily show. \nThe cup rims on this seamless bra are thin and designed to conform to your unique shape, so there won’t be unsightly gapping or protrusions that disrupt a smooth silhouette. It also comes with a seamless back band, removable straps and soft cup pads for comfort.\nAvailable at leading department stores. \nBEST PUSH-UP: CHALONE'S OCEANE WIRELESS PUSH-UP STRAPLESS BRA, S$89.90\nThis one’s got several features that set it apart from a standard strapless bra. First of all, wireless cups that are moulded to provide shape, support and a subtle boost. Secondly, a plunging centre that will go well with low-cut dresses and tops. And finally, an additional back band to help keep the bra in place throughout the day.\nwww.chalone.com.sg \nBEST FOR LARGE BUSTS: PRIMADONNA'S DIVINE STRAPLESS BRA, S$159.95\nWomen who are generously endowed can have a difficult time finding a good strapless bra. Options for cup sizes beyond C tend to be limited. On top of that, adequate support and full coverage are key requirements, along with a secure fit that doesn’t slip – criteria that few strapless bras made for full-busted women can meet, especially in the absence of shoulder straps. \nThis strapless bra is available in cup sizes starting from C to GG, and has fuller cups that will provide higher coverage. There's no silicone grip along the back – however, the back band is cut wide to provide a “super elastic hold” that moulds to your body for a secure, yet comfortable fit. \nwww.storminadcup.sg\nBEST FOR SMALL BUSTS: COSABELLA'S NEVER SAY PADDED FLIRTIE BANDEAU, US$69 (S$93)\nA bandeau bra is perfect for casual days when just light support for the bust is enough. It’s also a great style that can provide sufficient support for ladies with a smaller bust. This lacy, wireless number is padded so that there’s no show-through, while the sides are boned to offer extra support (it also means the sides won’t constantly bunch up as you move about).\nwww.cosabella.com \nBEST LONG-LINE: LE MYSTERE'S SENSUELLE BUSTIER, US$79 (S$106)\nIf you’ve never been able to find a strapless bra that fits securely and doesn’t shift, your best option may be to try a bustier style, which will offer added support by way of the extended bodice.\nA long-line bra also boasts contouring capabilities, and can help smoothen unsightly bulges below the bra line. It’s a good choice for wearing under fitted garments, such as gowns, as it creates a sleek and flattering silhouette.\nwww.freshpair.com\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Underwear ', '     bra ', '     women ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Buying second-hand luxury goods? Fakes are rampant, so buyer beware
  </h1>, 'text': 'Graham Wetzbarger knows what fake tastes like. “Tiffany & Co counterfeits can be coated in aluminium. If you taste it, it’s like a soda can, it has a metallic taste that sterling silver doesn’t have,” he explained.\nWetzbarger, a US-based luxury goods expert and former chief authenticator at consignment site The RealReal, is a firm believer that the art of validating a luxury object, be it a work of art or a sneaker, relies on the use of multiple senses. Although, he admits, taste is very rarely used. “You smell a lot; there is a lot of glue in counterfeits.”\nSpending on second-hand luxury goods climbed from £20 billion (S$36.5 billion) in 2017 to £28 billion in 2020, according to Bain, outpacing growth in the overall luxury goods market by a significant margin. Online marketplaces and consignment sites including The RealReal and Vestiaire Collective have made it as easy to buy and sell second-hand as new – would-be shoppers no longer have to spend hours trawling bricks-and-mortar consignments stores in search of a coveted handbag or dress.\nIn this burgeoning environment, fakes have proliferated. Fashion archivist Greg Chester of One of a Kind in London says handbag counterfeiters have become so skilled that the store has started to avoid the category altogether. “It’s not worth the risk for us,” he said. The RealReal has previously been accused of failing to spot fakes.\nHuman authenticators are expensive, and tech-powered solutions designed to improve – and perhaps ultimately replace them – continue to evolve. In April, LVMH, together with Prada and Richemont-owned Cartier, launched Aura Blockchain Consortium, a global platform that gives unique digital identities to products, allowing customers to ensure their purchase is the real thing. Authentication company Entrupy claims a 99.1 per cent accuracy rate after training its image-recognition technology on a self-built database of hundreds of thousands of items.\nThese systems are still in their infancy however. Image-recognition technology needs to be trained on databases of images that are still being built. Humans are needed to ensure that the visual references fed to the machine are of genuine products.\nBlockchain, on the other hand, is usually applied at the source, when a product is first created. When applied to vintage products, the items need to be certified first, bringing us back to human authenticators. For the most part, industry professionals view technology as a helpful addition to a job destined to remain largely human-based for the foreseeable future. “It’s still a hands-heavy skill,” said Wetzbarger. “Ninety-plus per cent of the entire industry is human.”\nBack to taste, smell and touch it is. When a trunk made of a very unusual metal arrived at Christie’s in 2018, Rachel Koffsky, the auction house’s senior specialist for handbags and accessories, had a feeling it could be a rare Louis Vuitton piece from the end of the 19th century, made of aluminium. At the time, only one was known to still exist, stored at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. Seeking scientific confirmation, Koffsky brought the trunk to the National History Museum, where it was analysed in a basement lab.\n“The trunks that were made in the late 19th century were created for explorers travelling across the world, and they needed to be very lightweight. Aluminium had just been invented and it was a very expensive material, known as the white gold of Napoleon,” she explained. “Making sure that it was aluminium was critical to ensure that this was the historic piece that we had a feeling that it was going to be.” The trunk sold at auction for £162,500 in December 2018.\nDetails such as where the manufacturing label and brand label are positioned, as well as the construction of the garment itself and, in the case of a Chanel bag, the number of stitches between two quilted sections, can help authenticate an item. “It’s like learning a language,” said Chester, who keeps detailed timelines for each brand, recording details such as changes in finishing techniques or manufacturing labels. “Once you have dealt with certain designers for so long if something doesn’t look right it sticks out like a sore thumb.”\nCounterfeiters make a profit by selling cheaply made items at inflated prices, so finishing techniques are where they often fall short of the real thing. For both Chester and Wetzbarger, turning a garment inside out is essential. “Counterfeiters will spend 99 per cent of their time on the exterior of an item to fool the eye, so it’s when you get to the guts of the pieces that you start to see errors,” said Wetzbarger.\nHardware elements such as buttons, studs and fasteners are also key indicators. When it comes to zippers, for example, luxury brands rarely use Japanese brand YKK, the world’s largest zipper manufacturer by sales, and instead opt for Riri or Lampo zippers, which Wetzbarger calls the BMW and Mercedes of zippers. Anything that is designed to improve management and inventory control, including serialisation numbers, date stamps or fabrication tags, can be leveraged by authenticators to trace the style and date of a garment. “All of those itchy things against your sides that a lot of people end up cutting out – that makes our job harder,” said Wetzbarger.\nLuxury authenticators come from a variety of backgrounds and learn much of the trade through direct experience, shadowing other authenticators, as there is no formal path into the field. Wetzbarger says many of his best recruits were previously luxury sales assistants who had already been trained to spot and appreciate craftsmanship, often by brands themselves.\nRelying on seasoned authenticators to teach the trade to newcomers might have worked when second-hand luxury was a niche market but, as the sector continues to expand and attract new players, the demand for skilled authenticators has far surpassed availability.\nWetzbarger says that basic training can be done in six months, but it takes a couple of years of autonomous work for an authenticator to be considered an expert. He laments the lack of a trade organisation or a third-party authenticator guild that could provide a shared industry standard.\n“Companies are all training their own armies of authenticators because everyone is fighting for market share,” he said. “There are industry standards, but they are not really [formally] agreed upon.”\nSolving these issues is critical for the second-hand luxury market’s success, says Bain partner Claudia D’Arpizio who, despite the promise of blockchain, sees humans remaining at the core of the profession. “You have to have the human touch there.”\nBy Annachiara Biondi © 2021 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     luxury goods ', '     luxury fashion ']}"

      Kwanpen’s third-generation leader, Jonathan Kwan: ‘As children, we take things for granted’
  </h1>, 'text': ""Name any luxury fashion brand and chances are, it will have an iconic product with a story to tell and a reason for being. In the case of Singapore leather goods label Kwanpen, that signature item is the Raffles 1819 Bag.\nAs Jonathan Kwan, Kwanpen’s director of special projects relates, the story goes that one of the company’s first boutiques was in Raffles Singapore. When the designers were tasked to conjure up a new handbag, they took inspiration from the grand dame.\n“The metal bar on the bag resembles one of the pillars of Raffles Hotel. The two pieces of hardware on either side of the bag represent Family and Business. Family is as important as Business, and Business is as important as Family. The two symmetrical pieces of crocodile leather also represent that.”\nJonathan, 38, is the grandson of Kwanpen founder, the late Kwan Pen Seng, who was trained as a goldsmith in Guangzhou, China. When he migrated to Singapore in the 1930s, he found work with a number of local goldsmiths, but soon realised that his income would not be enough to support his family of seven – his wife and their five boys.\nFor the enterprising migrant, the only solution was to start his own business. With Singapore under colonial rule, Pen Seng struck upon the idea of crafting crocodile skin bags for British aristocrats. “At that time, crocodile leather was one of the cheapest leathers on the market. They used the back of the crocodile, which was spiny. Nobody wanted it. But my granddad did, because he had limited funds,” shared Jonathan.\nPen Seng knew that if he used cow leather, the designs would be too easy to replicate. And he targeted the British aristocrats because they knew how to appreciate crocodile leather goods.\n“Crocodile leather was known to be difficult to work with, so naturally the prices went up,” Jonathan added. “And crocodiles are difficult to breed – they’re not docile creatures, unlike cows and sheep. Now crocodile leather is the most expensive. But it just so happens… that we started early.”\nHow the company got its name was a matter of happenstance. The British, accustomed to the Western name order (first name followed by family name), referred to Jonathan’s grandfather as “Kwan Pen”, and the moniker stuck. But it wasn’t until much later that the company rebranded itself as Kwanpen. Listen to our podcast below to hear the full story.\n“In the 1980s when we first opened our shop, Japanese tourists were flooding Singapore and the world. We called ourselves ‘Ginza’, after the Tokyo district. One day, we realised that we should name the company after my granddad,” Jonathan explained. The company logo, which resembles two “K”’s on top of each other, is actually a stylised form of “Kwan” in Chinese.\nPen Seng passed away before Jonathan was born, but he made sure to impart his business acumen and craftsmanship skills to his five sons. Today, Kwanpen is a global brand with boutiques in nine locations from Bangkok to Istanbul. The Singapore flagship is located in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, and the company is presided over by Jonathan’s father, Leonard.\nWhat, then, is Jonathan’s role in the company? “I don’t really have a fixed scope,” came the reply. “[I] have to do everything under the sun. For example, the opening of new shops, down to marketing, all different parts of the company. It helps me understand the company better.”\nUniquely, the entire Kwan clan lives in the same condominium complex. “Our family [is] quite close-knit. We like to stay close to each other.” Before the family moved into the condominium, they lived in a rented house in Hougang, where Jonathan was born. Shortly after, they moved into an HDB flat in Balestier, but in the 1980s, business boomed, so all five brothers decided to buy an apartment for their mother.\nAt that time, Jonathan’s uncles were not married yet, so they all moved in with his grandmother. Leonard moved into a separate unit with his family. Explaining the fraternal bonds, Jonathan said: “The five of them have an understanding that is not understood by anyone else apart from the five of them.” As Jonathan’s uncles grew older and got married, they moved out but bought units in the same estate.\n“My grandfather used to say, ‘One chopstick is easy to break. But five chopsticks are much harder to break.’ I think those were his last words to them. Like any business, there are arguments, but they’re still together.” One of his uncles started his own market research business outside, but he helps out every now and then, whenever he’s needed.\nThere are many benefits to living in the same complex, explained Jonathan. Before the pandemic, there were always impromptu family dinners and meet-ups, on top of monthly get-togethers. During the pandemic, his uncles would take turns buying food for the entire clan. “Somebody would go and buy some famous bak kut teh and then they would distribute it, or somebody would buy char kway teow and then suddenly you have char kway teow!”\nWhen he was younger, Jonathan enjoyed the company of his cousins, with whom he would play in and around the estate. “I think it’s fun. It’s good growing up and getting to know all your cousins. I wouldn’t have it any other way.”\nThe family, says Jonathan, considers itself the guardians and gatekeepers of the business. His father and uncles are doing everything they can to make sure that things run smoothly for Jonathan and other members of the third generation (which consists of his brother, sister and two cousins who are working for the firm). None of them, he adds, feel as if they own the company per se.\n“It’s like football, you’re passing the ball to the next person. If in football you have a radio, and you can talk to the person you’re going to pass to, that’ll be the best thing to have, because you can tell him where the ball is going to come from. It would be a smooth transition.”\nAs for the saying that the third generation is the weakest link, Jonathan had this to say: “There might be some truth to that. The first generation started the business. The second generation made it big. Obviously, something that the second generation did was better than the first to make it more successful.\n“When it comes to the third generation, the second generation will doubt them, because they’re the ones who made it successful. The third generation joins the business after it became successful.” Jonathan himself joined the company in 2011, after two years of working in another company. Lucky for him, his father never put pressure on him. This goes some way in explaining Jonathan’s casual, easygoing demeanour.\nHis father believes that people take time to grow into their roles. “There isn't really a target to be met. There isn't an ROI to hit. You come into business and you start learning.” Retirement, he adds, is not a word in the family. “There are no fixed rules, or timing, when you should retire or when you should hand it off to the next person. As with all family businesses, they will always be there, looking over it, even though they’re not running the day-to-day business.”\nLike many children of business owners, Jonathan didn’t get to spend much time with his father when he was younger. The latter was always busy in the office or travelling. It was only when he joined Kwanpen that the two became close. “After I became a dad myself, we got even closer, because I finally realised that it’s not so easy being a dad,” he said, referring to his three-year-old son with wife Park Sung-hye. The couple tied the knot in 2016.\n“I think as children, we tend to take things for granted. In my case, well, I didn’t realise how much sacrifices both my dad and my mum made to send me to university, for example, or even just to put food on the table. They worked really hard. And they always made sure that the family was well taken care of.”\nThe Next Gen podcast is brought to you by Jaeger-LeCoultre.\xa0\u2028\u2028Listen to our interview with Jonathan Kwan\xa0here.\nNew episodes of Next Gen are published every Sunday at\xa0cna.asia/podcasts\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     fashion ', '     luxury fashion ', '     luxury goods ']}"

      Meet the 30-year-old streetwear entrepreneur trying to stamp out online fakes
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Richard Xia needed some capital to launch Novelship, his sneaker reselling business in 2018, he did what any cash-strapped millennial might do. Together with his co-founder and long time buddy Chris Xue, the duo resorted to selling their prized streetwear and sneaker collections to raise funds for their start-up.\n“Our parents did not want to give us pocket money,” Xia recalled with a laugh. “So I told Chris that even though it would be painful, if we sold our collection, we would raise around S$10,000 to S$20,000.”\nSo, he resold his collection of streetwear by cult brand Bape while Xue, a big NBA fan, sold his prized collection of Air Jordan sneakers. “Once we built our platform, we figured we could ourselves be users of the platform to get everything back,” the 30-year-old added.\nThe idea to launch Novelship was borne out of the pain points that the co-founders, both ardent fans of streetwear and sneakers, had personally experienced when trying to shop for products they wanted from cool brands like Supreme, Nike, Adidas Yeezy and Fear of God.\n“We wanted to create a sustainable business venture based on something both of us are passionate about,” said Xia, who had by then launched two other businesses, including a mobile cafe he had set up outside the library at the National University of Singapore while he was still a student.\n“We thought about the issues we faced as customers in the region and realised that the demand was developing so quickly that it was very difficult to have access to authentic limited edition products. Because of that, people tend to buy from strangers online on Facebook groups, forums or classifieds platforms where there are scammers and fraudsters out to make a quick buck,” he said. Counterfeit products were also a problem, he added.\nTo solve this issue, they wanted to create a specialised platform for buyers and sellers in Asia to buy and sell limited-edition sneakers, streetwear and collectibles. Every single item purchased or sold on Novelship undergoes a rigorous quality check and authentication process using cutting edge technology and industry expertise to ensure consumers never receive a fake, he explained.\nTo date, the Singapore-based company, which employs about 60 people, has five processing centres and has a presence in six markets around the Asia-Pacific, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia.\nAccording to Xia, what sets Novelship apart from other international marketplaces such as Goat or StockX is its well-established network in the region, such as transactions being carried out in the local currency and having a well-oiled customer service system to help troubleshoot where it is needed.\nEven though there is a perception that many resellers jack up prices to multiple times the retail value, Xia said this is actually a rare occurrence that typically applies to ultra-hyped items like the Air Dior collaboration between the Jordan brand and Dior.\n“Most of the items being traded are between S$200 and S$300,” he said.\nPopular items on the marketplace include Nike Dunk Low, Air Jordan 4 and Adidas Yeezy sneakers. Recent hot items include the NikeXSacai collaboration shoes, he added. Apparel by rapper Travis Scott is also hugely covetable, as are pieces from the KawsXUniqlo collaboration.\nBut while hypebeast – and hypebae – culture is arguably showing no signs of slowing down among the younger generations, the company’s success was not an immediate guarantee, especially in its early days.\nHe can still recall the exhaustion of doing everything from customer service to deliveries in the early days of the business. “Recently, people have been talking about China’s 996 work culture of working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. I tell you, entrepreneurship is 007 – you work from midnight to midnight, seven days a week, especially for the first few weeks,” he quipped.\nIn 2019, the duo secured US$2 million (S$2.7 million) in funding led by Global Founders Capital, which has also backed companies including Lazada and Slack, to drive its expansion in “key high growth markets” across the region.\nHowever, just as they were putting these growth plans into place in 2020, the pandemic struck, prompting widespread global lockdowns that affected their ability to even run a business.\n“I remember quite clearly barely two weeks into our launch campaigns in Indonesia and Malaysia, COVID-19 hit, logistics lanes were cut off and we could not ship reliably into these countries,” he recalled. This meant that customers who had bought products would have to face delays in receiving their items.\n“And in Singapore, when the circuit breaker happened, our warehousing crew and logistics flow was further disrupted.”\nTo keep afloat, the entire team had to act quickly and come up with multiple contingency plans while implementing various safety processes at the same time to ensure they could continue operating their business. “This period was the biggest challenge we have faced so far,” he said.\nThanks to the quick response by the team – and the surge in online shopping during the last 18 months of lockdowns, the company has managed to navigate the pandemic.\nUp next, he is setting his sights on growing the business further such as by launching an Android app (Novelship already has an iOS app) and setting up drop-off locations in its key markets for greater convenience.\nThere are also plans to work with celebrities and influencers to offer a curated selection of products or to host exclusive releases on the website. “What we want to achieve is to be a one-stop solution for Gen Zs and millennials,” he said.\nFor these two millennial co-founders at least, they have already achieved this. True to their goal, they have already rebuilt their collections that they sold all those years ago to start their own business.\n“Don’t worry about Chris (Xue), I just checked out his room a few days ago and he has tonnes of shoes – he got most of his collection back,” said Xia with a chuckle.\n“I have gotten into sneakers as well and I have been collecting Supreme figurines as well as Kaws and Bearbrick collectibles. It is an expensive hobby!”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Legendary shoe designer Manolo Blahnik's niece: 'My uncle is the most cultured man I have ever met'
  </h1>, 'text': 'Kristina Blahnik recalls spending almost every weekend as a child with her uncle, Manolo Blahnik, when he and her mother Evangelina would be working on the company that he started in 1971. When the elder Blahnik – who was never formally trained in shoemaking – wasn’t creating shoes, they would be watching movies. He was passionate about films and books and often had profound conversations with her about them. It piqued her curiosity about the world and nurtured within her a deep appreciation for tradition and beauty.\nShe was particularly fascinated from an early age by the way her uncle’s creative mind reinterpreted everything that he saw into inspiration for new collections, new shapes, and new sculptures. “I was very much taken by that and realised how important it is to have curiosity – and my uncle is the most curious man, and as a result the most cultured man I have ever met,” she enthused, looking immaculately radiant and chic over a video call.\n“My uncle has never had a creative block. He taps into his knowledge of everything that he has acquired as a result of his curiosity,” she said. “Because if you are not curious, how do you evolve? So absolutely this quality is at the very heart of our values.”\nFROM ARCHITECTURE TO FASHION\nIn spite of her closeness to her uncle and mother, Blahnik, who is in her mid-forties and an only child (her uncle has no children), resisted the family business. She studied architecture at the University of Cambridge before setting up her own practice in her mid-twenties. “My spirit loves space; it loves objects, it loves shapes. And that’s really what I\'m still carrying into what I do now,” she said.\nEven before she officially joined the company in 2009, she was involved in the family business. “When I had my architecture practice, I was still supporting the family business in ways that I could. One of them was photographing the archive in late 1999. That archive is still very much at the heart and soul of the entire company, and still is relevant now 22 years later,” she said with pride.\nThough her role was not clearly defined at the start, she eventually took over as CEO in 2013. Defining herself as a creative strategist, Blahnik juggles multiple roles and has helped steer the family-run business forward since joining in 2003. Because of her training as an architect, she has an exceptional eye for detail and it perhaps explains why she has taken the leap from architecture to fashion in her stride.\n“I had my own walkabout and developed the confidence to have my own voice. In a family business, it is everyone’s own voice that adds layers and freshness. A new generation is an evolution in itself. Every day I feel even more confident that it was the right thing to do. Twelve years later, I do find my purpose is clearer and clearer,” she mused.\nUnlike many CEOs, she plays a pivotal role in the creative process and development of each collection. Until COVID-19 struck, she was routinely accompanying her uncle to their atelier in Italy. “I have truly done everything. When I started, we were a team of six, so you had to pitch in to do what was needed at that time,” she shared, “and I still do.” Under her watchful eye, the team has grown to more than 80 with 20 boutiques and over 300 stockists around the world.\n“A shoe is like a building – it has structure, it has engineering behind it, and materials… I understand all that. And I think that helped fast-track me into understanding how shoes are made, although I am still learning every day,” she said with a laugh.\nMAKING STRIDES\nLast year the company acquired Re Marcello, an Italian factory it has worked with for decades, in a cunning move for a small luxury player. For Manolo Blahnik, whose shoes are exquisitely detailed and technically challenging, investing in quality manufacturing is imperative.\n""Relationships are so important,” said Blahnik, as she discusses the brand’s first virtually-designed collection. “The artisans, they are like family. They understood what Manolo needed and they were able to interpret it virtually,” she added. She is reluctant to have the team be seen as just manufacturers. “They are not simply making; they are creating. I want to see the word \'art\' in artisan being celebrated.”\nWhen asked if it is difficult for a brand so steeped in history to value tradition while staying ahead of the game, she demurred, “Not at all. My uncle’s personal motto is something that Italian director Luchino Visconti once said to him at a party hosted by legendary style icon Anna Piaggi. \'Senza la tradizione non siamo niente,\' which translates to \'without tradition we are nothing\'.\n“You can’t create in a vacuum,” she added. “The richer your experiences are the more you are able to reference that and create something new. We have to appreciate the past and learn from it. We also don’t follow fashion trends; our designs are timeless so they can always be worn. I like to say that our shoes are investments and our customers are investors.”\nGOLDEN ANNIVERSARY\nCelebrating the past is indeed the objective of the 50th anniversary capsule. The new collection, which is available in Singapore, is inspired by the designer’s remarkable five-decade career, and the dazzling collection features nearly 20 styles ranging from never-before-seen shapes to revamped classics like the Hangisi, all reinterpreted in gold.\nBlahnik is confident the shoes will be well received. “They are styles that have been successful in Asia. The Maysale, which is my personal favourite, you can wear from the moment you wake up in the morning until you are on the dancefloor at the end of the day,” she chuckled.\nAlso in time for its golden anniversary, the luxury shoemaker made a splash in New York City with a flagship store on the Upper East Side’s Madison Avenue, ensconced in a double-height space within a historic 1920s heritage building. “It’s an opportunity to pay homage to a legacy that has been built by my uncle and my mother,” said Blahnik of the milestone. “It’s a moment in time and our golden anniversary, and we are celebrating that to move into the next 50 years.”\nDespite her refreshing candidness, she turns coy however when asked if the new boutique will feature in the upcoming Sex And The City limited series, And Just Like That... that is currently being shot in Manhattan. The hit HBO series famously turned the shoe brand into a bona fide household name globally back in the early 2000s when its protagonist Carrie Bradshaw was mugged and robbed of her beloved pair of Manolo Blahniks.\n“When that all happened it was a complete surprise to us,” she said of the brand’s association with the TV show. “It was genuinely just a passion of [lead actress Sarah Jessica Parker’s]. We didn’t manipulate it and it wasn’t a marketing strategy. It all happened organically,” she insisted.\n“So let’s see if it will be in the show, I am as curious as you are about it!”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style "", ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      This Singaporean fashion photographer runs a virtual modelling agency with CGI models
  </h1>, 'text': 'The pandemic has certainly disrupted our lives. For many of us, the transition to working from home, while occasionally frustrating, has been manageable. But for many creatives, whose work is dependent on human interaction, the pandemic has adversely affected their livelihoods. Case in point, when COVID-19 hit last year, fashion photographer Shavonne Wong, who many of you might know from her appearances on Asia’s Next Top Model, had all her shoots cancelled or postponed.\nThis enterprising 31-year-old Singaporean creative, however, has used this setback to pivot and find new opportunities. One of these is the launch of an innovative virtual model agency, that uses computer graphics to create virtual models whose “shoots” are no longer dependent on weather, safety regulations or any other physical restriction. The other opportunity Wong has seized is the burgeoning NFT art market. She has created and successfully sold several beautiful NFT artworks.\nHI SHAVONNE, WERE YOU ALWAYS CREATIVE, EVEN WHEN YOUNG?\nYes. From very early on, I’ve always loved doing creative things. I was constantly doodling and drawing for the fun of it. Mainly visual creative stuff though – I’ve zero talent in music and dancing, which I came to realise through my 10 years of pianos lessons and many failed attempts to learn dance. Hahaha.DID YOUR PARENTS ENCOURAGE YOUR CREATIVITY?\nI’m incredibly thankful for my very supportive parents. I don’t think it was ever a surprise for them that I wanted to go into the creative field since I was constantly drawing as a kid, but I’m grateful that they did not try to push me towards any of the stereotypically ""Asian parent-approved fields"" like medicine or law. I was very lucky to have food in the fridge and a bed to sleep in, that afforded me the peace of mind to go into photography, taking risks and focusing all my energy into being as good a photographer as I could be.WHAT GOT YOU INTO PHOTOGRAPHY?\nI love the stories of photographers whose grandfathers were also professional photographers who handed them their camera to go on and continue their legacies. But to be honest, I got into photography because I was bored and wanted to explore something new. I had just graduated from polytechnic at that time and was flipping through fashion magazines and thought to myself, ""Oh, this can’t be too hard."" Hahaha, famous last words.\nThe first thing I did was to borrow a camera, rent a studio and drag my sister there for a photoshoot. I had no idea what I was doing and had to ask the studio owner to help with setting up the lighting, but I remember having a lot of fun so I just went on doing more and more shoots. Eventually, I started getting small jobs here and there which gradually grew more and more and before I knew it, it was a career.YOU WERE A RECURRING PHOTOGRAPHER ON ASIA’S NEXT TOP MODEL. DID YOU ENJOY THOSE EXPERIENCES?\nYes, of course, I grew up watching America’s Next Top Model so getting to be part of the franchise was honestly incredible. It was certainly different from the usual photography shoots I’ve been part of and being in front of the camera is so far out of my comfort zone, but it was very enjoyable.WERE YOU INSPIRED TO CONSIDER MORE ON-CAMERA TV APPEARANCES IN THE FUTURE?\nSure, it\xa0was a\xa0great\xa0experience and I’m very\xa0fortunate to have been able to be part\xa0of\xa0it. Also, I think as a creative I have learnt through the years that marketing one’s brand is just part of the job scope. You\xa0can’t be hired if nobody knows you exist. TV appearances like these are great for boosting brand image and it’s something I keep in mind too.\nHOW DIFFICULT IS THE LIFE OF A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER IN SINGAPORE? DO YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH MISCONCEPTIONS ON WHAT YOU DO?\nAs a freelance creative, there is always going to be ups and downs. People also think that the fashion industry is incredibly glamorous\xa0but truth to be told, there actually isn’t that much money in it.WHAT WAS THE BEST SHOOT YOU EVER RAN?\nMy most favourite shoot is definitely the one I did with Billy Porter. Firstly, I’m just such a huge fan! Secondly, I’m really used to photographing models and more often than not, we need them to be blank slates so we may mould them to the stories we want to tell. Photographing Billy Porter though was truly trying to capture moments of someone with such a big character. It was a wonderful experience. Also, music was played during the shoot and he sang along to it which in my head equals to me getting a private performance.AND WHAT WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT?\nThe America’s Next Top Model shoots were pretty crazy as they usually meant a whole day shoot and an overnight edit so they would have images the next day for the judging panel. Plus the added stress of being on TV! But still an overall very fun experience.\nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS?\nDuring the time when COVID-19 first hit, photoshoots were just flat out not allowed so that meant that all the jobs I had were all cancelled or postponed indefinitely. When that happened, I figured that if I can’t work with real models, I’ll just create my own. That was when I decided to pivot into 3D and spent the whole of 2020 focused on learning how to create realistic humans in 3D.LET’S TALK ABOUT THAT. WHAT EXACTLY IS A VIRTUAL MODELLING AGENCY?\nA virtual modelling agency is basically like a typical model agency, except instead of real models, all the models in the agency are virtual CGI humans.\n\xa0\nI started working on\xa0this in April 2020 – it took me approximately a year to reach a standard that I was fairly contented with. I’m still constantly learning new tricks and techniques while practising all the time to make them even better.WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS IN HOW YOU CAN USE THESE MODELS?\nGenerally, there aren’t limitations. That’s what so appealing about this, that with the virtual models, the possibilities are endless. Just that perhaps with the 3D space, literally everything will have to manually created. Example like if I was doing a photoshoot, putting an earring on my model is incredibly easy but in 3D, the earring will have to be manually created first.HOW DO YOU MAP A CLIENT’S PRODUCTS ONTO THE MODELS?\nCreating 3D garments is very similar to creating an outfit in real life. They use the same methods with the pattern cuttings so that’s usually the first thing I need from the client along with the actual garment patterns. The main software I use for clothing 3D is Marvelous Designer where the outfit is created and then draped onto the model.HAS IT BEEN HARD TO CONVINCE CLIENTS TO ADOPT THIS IDEA?\nYes, it’s been a little tricky trying to explain it to clients who might be a little hesitant to adopt\xa0early-stage technology. Many clients are very used to the traditional way of doing things and did not understand the requirements and different needs that come with creating results using virtual models in a 3D space.TELL ME ABOUT YOUR ENDEAVOURS INTO THE WORLDS OF NFTS. WHEN DID YOU FIRST DISCOVER NFTS AND WHAT DID YOU THINK?\nIn February this year, my husband was the one who introduced me to NFTs. I found the idea of it very interesting and was drawn towards being able to create artworks with no outside direction and actually earn from it. Having royalties from the secondary market implemented automatically through smart contracts was also very appealing.\nWhen I think of the future, I very much believe in a very virtual future which means that if you think of NFTs as digital assets, they will likely be here to stay. Looking at the kids nowadays on Roblox/Fortnite, there’s no online and offline world, it’s one world. Seeing that they are the future generation, going into the metaverse will be a very seamless transition for them. \nI think it’s very cool for artists that NFTs boomed for art but I believe that NFTs will be used to basically form everybody’s online avatar’s personalities through the art NFTs they own, music NFTs they listen to or fashion NFTs that they wear. I’m the sort of person who already has fun dressing up my characters when playing video games so the concept of NFTs in the metaverse made total sense to me.HOW HARD WAS IT TO START MAKING YOUR OWN AND SELLING THEM?\nI already had a couple of my models at a standard I was happy with, so it was really about putting them in a setting, lighting them, etc. Very much like a photoshoot. It was really exciting actually because I also got to experiment and try out a lot of things that I would not be able to do in real life. In 3D, I did not have to worry about silly real-world things like gravity or putting my models in space. I suddenly had a lot of artistic freedom to do whatever I wanted in my own personal voice.\nMy first few pieces all sold pretty quickly once I minted them so it all actually went really well for me. Majority of my works have been sold out and I’ve gotten really good feedback on them. It’s very flattering to be honest.\nDO YOU THINK THAT WITH THE CREATION OF THINGS LIKE NFTS, THE ART MARKET IS BEING CHANGED RADICALLY?\nYes. I believe it cuts out the middle man such as galleries, but it does put the burden of marketing and pricing straight on artists’ shoulders. Smart contracts also mean immediate payment when a piece is sold without the need to send invoices or contact clients about\xa0late payments. Getting royalties on secondary sales is also pretty sweet as it means that artists get to be paid when their works are resold for an extra value.FINALLY, WHAT INSPIRES YOU TO GET OUT OF BED?\nDoing new art, experimenting\xa0more with 3D and learning more about the technology.AND WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT?\nWondering if people like my art. The work I create for NFTs are\xa0personal work with\xa0no\xa0outside direction, which means that it can be incredibly\xa0freeing while also terrifying. Whenever I put out new\xa0work, I feel really\xa0vulnerable. I’m still a sensitive artist at heart after all. Other than that, it’s just the knowledge that we’re living through revolutionary times and wondering if I’m properly making use of the opportunity I have here.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Photography ', '     models ', ""     Asia's Next Top Model "", '     fashion ', ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      The Singaporean fashion designer who dresses brides, politicians and royalty
  </h1>, 'text': 'Stepping into Stylemart’s boutique on Selegie Road, you are immediately greeted by a resplendent array of colours. Hanging on the racks and elegantly draping over mannequins are saris, lehengas, gowns and more, each intricately embroidered and exquisitely tailored. \xa0\nThe designer behind them all is Kavita Thulasidas, who took over the family business from her mother. \nThe history of Stylemart, in fact,\xa0can be traced back to the 1950s. “It started off as a shop in Changi Village where my grandfather used to tailor suits and uniforms for British officers of the Royal Air Force (RAF),” the 47-year-old shared. \nIn the early 1980s, her mother, Huri Buxani, took over the business, turning it into a high-end Indian bridal fashion boutique. “She was actually the first to bring high-end Indian fashion to Singapore,” Thulasidas revealed. “For brides who were getting married, there was no question of them stopping by Stylemart to shop.” \nThulasidas was involved in the family business from a very young age. One could say that a penchant for fashion design runs in her blood. “I was one of those fashion-savvy teenagers, and I was just naturally interested in the business,” she shared. \xa0\nThe designer recalls travelling to India with her mother on merchandising trips, where she was exposed to the fascinating world of fabrics, textile weaving and embroidery. “I think I was a bit of a pain to the team in India at the time. You know, this little girl comes in, doesn’t really know anything, but starts pushing them to try this, try that,” she recounted with a laugh. \xa0\n\xa0\nAt 18, most youths would still be finding their passion in life. But at that age, Thulasidas had already launched her debut collection. \nShe officially took over the reins of the business six years later, at the age of 24. That was 1999, and the world was still reeling from the Asian Financial Crisis. Back then, Thulasidas was married and living in France (more on this later) but decided to return home to help her mother. \n“It was a very difficult time and I think that was when my input was most valued,” she recalled. “I told my mother, ‘Let’s combine my strength, my youth, my energy with your wisdom and years of experience, and let’s make something happen.’”\nArmed with fresh ideas to turn the business around, Thulasidas embarked on a rebranding of Stylemart in order to expand its clientele. \n“I wanted to do something more exclusive, more upmarket and diversify from bridal wear to couture, evening gowns and party wear,” she recounted. That’s when she began experimenting with fusing other Asian cultures into her designs, creating uniquely Singaporean creations. \nFor example, qipaos and kebayas are designed with Indian embroidery, while batik is used for saris. “We moved from being a household name within the Indian community, to becoming a Singapore fashion label,” she said. \nUNIQUE CREATIONS WITH AN ASIAN TWIST\nToday, Thulasidas is one of Singapore’s most established fashion designers. She counts ministers, media personalities, as well as royalty from around the region as some of her clients. \nThis year, she was one of eight local designers chosen to showcase at #SGFASHIONNOW, the first contemporary fashion exhibition by the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM). For the showcase, Thulasidas designed an elaborate kebaya sari, featuring intricate silk thread embroidery. \n“I think it’s really important to have clothes and designs that are classic,” she says of her design philosophy. “My signature style is one-of-a-kind pieces that use very skilled craftsmanship. Each piece has an Asian twist and is true to the ethnicity it belongs to.” \nIn 2005, Thulasidas also branched out to launch her own label, Asian Woman. The label has a high society following, with “more Westernised evening gowns” designed for red carpet events and parties. True to her signature style, she describes the designs as “Western wear with an ethnic twist”.\xa0 \nIn 2019, she debuted her eponymous label – Kavita Thulasidas – in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The boutique is located in One Galle Face Mall, a prestigious shopping development in the nation\'s capital. \nCompared to Stylemart, the label is “a little more exclusive, with couture bridal wear”, Thulasidas explained. “It is a very personalised and detailed design process for both the bride and the groom.” \nAfter waiting for a pickup in the wedding scene in Singapore, the designer is now preparing to launch the label here. Although it was originally slated to launch in September, she decided to hold it back a little longer in order to focus on the Deepavali festivities. \nOPTIMISM IN DIFFICULT TIMES \nBeing an events-oriented fashion label, Stylemart as well as its sub-brands have not been spared from the pandemic. But robust business during this Deepavali period is pointing towards “a very promising recovery”, Thulasidas commented.\n“It was very unpredictable at first. We started production very early, but when Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) was announced, we tried our best to pull the brakes as much as we could. But now, we realised that we actually need our stocks. Even if it\'s a home event, people want to be dressed up.”\nThulasidas is no stranger to navigating through tough times, having steered the business through the Asian Financial Crisis. The key, she believes, is to remain optimistic. \n“It’s not about how the pandemic affects you, but how you cope through it. I\'ve seen this business through many different cycles, including the ups and downs of the Asian Financial Crisis,” she said. \n“I won’t boldly say that I have become immune to difficult times, but I have just become very used to saying, “Okay, this is just a phase”. We just go back to basics, tighten the belt. We\'re going to run a tight ship to get through these stormy days and in a matter of time, we will see the sunlight again.""\nHARD WORK AND SACRIFICE\nPandemic or not, the life of a fashion designer may seem glamourous on the surface. But behind the scenes, churning out designs, along with managing an entire business, is a lot of hard work. \nFor Thulasidas, getting to where she is required a lot of sacrifice. Prior to taking over Stylemart, she had just given birth to her first daughter the year before, the mother-of-two shared. \nWhen asked how she balanced life as a young mum together with leading a business, she answered with a smile: “I don’t know how I did it, I just did it.”\n“But I must say, the business really took a big part of my life,” she mused. “Sometimes, when I think about it, I do feel that I missed out on a certain phase in my life. I was working [from such a young age] and sometimes I feel that my youth was spent working very, very, hard.” \nStill, she counts herself lucky to be doing something she’s passionate about. “Not many people can say that,” she acknowledged. \nShe describes the time she spent living in France – the fashion capital of the world – as an eye-opening experience that allowed her to fully embrace her love for design. \n“I spent a lot of time reflecting, researching and just dabbling in fashion. When you get into something so young, sometimes you don’t think too much about it. But those three years away from the family business made me realise that fashion is something that I am good at. And if I had the chance, it’s something I want to do,” she said. \nHaving devoted her life to the family business, would she expect her children to take over one day? “You know what I’ve done? I spoiled the market for myself, because my children have seen me work so hard, I think they became scared,” Thulasidas responded with a laugh. \nWhile she describes her 23-year-old daughter as “artistically talented”, she is currently pursuing a career as a lawyer, she shared. Her 18-year-old son, however, has shown interest in business.\n“He likes chatting with me about business processes, things I\'m doing right in my company. He’s also got a lot of advice on things that I’m doing wrong,” Thulasidas laughed. “I think that he might get involved in multiple businesses in the future, and mine might be one among them.”\nBut at the end of the day, she believes that the business should be handed down to the most capable person. “One thing about family businesses is that you always think it should be kept within the family. But I\'m open to the idea of offering it later, when the time is right, to a deserving candidate who is talented, and not just someone within the family.” \nFLYING THE FLAG\nReflecting on her career, Thulasidas shares that one thing she is proud of is the ability to represent Singapore in her designs. “When I see women I dress attend state events, I take a lot of pride in that, because I think the designs truly reflect our Singaporean identity. We are a small country, but we have a strong sense of culture.”\n“I also cherish the fact that I get to dress women for special occasions. I get to be a part of their celebrations and bring joy into their lives. And that really gives me a certain sense of validation and satisfaction with the work that I do,” she added. \nThulasidas calls it an honour to be able to continue her family’s legacy. “My grandfather was very proud of what my mother achieved in her time, and my mother too is very proud that I have taken the business to new\xa0heights. It was all achieved with\xa0hard work, grit and determination. Nothing comes easy, and it is with their blessings that we grow.” \n', 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     fashion ']}"

      Fitted or flared? One woman's search for the perfect pair of yoga pants
  </h1>, 'text': 'Not unlike women looking for\xa0Mr Right, the search for the perfect pair of yoga pants can sometimes be an elusive, even\xa0futile, search.\nI\'m speaking from experience, after a trial\xa0class at a now-defunct yoga centre in the leafy depths of Serangoon Gardens eventually led to me becoming a daily disciple of hatha yoga\xa0for several years after.\nAt that time, Lululemon’s high-waisted, flared Groove were the yoga pants to wear.\xa0Everyone who was serious about her practice got on her mat in a pair. So naturally, I wore one.\nThe pants\' relaxed silhouette was even widely credited to have sparked the athleisure movement that gripped yoginis and non-yoginis alike. But the\xa0Groove pant was abruptly discontinued in 2016, which, incidentally, was roughly around that same time I put my\xa0yoga practice on extended savasana (the\xa0final resting pose in yoga). \nThat would have spelled\xa0the end of my relationship with yoga (and yoga pants). But thanks to COVID-19,\xa0I recently started to crave getting back on that mat again.\xa0The hefty burden of many extra pandemic pounds finally broke the sleep spell.\nDespite not practising for some time, I fervently remembered yoga to be a ritual that involves being ""present"". Unfortunately, my yoga wardrobe of yore no longer served\xa0my present body.\xa0\nGetting new yoga wear became paramount. So, several clicks of the mouse later, I quickly got up to date with the latest togs and found something curious.\nThe second-skin yoga pants in a spectrum of colours that has been dominating the yoga scene for the past couple of years are\xa0still omnipresent. What was interesting though was the return of the once-discontinued flared Groove. Except this time, it wasn’t a solo effort by Lululemon. Other yoga wear heavyweights such as\xa0Alo, Sweaty Betty and Lorna Jane have also jumped on the bandwagon.\nAnother interesting thing I observed: Only Lululemon peddles the revived Groove pant (S$152) specifically as yoga wear. \nThe rest market\xa0themselves as something else.\xa0Sweaty Betty’s Power Kick Flare Gym Trousers (S$170) is designed as multi-sport workout pants for women who prefer non-form-fitting togs. Alo’s High-Waist Zip it Flare Legging (US$128/S$173) is a pair of athleisure pants that comes with a hidden zipper that allows the wearer to decide on how big a flare she wants. Lorna Jane’s Hendrix Flared Leggings’ (S$130) proprietary LJ Cloud material combines casualwear with sporting specs like a patented Active Core Stability feature and four-way stretch.\nTo me, they\'re all the same: Flared yoga pants. And they\'re back. Just like me.\nBut what was behind the resurgence of\xa0this trend?\nPresenter-entrepreneur Jade Seah, who\'s behind the newly launched line of sportswear\xa0JUUJAA, explained to me:\xa0""Yoga pants, activewear and athleisure wear in general take cues from fashion trends. This [trend]\xa0coincides with the trend in denim.\xa0These [pants] come with a higher waistband for 2021. Higher-waisted cuts have been trending and do not look like they are on a decline anytime soon, and with these have come variations on the straight-legged trend – bootcuts and flares, which are also a little more forgiving on those not blessed with height.""\nBut while I was pleasantly surprised to see flared yoga pants back on the shelves, a quick\xa0survey around yoga centres showed that other yoginis aren’t tripping over themselves to embrace this new-again trend. \nPresenter and celebrity yoga instructor Denise Keller for one is not buying into it. “I think the flared pants won’t make any sense in a strong Ashtanga practice where binds are common especially around the ankles,” she told me.\n“Flared yoga pants belong in the same category as yoga skorts, which epically failed for functionality and as a result, discontinued in the world of yoga. Flared yoga pants feel the same,” added an ambassador for yoga apparel and equipment Manduka.\xa0“I don’t need anything flapping around when I’m on the mat. it’s just too distracting and there is no ankle support.”\nSeah agreed, ""I can see how a very large flare might not work for certain\xa0poses such as inversions. I would say, be sensible about it, and pick pieces that flatter and will work for the activity in question.""\nSo what are women looking for in a good pair of yoga pants? While every yogini may have a different answer that spans form to fit, at its core, it is how the pants cater\xa0to the well-being of the wearer, offering solutions to movement.\nFrom a designer\'s point of view, Seah believes\xa0that a good pair of yoga pants should not restrict movement in any way.\n""When designing, comfort and practicality are as important to me as fashion and style,"" Seah said. ""They need to be lightweight yet be able to hold in any wobbly bits. The material should be soft and comfortable; almost feel like second skin.""\nSpeaking from a practitioner’s point of view, the 39-year-old Keller shared, “Choice of material is very important in a pair of yoga leggings. I need them soft to the skin, but supportive enough to practice”.\nMany of my yoga peers shared Keller’s mindset. In fact, they have a specific ""uniform""\xa0they wear to class. The said uniform generally consists of a body-skimming top and a favourite pair of tights – among them are Lululemon’s Align tights, Alo’s Airbrush tights and Lorna Jane’s Lotus tights. Whenever those styles of yoga pants drop a new colour, they have\xa0to own it.\xa0\nKeller summed up the mindset. “I’m a minimalist yogi – once I like the material and design, I stick with it for life.”\nSizing also matters. While small, medium, large may work for some, many others are overlooked. Asians in particular get the shorter end of the stick when shopping with international labels, making do with the closest measurement available on the sizing chart. Some sportswear retailers are finally coming round to this gap on the size\xa0chart though. \nThis May, the Canadian retailer Lululemon went the extra mile to launch a completely new range of sizing for styles that are particularly popular in Asia – Asian Fit was introduced for selected\xa0items in order to create a more customised fit for Asian customers who have been overlooked by the regular size chart. \xa0\nFitted or flared,\xa0yoga pants that fit\xa0your body\xa0and your choice of activity is the best pair. \nAnd in case you\'re wondering how my search for new yoga pants went, I’m happy to report that I\'ve locked in on my targets:\xa0Lululemon’s Instill high-rise pants for\xa0its patented SmoothCover fabric hugs like a pair of Luxtreme but feels like Align’s Nulu material; and Sweaty Betty’s Power 7/8 Gym legging for its bum-sculpting seams that\xa0help\xa0me\xa0look the part\xa0of an active person even before I start breaking a sweat.\nIf being on-trend is your thing, you can save the flared yoga pant for low-impact activities like a stretch class or a trip to the supermarket. For\xa0fashion inspiration, the uber chic Keller has a style nugget to share:\xa0""You could wear them like any other pair of yoga leggings, with a simple white t-shirt or a boyfriend shirt. Just don’t stand too close to the sides of escalators…”.\n', 'related_topics': ['     exercise ', '     Yoga ', '     fashion ']}"

      Why are people paying top dollar for cartoon character luxury watches?
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s been 88 years since the world’s most famous mouse first appeared on a watch, when American watchmaker Ingersoll had the cute idea of using the Disney mascot’s hands to indicate the hours and minutes. Making its debut at the Chicago World’s Fair in 1933 to a crowd still reeling from the Great Depression, the Mickey Mouse watch was the bright spark people needed, and 11,000 pieces were sold on the fair’s first day at Macy’s.\nThe watch was meant to appeal to the masses, which meant it would take another 50 years before any luxury watchmaker would dare to take on “fun” attributes for its serious products. That watchmaker turned out to be Gerald Genta, who released his first Mickey Watch in 1984 at the Montres et Bijoux in Geneva – much to the horror of its organisers who deemed it inappropriate for its highfalutin crowd. So Genta responded by leaving, and continued to make them well into the 1990s.\nBut oh, how the world has changed. Not only have such “character watches” come to be accepted in the world of six-figure tickers, they are now actively sought out and embraced. Earlier this year at the Geneva Watch Days, Bulgari paid homage to Genta’s rebellious creation by unveiling the Gerald Genta Arena Retrograde with Smiling Mickey Mouse. The 150-piece limited edition uses Mickey’s left hand as a mono-retrograde minute hand, and includes jumping hours at 5 o’clock, giving the mechanically inclined something else to smile about.\nOne can argue that Mickey Mouse is old and iconic enough to be pardoned on a luxury timepiece, but the same can’t be said for Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak Concept “Black Panther” Flying Tourbillon. The Marvel hero is crafted in white gold, appearing to crouch over a flying tourbillon at 6 o’clock. Though the design is polarising, the workmanship is unquestionably top-notch, requiring 30 hours of work by four engravers and four painters on each of the 250 pieces made. A one-off version in 18K white gold with a hand-engraved case sold for a stunning US$5.2 million (S$7 million) to a bidder in China this April – a record price for an Audemars Piguet at auction.\nWhy are people paying top dollar for what is essentially elevated childhood memorabilia? Crown magazine’s editor-in-chief Alvin Wong weighs in: “Character watches, while cute and seemingly playful and novel, are no child’s play,” he said, referencing the complications found in the Gerald Genta and Audemars Piguet watches.\n“These are serious pieces that demand deep pockets and more than a passing appreciation of high-end watchmaking. Obviously, with the example of the Audemars Piguet x Marvel collection, the idea was to get some of Marvel’s mojo to entice collectors, who probably grew up with the comics and are now of-age ballers.”\nIt would certainly explain Tag Heuer’s decision to collaborate with Nintendo on its collection of smartwatches. The Tag Heuer Connected x Super Mario is awash with references to the video game legend, such as the M logo on the crown, the rubber and leather straps in Super Mario red, and a dial that gets more animated the more physically active the wearer. According to Tag Heuer CEO Frederic Arnault, the collaboration was meant to “add a bit of fun and originality to [the wearers’] activities and wellness.”\nProminent watch blogger Su Jia Xian believes character watches are gaining ground recently because the industry’s heavyweights are finally starting to make them – and market them heavily. “They were less prominent before because the brands making them were niche, like Romain Jerome, or they were affordable, like the ones made by Seiko,” he said.\nPerhaps with this increased awareness, more indie examples of pop culture-themed watches will show up on the radar. Who wouldn’t want a US$100,000 Space Jam Tourbillon by Kross Studio or a pink gold version of the S.U.F Sarpaneva x Moomin watch made specially for The Hour Glass? Okay, not everyone, but even those who aren’t fans might consider these investment-worthy collectors’ items.\n“Character watches generally have more value on the secondary market than the equivalent watch without the cartoon or comic branding,” continued Su. “It makes sense since the premium is essentially for the appeal bestowed by the intellectual property on the dial.”\nIn the case of Omega and its Moonwatches, the presence of Snoopy on those Speedmaster dials doesn’t just indicate rarity and bloated price tags – it reminds the owner of the brand’s heroic ties to NASA and the agency’s Silver Snoopy award for outstanding achievements related to mission success.\nBut often, joy alone is enough of a reason for people to hanker after a character watch. “They are the ultimate wearable expressions of nostalgia, a discreet way to mark one’s personal adoration for a beloved mascot,” said Minxiang Yang, founder of watch consultancy Chrono.Design. “I look forward to seeing more of such collaborative efforts done in a more subtle manner, going beyond simply slapping the character’s silhouette on the dial. A good example is Seiko’s homage to the Naruto franchise.”\nFor Ivan Chua, founder of local micro-brand Vario, staying on-trend was the last thing on his mind when he was conceptualising the Popeye edition of his upcoming Navi Nautical Jumping Hour watch.\n“I didn’t realise pop culture watches were getting popular,” he admitted. “This watch is meant to be a tribute to Gerald Genta, and I just wanted to make something that reminds me of my childhood – perhaps that’s the appeal of character watches. These characters became ingrained in us, so the watches we wear show off a bit of who we are, while reminding ourselves of the good old days.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Timepieces & Jewellery ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ']}"

      10 minutes with… The great-great-great-grandson of Louis Vuitton
  </h1>, 'text': 'Tall, handsome, charming, stylish, and the sixth-generation descendant of Louis Vuitton, there could be no better frontman for the French luxury house than 44-year-old Benoit-Louis Vuitton.\nAs its corporate director of Art, Culture and Patrimony, he represents and embodies the heritage and values of the company, handles client relations for high-end customers, and manages the Asnieres Family House (which he lived in till he was seven), as well as the company’s gallery and exhibition contents.\nTo mark 200 years after the birth of his great-great-great-grandfather, Benoit-Louis recently hosted an intimate virtual tour of the Asnieres house and atelier that Louis Vuitton built near Paris, France.\nCNA Luxury: Thanks for having us! Tell us about the Asnieres house and how important it is to the family.\nBenoit-Louis Vuitton: The original family house was built a little after the Asnieres atelier, which was built four or five years after Louis Vuitton founded the maison in Paris in 1854, as he needed a bigger space to create his traditional trunks.\nThe dining room is decorated very simply. There’s a small display of wedding trunks that Gaston, grandson of Louis Vuitton, collected. Eastern and Middle Eastern in origin, they’re decorated with motifs such as lovebirds, which represent love and the richness of family life.\nGaston was a crazy collector of everything and anything. Thanks to him, we are starting to gather archives, with more than 100,000 documents, and 20,000 objects, not just from Louis Vuitton.\nThe living room dates back to 1900 and is an extension created by George, son of Louis Vuitton. It’s Art Nouveau in style and richer in terms of decoration, with ceiling mouldings, paintings, stained glass windows, a green ceramic fireplace with floral motifs, a bronze bust of Louis Vuitton, and one of Louis Vuitton’s earlier trunks in striped canvas, as a coffee table.\nThe rich environment was created to welcome suppliers and showcase how creative and successful the business was. At present this room has an old, vintage feel to it, but it was very modern and innovative for its time.\nWhat memories do you have growing up in this house?\nIt was nice growing up in a place like that. Not only in the family house, but running around the workshop. The environment influenced my values and way of life –manufacturing, craftsmanship, innovation, how things look. \xa0\nMy brother and I also spent a lot of time playing in the garden. We found it funny to throw things around and break the little glass panels of the living room’s stained glass windows. We also had yearly BBQs in summer and Christmas parties with all the employees.\nAnd where do you live now?\nIn an apartment in Paris, which is modern, but filled with vintage pieces from my [late] father (Patrick-Louis Vuitton). I spend weekends in my father’s country house, which I’m getting renovated at the moment. I’m keeping the old wooden frame but incorporating a contemporary glass house, and buying pieces of modern art for it.\nI am a mix of history and tradition, innovation and modernity, so I like to mix things up. It goes with my DNA, and with the curiosity we have at Louis Vuitton to remain innovative.\nWhat has your career path been like?\nI did Management and Marketing studies in a Franco-American business school in Paris, then internships in Paris, London and Japan for Louis Vuitton and Chaumet. I was watch and jewellery manager at a store in New York from 2003 to 2005.\nFrom 2005 to 2015, I was head of product for Watches, then head of commercial development of High Watchmaking; I was also involved in the commercial development of High Jewellery.\nFrom 2015 to 2019, I was director of the Canadian Toronto Maison, then from 2019 to 2020, I was director of Customer Experiences for Louis Vuitton Atelier. This year, I became corporate director, Art, Culture and Patrimony.\nYou’re a watch buff?\nYes, but I don’t count the number of watches I own.\nEven as boys, my brother and I liked watches and jewellery. We used to fight a bit, so my father told us, “if you behave, you will each get a 10-franc coin at night. We made 270 french francs each after a month – not the full 310, because there were days we did fight. We used the money to buy Swatches as we were collecting them then.\nWhen my brother turned 18, he requested a watch as a gift. I did the same. For men, it’s the only jewel you can wear. There’s always a story behind watches. That’s why when you start collecting them, you never stop.\nBefore I started working with the family business, my father [Patrick-Louis] had jokingly said every generation has to bring something new to the business.\nI said I would introduce watches and jewellery to Louis Vuitton. What we did in the last 15 to 20 years – business has been growing, and I am proud to be part of that. I had the luck to work with our master watchmakers Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini, who still work in Geneva (at La Fabrique du Temps Louis Vuitton).\nWhat’s a typical week like for you?\nCrazy, because we just finished the [fashion] shows. What I like most about the shows is the day after, where we see and touch the products – the quality, creativity, attention to detail and craftsmanship – with our clients.\nThere’s no typical week, more like there’s a typical hour. I’m always jumping from one topic to another, going from one meeting to another, crossing between buildings as our offices are located in two different buildings. It’s crazy but interesting. There’s so much energy, seeing different people, as I work with all the departments – communications, client relations, and so on.\nOn weekends, I visit the country house to rest mentally, but I have many activities going on there! When you are working for LV and with the family, you are always on the go. We are all nuts. It’s not a question of age, but of mentality. As long as you’re curious about life, about everything, that’s what makes things interesting.\nYesterday we launched to press a new (fictionalised) novel about Louis Vuitton. We also talked about if we were to do a movie about the life of Louis Vuitton, who would be the actors? We had in mind a French-American actor as a young Louis Vuitton, maybe Anthony Hopkins as an older Louis Vuitton. As for Louis around 40… maybe it would be Virgil [Abloh]… it matches our spirit of disruption.\n\xa0What are your favourite Louis Vuitton items for everyday use?\nThe black-and-white varsity jacket from the SS2021 menswear collection, with alphabet patches and hand-knitted crochet flowers on it.\nMy Keepall Bandouliere 50 in Damier Distorted Canvas from a SS2021 popup, with black-and-white Damier checks. I like that it’s a traditional bag shape created many years ago, but with a modern interpretation.\nMy Monogram wallet, with a colourful interior.\nThe Louis Vuitton Escale Spin Time Meteorite watch, with a titanium case, rose gold bezel, a nice mechanism, and a face made out of real meteorite. You’re wearing billions of years on your wrist!\nIn terms of shoes: Sneakers made out of python, and leather boots with a beautiful patina – black with a tint of green.\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside of work?\nI’m an outdoorsy person. I like to go to the gym, ride horses, ride bikes, run, be outside, and be in nature with animals.\nWhat are you up to next?\nA trip to South Africa. I like the idea of being surrounded by big lions and other animals, not being connected to media, being told not to leave the bedroom at night to go to the outdoors bathroom just 10 metres away, because there are wild animals around.\nI’m going to see gorillas too. I like the idea that I am one little human in front of a big family of gorillas who can break you into two with their bare hands. In a family like mine, we live with a lot of privilege, but it’s nice to feel you are just a little something in a big world.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Timepieces & Jewellery ']}"

      Across Asia, why are more men carrying women's handbags?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Terence Lee was recently offered an Birkin bag from a Hermes boutique. The 31-year-old Malaysian, a pediatric doctor working in Australia, has been a bag collector for many years. \n“I think it’s safe to say that most bag lovers who are into luxury would likely include the Birkin as one of their ‘holy grails’ and I am no different. I’ve been collecting designer handbags since I started working, and the Hermes Birkin used to seem so unattainable when I first started this mostly unhealthy journey,” Lee told CNA Luxury. \nTo celebrate his 30th birthday last year, Lee purchased a preloved Birkin 35 in Togo leather with palladium hardware from a reseller based in Singapore. “Very recently, I was offered a Birkin 35 from my local store in Melbourne and of course I said yes before I even saw it in the flesh. It is an etain (matt grey) Birkin 35 in Togo leather with rose gold hardware and I love her so much,” he quipped. \nLee is just one of many men featured on the Instagram account @birkinclub4boys. The account, which has around 15,700 followers, invites men from around the world to submit photos with their Birkin bags.\xa0\nFeatured on a similar account, @birkinmen, is 38-year-old business owner and freelance makeup artist, Preston Tran. \n“I am a bag lover in general and I have always been in love with Hermes,” the Vietnamese-American shared. \nA trip to Les Ateliers Hermes (Hermes’s workshop in Paris) this summer only grew Tran’s love for the brand. “After witnessing how each Hermes bag is made behind the scenes, it made me appreciate their products more. All the skills and techniques that Hermes’s craftsmen put into the products, such as hand-stitching, proves that the bags are given so much love. It is what makes them special not just for the craftsmen themselves, but also to all bag lovers out there.” \nTran has an enviable collection of 15 Hermes bags. “Most of them are Birkins in size 40, 35, and 25. I also have one Kelly Touch in size 32, a Mini Lindy and a Constance,” he shared. \nThe story of how the Birkin bag, arguably the most sought-after luxury bag in the world, came to be is\xa0one that’s oft told. In 1981, actress and singer Jane Birkin was boarding a plane when she met Hermes chief Jean-Louis Dumas. While trying to fit all her carry-on items into the overhead compartment, she realised that her handbag could not hold all her belongings. Birkin began to rant to Dumas about how fashionable bags were never big enough to fit all of one’s things. \nInspired, Dumas began dreaming up the perfect bag and the Birkin was born, crafted in supple leather with Hermes’s signature saddle stitching with a buckled flap top and swivel clasp. The original design has endured ever since. “The workmanship behind the Birkin is impeccable and the style is tres chic,” commented Lee. Of course, one cannot simply walk into a Hermes boutique to score a Birkin. “The fact that it is somewhat elusive makes it all the more exclusive too,” Lee added.\nTHE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA \nWhile the Birkin was first created as a women’s handbag, over the years, more and more men have been carrying them too. Before becoming a Chanel ambassador, K-pop artist G-Dragon was known for toting around a Birkin 40 in red with gold hardware. \nAlso spotted with the Birkin on Instagram – Singaporean Bling Empire star Kane Lim and local celebrity hairdresser David Gan. \nAlthough the trend is not new, auction houses that CNA Luxury spoke too – namely Christie’s, Bonhams and Sotheby’s – shared that there has been a steadily growing percentage of male Asian bidders at recent auctions. \n“We have seen this trend all over the world and in Asia, with big stars such as G-Dragon initiating this trend,” said Morgane Halimi, Sotheby’s head of Handbags and Accessories. \nMeanwhile, Jerry Chang, associate specialist, Handbags and Accessories Department of Christie’s Asia Pacific, noted that the auction house has seen “active participation from Hong Kong and Southeast Asian male clients”. \n“Southeast Asian collectors are very strong,” concurred Humphrey Cheung, Bonhams’ specialist of Designer Handbags. “One reason is that social media is developing very quickly there and so there’s been a bigger demand for people to be seen with rare bags.”\nCheung pointed to the example of Thai influencer Bas, known for his wide collection of luxury bags and unboxing videos on his Instagram account, @bsweetintoxication. \nMeanwhile in Hong Kong, dentist and influencer Christoffer Cheung, @curiouschristoffer on Instagram, has amassed almost 60,000 followers with OOTDs styled with luxury bags. \nSOUGHT-AFTER BIRKINS\nThere are several reasons why men are attracted to the Birkin in particular. These include fashion and size, said Christie’s Chang. “Men appreciate craftsmanship, quality and subtlety in handbags,” Chang commented. “The Birkin also offers different sizes – particularly large ones that can best address a modern man’s needs.” \nSotheby’s Halimi shares that “men generally look for sizes 35 or above and often in dark colours. But more and more men have been attracted by shiny or matte exotic skins that will bring a rock touch to any outfit”. \nTwo rare models – the Shadow Birkin and the Birkin Cargo – are very sought-after by men, Halimi shared. The Shadow Birkin was designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier in 2009 when he was creative director of Hermes. The design features the illusion of a top flap, embossed onto leather. “It doesn’t have any hardware, which a lot of men appreciate.”\nOn the other hand, the Birkin Cargo “is appreciated for its multiple pockets. It is also lightweight because it is made from canvas,” said Halimi. \nBonhams’ Cheung, however, noted an increase in interest in the Birkin Mini. “Men go for the mini Birkin nowadays [because] we don’t have the need to carry a great amount of things. Smaller bags generally have strong resale value as well.” \nBesides the Birkin, Cheung also noted that the Hermes Mini Lindy has become popular. \nAnother popular model is the Hermes Kelly in size 40, shared Christie’s Chang. “It’s also one of the most recognisable and classic Hermes handbags. Kelly bags come with a shoulder strap, which is more convenient for men as they can carry the bag on their shoulders,” he said. \nTHE RISE OF ANDROGYNOUS FASHION\nBag collector Lee styles his Birkin as an everyday bag, paired mostly with casual wear from T-shirts to jeans and basic knitwear. “I guess the Birkin just elevates every look. I do draw the line at sweatsuits though!” he quipped. \nIt is not only the Birkin that is having a moment among male bag collectors. Some of Lee’s favourite bags in his collection include the Dior Saddle and the Chanel Mini Flap, while Tran cites mini bags from Louis Vuitton and Dior as some of his favourites. \nBoth Tran and Lee represent a growing group of consumers embracing androgynous fashion. In recent years, fashion has increasingly challenged gender norms. \nBack in 2017, G-Dragon made a stir as the face of Chanel’s Gabrielle bag campaign. More recently, in 2020, Gucci reissued the Jackie handbag, aimed at all genders. Musician Harry Styles appeared in the fashion house’s Gucci Beloved campaign, sporting the Jackie. \n“I don’t think it is just handbags but fashion in general is getting more gender-neutral,” Lee commented. “I guess it works both ways. As more women wear pant suits out of love for the style, more men are carrying handbags.”\nAt the end of day, Lee believes it is “not about what you wear, but how you wear it”. \n“To me, I think that it is very personal when it comes to art, fashion and beauty,” shared Tran. His advice? “Just do whatever you want to do that makes you feel happy and comfortable, regardless of gender. That’s all that matters!” \n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Hermes ']}"

The sleeves are too short, with as much as three inches of shirt cuff popping out. The point of good tailoring is that it hangs smoothly; Craig’s Bond suits cling and pull around the waist and chest. The jackets stop near the top joint of the thumb, rather than the canonical lower one, when Craig’s arms hang by his side. The lapels are too skinny for a broad-chested man and look cartoonish.\nAll of these disasters have been on display from Casino Royale right up to (or, as I call it, No Time for a Second Fitting). It is hard to accept that Bond, the great model of masculine style and icon of a nation known for its bespoke suits, has fallen so low. We assume that anything 007 wears looks good by definition. But search online for some pictures and look for yourself. These are very fine, hilariously ill-fitting clothes.\nI am hardly the first to make this observation. The problems are obvious, and people who understand how tailoring really works (I don’t) have long expressed their horror on social media. The problems cannot be explained by the fact that Craig is muscular. As Scott Schuman of The Sartorialist notes, a little extra space in the midsection of a jacket, and a single pleat in the trousers, softens the angular lines of a gym body to excellent effect. Sean Connery competed as a bodybuilder as a young man; he managed to find suits that fit.\nIt is also impossible that the suits are the way they are by mistake. There are plenty of dumb things in multibillion-dollar movie franchises, but all of them are dumb on purpose. What are the stylists going for here? Jesse Thorn of PutThisOn suggests they may be “a way to emphasise his inelegant, almost brutish physicality”. (He also points out, with perfect accuracy, that Craig’s suits have “inspired a generation of shitty groomsman outfits”.) This certainly fits the image of Craig’s iteration of Bond as dour and lethal. But I think the effect is not to make him look tough, but rather to make him look short. At 5ft 10in, he isn’t.\nMy theory is that the filmmakers are trying hard to make Bond look “contemporary”, a natural impulse when trying to draw young viewers to a 60-year-old series. It may have worked, for all I know. Certainly, tight was in style in the heyday of the Thom Browne suit. But these suits, which fit skinny boys nicely, are awful on big men, as LeBron James proved by buying them for his teammates at the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was all very fashion-forward and looked like hell. Other large-framed stars, from Idris Elba to Chris Pratt, have squeezed into snug suits, with similarly disastrous results. But, in any case, the small-suit moment may have passed.\nThere is an interesting philosophical question here. Is there really such a thing as the right way for a suit to fit? I mean, who cares how much cuff shows, or whether you button the second button, or what have you? All of the so-called-rules, one might argue, are simply matters of arbitrary aesthetic whim, and if they have any good use, it’s that they are fun to break. If everyone decides a tight suit looks good, then it does.\nThe problem with this argument is that it is difficult to look chic while also looking uncomfortable. The problem with Craig’s Bond suits is that they would in fact be terrible clothing for driving a motorcycle out of the back of a plane (or whatever). If I’m going on a secret mission, you can be damn sure I’m going to be able to crouch down without straining the inside seam of my trousers or sweating right through my jacket.\nA century ago (as Thorstein Veblen explained), fancy clothes were designed to make physical activity impossible to comfortably complete, in order to demonstrate distance from the working classes. Hence the top hat and the corset. But beyond high heels, it is difficult to think of a holdover from that barbaric era. If there is something constricting about a suit, it doesn’t fit. The true rules of tailoring (as opposed to mere preferences about details) are what they are because they convey ease, through the natural drape of the cloth and the proportionality of the cut. Craig’s suits look uncomfortable, and therefore they make him look like a try-hard.\nThe makers of the next Bond film have a puzzle to solve, one that the Craig episodes failed to crack – how to retain the elegant classicism, the idea of Bond as a connoisseur, that is intrinsic to the series, while still selling millions of movie tickets to young people. The interesting thing is that this is the very same problem faced by every maker of luxury menswear. Of course, it will not do to put Bond in high-end trainers and a cashmere jumper. But there is a neat solution to the filmmakers’ dilemma: Make the next Bond female, and open whole new vistas for what a stylish superspy should look like.\nBy Robert Armstrong © 2021 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     celebrity ', '     Television & Movies ', '     fashion ']}"

      Fashion trend alert: Are you ready to ditch your 'mom jeans' for low-rise denim?
  </h1>, 'text': 'I recently did the unthinkable: I set aside my collection of classic high-waisted denim to shimmy into a pair of low-rise jeans. \nYears ago, I had stuffed my low riding jeans deep into the innermost recesses of my wardrobe, swearing I would never be caught dead in them ever again.\nBut in recent months, Y2K trends such as trucker hats, candy coloured bling and bedazzled anything have been experiencing a resurgence on TikTok and on the streets. Then before any of us could have seen it coming, celebrity trendsetters including the likes of pop star Dua Lipa and models Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner have been parading around in low-rise jeans.\nWith that, it became official. Whether you like it or not, the most dreaded but iconic noughties look of all – tummy baring, almost butt-crack revealing low-rise jeans are back.\nLike many elder millennials who experienced the original wave of this trend in the early 2000s, I once practically lived in these hipbone-revealing jeans, often pairing them with baby tees or teeny crop tops a la Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Paris Hilton. Thankfully, this happened before camera phones were a norm, so there is little evidence of my #ootd\xa0back then.\nWhat remains seared in my memory is the trauma of constantly worrying about muffin tops if I overate at lunch and how I would compulsively tug my jeans up every few minutes because they hung so low that I feared they would fall off.\nSo, when waistlines began to creep up and high-waisted jeans became a thing, I gladly abandoned those ultra-low styles in favour of the covered-up styles that provided so much more security in keeping the belly area nicely cinched in. Naturally, I was more than a little horrified to realise that my days of looking\xa0au currant in mom jeans could be numbered.\nBut if you, too, still suffer from uncomfortable flashbacks due to your fashion booboos of the past, do not panic yet. As with many trend revivals, this is somewhat different from the OG. \nWhile today’s low-slung jeans will, of course, sit low under the belly button, they actually have a much more forgiving, relaxed fit compared to those super tight, bum hugging versions of yore that would only fit the skinniest of waifs. So worry not, they are much less likely to dig into your hips and cut off blood circulation. \nStyling a low-rise outfit is more versatile these days too. Take a style cue from Hailey Bieber and Emily Ratajkowski, who have a penchant for baring their abs with low-rise jeans that come with slouchier legs. Add a barely-there top and balance it out with chunky white sneakers and voila, this is the 2021 iteration of how to pull off this look.\nGranted, although most of the fashion set celebrities spotted in this style are conventionally slim, this is actually a rather inclusive look that women in a diverse range of body shapes could pull off with panache. \nIf you are one of those #fitspo types who have spent most of the past year and a half of COVID-19-induced isolation and lockdowns diligently working out to Zoom fitness and yoga lessons, consider these low-rise jeans the perfect flex for your hard-earned abs while still being roomy enough to accommodate your muscled thighs and butt.\nOr if you have been more inclined to languish on your couch while bingeing all the Netflix series as soon as they are dropped, there is no reason why you cannot pull off these comfy low jeans even if you have put on some pandemic pounds. If crop tops make you happy, wear them. In this era of body positivity, what matters is that your clothes empower you.\nAlternatively, simply pick a top that is a little longer than the waistband for more coverage. The day I finally wore low slung denim for the first time in over a decade, I chose to ease myself back into this trend by pairing the jeans with an oversized boyfriend button up that I could tuck into the waistband. \nAs a bonus, unlike high-waisted pants which tend to look most flattering on those with naturally tiny waists, low-rise jeans accentuate the curves of one’s hips and booty no matter what your proportions are. \nAfter almost a decade of wearing high-waisted jeans that cinched and held everything in, sometimes to the point of discomfort, it was – dare I say it – liberating to, well, let it hang more naturally in low slung denim and be able to take full, deep breaths with ease. \nIn fact, I enjoyed wearing my low-rise jeans so much that I am putting them back into regular rotation in my wardrobe. But that does not mean I am getting rid of my mom jeans just yet. If there is anything the ongoing democratisation of fashion has taught me, it is that there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all trend.\nSo yes, I might just step out of my home in an ultra-trending bra-inspired top and low-slung jeans look one of these days. But those high-waisted jeans will always be around for days when I prefer a more structured silhouette. This time, I fully intend to have my cake and eat it, too.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     denim ', '     trends ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      From Tiffany Blue to Hermes Orange: The stories behind fashion’s iconic colours
  </h1>, 'text': ""Over the decades, many of the world’s greatest luxury brands have each embraced a particular shade as a signature colour code. This hue is not only recurrently expressed through their products, but more importantly, all through their communication. \nJust think of Tiffany & Co’s signature hue, so identifiable that it is simply referred to as Tiffany Blue, and which is extensively used in all its packaging. \nThe American-born brand, which was acquired by LVMH for US$15.8 billion (S$21.3 billion) in January this year, isn’t alone in claiming ownership of a single colour. The blood red soles on Christian Louboutin’s high heels and Hermes’s warm citrus orange boxes are both also easily recognisable and similarly trademarked.\nWhile prints, patterns and designs are great ways to establish a fashion house’s personality, colours in fact are most effective in helping the brand be immediately identifiable. There is no question that colour is a signifier that commands our attention and enables us to form powerful associations. \nOften stemming from or inspired by a brand’s historical heritage, this distinctive shade is continuously manipulated and reinterpreted so as to remain current. Beloved fashion houses such as Burberry and Fendi have, over the decades, and through clever creative direction, been able to successfully inculcate in us the singularity of their colours. \nWe take a look at five of fashion's most ubiquitous colours.\nBURBERRY BEIGE\nThomas Burberry created his coat-making company in 1856 when he was just 21 years of age. He went on to invent gabardine, a waterproof fabric essential for English weather that revolutionised wet weather apparel. \nIn 1912, the famous Burberry trench coat was patented. Initially a military garment, it featured the famous khaki beige and all the details that were useful within that particular context, such as a storm flap buttoned at the chest and epaulettes for displaying officers’ ranks. \nThe beige colour (sometimes also referred to as tan) has since attained a classic and timeless stature, and also has become an unmistakable brand signature. Neutral, calm and relaxing, the colour beige is also versatile, and has managed to remain a mainstay in the brand’s collections until today.\nFENDI YELLOW\nThe sunny shade of yellow has been inextricably linked with the Rome-based fashion house since 1933, with the association no doubt to do with the fiery Italian sun. \nAt the time, Fendi launched the Pergamena, a natural papyrus-coloured leather, that marks the origin of the Fendi signature yellow hue. It quickly became widely used for Fendi’s leather goods, and the colour – which has typically represented honour, loyalty, and joy – has since popped up across all the brand’s design codes from “it” bags to fragrances, such as the straw-hued Furiosa. \nThe current Fall Winter 2021 ready-to-wear collection sees the iteration of Fendi Yellow in the form of contemporary-styled leather goods, such as the boldly embossed Fendi Pack Backpack. Recently, the fashion house launched Fendi Caffe by Anniversaire in Omotesando in Tokyo, which is stylishly decorated in signature Fendi Yellow and which is fast becoming one of the most iconic cafes in the city.\nHERMES ORANGE\nYou have probably heard stories of people buying keychains at Hermes just to get their hands on the iconic orange-coloured boxes. But the packaging didn’t always come in this shade. \nIn the early twentieth century, the house originally presented its goods in cream-hued paper with gold edges. However, due to a lack of resources as a result of the Second World War, it had to switch to orange for its paper and packaging. \nThe warm citrus tone, which conveys dynamism, adventure and joy, was subsequently adopted across the brand and was made official in the 1960s. Even when orange fell out of fashion in the 90s, Hermes decided to anchor itself in timelessness and kept with tradition, preserving the use of the colour for their label. \nKnown simply as Hermes Orange, it has become a symbol of luxury and ultimate refinement, and has been synonymous with the house, which is famous for its leather Birkin bags, for nearly a century. \nLOUBOUTIN RED\nShoe designer Christian Louboutin’s connection to his famous red-soled shoe began with an alteration on a heel prototype in 1992 because the factory’s version looked heavier than his sketches. \nBy applying his assistants’ red nail varnish to the sole, he transformed the heel and serendipitously found his perfect signature. The designer reportedly once quipped that he found the red colour to be noticeable and powerful. And indeed, the colour red is widely regarded to represent love, passion and desire.\nThis unmissable pop of colour on the soles of his shoes has since rendered them as pieces of art. In fact, so distinct is the aesthetic that Louboutins have become a part of our popular lexicon, thanks to celebrity endorsements. Just about everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Kanye West and Cardi B have given the luxury shoe label a shout-out in their songs. \nTIFFANY BLUE\nThe little blue box has been the stuff of dreams ever since Audrey Hepburn starred in Breakfast At Tiffany’s. \nThe famous Tiffany Blue of Pantone 1837 references the year the first boutique opened in New York City, and in fact it does not appear on any colour swathe as it remains the exclusive property of the brand since it was chosen by its founder, Charles Lewis Tiffany. \nWhile its exact origin is unclear, it was either inspired by the shade of American robin eggs or the late 19th century craze for turquoise. The colour blue typically conveys trust, loyalty, and sincerity, so it’s no surprise that the brand has chosen to align itself with these values. \nIn a sign that it is evolving with the times, Tiffany & Co recently tapped American artist Daniel Arsham to create limited-edition Blue Box sculptures. Featuring hand-finished patina, the artwork represents Arsham’s reimagining of the luxury brand’s iconic Blue Box as a relic discovered in the distant future.\n\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Hermes ', '     Tiffany & Co ', '     Burberry ', '     Fendi ', '     Louboutin ']}"

      This Singapore lingerie maker designs stylish bras for breast cancer survivors
  </h1>, 'text': 'Being diagnosed with breast cancer is life-changing and can affect a woman in many ways beyond physical health. The emotional impact can be equally overwhelming – coming to terms with the diagnosis, as well as finding the courage to battle cancer and the determination to get though treatment takes tenacity.\nLearning to embrace the physical changes in\xa0one’s body following breast surgery, be it a lumpectomy or mastectomy, is yet another emotional journey. It differs dramatically for every woman, naturally, because everyone’s personal view on body image is different and unique. One thing that’s the same, however, is the fact that it has changed permanently and that, ultimately, a healthy recovery takes priority over everything.\nThese aside, certain dressing habits are no longer the same, too. For one, it is not uncommon for these women to find that the bras that they used to wear no longer fit well, nor provide adequate support and even flexibility for their needs.\nA new lingerie wardrobe is necessary, but shopping for it has become a lot harder for them, as the options that cater to their different needs are few and far between. According to breast cancer patients CNA Lifestyle spoke to, there is a distinct lack of bra choices for them in the current market – a shortage that local lingerie brand Perk by Kate took note of, and for which it recently launched an initiative.\nFounder Kate Low set out to create a line of bras designed for those going through breast cancer recovery – a six-piece collection with thoughtful features that would fit their specific needs, without compromising aesthetics.\nThe brand worked closely with a breast reconstruction surgeon, Dr Chia Hui Ling from SW1 Plastic Surgery Clinic, to develop these bras and identify key features that women who have undergone breast surgery need. Among these are a front closure for ease of wear; soft, breathable fabrics for comfort; and thicker, adjustable straps that provide high support and a customisable fit.\nOf course, there’s no feedback better than that from the actual users of the product, which is why the brand also sought the opinions of its customers who are breast cancer survivors. \nFor Breast Cancer Awareness Month, CNA Lifestyle spoke to some of these women and learnt more about their personal recovery journeys, as well as how finding the right bra, for them, can be so physically and emotionally uplifting.\nNG WENYA, 36 \nEnduring treatment for cancer is trying, and inevitably also a journey of self-discovery. Ng personally feels she has emerged stronger following her diagnosis last year, and going through chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a lumpectomy.\n“Interestingly, I’ve become more confident of my body after my cancer diagnosis. I lost all my hair, eyebrows and lashes when I was undergoing chemotherapy, and there was a period when I didn’t dare to look at myself in the mirror. But I realised later that my worth or identity was not defined by my outward appearance and that my friends and family did not love me any less\xa0based on how I looked,” she revealed.\nShe agreed, however, that physically and visually, breasts are one of the first things that women are identified by. \n“Before my surgery, I was worried about how my breast would look after the procedure. Truth is, there are still days when I\'m bothered that it does not look and feel the same anymore, and when I wear my bra, my breasts don’t look equal. I have to remind myself that they are not the only thing that contributes to my femininity,” she said.\nIn the first few months after surgery, she found herself trying to find clothes to fit her post-surgery bra. ""I couldn’t wear certain types of clothing because they just did not go well with it,” she said. Even so, she still finds herself going back to her post-surgery bra quite often these days, since it wins on comfort and function. \n“Most post-surgery bras are more functional than pretty, and it would be nice to have one that is a combination of function and aesthetics. For women who are adjusting to their identity as a woman, following the loss of their breast(s) and hair, this is a nice touch that could make them feel pretty, sexy, or womanly again,” she said.\nNg also wishes to see more inclusivity on the part of bra makers. “Now, it feels like we are excluded, especially for women who did not undergo breast reconstruction surgery and need a bra that can accommodate a silicone prosthesis. It helps to have that feeling of normalcy – that I can step into a department store and shop for bras like I used to,” she added.\nSELENE ZHANG, 33\n“To be honest, I didn’t really think much about my breasts, and how they’ll look like ever since I got diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year. All I know was that I wanted this foreign thing out of my body and be cancer-free. I was presented with an option of a lumpectomy at first, so that I can still conserve my breast. However, after an MRI found some further suspicious mass in the same breast, I opted for a mastectomy with an implant reconstruction instead,” shared Zhang.\nUnlike many other women, Zhang’s confidence wasn’t shaken after losing one of her breasts. “Instead, I feel happy that I am one step closer to getting this cancer out of my body. Our breasts do not define our femininity – it’s more about how we, as women, portray our confidence with what we have, be it with breasts or not,” she said. \nShe did not know what bra would suit her following surgery. “All I knew was that I needed one that was wireless and with a front clasp. My plastic surgeon passed me post-mastectomy bras to wear after the surgery, but they were, however, pretty ugly,” she said frankly.\n“Eventually, when I had a better idea of what kind of bra I wanted, I started looking around shops in Singapore, but unfortunately, there weren’t really many choices. There may be wireless bras aplenty but it’s almost impossible to find any with a front clasp,” she added. \nIt wasn’t feasible for her to rely on post-surgery bras, too, as their design makes it hard for her to wear certain types of clothing. “They are cut so high up to my armpits that I couldn’t wear any sleeveless clothing, because the fabric will be peeking out. The lack of pretty post-surgical bras is pretty alarming – given the fact that breast cancer is on the rise. I think breast cancer patients just want to feel normal or pretty, and having well-designed bras made available for us is really important,” Zhang said.\nThis is why she is so supportive of Perk by Kate’s new initiative. “It’s awesome – letting breast cancer patients have more options than ugly bras just because we have cancer. Most of us just want to feel normal, and not be constantly reminded that we have cancer. I do feel that current options we have just make us feel that cancer patients are not allowed to have nice things.”\nVIVIENNE WONG, 36\nWong was diagnosed at age 32, and has had a mastectomy, followed by reconstruction surgery. “It was devastating to be told that I had to lose a breast, and that I would need chemotherapy, radiation and long-term hormonal therapy. But I pulled myself together – I knew I could be well again but I had to do what is necessary,” she shared.\nIt took time for her to get used to her post-surgery body. “Sometimes, I didn’t feel like I was in my own body. I had to get used to the weight of an implant, the numbness of the whole reconstructed breast, the stiffness in my upper arm and shoulder, changes in my posture (shoulder rolled forward slightly),” Wong explained.\nApart from that, she also found herself no longer at ease wearing certain types of clothing. “The plastic surgeon did a great job with the aesthetics – but it will always be slightly uneven. Padding in bras helps but doesn’t completely fix the problem, so, up till today, there are certain cuts of shirts and fabrics that I avoid because they reveal the unevenness in my torso. I know people won’t really notice it, but I’m kind of OCD like that,” she said.\xa0 \n“It’s hard to find a bra that evens out my shape completely. I have to get creative with where I insert padding. I get the most even shape in padded and wired bras but can’t wear them as they don’t sit evenly on my body and the wire digs into my reconstructed side,” she revealed.\nHer idea of a perfect bra now is one that provides\xa0“flexibility”: “I’ve always thought if there’s a bra that allows me a lot of different spots to slot in paddings of various shapes and sizes, I could ‘customise’ my own shape. Also, front hooks are easier than back hooks because of limited mobility after surgery.”\nFinding a comfortable bra that provides a good foundation for her dressing needs is even\xa0more important, since Wong is a wedding singer and has to present her best self when working. \n""It’s weird but finding the right bra makes me feel emotional. When I can look in the mirror and see a nice, even shape, it makes me feel understood and seen, even if that wasn’t the brand’s intention at all. I remember tearing up when I found my first well-fitting strapless bra, which is from Perk by Kate, three years after my surgery,” Wong shared.JESSIE TAN, 46\nTan was diagnosed four years ago, had a unilateral mastectomy, but chose not to have reconstruction. “Today, I continue to live flat on one side and the lack of suitable bras for people like me is an issue that I hold close to my heart. For the past four years, I have not been able to find a single bra that fits comfortably, and to a large extent, I had learnt to accept that maybe I never will,” she commented.\nShe, too, pointed out a severe lack in availability of post-mastectomy bras in Singapore. “As of today, I am aware of only three sources here. After surgery, I spent (and continue to spend) a lot of time online, searching for suitable bras to buy. Not surprisingly, there are a lot more choices in the US, but the problem with purchasing bras online is the inability to try them on. Being able to put the bras on before purchasing them is actually a critical factor for us,” she shared.\n\xa0\nComfort is of extreme importance for breast cancer patients who have undergone surgery, and it’s not something that is easy for others to fully grasp. \n“The reality is that only women who have had the same experience are able to truly understand how it feels. The physical discomfort I experience from the mastectomy is perpetual but is something we have to accept and manage on a daily basis. But this discomfort is made so much worse when I wear a bra that is not suitable,” she explained.\nThis is why Perk by Kate’s breast cancer initiative spoke to Tan. “I felt hopeful, because this is a Singapore brand that is interested to explore a possible solution to an issue that I am facing on a daily basis. I truly hope that this initiative will help to raise awareness among the bra manufacturers and that it will result in more choices being available to breast cancer patients in Singapore,” she said.\nPerk by Kate is available at https://www.perkbykate.com/.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Lingerie ', '     Underwear ', '     women ', '     Breast Cancer ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style "", '     Wellbeing ']}"

      Thai start-up on a mission to revive old clothes and slow down fashion industry
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Hau Thi Pa was heavily pregnant with her first child. Still, she insisted on joining a workshop in Bangkok with other Hmong refugees from Vietnam earlier this year.\nA few of them were mothers with young babies. Their tiny faces popped out from sling bags on their mothers’ backs, all hand-sewn and decorated in the ethnic Hmong style.\n“I want to be able to earn income by myself,” Hau Thi Pa told CNA.\xa0\nThe 20-year-old arrived in Thailand with her family at a very young age. She is skilled at sewing, which is a Hmong traditional art form passed down from mothers to daughters for generations.\nLike other participants, Hau Thi Pa was learning the art of redesigning old clothes for customers in the workshop organised by Reviv - a Bangkok-based online start-up that offers clothing repair and alteration services.\nBesides giving old clothes a new life, it also promotes a fashion culture that cares more about the environment and the vulnerable in society.\n“People are increasingly talking about problems of the fashion industry, which consumes a lot of resources - whether it would be trees, land, water or energy. It also generates waste, not to mention labour issues,” said Reviv co-founder Poom Kometsopha.\n“In fact, we’ve already had enough clothes for everyone in this world. The problem is a lot of them were simply discarded.”\nReviv was launched in early September with a main goal of educating consumers about the environmental and social impacts of the fashion industry. It offers online services to make clothing repair and alteration easier and more convenient.\nAlthough such services are not uncommon in Thailand, it is not always easy to find the providers nowadays. Many of them are scattered outside the city centre and do not have a fixed working schedule.\nMoreover, many Thai consumers have adopted a negative attitude towards old clothes, according to Poom.\xa0\n“Repairing or reusing old clothes may not be so fancy or well accepted,” he said.\xa0\n“The culture of fast fashion has taught us to associate our self-worth or value with buying new clothes all the time. So, opting for old clothes doesn’t quite boost people’s self-esteem.”\nBy connecting consumers with quality artisans online, his start-up hopes to change such perception and advocate a more sustainable kind of fashion in the country.\nIts services are available on the web and the Line messaging app. Customers can choose from the menu how they want their clothes repaired or changed - from patching to size adjustment and embroidery.\xa0\nOnce payment is made, customers can post their clothes to the company. They can also track the work progress online and get their clothes back within two to three weeks.\nFAST FASHION DAMAGES ENVIRONMENT\nDespite its main service in clothing repair, Reviv was in fact created with a green mission to fight fast fashion in Thailand, where garments are affordable and easily discarded.\xa0\nFast fashion refers to the mass production of inexpensive, trendy garments that are low-quality and disposable. The business model is common in Thailand and often employs low-paid workers.\nData from international market research and analytics firm YouGov showed four in 10 Thai adults have thrown away an item of clothing after wearing it just once.\nIn October 2017, it conducted research with 1,137 respondents in Thailand and found that one in five millennials - those aged between 25 and 40 now - keep their clothes for under a year before throwing them away.\n“The most popular reason for disposing of clothes is because they no longer fit, which 45 per cent consider grounds for throwing garments away,” YouGov reported.\nOther common reasons are because their clothes have been damaged. The research also showed millennials are more likely to dispose of their garments because they are “bored” of wearing them, compared to the older generation.\n“Across all generations, nearly one in five (17 per cent) have thrown unwanted clothes in the bin,” YouGov added.\nEach year, various practices in the fashion industry have devastating impacts on the environment. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the industry produces between 2 per cent to 8 per cent of global carbon emissions and releases half a million tonnes of synthetic microfibres into the ocean annually.\nEvery second, the UN said, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned and if nothing changes, “by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget”.\nAlthough more retailers are moving towards sustainable fashion that is friendlier to the environment, their transformation does not address the overconsumption in the fashion industry.\n“If consumers continue to consume too much and forget about their old clothes, the problems of this industry will never end, no matter how many fashion brands are environmentally friendly,” Poom said.\n“FELT LIKE I GOT A NEW PAIR OF JEANS”\nBy making clothing repair easy and more accessible, Reviv’s co-founders hope more people would reuse their clothes instead of buying new ones while saving the planet from more carbon footprints, waste and plastic.\nThey also offer various styles of needlework to help clients customise a new look for their old garments, giving them a new life that is not just stylish but also tailored to what each person needs.\nOne of its customers is Jirapa Chonweerawong. She has a pair of jeans that have been with her for more than 20 years. Well-worn and damaged, they were left in the closet for a long time until Jirapa came across the start-up and sent them in for repair.\n“When I got them back, I wasn’t so excited. But when I put them on, I felt like I had got a new pair of jeans. Nowadays, when I need to go somewhere, I’d grab them first with no hesitation,” she told CNA.\n“I like that there are patterns and we can choose them ourselves. The needlework is neat.”\nBesides a new look for her old jeans, Jirapa also enjoyed the fact that one more garment was saved from the landfill. Her purchase also went towards helping ethnic minorities such as Hau Thi Pa as well as other vulnerable groups in society.\nThrough its choices of raw materials, business partners and artisans, Reviv hopes to remind its customers of various social issues, from the statelessness of refugees to a lack of social security among non-registered garment labour.\xa0\nIt also works with suppliers who have special needs and visually impaired craftsmen who create textiles and embroidered fabrics for its customers.\xa0\n“Customers can use their work to repair or redesign their clothes. By doing so, they give voice to these voiceless people,” Poom told CNA.\n“They do it by wearing their stories, showing and telling them to others.”\nFor Hau Thi Pa, who currently heads the sewing team, the job has enabled her to utilise her sewing skills to support her family.\nEach time she works, the young mother also gets to save a piece of clothing from landfill.\xa0\n“I want my customers to be happy with the clothes they still want to keep wearing,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     fashion ', '     climate change ']}"

      Model sisters Aimee and Hannah Cheng-Bradshaw on the hard truths about modelling
  </h1>, 'text': 'Not all siblings are, admittedly, great at sharing. For sisters Aimee and Hannah Cheng-Bradshaw, however, it’s something that is innate. “We share everything. We don’t keep things hidden from each other – definitely not! We’re too vocal,” said\xa0the younger of the two, Hannah.\nBesides both being models, and clearly having inherited similarly good genes in the looks department, they also seemed to share the same sunny, chatty disposition that was evident when CNA Lifestyle had a quick chat with them on the business of modelling. \nThose who remember watching Asia’s Next Top Model, which aired several years back (Season 3 in 2015, to be exact), will find Aimee a familiar face. Since taking the second runner-up spot in the Asian offshoot of the American reality TV modelling competition, she’s gone on to model in numerous prominent magazine shoots and ad campaigns.\nSix years on, Aimee’s younger sister Hannah, who just turned 21, looks set to walk the same path. Now a veteran model, 26-year-old Aimee is showing\xa0Hannah the ropes to becoming a successful model. CNA Lifestyle took some\xa0notes.\nTHE HARD TRUTHS ABOUT MODELLING\n“It’s no secret that the world of modelling can be quite cruel, especially when it comes to ageing. There’s a short ‘time frame’ (to get work)\xa0for a lot of models, unless you can attain a level of success where age is less of a factor. So it’s important to keep our skin in the best condition possible so that we can get work for as long as we would like,” said Aimee frankly on the realities of the industry.\n“Yes, as models, our skin is the number one thing that we have to take care of, because, you know, our face is our job,” agreed Hannah.\n“We have to put on so much makeup and we don’t always have control over the quality of the makeup that’s being used. I understand that makeup artists do try to make sure that the tools and makeup they use are as hygienic as possible, but when you are backstage at a runway show, for example, there are always many makeup artists around having to powder multiple girls down really quickly,"" shared Aimee. \n""It’s very important to cleanse your skin well after that, because if you don’t have that clean base for you to be able to do all your other jobs, it’s going to impact the work that you can get.""\nSIBLING RIVALRY?\nWho, then, among the two sisters has better skin? While they both look like they have a flawless complexion on our computer screen, during our Zoom call, each insisted\xa0that it’s the other who has perfect skin.\nThe truth, they revealed, is that both of them struggled with bad bouts of acne in their teens. Thankfully, the spots cleared up and did not leave obvious\xa0scars on their skin.\n“We were both on acne medication for a number of years so we’ve been through the worst phases of bad skin. But because of that, I do stick to a simple routine, especially in times when I tend to have breakouts,” said Hannah.\nAimee described it as “a period of dark memories”: “I did not know how to deal with pimples back then. When I had breakouts around the time when I was 13 or 14, I thought that it was because my skin was dirty, so I would ‘over-wash’ it with cheap, harsh cleansers. I didn’t realise that that was making it so much worse. I feel like I struggled for way too long, and that was so unnecessary.”\n“So, when Hannah was having the same skin problems later on, I got her to use gentler cleansers that helped rebuild the skin barrier. And because of that, her skin was a little better – and you’re welcome, by the way,” she said while playfully gesturing to Hannah.\nSISTER KNOWS BEST\nIt’s definitely advantageous to have an elder sister around and Hannah agreed.\xa0“Everything I know about beauty, I learned from Aimee – she is the biggest skincare ‘creature’ that I know. Some days, when I’m like just going out to walk the dog for a while, she’ll go, ‘er, you’re wearing sunscreen right?’; or when I’m putting on my moisturiser, she’ll be like ‘oh my, why are you rubbing your face so hard? Be gentle!’”\nHannah has sensitive skin and tries to keep it trouble-free by only using familiar, tried-and-tested products and refraining from “going overboard with serums, scrubs and glycolic things”. “Sometimes with skincare, it’s tricky – it takes a little while to see how a product reacts with your skin, since everyone’s skin is different. My skin can also flare up if I try and do too much to it too fast,” she explained.\n“I tend to just use a light cleanser, and then I follow up with toner, serum and moisturiser, and now, eye serum at night – very important. I’m currently using the Multi-Active Day Cream by Clarins and I like how light yet moisturising it is, which is great, particularly for my skin type,"" revealed Hannah. ""I am a fan of the brand’s moisturisers especially, because they are all so hydrating yet gentle on the skin, and I have been using them for quite a number of years.”\nFunnily enough, this less-is-more approach is something that Aimee, who admitted\xa0to being a beauty fanatic, actually picked up from Hannah. “I went through a phase when I was so keen on a 10-step routine and needed all these different products… but my skin still wasn’t clear. At that time, Hannah was only using a very basic cleanser and moisturiser and her skin was so good. She’s like, ‘I just don’t put anything else on my face, only what it needs’. I tried it and it worked out great,” Aimee shared.\nAimee indulges her desire to try out new skincare products every now and then, but only when she doesn’t have a big shoot coming up. “I cannot risk having some sort of breakout before the shoot, because that would affect so much beyond just me – like the photographer, the shoot-venue booking, that kind of stuff,” she said. \nProfessionalism in the work of a model entails many things, not least ensuring that one is in her best physical state in order for the entire team to produce ideal results. \nThink any facial flaws can be easily covered up with skillfully applied makeup or fixed with Photoshop? While part of it may be true, there is a limit to what can be done. There’s much more that is required “behind the scenes”, including a commitment to taking extra care of one’s own skin, which sounds so simple but is not always easy to accomplish.\nSpecial thanks to Shangri-La Hotel Singapore.\n(Photography by Alvin Teo, art direction by Chern Ling and Jasper Loh, styling by Lena Kamarudin-Tambunan, styling assistant Muhammad Rafiqin Bin Razali, make-up by Lolent Lee and hair by John Lee.)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Beauty ', '     fashion ', '     models ', '     women ', '     Skincare ', '     Makeup ', '     celebrity ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      At Milan Fashion Week, stripped back fashion and an epic switcheroo
  </h1>, 'text': 'No one does fashion week quite like the Italians. Milan Fashion Week is always jam-packed with shows,\xa0and the spotlight was set once again on powerhouse brands as they returned to the physical runway. \nThis time around, there were several history-making moments from Italy’s behemoths in fashion. The clothes, however, were a little more pared back – easy, elegant and feminine. \nOver at Prada, ""Seduction, Stripped Down"" was the name co-creative directors Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons gave to their collection. Traditional dresses were deconstructed using elements such as trains and corsets. Leather jackets were styled with satin mini skirts with long trains. Back-baring dresses came in hues of pink, yellow and tangerine. \nFor the first time in fashion history, Prada’s collection was showcased simultaneously on two catwalks in two separate cities. While the Milan show took place, the collection was also unveiled in Shanghai. Both shows were live-streamed simultaneously on screens for the audience in both cities. \nFendi presented a collection that started off with\xa0muted colours, slowly giving way to more brightly-coloured prints.\xa0Inspired by the 1970s disco-era, models walked down the runway in sharp trouser suits, cape-like gowns, silky floaty dresses and kaftan tops. \nMeanwhile, in a runway show headlined by singer Dua Lipa, Versace’s collection was inspired by the house’s printed silk scarf, also known as the foulard. Dresses were slashed to reveal glimpses of the foulard underneath.\xa0The collection also featured another house signature – pencil skirts, blazers and dresses were cut up at the side, held together by safety pins.\n\xa0\nGiorgio Armani’s seaside inspired collection was punctuated with pastel hues and soft shades of green and blue. Models sauntered down the runway in flowy chiffon dresses, tulle tiered skirts, soft linen trousers and cropped white blazers. \nDolce & Gabbana, on the other hand, is milking a renewed interest in Y2K fashion. Models took to the runway in clothes and accessories loaded with crystal embellishments. There were mini skirts, sheer shirts, camo pants, beaded fringe skirts and exposed lingerie – a sign that fashion from the noughties is here to stay. \nA post shared by Dolce&Gabbana (@dolcegabbana)\nWhat happens when two designers pull off an epic switcheroo? The highlight of Milan Fashion Week came when Donatella Versace and Kim Jones showcased a joint Fendi x Versace runway, dubbed Fendace, where the creative directors switched their roles to design looks for one another. \nThe show, a first in the history of fashion, was split into Versace by Fendi and Fendi by Versace. For Versace by Fendi, Kim Jones fused Fendi’s iconic monogram pattern with Versace’s Greek key motif. For Fendi by Versace, Donatella Versace reimagined Fendi’s F monogram with crystal-encrusted details. \nIt was a swap of epic proportions, and one thing’s for sure – Fendace will be the name on everyone’s lips, at least for awhile. \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      Emily In Paris is returning for season two – and the chaotic fashion is here to stay
  </h1>, 'text': ""Watch just a couple of minutes of Emily In Paris Season 1 and you’ll know that Emily really doesn’t know how to dress for Paris. \nRemember that hideous Eiffel Tower printed blouse? Or her countless berets? It’s evident that the titular character, played by Lily Collins, has only two moods when it comes to dressing up – human tourism board, or walking French cliche. \nSo now that Emily has lived in the City of Lights for a while, you’d think that her fashion has gotten\xa0better. Surely the chic Parisian style of her friend Camille, or even her boss Sylvie, would rub off on her, right? \nWrong. \nAlthough there’s no official release date yet, Netflix has revealed sneak peeks of Emily In Paris season two, and the fashion is just as bad, just as chaotic, and just as confusing. \nTake for example this patchwork and rose-printed minidress from Dolce & Gabbana.\nMaybe the dress alone would have been tres chic, but did she have to don that kitschy black-and-white bucket hat? And that glittery Louboutin letter-adorned handbag? Something has got to go here.\nAnyone who has been to Paris would know that the French don’t actually wear berets. Well, unless they’re mime artists. \nBut Emily must be traipsing around the city with her eyes closed because –\xa0le sigh –\xa0here she is in yet another beret, this time is a bright shade of yellow. \nIn fact, her whole outfit is in a nauseating pastiche of yellow. Don’t even get us started on those gloves. Are her hands hurting from taking too many selfies?\xa0And that checkered jacket thrown over a dress printed with… people cycling? We do like that adorable Prada Cleo handbag, though.\xa0\nNow this ruffled dress in sky blue from French label Magali Pascal is a look we can get behind. Although it's a little over-the-top (especially compared to Camille’s stunning white blazer-dress), at least there are no clashing prints. \nAnd speaking of prints, oof, this outfit is really giving us Emily In This Fashion vibes. No, throwing on a sheer jacket is not helping this look. And can somebody tell Mindy that the leopard print moment is over? Props for that cute Dolce & Gabbana Devotion bucket bag though. \nLast but not least, what is with Emily’s 1960s throwback look here, with that mod print jacket, white hairband and err, poofy hair? Let’s hope this scene is from Emily attending a themed party. \nBad fashion aside, truth be told, we’re a little jealous of Emily. While it’s been almost two years since we’ve hopped on a plane, Emily gets to meander her way around the City of Lights, spend a weekend in a French chateau, order a pain au chocolat for breakfast… \nBest believe we’ll still be tuning in to season two, if only to indulge our wanderlust. \n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     Television & Movies ', '     Netflix ', '     fashion ']}"

      Commentary: A tote bag sounds like the eco-friendly option – but it isn’t always
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: How many times have you been offered a cotton tote bag, only for you to have no choice but to begrudgingly accept? There’s a high chance every household will have several of these tote bags sitting around, collecting dust.\nThe reusable tote started life as an antidote to heavy plastic use, as awareness on sustainability and how we use resources rose over the years.\nBut event organisers have been handing out tote bags en masse, and they are readily available at supermarkets and clothing chains. Even this year’s National Day Parade pack incorporated reusable and recyclable backpacks.\nIf we’re collecting tote bags by the dozens, are they really eliminating waste and encouraging reuse?\nAfter all, the production of tote bags comes at a cost to the earth as well, a cost that sometimes exceeds that of plastic bags. A NTU study in 2020 found that in Singapore’s context, reusable cotton bags, compared to reusable plastic bags (when both are reused 50 times), have over 10 times more global warming potential.\nResearchers said that we’d have to use these reusable cotton bags hundreds of times before they become the better choice over single-use alternatives.\nIn order to understand cotton totes’ massive environmental footprint, we need to look at how they are produced.\nFirst, cotton is a resource-intensive crop. A 2018 study showed that even an organic cotton tote needs to be used a whopping 20,000 times to offset the impact of its production, specifically, high water and land use because cotton is a “thirsty” crop. It takes 900 days of a human’s drinking water use to make enough fibre for a single t-shirt. \nYet organic cotton has a better environmental track record compared to regular cotton. It contributes 46 per cent less to global warming, involves 70 per cent less land and water acidification, 91 per cent less surface and groundwater use and 62 per cent less energy demand, according to Textile Exchange’s life-cycle assessment.\nSecond, cotton totes usually have prints on them. These use PVC dyes which are not easily biodegradable, rendering them effectively unrecyclable.\nWhen anything is made by mass production, tagging “sustainable” onto it is a meaningless add-on. As these bags are made in huge batches and provided at a low cost, they are quite likely churned out in a factory that pays minimal wages and little heed to the environment.\nCurrently, there’s no regulation in the fashion industry that requires companies to break down their “organic” labels. Without that accountability, you never really know if an organic cotton tote is 100 per cent organic or not. Brands may very well be greenwashing.\nHaving said that, do tote bags absolve us of our plastic bag sins?\nCertainly, using a reusable bag and avoiding plastic has its environmental merits. We should be shifting away from throwaway culture as much as possible.\nAfter all, 91 per cent of all plastic isn’t recycled. With the bulk of plastic being incinerated or left to “decompose” in landfills, they end up polluting our air, land, and water. \nAnd even when plastic is “recycled”, it often means that the toxic waste is exported to poorer countries that don’t have the proper infrastructure to manage it, but who buy it anyway to bring in more income. \nIn fact, since China’s ban on imported plastic waste, many Chinese recyclers have illegally relocated to other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. \nThis entire process of waste being exported from richer countries to poorer ones is known as waste colonialism, in the field of discard studies. So we need to ask ourselves if our sustainable solution has become another problem in itself.\nWith the feel-good “I’m not a plastic bag” messaging emblazoned across reusable bags sold at fast fashion outlets, neighbourhood supermarkets, and even IKEA, one wonders if actual sustainability isn’t the end goal of the push for tote bags, but rather the performance of sustainability.\xa0\nIt is an easy tick in the sustainability box without having to substantively change operations and product lines to actually reduce waste.\nIn 2019, H&M joined other major retailers in charging 10 cents for each shopping bag across Singapore stores, to encourage customers to bring their own reusable bags – or buy one at check-out if they don't have any.\nH&M said it reached its 2020 goal of using 100 per cent sustainably sourced cotton, defined as organic, recycled or sourced through global non-profit Better Cotton Initiative. But fast fashion giants still maintain\xa0a take-make-waste business model – one that racks up emissions and pollution.\nLet’s be clear that avoiding single-use plastics is important. Governments and businesses need to address the issue of its overproduction.\nBut it’s also important to remember too many tote bags\xa0 end up as shelf display pieces – or more likely, shoved in kitchen cupboards. It’s not always the more sustainable option to own yet another reusable bag.\nWhat do we do about the onslaught of these bags? The next time you get offered one, just say no. Instead, ask why the company needs to keep making more.\nMany of us work in companies or go to schools that do make unwanted tote bags. Tell whichever department or group that’s making them to do something else with their budget instead.\nPerhaps they could donate the money budgeted for the bags to a climate justice organisation in Singapore or Southeast Asia. Or they could gift people something sustainable and practical instead, like a voucher to a plant-based eatery, or maybe even to offset their electricity bill if they’ve switched to renewable options.\nThis tote bag problem reveals how deeply entrenched our single-use habits are: We just replaced the bag with a different material without fixing the problem.\nWhat we need to fix is our consumerist, throw-away culture. We simply need to stop buying less because we don’t need more stuff and we can share the stuff we already have.\xa0\nIf organisations are so intent on us using less bags, then maybe they should implement bag-sharing initiatives instead. \nAfter all, we have enough bags to go around – probably for the rest of our lives. Whatever the answer is: Another cotton tote bag certainly isn’t it.\nTammy Gan is a social media activist and freelance writer focused on getting people to think deeper about environmental and social justice issues, in service of more just futures.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     climate change ', '     fashion ']}"

      Black wings and a lot of colour: Who wore what at the Emmy Awards 2021
  </h1>, 'text': 'Michaela Jae “Mj” Rodriguez wore vintage Versace Atelier in teal in an homage to Old Hollywood, her hair flowing down her back, and Billy Porter worked large wings on his black trouser look at the slimmed-down Emmy Awards held on Sunday (Sep 19) (Monday morning, Singapore time)\nComing less than a week after the wild and sometimes wacky fashion of the Met Gala, glamour was back at the Emmys. There were looks of soft pink and yellow, statement minis in bright sequins – and Nicole Byer in a stunning strapless purple gown that was sure to land her a best-dressed spot.\nMany, including Kate Winslet and Cecily Strong, went for classic black, the latter with a high slit and low plunge. Black isn\'t Cedric the Entertainer\'s style. The evening\'s host walked the red carpet in color-blocked shades of blue.\nPorter worked the poses for the cameras, showing off his wings. “I am the fairy godmother. There is a theme going on,” Porter said of his recent turn in Cinderella.\nOT Fagbenle, meanwhile, wore a traditional Nigerian look in red with black accents by a Lagos brand, Sofisticat.\nByer wore custom Christian Siriano. She thanked all the women who came before her to break the couture barrier for plus-size women, and she went for it in the strapless look with sheer layers that flowed to the ground.\nAnd what did “Ted Lasso” himself wear? Jason Sudeikis, without his character\'s signature porn \'stache, showed off his Eazy-E socks tucked under a velvet suit of powder blue by Tom Ford.\n“It\'s kind of like keeping everything in perspective,"" he said.\nSudeikis\' co-star, Hannah Waddingham, was a goddess in a one-shoulder gown in soft pink.\nRodriguez paired her gown with 71 carats of Bulgari diamonds with the goal of mixing “old Hollywood with the new,” she said.\nThe pandemic put a damper on the Emmys last year, but fashion was back with a far smaller in-person crowd. Keri Russell dressed all the way up in a Zuhair Murad couture gown in rose mauve with feathers surrounding the hem of a caped back.\nAnya Taylor-Joy, always a red carpet star from another era, wore a backless pale yellow Dior couture dress in satin with a dramatic yellow opera coat, her hair in a carefully curled updo.\n“She’s like a painting,” said Andrea Lavinthal, style and beauty director for People. “Everything about her is so glamorous and elegant.”\nKathryn Hahn paired her strapless black Lanvin trouser look with an ultra-wide leather belt and statement neckless of white and green jewels. Taraji P Henson didn’t disappoint in a sleek sheer embellished black look, her hair in a top knot.\n“I have pockets,” she noted. “It always helps.”\nKnown for his loudly colored and patterned suits, RuPaul wore a black double-breasted jacket with a white swirl pattern on his pants, while Bowen Yang of Saturday Night Live rocked a pair of silver high-platform boots.\nBut the trend of the evening was colour, colour and more colour.\nYara Shahidi kept her jewels to a minimum as she twirled in a princess gown of emerald green by Dior, while Kaley Cuoco brought the colour in a neon yellow look by Vera Wang.\nAnother standout: Michaela Coel in a bright yellow bandeaux top and matching skirt as she raced inside after closing down the carpet. Issa Rae wore a custom mesh look in white from Aliette. It was a simple, sporty silhouette, with impact.\nThere were other looks of note: Cynthia Erivo in white leather Louis Vuitton mermaid gown with a feathered hem of blue and green; Angela Bassett in body-hugging Greta Constantine in black with a bright pink ruffle traveling from top to floor; and Elizabeth Olsen with the unique privilege of wearing a white look designed by The Row, the brand of her twin sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley.\n“We really loved all the bright and bold colors,” Lavinthal said. “It felt like a fun Crayola box. It certainly felt celebratory. It\'s nice that it wasn\'t this subdued and timid return to the red carpet. People seemed excited about it.”\nLavinthal also praised the men: Dan Levy in cobalt blue Valentino and Kenan Thompson in pink joining Sudeikis, Cedric and others who gave up the idea of a black tuxedo.\n“Seth Rogan was in orange,"" she said. “He looked like autumn. It just needed some leaves.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     Emmy Awards ', '     fashion ']}"

      Creative Capital: Singapore’s Macaron queen now designs colourful clothes 'with love'
  </h1>, 'text': ""Over a decade ago, the best macarons you could get in Singapore came from a local baker whose shop was called ET Artisan Sweets. “ET” stood for the founder and baker, Eileen Tay. Today, she is applying her artistry not to baked goods but to clothes. \nFor the past four years, this 39-year-old entrepreneurial\xa0Singaporean has been running Elizabeth Little, an online clothing brand that makes, in her words, “playful vintage-inspired ethical heirlooms, carefully crafted with love and compassion.” \nElizabeth Little makes fun, wistful outfits, mostly for little girls and their mums. While there are some clothes for boys and men, this outfitter is much more for the ladies (both big and little). Having been a huge fan of Tay’s previous company, and as a girl-dad myself, I could not resist browsing through the range of girl's dresses on her website.\nWHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP, WERE YOU ALREADY INTERESTED IN CREATIVE PURSUITS?\nI grew up in a family where entrepreneurship and creativity were highly encouraged. Although academic pursuit was important, my parents provided my siblings and I ample opportunities to learn other skills like martial arts, sports and the arts. \nI remember learning Chinese calligraphy and painting at Holland Village at five, and attending art and handicraft classes involving twisting wires and crystals to form elaborate ornamental displays. I have done cross-stitch, knitting, and even the obscure Paper Tole technique in primary school because my mum loved sending me for classes. She doesn’t have crafty hands, but she has many friends who craft, and I spent most holidays and weekends learning craft. I continue to love the process of creating from scratch because it is so therapeutic.\nYOU’RE A PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED PASTRY CHEF WHO HAS WORKED IN SOME AMAZING PLACES. WHAT DREW YOU TO FOOD? \nMy mum is a homemaker who visits the wet market almost daily to buy fresh seasonal produce for our daily meals. Because she lives to eat, her love for quality food inspired me to learn more about the quality of ingredients, the importance of seasonality and different cooking techniques. Growing up, I sat at the kitchen counter watching her bake trays of cakes, which she learned from her community centre lessons. I also helped with the mis-en-place during festive meals. Lunar New Year season was spent making pineapple tarts and cookies for family treats and gifts. When most girls my age were spending money on fashion magazines, I was slowing growing a collection of food magazines, cookbooks – and spending a lot of time eating.\nWHEN DID YOU START ET ARTISAN SWEETS?\nI started ET Artisan Sweets in 2008, which became renowned for delectable macarons and decorated desserts. My dream was to emulate Martha Stewart and Darcy Miller as a crafter of tastefully made goods. \nWHAT WERE SOME OF THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF RUNNING THAT BUSINESS? WHY DID YOU EVENTUALLY CLOSE IT DOWN?\nMy best memories were working with an excellent crew and making products that were known as the “best macarons in Singapore”. We expanded to making dessert tables for weddings and corporates, and had so much fun designing celebrations for clients. One of the finest moments was making 50 mini celebration cakes for NTUC’s 50th birthday, which Mr Lee Kuan Yew cut into. \nThe lows include experiencing hiring challenges pertaining to retail staff, and challenges because of my business model and rising costs. I closed when we were doing well, primarily because of unfavourable conditions for a lease renewal and the impending arrival of my second child. I closed the shop on Feb 12, 2015, two days after I saw a revised proposal to the tenancy. My daughter, Elizabeth, was born on the 16th.\nWHAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR ELIZABETH LITTLE?\nAfter closing the cake shop, I was busy juggling two little ones and settling into a role of a homemaker. However, I soon became very bored. I took up dressmaking and fell in love with fabrics, especially Liberty Fabrics, which I had started to stockpile. My original plan was to sell fabrics to people online, but there was little demand for that. During this time, I was also sewing for my children and people started enquiring about those outfits. Subsequently, I explored the possibility of outfitting children instead.\nHOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO GO FROM THAT INITIAL IDEA TO ACTUALLY OPENING?\nSix months. I was on vacation in Bali and discussed the idea of selling fabrics with my husband. Six months later, I incorporated the business and started to build the online storefront.\nHAS BUILDING A BRAND BEEN EASIER THIS TIME AROUND?\nYes, because I’ve been able to draw inspiration from both the positive experiences and mistakes from my previous business. The real challenge at first was finding a name. We had some ideas revolving around our children’s names. Then one day, my anglophone husband drew up a sketch and idea called “Elizabeth Little”. Elizabeth was our second child and she was petite, always somewhere below the national average weight.\nOf course, we learned along the way that the process of building the brand was far more than just finding a name. We didn’t hit it right on the onset – in fact, we think of the process as evolutionary and expect it to continue to change. As makers, there were times we had to stop ourselves from becoming overly product-focused so we could pay more attention to the brand story. As we started to get to know more of our customers, we began to understand who we were reaching out to and believed even more in our brand values.\nWHAT LESSONS FROM RUNNING ET ARTISAN SWEETS DID YOU APPLY TO ELIZABETH LITTLE?\nBuilding relationships with customers is arguably the most important thing you can do for your business. Similar to how we remembered our clients’ names and journeyed with them through celebration milestones from weddings to baby showers, full-month celebrations and birthdays, we continue to apply the same care and attention with our clients today.\nAND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE NEW SKILLS THAT YOU HAVE HAD TO LEARN? \nI’m not naturally digitally savvy, so I had to learn everything from post-editing in photography, to building an e-commerce platform, to creating visuals, and strategies on social media. In tandem with running the business, I took time to attend several courses at SMU on digital marketing and brand story telling.\nWHAT’S THE CORE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND ELIZABETH LITTLE?\nOur products are always ethically made, socially responsible, and use sustainable materials. We believe at the very heart of what we treasure – as makers, as parents, as humans – is time. Unfortunately, there a growing enmity between time and the personal technology that surrounds us.\nAlthough some forms of technology have made positive changes in the world, there is evidence that technology cares very little for our humanity or our time. This is why we believe that in building a better world for all with unhurried hands. \nWhen unhurried, we have the time to notice the other person in the room. We cherish conversations and make memories. We imagine and touch, and we translate that movement into something beautiful. When unhurried, we pause to care for those around us, and so make the world a better place. \nThis is why we believe in taking the time to make things well, as well as to make them last, with the hope that clients will cherish and pass them down for generations to come.\nYOU MENTIONED THAT YOU ARE INSPIRED BY LIBERTY PRINTS. CAN YOU ELABORATE MORE ON THIS?\nBefore I started the business, I found difficulty identifying with the styles and colours of existing available childrenswear brands.\nI love the amazing kaleidoscope of colours and floral prints from Liberty (a fabric brand in the UK known for its colourful designs). They bring lots of cheer to me and remind me of what a happy childhood should be: Colourful.\nLiberty has filled my imagination to create timeless dresses like the classic Peter Pan collar dresses and smocked ones I grew up with. With their prints, we create beautiful and functional pieces that are perfect for occasions as well as everyday wear.\nHOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR DESIGNS?\nI am not driven by fashion trends. My focus is on timeless designs that transcend trends and seasons.\nFor childrenswear, I am mindful of how quickly children grow. We add functionality to allow expandable options for a longer wear. We go to the extent of selecting fabrics, linen and natural fibres which are hard-wearing and long-lasting.\nFor ladies, we design classic, timeless styles, accented with handcrafted details that our clients are proud to wear.\nI hope to encourage a more responsible approach to fashion through sustainable consumption. Yes, this includes the use of the finest materials and choice of cuttings, but ultimately, what is most important is how our clients feel when they wear something from Elizabeth Little, whether that’s comfort or a confidence boost.\nDO YOU FIND ANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN CREATING A DESSERT AND DESIGNING CLOTHES? \nAbsolutely. In both cases, hands and tools are needed to bring out details and finesse. Both crafts also require technical skills and precision to attain a consistent product.\nSmocking a dress is like piping macaron shells. Once the formula is set, the art is repetitive yet therapeutic. I try to make each stich as consistent as the previous, so for the next. Similarly, donning crystals on dresses is also like donning crystals on a decorated cake.\nWhether you’re designing clothes or creating desserts, you begin with a blank canvas, and weave together different ingredients and materials to make a masterpiece. The quality of each ingredient and material also contribute to the outcome, which is why I spend a lot of time looking at quality and process sustainability, whether I’m working with clothes or food. \nARE YOU BEHIND ALL THE DESIGNS OR DO YOU HAVE OTHER DESIGNERS WORKING ON THE PRODUCTS?\nI design all the products at the moment, but you can imagine that running a business would not be possible without a team or collaboration. I’m hoping to expand it going forward.\nOur values drive the type of products we make, be it ready-to-wear, made-to-order or made-to-measure. This allows us to be more conscious in curating the quality and quantity of products we make. We abhor wastage of production offcuts and have been collaborating with like-minded organisations to create opportunities for employment\nWALK ME THROUGH A TYPICAL DAY OF YOUR LIFE.\nI try to start my day early at 6:30am. I drop off my children at school before heading for a quick breakfast. I’m usually in the office by 7:30am.\nMy list of to-do’s include planning and posting the brand’s social media content, planning and testing designs, cutting orders for supplies and production, troubleshooting quality issues, researching new designs and materials, and fulfilling and packing customer orders.\nIf I cannot complete the work in office, which is often the case, I’ll take it home with me, skipping lunch while I continue to check that my children are compliant with their schedules by driving them around to where they need to be. \nAlong with the shuffling, I might have staff meetings or discussions with external parties at least three to five times a week to check in on how things are going on the other sides of the business.\nIn the evening, I check that dinner has been prepared. Our entire family comes together for the meal, which is so important since that’s the only meal we have together.\nAfter my husband and I have put the kids to sleep, I am usually finishing up more work – smocking, stitching bows and accessories, addressing customer queries, and preparing the fulfilment of orders to clients through our courier services. I’m usually in bed by midnight or at 1am.\nEven though I sometimes work weekends, I try to strike a balance since that’s my time with the children. We do our best to keep ourselves study- and work-free for at least 24 hours. Weekly rest has become so essential.\nDO YOU HAVE A HERO OR SIGNATURE PRODUCT?\nFrom a design perspective, we are known for our range of hand-smocked heirloom dresses, each named after regal princesses: Charlotte, Victoria, Eleanor, and Alexandra. Our Narumi dress with Broderie Anglaise collars, and bespoke Carina smocked cheongsams for ladies are also highly sought-after.\nBut beyond a signature piece, many of our customers know us for our commitment to social responsibility. We pride ourselves on being an ethical and sustainable business that creates opportunities for those who need it most. Our products are crafted by persons in developing sectors of society, who are paid above-average wages.\nYOU HAVE KIDS AND THIS BUSINESS. ANY SECRETS TO ACHIEVING WORK-LIFE BALANCE YOU CAN SHARE?\nI have three kids who are eight, six, and two years old. It’s a known secret: There is no such thing as work-life balance. There will be trade-offs whichever way one chooses.\nI try to find ways to engage my children in my work, so that their lives are not dichotomised from my trade. They need to see that we care about their contributions as well. During last year’s Circuit Breaker we ran a promotion to give re-usable facemasks to charities with beneficiaries in need. My children helped to pack the face masks – we created a mini production line at home as they too had been sanctioned to home-based learning. \nANY PLANS IN STORE YOU CAN SHARE WITH US?\nPre-COVID, we joined Boutique Fairs, which was a big bi-annual affair that gave us many opportunities to mingle with our clients. The pandemic has certainly changed everything we previously experienced. But one thing that remains is our humanity.\nIn the road ahead, we hope to create new opportunities for clients to engage with our process of making their own heirlooms. We dream about a physical place for our clients to walk into, where they can disconnect from their hurried lives, and co-create memories in an unhurried way.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Desserts ', '     fashion ', '     kidswear ', '     womenswear ', '     Career ']}"

      Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha: Bags, outfits and accessories worn by actress Shin Min-a
  </h1>, 'text': ""Love is in the air in Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha, the latest K-drama currently streaming on Netflix. \nIn this series, a dentist from Seoul named Yoon Hye-jin moves to the rural seaside town of Gongjin to open her own clinic after an argument with her boss. Hye-jin is played by actress and model Shin Min-a, who is making her comeback on the small screen after a hiatus. \nIn the romcom, Hye-jin meets Hong Du-sik, played by Kim Sun-ho of Start-Up fame. Du-sik is Gongjin’s handyman, also known as Chief Hong to the residents. \xa0\nHere at CNA Luxury, we’ve not only fallen in love with the series’ leads and their undeniable chemistry, we’ve also fallen in love with Shin Min-a’s impeccable style as a city girl who loves to shop.\nHere’s a breakdown of all the outfits, bags and other accessories we spotted on the character she plays. \n\xa0ALEXANDER MCQUEEN CURVE BAG\nThroughout the series, Yoon Hye-jin is seen toting some of the most lust-worthy bags around.

      Met Gala returns in style with Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, Rihanna
  </h1>, 'text': 'Billie Eilish went full glam in a huge peach ball gown at the pandemic-delayed Met Gala on Monday night (Sep 13), while fellow host of the evening Amanda Gorman was breathtaking in blue custom Vera Wang with a diamond laurel wreath in her hair.\nRihanna, ever the Met Gala queen, showed up late in a huge black Balenciaga look and hat accompanied by A$ap Rocky in a multicolored quilted coat from ERL. She wore more than 267 carats of Bvlgari diamonds, including two choker necklaces.\nCo-host Timothee Chalamet raced onto Fifth Avenue to take selfies with fans before walking up the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for his entrance after a marching band and gymnast kicked off the long-awaited evening. Last year\'s gala was cancelled due to the pandemic.\nThis year\'s official theme of the fundraiser for the museum\'s Costume Institute was ""American Independence"", leaving plenty of room for interpretation. Just ask Lil Nas X, who did a Lady Gaga-esque strip tease on the carpet in gold Versace, from cape to armour to embellished jumpsuit.\xa0\nEilish, the belle of the ball, wore Oscar de la Renta. She told Vogue: ""It was time for this. I feel like I\'ve grown so much over the last few years.""\nChalamet had Converse sneakers on his feet but Cartier diamonds on his look. Chalamet called his outfit, including Rick Owens sweatpants, “a bit of everything”, just like America. Alfonso Navas, the fashion editor for Esquire, lauded his fashion choices as a “a smart play on the theme by interpreting American icons in sportwear.”\nGorman\'s dress, which included more than 3,000 hand-sewn crystals, was made to evoke a starry night sky. She told Vogue she felt like Lady Liberty, reimagined. Her crown, the star poet said, was a nod to publishing. Another of the hosts, Naomi Osaka, wanted to celebrate all her cultures – Japan, Haitian and the US\xa0– and picked a Louis Vuitton gown designed in collaboration with her sister, Mari Osaka. It was a swirly blue, aqua and purple print with long black ruffle sleeves and a wide red sash.\nIf this gala produced a trend, it\'s huge statement sleeves, with some stars and stripes thrown in. There was a smattering of red, as in the red, white and blue of the American flag. Karlie Kloss wore red Carolina Herrera with huge ruffles at the neck and sleeves. Jennifer Hudson also chose red sans sleeves.\xa0\nAlso in red: Ella Emhoff, the daughter of the country’s second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, and Vice President Kamala Harris. She wore a bodysuit and high-shine trousers by Stella McCartney with a sheer top and a crystal design in all the right places. She wore Adidas by McCartney embellished in red and made partially of a recycled material derived from ocean plastic.\nThe gala, drawing standouts in fashion, TV, film, sports, tech and beyond, included tiny but mighty Olympian Simone Biles in an almost 40kg embroidered gown of silver with a top adorned in a firework burst pattern and a huge train carried up the museum steps by six men. The gown was a collaboration with Athleta.\nRalph Lauren dressed Jennifer Lopez in a faux fur wrap with a dark brown crystal and beaded look in her signature plunge at the neck and high slit, a wide-brimmed Western-style hat on her head. She and Ben Affleck smooched with masks on days after their\xa0red carpet coming out in Venice.\nDan Levy took the party\'s theme to the extreme in a blue confection from Loewe. It had, according to the brand, “printed leg of mutton sleeves"" on a polo shirt with an applique of two men kissing.\nYara Shahidi wore silver custom Dior complete with a light hood. She said she was inspired by Josephine Baker. Harris Reed, in collaboration with Dolce & Gabbana, put Iman in a huge golden feathered head piece and equally adorned skirt of crinoline with a jacquard bustier.\nBlake Newby, the style and beauty editor for Essence, called Iman\'s look “both massive and angelic”.\nGala overseer Anna Wintour arrived early with a wave to the crowd accompanied by her pregnant daughter, Bee, in a floral design with ruffles at the neck.\nAlong with oh-so-many jumpsuits, there were plenty of classic red carpet looks and a wave of gold, the latter including a Peter Dundas look worn by Mary J\xa0Blige. It plunged to the belly button and beyond at the front and back. Megan Fox, fresh from her appearance at the MTV VMAs, also wore embellished Dundas, a red body hugger with criss-crossing at the front and sides.\xa0\nMJ Rodriguez, the Pose\xa0star and first transgender performer to pick up an Emmy nomination in a major acting category, wore an old glam, black-and-white corseted look from Thom Brown. The designer called it a modern-day twist on classic American sportswear. She attended the gala with purpose.\n""Not a lot of trans girls like myself get this opportunity,"" she said. ""The human condition is what I\'m here for.""\nUS\xa0Rep\xa0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez showed up in an Aurora James gown of white with a message splashed in red across the back: ""Tax the Rich"".\n“It\'s really about having a real conversation about fairness and equity in our system, and I think this conversation is particularly relevant as we debate the budget and reconciliation bill,” she said.\nThe evening had its share of what-the-heck moments, like a couple of horse heads on dresses and a green-haired Frank Ocean carrying a fake baby with a green face to match. Thom Browne gave the walking fashion statement Erykah Badu an extra-tall top hat with a bulky black look, a bunch of crystals and chunky bling around her neck.\nHer purse was a black leather dachshund.\nThe fashion girls represented, Gigi Hadid in classic white Prada fresh from a slew of runway walks at New York Fashion Week, and Kendall Jenner in glittery, revealing silver by Givenchy. Jenner\'s look was inspired by My Fair Lady.\nThe entrance of Jenner\'s older sister, Kim Kardashian West, caused a stir as fans wondered whether her estranged husband Kanye was the masked man at her side. It was none other than Demna Gvasalia, the creative director for Balenciaga who created her get-up: A black face covering worn with a T-shirt dress, catsuit and boots.\nNewby told the AP the easiest and most obvious ways to stay true to the evening\'s theme is by wearing American designers.

It coincides with the opening of ""In America: A Lexicon of Fashion"",\xa0 the first of a two-part exhibition at the Met\'s Anna Wintour Costume Center.\xa0\nOrganisers invited 400 guests, or about a third the number that usually attend.\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     fashion ']}"

      Mould, cracks and discolouration? How to make your leather bags look great again
  </h1>, 'text': ""With travel curtailed and dining-in restrictions yo-yoing for the past 20 months, little wonder that luxury leather bags are exhibiting signs of distress, having not seen the light of day for a longer time than usual.\nBag cleaning and restoration specialists like Bags Butler, Bag Artisan, Colorwash and Honest Crafters are reporting an uptick in customers bringing in their leather treasures for treatment as they finally take them out of dank cupboards and discover mould, cracks and discolouration.\n\xa0\nSandra Lee, marketing manager of Bag Artisan, an over-20-year-old specialist in handbag cleaning, repair and colour restoration services, shared that customers have been sending handbags from luxury labels such as Chanel, Gucci and Prada for servicing.\nShe said: “We have seen an increase in enquiries for bag servicing in the last six months as some ladies have started to bring out their precious bags out of storage in anticipation of going back to work or even the opportunity to travel again, or to attend some weddings or events.\xa0Some bags have become mouldy while some leather bags have dried and started cracking.”\nMould develops quickly on a bag’s surface when it is stashed away in dark, humid spaces with low ventilation for long periods of time. Singapore’s perennial warm weather as well as improper storage and poor aftercare also contribute to its damage, says Eirene Ong, executive manager of leather restoration specialist Honest Crafters.\nShe explained: “Mould is an unavoidable natural occurrence for the humid weather here. When a mould spore lands on leather, it roots into the porous surface and begins to feed off the leather, causing discolouration and mould stains. It can even damage the structural integrity of the leather.”\nLee added that persistent changes in temperature causes leather to expand and contract, resulting in it drying up and cracking. “If this persists, the leather becomes irreparable and would require intense restoration services,” she said.\nStyle Theory, which has rental and resale services for luxury apparel and accessories, launched its restoration service late last year. The team has restored over 1,000 designer bags to date, says its co-founder and chief operating officer Raena Lim.\nShe shared: “The most common request from our clients is touching up the discoloured areas of the handbags. This is most often seen on the bottom corners, handles, and flaps of bags, which are high-contact areas and prone to friction and damage. Often, the leather has been scratched, or the top layers of the leather, which hold the colour, have been rubbed off, resulting in discolouration.”\nSeveral common mistakes contribute to the damage on leather bags. Colorwash co-founder and managing director Gemma Gil says that customers tend to store items without proper cleaning just because they don’t see visible problems. “But there is sweat and dirt, which are invisible but causes mould to grow faster than usual. Always do proper cleaning and moisturise your items before storage,” she advised.\nPlastic bags, cardboard paper boxes and the usual shopping bags are not suitable for long-term storage, neither are non-woven dust bags. “Non-woven dust bags can deteriorate or crumble overtime, putting your leather bags and shoes at risk of discolouration, disfigurement and structural breakdown. Some may even develop a dusty, powdery film on their surfaces overtime,” cautioned Ong. She also advised against over-filling bags with heavy items or using DIY remedies such as lemon juice, vinegar, toothpaste and baking soda to clean the bags.\nDitch the detergent and baby wipes too, especially if it’s alcohol-based, says Lee. “Detergent can be bad for your bags as well as using abrasive sponges and other harsh materials that can damage the leather. We've also seen customers who attempted to remove stains from their fabric bags and ended up even worsening the condition by pushing the stain deeper into the fabric, making it almost impossible to remove.”\nLim recommends storing bags away from direct sunlight to prevent discolouration and unsightly “tan lines” over time. Send a new bag for water-repellent treatment before use to apply a protective layer against stains or accidental spills, and stuff the bag with acid-free tissue to retain its shape and absorb moisture. Don’t pack it tightly with other bags as colour transfer can occur. It can also cause dents on the handbag’s exterior due to straps and buckles being pressed into the leather.\nShe added: “Storing designer bags in their original box seems like a great idea but it is actually a big no-no! The boxes reduce ventilation, encouraging mould growth. If the handbag is not being used regularly, then the owner is unlikely to realise the extent of the mould growth until it’s too late.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Men, your favourite classic shoe styles are now more flexible than before
  </h1>, 'text': ""When you should be joyful wearing your beautiful shoes out for the first time, you typically end up in misery – they feel tight around the toes, they rub at the heel, and they pinch with every step. Before your evening is over, you already just want to take them off.\nWe are generally accustomed to the idea of that dreaded break-in period, when a new shoe rubs against tender feet, causing blisters and abrasions. It is only until the shoe and your foot find a way to conform to each other that they finally feel good to wear. Dress shoes in particular, with their sturdier construction and stiff leather, tend to require at least a few uncomfortable wearings before they finally feel as good as they look.\nBut Louis Vuitton has the answer to leather formals that you can wear right out of the packaging without any pain. The French brand's latest footwear innovation, appropriately named The Vendome Flex collection, is an unfussy trio of timeless styles that have been created using a new technique. \nEssentially, the entire line can be bent and folded with no consequences. And that means that there's no need to break them in like one would with regular leather shoes. This classic line includes a Derby shoe, loafer and Chelsea boot. Basics, really, that should exist in any man’s wardrobe, and they combine shoemaking expertise with all of today’s needs for comfort and elegance.\nEach of the three Vendome Flex styles is the result of the mastery of expert artisans at the Louis Vuitton shoe workshop in Fiesso d’Artico, Italy. The traditional Goodyear-welted seam, which is a unique technique invented in 1869 whereby a strip of leather runs along the perimeter of the outsole to provide stronger construction and greater wearability, has here been enhanced with a new flex technique. \nThis extensive reworking of the traditional sole, lining, and upper leather has resulted in a construction that is softer, and therefore kinder to feet. Specially-made technical materials formerly reserved for use in sneakers have also been placed within the insole to provide extra relief.\nComfort aside, these iconic shapes have been gently contemporised to exude a modern and relaxed attitude, particularly suitable for this day and age where we weave between professional and casual settings so easily and so frequently. \nThe classic Derby is masterfully made from a single piece of waxed calfskin, while the loafer and Chelsea boot feature accents of Louis Vuitton’s emblematic Monogram canvas across the former’s upper, and along the tab of the latter. \nCrafted with the finest leathers and made precisely for comfort, you can be sure you will keep your bounce in every step and not be rushing to take these kicks off.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Louis Vuitton ']}"

      Rebecca Lim on her tireless devotion to her craft and aspiring to be number 1
  </h1>, 'text': 'Like many in showbiz, actress Rebecca Lim has a dream role she would like to portray one day. But while other thespians may aspire to act as the movers and shakers of the world, Lim hopes it\'ll have something to do with the romance between her parents.\n“My mum is my superwoman,” said Lim. “Even through difficult times, she is able to stay strong and full of grace, be loving and generous, and has always been the shelter and pillar of the family.”\nHer mother is her life’s inspiration, said the bilingual 34-year-old. “She shows that you don’t have to be a public persona to be iconic. She is iconic in her own way.”\nLim herself is known for bringing many memorable – some say iconic – roles to life, garnering multiple awards along the way. She’s one of Singapore’s most recognisable faces, having won nine consecutive Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste accolades at the Star Awards since 2012. \nHer acting chops include her portrayal of entrepreneur Zhang Xueqin in 2015’s Yes We Can, which nabbed her the Best Actress Award at the Star Awards; her role as Wan Feifei in the 2016 drama The Journey: Our Homeland, which won the Asian Star Prize Award during the Seoul International Drama Awards; and acting as wannabe actress Ah Zhen in 2018’s The Lead, where she won another Star Award for Best Actress. \nBut the one role she says has been the most pivotal in her career is that of trainee lawyer Wendy Lim in the 2010 Channel 5 legal series The Pupil. It was the first role she snagged after graduating from Singapore Management University with an accountancy degree and a major in law. \n“It was my first project as a full-time actress and it got me my first acting award in the Asian Television Awards, which drew more eyeballs to me. And that opened a lot of doors for productions in Channel 8 and for other casting directors to pay attention to me,” said Lim.\nA relative rookie at that time, she humbly credits the show’s stellar cast and excellent script, which included the likes of Adrian Pang, Janice Koh and Lim Kay Tong, for making her “look good” in the series. \nOf course, she pulls her own weight on set, too. \nKnown for her hardworking ethic, Lim often takes the time to deep-dive into her characters even before it is time for the cameras to roll. \nFor example, for the drama This Land Is Mine, a 15-episode series currently airing on Mediacorp Channel 5, in which she co-stars with Pierre Png, Lim studied old interviews and watched CNA documentaries about the 1940s to better understand her character June, a law clerk. \n“There is no way you can read a script and fully understand why the character is thinking or reacting in a certain way because women at that time lived in different circumstances. So I had to really research the era to understand her,” said Lim. \nShe goes through this process for the various roles she takes up, to truly bring her characters to life, whether they are the heroes or the “bad guy”. \n“No matter what kind of character I play, I have to love her first and really understand and appreciate the character,"" said Lim. ""I always accept my characters for all their flaws and idiosyncrasies and only then, can I play the role well and do it justice.”\nUp next, Lim is gearing up for her first hosting gig, which she says requires a different set of skills from acting. \n“For acting you are someone else, but for hosting, you have to be yourself. The audience has not really seen Rebecca for who she really is, but I believe in stepping out of my comfort zone and I am excited for that.”\nIn fact, sharing this personal side to herself on the small screen is a big step for Lim, who is one of the more private personalities in local showbiz. \nWhile many celebrities may post snippets and musings of their private lives on social media, which sometimes include the struggles and difficulties they encounter, Lim’s Instagram account is more of a photo album. \n“I’m not someone who shares a lot about my personal life on social media or even in interviews because I am very precious about my family and my life,” she said.\nInstead, to express herself, Lim turns to fashion. With an effortless ability to rock a showstopping gown, she is often one of the most photographed celebrities when she shows up on the red carpet. \n“I try to be adventurous once in a while when I do photo shoots or when I attend events,” she said with a laugh.\nOn the other hand, her daily wardrobe tends to lean towards classic, she said. “I love white, black and denim as these never go out of style and I re-wear or re-match my clothing. I also do not follow fashion trends blindly as I know what suits me and what does not.”\nOn the personal front, she lets on that like every other person, she has her fair share of struggles, such as when loved ones fall ill. This can get particularly challenging if she has to act in a happy or comedic role while juggling personal issues, she revealed.\n“A lot of the time, people don\'t really understand why I become a bit reclusive sometimes but that is because there is just so much happening on set that there basically isn’t any time for myself,” she explained.\nHer way of coping, she said, is to “compartmentalise”. \n“When I am at work, I really try to focus on just being there and then when I am at home, I\'m always 100 per cent focused on my family and really being present with them,” she said. \nSimilarly, she brushes off the keyboard warriors who lurk online because there is more to life than letting them live rent-free in her head. \n“Why are you letting someone who doesn\'t care about you have so much impact on you? I always have to remind myself that hey, these people just mentioned things about me and then they move on, so I should, too,” she said. \nSometimes, she quipped, an ice cream or chocolate is the best remedy when encountering trolls.\nShe will, however, take constructive feedback seriously. “If there is some truth in what they say, then I can learn from it and improve,” she said. \nThe tireless quest to further hone her craft never ends. “I always tell myself to keep improving. How do I speak better, how do I speak clearer? I do not find excuses for myself and if I know I did not do a good job, then I will try to do better the next time,” she said.\nHer aim is to grow into the best actress that she can be. “When people think of who the top three actresses are, not in terms of popularity but in their craft, I hope that I come to mind,” she said. “So that is my goal for myself to always be in the top three, or even the top – that is the dream.”\nPhotography by Alvin Teo, styling by Lena Kamarudin, hair by Dexter Ng, makeup by Shaun Lee, photography assistant Samuel Foo, fashion assistant Muhammad Sadiq.

      Looking to make some extra money? Start by decluttering your wardrobe
  </h1>, 'text': 'This recent phase of extended staying in appears to be particularly challenging for many who are tired of this long battle with the pandemic. But for me, there was one bright spark. After procrastinating through last year’s ""circuit breaker"", I could finally take the time to declutter my overstuffed wardrobe.\nLike many not-so-secret shopaholics, I have more handbags, sneakers and clothes than I can conceivably cycle through. And while there are some DIY ways to rehome these unwanted items consciously, such as donating them to charity or reselling some of them on Carousell at a low price, it can feel “painful” to do the same for luxury items. \nLuckily, these days, there is a thriving online market of preloved resellers for those who hope to extract some value from designer bags, clothes, shoes and accessories they have grown out of. These sites, such as HuntStreet, Vestiaire Collective and The Fifth Collection, curate and list preloved and vintage luxury items that have been authenticated\xa0so buyers are assured of what they are paying for.\nAs interest in sustainability grows, these marketplaces have also seen a growth in buyers and sellers who are on the lookout for a good deal while doing their part to help save the planet.\xa0\nNatalie Lee, vice president of Asia Pacific at Vestiaire Collective said: “This pandemic and the lockdown has further accelerated this cultural shift towards being more environmentally conscious in consumption and hence purchasing from the circular economy. In 2020, we observed a 200 per cent increase in new sellers from Singapore on the platform.” \nOrders from Singapore on its app have also increased by 200 per cent since 2019, she added.\nSingapore-based The Fifth Collection has similarly doubled its number of sellers since the pandemic.\n“Decluttering came more naturally to everyone as a result of being stuck at home. Not only did we all definitely have the time to finally tackle this rather daunting task, but on top of that, we had nowhere else to go,” said Nejla Matam-Finn, co-founder of The Fifth Collection.\nSo, what are the brands and items to look out for as you brave the depths of your closet?\nNo surprises that buyers are looking for items from popular brands such as Hermes, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Cartier. Handbags are especially popular, in particular mini bags, which offer more mobility during the pandemic. \nIn particular, scan your wardrobe for iconic bags. Janice Winata, co-founder of HuntStreet, said: “Classic styles from fashion powerhouses such as the Chanel classic flap, the Hermes Birkin and Kelly, Louis Vuitton monogram bags and the Lady Dior bag are some examples of styles that are most in demand.”\nFor example, a pre-owned Chanel classic leather medium flap bag that is not more than three to four years old and in very good to excellent condition can sell for S$7,000 to S$9,000. \nIf you happen to still have earlier versions of bags like Louis Vuitton’s monogram pochette or Prada Nylon bags hidden away, this might be a good time to sell yours. According to Lee, some of the most popular heritage styles include oldies but goodies such as the Prada Nylon, Gucci Jackie, Louis Vuitton Pochette, Fendi Baguette, Dior Saddle and Celine Triomphe.\n“With many brands returning to their heritage designs for inspiration, we have observed a resurgence in their demand and value,” she said.\nFor instance, a Fendi Baguette, which was a reissue design of the famous one that appeared on the arms of Carrie Bradshaw in Sex And The City, sold on the Vestiaire Collective platform for\xa0S$4,965, she said.\nBut like how it does not make sense to purchase art or whisky purely for the “investment value”, it does not make sense to buy something in the hopes of turning a profit on the secondary market. \n“Buying a piece from popular brands does not automatically mean they will sell fast and for a high price on the secondhand market. It is much more complex than the uninitiated might think,” said Matam-Finn.\nFor example, country-specific trends could also impact how quickly you might be able to sell an item. High heels, said Matam-Finn, have not been performing as well as they used to in the local market. But the site’s overseas buyers have been snapping up an increasing amount of heels, perhaps to celebrate the lifting of restrictions in their countries, she said.\nStill, there are some pieces that tend to fetch a high resale value relative to their retail price. These are typically classic designs, vintage pieces, limited-edition or sold-out items. \nA case in point are the highly coveted Dior Air Jordan 1 high top sneakers that were launched last year. These shoes command a premium price of between S$11,000 and S$15,000 – or more – on the resale market, well above the original retail price of US$2,200 (S$2,974).\nSome of the more well-received designer collaborations with fast fashion brands, such as Giambattista Valli or Balmain with H&M, also frequently command a premium between one and a half and up to four times their original retail prices due to their scarcity and high demand, said Winata.\nBut more often than not, you probably will not get rich by selling the contents of your wardrobe. Clothing typically sells for up to a few hundred dollars, which is often a fraction of the retail price for luxury togs.\n“If you are an avid buyer of firsthand fashion, then you should declutter often in order to lose as little as possible on the resale market. But even that is not a guarantee that your ‘return on investment’ will be where you expected it to be. Just like a car, once it leaves the dealership, once an item is used, this impacts its value,” said Matam-Finn.\xa0 \nDo take care of your items even while you are using them so that they are in the best condition possible when it is time to let them go. It can also be worthwhile to spruce up your items before you get them listed on a resale website. \nSabrina Joseph-Tan, co-founder of HuntStreet, said:\xa0“It can be as simple as using a leather cream or conditioner to wipe down the bag and using a lint-free cleaning cloth to polish the hardware. It also helps to include all the accompanying accessories and paperwork such as receipts or certificates with your item.”\nUltimately, if you are a potential seller, try to think about it as if you are the buyer. Matam-Finn said, “Would you purchase a white piece that has lots of visible flaws? So, yes, a trip to the dry cleaner or cobbler can go a long way.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Bags ', '     Shoes ', '     Clothes ', '     secondhand ', '     Vintage ', '     Hermes ', '     Chanel ', '     Gucci ', '     Fendi ']}"

      From Mongolia to Labrador Park, she’s redefining luxury travel in a pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'Breaking into a canter over large swathes of the Mongolian steppes, Krystal Tan and her group of friends soaked in the vast expanse of land, savouring the sunlight on their faces and the wind in their hair. \nThey were there in 2016 for a trip of a different kind. Under the guidance of two nomadic families, they became the first group of foreigners ever to assist in a migration on horseback to herd some 400 livestock across the rugged Altai Mountain range.\n“It was a journey brimming with moments of unadulterated bliss. We learned\xa0from the nomads themselves how to shepherd and when we finally got to the summer camp, set in a lush, enchanting valley filled with yellow and white flowers, we got straight to work and helped the families construct their nomadic ger (yurt),” recalled Tan, who had set up travel and lifestyle company Blue Sky Escapes the year before as a side gig while she was a full-time lawyer.\n“The night ended with the nomads inviting us into the gers we built, for a traditional Kazakh meal which consisted of lots of meat, storytelling and Russian vodka. It was true back-to-nature bliss.”\nThis experience cemented the raw, transformative power of immersive travel for Tan, who had long felt the call to explore the road less travelled.\n“Throughout my 20s, my partner and I were always drawn to planning truly epic holidays – whether it was dog-sledding in the Arctic circle, chasing the northern lights in Greenland or journeying through New Zealand in a vintage VW kombi campervan,” said the 33-year-old. \nIndeed, she has countless escapades to share, from meeting an African man who claimed to have been nursed by mountain gorillas to visiting a Bhutanese sky burial site to ponder the sanctity of life. \n“I soon realised that those journeys were not so much escapes from life but rather, a means to discover a truer life.”\nMaking these life-changing experiences accessible to other adventurous jetsetters became her raison d’etre and by 2017, she had left her legal practice to focus full-time on Blue Sky Escapes, which has since sent clients to far-flung destinations including Bhutan, Peru and Rwanda.\n“In a world under constant threat of bigotry, small-mindedness and an over-dependence on unfeeling technology, I was inspired by my journeys to build a business that stands for a more inviting world – a world unlocked and without barriers, brimming with rich experiences which shun discrimination and encourage self-discovery,” said Tan.\nThen last year, when COVID-19 forced the world into unprecedented lockdowns, she had to pivot rapidly to save her business. By March 2020, around 70 per cent of Blue Sky Escapes’ bookings were cancelled and the remaining 30 per cent were postponed. \nEven though many other travel agencies were downsizing or hitting pause on operations, she and her business partner Chervin Chow (who is now her husband), made the decision to keep the entire team on board. To help support the company, the two of them also stopped drawing their salary for a year. \nThey focused on bulking up the company’s range of domestic offerings to offer the opportunity to experience a mind shift of a different sort. “With everyone grounded and unable to travel abroad, we decided to design experiences which allowed guests to travel inwards,” she said.\nThis included a series of expert-led virtual holistic workshops such as morning grounding rituals and meditation sessions with certified practitioners during last year’s Circuit Breaker period. \nThe company also launched a virtual dance movement, Circuit Connekt, to “have everyone shake off the lockdown blues” and donated 100 per cent of the donations collected to the Sayang Sayang Fund, which provides targeted support to vulnerable communities in Singapore impacted by the pandemic. To date, they have hosted over 30 virtual sessions and touched over 4,000 participants.\nAs the country progressively opened up, they also introduced unique activities and indulgent staycations that include exclusive VIP perks and curated wellness experiences such as mindful movement, reiki and sound healing sessions.\nFor example, one of their activities offered was a trip to Lorong Buangkok, Singapore’s last surviving kampung village. “It is a wonderful chance to step back in time and understand what ‘kampung spirit’ is truly like, or how the villagers today continue to live off the land and rely on plants for holistic remedies,” she said.\nThe company’s meticulously organised wellness retreat series An Emergence Of Self has also been particularly well received. It was partly sparked by Tan’s personal search for a mental and spiritual break, which led to her discovery that there were no such self-exploratory retreats at that time that offered up holistic experiences in an intimate setting. \nCoupled with the reception she received for virtual and private wellness sessions, she decided to launch a physical retreat. \nA post shared by Blue Sky Escapes (@bluesky.escapes)\nShe observed: “It was intriguing to observe how the pandemic had facilitated a kind of awakening, with more and more people looking to tune inwards or beginning to question their purpose and meaning in life, and similar existential questions.”\nThe retreat, which is located in a beautifully restored 100-year-old black and white mansion in the heart of Labrador Nature Reserve, features a curated wellness programme of sessions which include active and dynamic meditations, yoga and even practising silence. \nGuest chefs are brought in to prepare nourishing and delicious plant-based meals that are sourced sustainably where possible. \nIt is a rare opportunity for individuals to unplug within hyper-connected Singapore – something which people used to do only when they travelled to yoga retreats in places like Nepal or Thailand.\nFor Tan, creating these local “travel” experiences has been a way for her to bring her ethos of conscious travel to her home ground. \n“We have always been inspired by the huge opportunities for personal and spiritual growth which present themselves when one journeys to their inner and outer worlds,” she said. \n“I have experienced first-hand the shifts in my own world views, no matter how big or small, after going on an experiential journey – and it always has you emerging with a renewed sense of perspective and clarity. In this sense, the pandemic did not alter or shape our original mission.”\nShe walks the talk too, even in the way she expresses herself through fashion and clothing. With an understated and elegant sense of style, Tan prefers clothing made of natural fibres like organic cotton, hemp and linen. \n“It is breathable and better for skin, especially for activewear, more environmentally sustainable and doesn’t harm the workers handling the garments behind the scenes,” she said.\nNow, as an increasing number of countries are gradually re-opening for travel, Tan hopes that more people will embrace a different mindset when they start globetrotting once again.\n“It is not always about venturing to bucket-list or Instagram-worthy spots,” she said. “When we can embrace life as a moving meditation, we can invite appreciation for all things that come our way and recognise that there is beauty everywhere, from moment to moment. As the saying goes, the journey of exploration is just as important as the destination itself.”\nPhotography by Alvin Teo, styling by Lena Kamarudin, hair by Junz Loke using Anti Collective, makeup by Lolent Lee using Sulwhasoo Beauty, photography assistant Samuel Foo, fashion assistant Muhammad Sadiq.

      Ditch your briefcases and backpacks: Crossbody bags are the way to go
  </h1>, 'text': ""With Work From Home the default arrangement for many since early 2020, it’s inevitable that leather briefcases and tote bags have gone into deep hibernation. And we are secretly thankful that we don’t have to lug our laptops on a daily commute anymore.\nThese days, on the occasions that we do head out, we usually have only the bare essentials on hand – think wallets, keys and sunglasses, all of which can comfortably fit in smaller bags. Unlike belt bags (also known as bum bags or fanny packs – all rather unfortunate sounding), which sit on the hips, crossbody carriers are a whole lot less burdensome to wear.\nMeant to be slung over one shoulder or worn across the chest, the freedom it offers is a clear reflection of our emotional needs these days – to feel lighter and less restricted. And they look infinitely more stylish too.\nMuch smaller than messenger bags but still large enough to make a statement, they hold just enough of your stuff. Like when you don’t want your keys jangling in your pockets or your wallet bulging in your pants. And if you think about it, the crossbody bag has appeared throughout history and across every culture in one form or another as a testament to its utility. Who hasn’t bought a locally-made woven crossbody with tribal patterns while holidaying somewhere in Southeast Asia?\nBut now instead of backpackers in yoga pants, the crossbody bag is embraced by both the high-fashion elite and street-style cool kids alike. Co-opted and rejigged by almost every brand under the sun, it has been making endless rounds both on and off the runways. There is no doubt that shouldering this new man bag is the way to go.\nKEEPING IT CASUAL\nIf you are just looking to step out to buy lunch, you can forget the formalities and sling on something casual. Such as this Off The Grid mini bag in royal blue from Gucci, which is part of a line of accessories and ready-to-wear apparel made from recycled materials and trims. Hewn from ECONYL, a nylon fabric sourced from regenerated materials that can be recycled and recreated, it is not only environmentally-friendly but user-friendly too, with multiple compartments.\nSimilarly functional is this piece from Giorgio Armani, which is designed for heavy usage and long-lasting comfort. Made of highly resistant waterproof nylon and completed by leather inserts, it has an adjustable, detachable shoulder strap and two front zip pockets.\nIf you appreciate a sleek but still informal style, you can go with this acetate fabric option from Marni in colours of black, ultramarine and forest green. Modern and fresh, it not only reveals the creative singularity of the fashion house but is functional too, with a deep zipped pocket.\nFor an eye-popping style that will freeze onlookers in their tracks (if not turn them to stone), you won’t go wrong with this contemporary nylon bag from Versace that is adorned with a Medusa plaque. Small, but what a punch it packs.\nA CLASSIC EXAMPLE\nIf you possess a more formal or conservative taste, or are looking for something that is smart and discreet for a professional environment, leather-bound bags are the indisputable option. Fendi's Vertical Box shoulder bag, for instance, is made of firm calf leather, and this version in black is supremely handsome when contrasted with the silver-tone hardware with magnetic fastening.\nIf you prefer a leather with a bit more yield that looks just as professional, you can go with this supple and ultra-flat Ultrapla pouch made from Togo calfskin from Hermes. Worn close to the body thanks to the adjustable shoulder strap, it is a great companion for the man who is constantly on the move and appreciates a little flexibility.\nA versatile option that can take you from the workplace to the bar is this Gusset Flat crossbody bag from Loewe. The finesse and elegant design make this a virtuoso bag, and you can easily pair this cognac-hued calfskin creation with straight-cut trousers or jeans alike.\nEqually practical and functional is this Mini Biker crossbody from Dolce & Gabbana, which is made from cowhide. The strap and chain can be detached, so you can wear it swinging off your shoulder or clasped in your hand as a man-clutch. Now, who doesn’t appreciate a multi-tasking bag?\nPLAYING IT COOL\nCool kids have even more choice. With life swinging back into action in these post-pandemic days for vaccinated folk, it will not be long before nightspots are allowed to welcome us again (fingers crossed).\nYou can keep your essentials secure in Bottega Veneta's small leather bag when you're heading out. Expertly woven from strips of paper-light leather in the label's distinctive intrecciato technique, it's fitted with an integrated shell pouch and has an adjustable shoulder strap that you can rein in while you are boogieing.\nJust as sophisticated is this offering from Saint Laurent. Made from buttery-soft lambskin, it features patchwork stripes with a Paris-engraved push-lock closure. The silver-toned hardware imbues a modern touch, and the short strap makes it perfect to be worn slung over the shoulder.\nIf logos are your vibe, you can’t not love this stylish Monogram Print Canvas and Leather Crossbody Bag from Burberry. This ink blue version is made of canvas and topstitched leather, and the design features interior card slots and is sized to fit all iPhones. Oh, and you can also personalise it.\nFor something mini but mighty, you cannot go wrong with this luxurious light blue Nano Pouch from Dior. Made from smooth calfskin, it is bold and timeless at the same time. The ruthenium-finish brass clasp reveals an interior compartment that can act as a case for AirPods, credit cards and other essentials. These days, what more does a man need in life?\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Don't miss this IG moment: A giant luxury bag at ION Orchard
  </h1>, 'text': 'Talk about go big or go home. It’s a maxim that British luxury brand Burberry appears to have taken to heart, as evidenced by the\xa0jumbo-sized replica of its signature Olympia bag that\'s currently looming pretty outside ION Orchard. \nUntil Aug 29, visitors to Orchard Road will be greeted by the astounding sight of this 10m-tall structure, which is as much a sculptural work of art as it is a product drive. \nPart of a global campaign to celebrate the Olympia, the giant model is a travelling installation designed to grab eyeballs and make jaws drop by appearing – seemingly out of the blue – at prominent landmarks around the world. \nIt was first activated in London in late June this year, where it sailed on a float down the River Thames. \nA post shared by Burberry (@burberry)\nShortly after, from late June to Jul 10, it popped up at the Palm Jumeirah in Dubai, sitting on the sands of Palm West Beach against the dramatic backdrop of the city skyline. \xa0\nA post shared by Burberry (@burberry)\nSingapore is the giant Olympia’s third stop on its round-the-world tour and the first in Asia.\xa0The installation is made with eco-friendly materials and all of it will be recycled after the tour. \xa0\nIn conjunction with its appearance here, Burberry is introducing three new colours for the bag: Heather Melange, a soft grey; Pale Vanilla, a classic cream; and Primrose Pink, a youthful, rosy shade. \nThese colours are part of the brand\'s Autumn-Winter 2021 collection\xa0and after the\xa0exclusive pre-launch at its ION Orchard boutique, will be available at all Burberry boutiques in September.\nIf the installation’s size is any reflection of the brand’s intent, then there are clearly big aspirations for the Olympia. \nDesigned by its chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, the bag is his tribute to Olympia London – a magnificent exhibition centre in the Kensington district which dates back to 1886. It was also the venue for Burberry’s Autumn-Winter 2020 show, where the eponymous bag made its debut. \nTaking inspiration from the building’s architecture – which features a soaring arched glass roof and a huge iron-framed dome window – Tisci gave the bag a sculpted crescent moon shape and a high arcing shoulder strap. \n“When designing the Olympia, I was thinking about creating the perfect form of a handbag – something that could capture the essence of femininity,” he said. \nMade from top quality leather, each bag is crafted in Italy by artisan makers who hand-mould it on a wooden block to create its beautiful curved form and hand-paint its edges.\nThe result is a silhouette that’s both classic and modern, feminine but not fussy. And versatile enough such that you can tote it to the office, to casual luncheons or out about town. All qualities which bolster the argument that the Olympia may well be the British house’s definitive ""it""\xa0bag. \nTo further drive home that message, Burberry tapped three luminaries of fashion and pop culture to channel the character of the Olympia in the bag’s global campaign – British singer-songwriter FKA Twigs, American model Kendall Jenner and British rapper-DJ Shygirl.\xa0 \nIn its press release, Tisci explained that the three women were chosen because they embody the power and beauty of feminine energy. “These women are amazingly talented and confident, and have a natural fierceness and determination to carve their own paths, each freely expressing their originality through their creativity,” he said. \xa0\nThe Burberry Olympia comes in mini, small and medium sizes, with an assortment of colours from warm tan, black and burgundy to pale blue, warm sand and deep orange. \nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

  </h1>, 'text': ""American fashion house Coach is hosting its first concept store in Singapore in vintage style: The pop-up, which opens on Saturday (Aug 21), will be held at a\xa0conservation shophouse at the colourful Kreta Ayer area, ahead of the brand’s upcoming 80th anniversary.

      The Singaporean artist who dreams big – from giant bunnies to huge blocks of ice
  </h1>, 'text': 'When it comes to first impressions, many of Dawn Ng’s artworks certainly make an impact – because of their sheer size. \nFor instance, Walter, her 2010 series of guerrilla installations of a giant inflatable bunny across various locations in Singapore, is undoubtedly one of her most iconic creations. Others may recall admiring Perfect Day, a 2014 light installation of the Chinese idiom ""feng he re li""\xa0while enjoying a cocktail and a bite at the Loof rooftop bar at Odeon Towers.\nMore recently, for her well-received Into Air solo exhibition held in January at a former ship repairs factory, she created, melted and evaporated large 60kg coloured ice blocks and documented this process via photographs, film and painting.\nA post shared by DAWN NG (@dawn___ng)\nBeyond making a visual statement, these creations are also imbued with deeper meanings. \n“I was interested in the craft of telling stories, be it in the form of a narrative, object or visual from a young age,” said Ng.\nFor instance, the Walter series, which popped up across Singapore’s heartland, was a nostalgic yet humorous commentary on the country’s landscape, while the Loof installation was a throwback to how Chinese-Singaporeans learned to start their Mandarin essays with this idiom, which means a breezy, beautiful day. A reminder, perhaps, of a time when all narratives started with a perfect day.\nThe bittersweet emotions that these works evoke are a central tenet of the acclaimed visual artist’s practice, which focuses on the concepts of time, memory and the ephemeral. \nThe large scale of the works not only represent Ng\'s feelings, they can also be interpreted as embodying the universality of the themes she conveys through her art.\n“Certain works possess this larger-than-life scale probably because I am always desperately trying to tell a story so much bigger than myself,” said the 39-year-old, whose work has been acquired by the Singapore Art Museum and exhibited at the Musee d’art contemporain de Lyon in France.\n“I often feel things in such a tsunamic, crushing way that it only seems right the works bear a mass, which echoes that volume of emotion.”\n\xa0\nTo effectively convey the stories she wishes to tell, Ng does not limit herself to a single medium. Instead, she works across a breadth of mediums, which includes sculpture, photography, light, film, collage, painting and large-scale installations. \n“Throughout my practice, I have never stuck with a specific medium for the very reason that I believe each idea informs the manner and material in which it comes to life, not the other way round,” said Ng, who has held solos in Art Basel Hong Kong and the Art Paris Art Fair, and shown in Sydney, Shanghai, Jakarta and New York. \nHer starting point is often an observation which she finds compelling and, over time, this “interest” evolves into a deep investigation. \nFor example, her ongoing series Into Air started in 2018 when she first became fascinated with the idea of the ephemeral quality of ice, which begins to melt once it is out of the freezer. \n“What started out as a benign curiosity about holding time in an ephemeral object like ice, grew into a full-blown obsession with creating and documenting the disintegration of large sculptural blocks of frozen pigment,” said Ng, who also concluded an Into Air solo in Seoul, South Korea, this year. “Ice is a perfect material to me because it cannot last.”\nIt took her three years of laborious research and experimenting to gain mastery over the medium of ice and to learn to capture its disintegration in a poetic way via photographs, film and painting. \nTo showcase the sculptural quality of the pigmented ice, each melting block is photographed from multiple angles at regular intervals. From this database of images, Ng carefully curates just a few images that convey the fleeting beauty of the ice blocks.\nA post shared by DAWN NG (@dawn___ng)\nAnd to create the large abstract paintings that were a part of the exhibition, she gathered the melted mass into large vats and lay cotton paper over the surface to allow the coloured pigments to form topographical blooms and textured tributaries on the paper as the liquid evaporated.\nShe is currently in the middle of an intense seven-month cycle of freezing pigments in her studio and filming the blocks in a continuation of her work on the Into Air series. Having the time to work on this demanding process, she said, has been one of the positive side effects of the past year. \n“The production process for this series is technically intensive, and this year of lockdowns was the perfect time to hole up and delve deeper into different forms, techniques and pigment control,” she said. \nPandemic pending, there are plans for solos in Sydney and London next year, she added.\nIn a society that tends to value financial success, Ng observes that this aspect can be a challenge for artists, ranging from upstart capital to achieving consistency and stability later on in their careers.\nShe said: “The old, canonised definition of success or what you could and should be in Singapore was starched and stifling. Many leading entrepreneurs and creatives in my generation had a head start in finance, law and engineering, then reinvented themselves in their late 20s.”\nNg herself worked in design and advertising in her 20s and used her savings to fund rental, research and production for the first five years of her practice. She said: “Things have reached a good balance now but I pour everything I make back into the studio – that is the only way I believe that work grows in experimentation, finesse and scale.”\nReflecting on how society has evolved over the years to become more receptive of a more diverse range of callings, she said: “Singapore may still not be the most natural incubator of creative renegades, but boy, have we come so far.”\nTo empower her own four-year-old daughter to pursue her own passions, Ng focuses on inculcating a sense of independence and strong work ethic in the toddler. \n“I know it sounds strange, but I feel I empower her by making things a tad more difficult for her instead of easy. It starts from the little things. For example, she gets to choose whatever activity she likes to do, but I prefer that she does most of it on her own – even if she does not know how – and finishes it,” she said.\nA post shared by DAWN NG (@dawn___ng)\n“I care that she made the effort and she didn’t quit when she got stuck. I believe that is the engine, which will drive any interest she has beyond a mere dabbling or hobby.” \nNg leads by example, tirelessly putting in the hours at work. “I am at the studio seven days a week because I want to be. It is both a discipline and a meditation,” she said.\nHer family’s support, she said, is what makes this endeavour possible. “My husband and daughter respect my commitment and I am grateful for that kind of alignment, because it allows me to go hard and then go home.”\nToday, as a sought-after artist, she is an inspiration for those who wish to follow their hearts. Her goal is clear. “Just to be simple, living proof that doing what I do is possible and real,” she said.\nPhotography by Alvin Teo, styling by Lena Kamarudin, hair by Junie Tan and Charlene Tang, makeup by Lolent Lee using YSL Beauty, photography assistant Samuel Foo, fashion assistant Muhammad Sadiq.\xa0Art direction by Jasper Loh, produced by Penelope Chan and Shalini Selliah. \xa0\nCNA Lifestyle and Louis Vuitton celebrate extraordinary women in this series, along with the spirit of the house’s iconic Capucines bag.\nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      Pandemic comforts: The best roomy trousers for ease of movement
  </h1>, 'text': ""The sartorial freedom we enjoyed while working from home saw us all living our days in linen shorts or silk pyjamas for far longer than we would like to admit. Now, with in-office work arrangements and social lives slowly flickering back into sight, we need to be accustomed to the idea of actually having to dress up to head out again.\nBut if the thought of having to squeeze into skintight jeans or snug high-waisted A-line skirts is a frightful prospect, fret not because you are not alone; now, more than ever, we crave feeling relaxed and free.\nIt turns out that the year of the pandemic has had an effect on fashion designers too. Aware that customers are seeking comfort, brands appear to have doubled down on the capacious. Oversized tailoring was seen on the runways and in look books from Gucci to Marni. Waistlines are relaxed and lowered while blazers have gone loose and slouchy.\nPants, too, have taken a turn for the baggier. A relaxed silhouette is clearly the new order of the day, and the roomy trouser is having its moment, not that it was ever out of fashion. Wonderful for offering a sense of easy mobility and lightness, it’s encouraging however, to observe the many iterations that have surfaced.\nFrom linen to leather, and frayed hems to strict cuts, the baggy trouser trend nevertheless dictates a relaxed silhouette. Its beauty lies in its versatility – depending on the colour and cut, fabric and function, it can be dressed up or down to be work-appropriate or date-worthy.\nBest of all? You can run and you can jump in them, literally things that you will want to do once the gloom of COVID-19 fades away.\nFOR THE BOARD MEETING\nKeep the lines sharp and the colours muted when wearing baggy trousers to the Monday management meeting. This pair of pleated crepe wide-legged pants from Alexander McQueen checks the boxes if you are hoping to command attention. Once an apprentice on Savile Row, the designer’s affinity for clean lines and precise cuts still influences the label's designs today. Tailored from black crepe, emphasise the flattering high-rise and pleated front by tucking in your shirt.\nThis grey version from Victoria Beckham represents modern minimalism at its best. Tailored from pinstriped herringbone wool, these pants sit high on the waist and have wide-legged hems that puddle effortlessly over heels. Style yours just as the former Spice Girl would – with a crisp shirt in a neutral hue.\nIf you prefer a look that is less severe, this pair from Dries Van Noten in a hazelnut tone manages to be both slouchy and tailored at the same time, thanks to the double pleats that accentuate the wide legs. Pair this with a matching blazer for a formal air, or simply slip on a soft white blouse.\nFor a style that’s less strict and more forgiving, this pair of wide-legged pants from Bottega Veneta is beautifully constructed from brown wool-twill. Fluid in silhouette, it has a slim leather belt and sharp pleats that add just the right amount of structure without compromising femininity.\nIf you are after elegant drama however, you can’t go wrong with Carolina Herrera. The beautiful cut on this pair that’s made from cotton-blend sateen sits flatteringly at your natural waistline for an A-line effect. Match this with a voluminous blouse for a look that is demure yet professional.\nBRUNCH WITH THE LADIES\nIt will be good to see friends again over a meal at your favourite dining spot. You can keep the mood relaxed with this extra roomy pair of pants from Marni. Representing the epitome of the season’s relaxed vibe, this pair sits high on the waist, and the versatile army-green shade will go well with both vibrant or neutral tops.\nIf you are a fan of leather, you will love this pair of trousers from Bottega Veneta that features exaggerated proportions. The long and super-wide legs have been crafted from buttery supple leather, so it actually feels as comfortable as it looks. But should you prefer a more classic fabric, this crisp linen number from Fendi promises understated elegance and timelessness.\nFor a softer harem-style silhouette, this pair from Alexandre Vauthier with its high-rise waist and tapered cuffs fits the bill. Pair it with a silky blouse or take it up a notch with a sharply cut blazer. You also cannot go wrong with this pleated pair of pants made of stretch-wool from Altuzarra, which is designed with a flattering high-rise waist and sharp pleats that enhance the dramatically wide legs.\nDATE NIGHT\nDressing up for an evening out with the beau has even more significance now, given that we haven’t been able to do so for so long. So pull out all the stops with this pastel pink pair of cropped trousers from Dolce & Gabbana. Decorated with a gold-tone jacquard pattern, these trousers will make it an evening to remember. So too will this high-octane canary yellow pair from Gucci, which is delicately cut from wool blended with silk and jacquard, and woven with a discreet metallic silver GG motif. Punch it up with a black see-through blouse for added glamour.\nFor something more muted but no less stylish, you can opt for this pair of chevron printed silk trousers from Giorgio Armani, which features a high waist and two side slash pockets. Its blue-grey colourway is at once fresh yet versatile, making it easily compatible.\nUltra sleek and feminine is how one would describe this fluid version from Roland Mouret that is deftly cut from navy crepe. The sharply pressed legs and midnight blue hue lend it unquestionable elegance. Classic, however, is how you could describe this gorgeous ivory tone wool-blend pair of wide-legged pants from Oscar de la Renta. While it is designed to be worn with a coordinating jacket, it can just as easily be styled with a blouse or bodysuit given its flattering high waist that enhances the figure and flowy legs that add inches to your height.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      What has Emily In Paris star Lily Collins been up to lately?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Remember last year’s hit rom-com Emily In Paris? After dropping on Netflix in October 2020, the series drew a legion of fans who fell in love with its almost-ridiculous storyline, charming characters, and beautiful Parisian backdrops. And who can forget the (sometimes questionable) fashion? \nActress Lily Collins plays the titular role of Emily Cooper, a marketing executive from Chicago who lands her dream job in Paris. The role earned Collins a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a TV series.\nWell, season two of the hit TV series is now on its way. Filming wrapped in late July, though Netflix has yet to confirm an air date. \nBut aside from meandering down the streets of Paris as Emily Cooper, what else has Collins been up to? \nFor one thing, the 32-year-old actress is now an ambassador of Cartier. The French jewellery brand has tapped Collins as the face of its Clash [Un]limited collection and the Double C de Cartier\xa0handbag. \nClash de Cartier was launched in 2019 as the jeweller’s edgy, youthful collection that challenged the norms of fine jewellery design. Necklaces, bracelets and rings feature unconventional elements such as studs, beads and clous carres. \nClash [Un]limited is a limited-edition capsule collection that highlights the Clash de Cartier stud. The collection is a radical approach to precious jewellery in white and in black, occasionally punctuated with hints of purple. It features “mitten” watches, pocket gems, two-finger rings, stacked rings, ear jewellery, clips to be worn inside or along the ear, and reversible bracelets and necklaces. \nMeanwhile, the Double C de Cartier handbag was released this year. The structured, all-leather shoulder bag features clean and simple lines. Its most distinctive feature is its metal clasp in the form of the brand’s wax seal-inspired double “C” logo. \nAside from Emily In Paris, Collins is also known for her role as a devout Baptist in the 2016 Warren Beatty film Rules Don’t Apply. She has also starred in Netflix original films Okja and To The Bone, as well as Amazon original The Last Tycoon.\nCollins is a long-time friend of Cartier. She wore a stunning Cartier Magnitude High Jewellery necklace\xa0to the 2019 Met Gala. \xa0\nIn a press release, the jeweller described the actress as an “individualist with a strong sense of elegance”. “Her curious and multifacted nature echoes Cartier’s ambition to collaborate with individuals dedicated to deep commitments,” Cartier said. \nCollins joins the fold of fellow Cartier ambassadors Troye Sivan, Willow Smith, Maisie Williams, Jackson Wang and more.\xa0\nCommenting on her appointment, Collins said, “For me, being part of the Cartier family means joining a community of unique nonconformists who show great strength of character. Cartier is Paris, it’s this certain idea of elegance and French refinement which the Clash [Un]limited jewellery and the Double C bag embody with classic extravagance.” \nDoes this mean we’ll see Cartier jewellery and leather goods in the upcoming season of Emily In Paris? We’ll keep our eyes peeled for that!\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     celebrity ', '     Timepieces & Jewellery ', '     fashion ']}"

      This 65-year-old fashion model is leading Singapore’s grey revolution
  </h1>, 'text': 'As an introvert, Ong Bee Yan never imagined she would ever become a model. But in 2019, when a young Singaporean designer scouted her to be part of a brand campaign, Ong decided to bite the bullet.\n“I am camera shy but I thought to myself, if a stranger has so much faith in me, why should I doubt myself,” said Ong, 65. \nWith her eye-catching silver hair and aura of unflappable cool, the photo shoot with Graye Studio caught the attention of others in the fashion industry. \nSoon, modelling offers began to stream in and since then, she has participated in shoots for brands including UOB and IT Cosmetics. \nShe has also been featured in publications including Her World, Today Online, Mothership and even the cover of Harper’s Bazaar Singapore.\n“I decided to face my fears, get out of my comfort zone and challenge myself. I told myself to embrace my age instead of letting it restrict or define me.”\nIndeed, this can-do attitude has taken the ever-versatile Ong on many adventures at a stage in life when many others prefer to take it easy after retirement.\nIn late 2016, the former graphic designer decided to launch a cold brew coffee business, 1degreeC, with her husband Richard Koh when the latter was retrenched following a company restructuring exercise. \nBesides overseeing the nuts and bolts of the business, such as working in the kitchen and dealing with day-to-day operations, she also relished the opportunity to interact with the younger generation.\n“Cold brew coffee is a millennial drink so the question was, how do we reach these people?” she said. The answer – social media.\nAt that time, as she did not know much about Instagram, she worked with her son’s friend to boost the brand’s social media presence. \nAlong the way, she learnt a thing or two about creating content, from taking good photographs to writing catchy captions. \nWhen the time came for her to take over the brand’s Instagram account, she realised she already had the basics down pat. “What is most rewarding is that I get to meet young people, collaborate with them and learn from them,” she said.\nA post shared by 1degreeC Cold Brew Coffee (@1degreec_coldbrew)\nThese days, Ong also has her own Instagram account @grey_evolution, where she shares snippets of her life such as family meals and outings with her grandchildren, as well as behind-the-scenes snaps of what goes on at photo shoots. It is one way she advocates for an engaged and active retirement lifestyle.\nA post shared by grey_evolution (@grey_evolution)\n“I hope to encourage seniors to get out of their comfort zones, challenge themselves and prove that old dogs can learn new tricks,” she said.\nShe is in part motivated by her own experience of caring for her mother, who had dementia. “It was a privilege but it was also painful. I could see that her memory was fading and she eventually could not remember me. I do not want my spouse or children to go through that,” she said, noting that since she launched 1degreeC, she has noticed that her memory has improved.\nBesides staying mentally active by taking on an array of different activities and challenges, Ong is equally conscious about staying physically fit. She makes it a point to do strength and weight training twice a week (see her do a four-minute plank on Instagram\xa0that would put many younger women to shame).\nA post shared by grey_evolution (@grey_evolution)\n“I keep fit and active because I do not want to confine myself. I am 65 and still alive, I still have lots to contribute and lots to do,” she said.\nOng and her husband are also big on upcycling as a way to care for the environment. They pick up what others might consider “junk”, such as picture frames or furniture and restore them to give them a second life. \nAdditionally, she is currently working on making foot scrubs from 1degreeC’s used coffee grounds and is hoping to involve special needs young adults or their parents in this process.\nAs an animal lover and proud owner of four stray cats, she gives back to the community by buying kibble for animal feeders who care for stray animals, to help ease their financial burden. She also supports animal charities such as Hope Dog Rescue, Cat Welfare Society or Animals Asia, donating half her modelling fees to these causes.\nContributing to her pets cause inspires her to keep going with her modelling gigs. While she still gets butterflies in her stomach before every assignment, one of the techniques this self-professed introvert uses to make it work is to rely on her “alter ego” on set. \n“I ‘zone out’ and I am a completely different person because if it had been me, I would probably have been as stiff as a robot,” she said with a laugh. “But I always say a prayer before I start and I tell myself to do my best because I have already accepted the assignment and I cannot let these people down.”\nIt certainly helps that she has an equally adventurous attitude towards fashion. “I have always loved to dress up but I am not a shopaholic so modelling is the perfect way for me to be experimental. I just tell myself to project confidence in what I wear,” she said.\nIn the future, Ong says she hopes to share some of her knowledge by conducting workshops on skincare, makeup and styling for seniors. \n“If you look good outside, you will feel good inside,” she said. “I would also like to conduct skills workshops like soap making. These are relevant in the market as young people are buying such products, so it could help people make a living out of it.”\nAs always, this go-getter is firmly focused on her goal. She said: “I hope my journey and life experience will encourage others who might be fearful to just go for it and to do what they want to do. Age is just a number, do not let it define you.”\nPhotography by Alvin Teo, styling by Lena Kamarudin, hair by Junie Tan and Charlene Tang, makeup by Lolent Lee using YSL Beauty, photography assistant Samuel Foo, fashion assistant Muhammad Sadiq.\xa0\xa0\nCNA Lifestyle and Louis Vuitton celebrate extraordinary women in this series, along with the spirit of the house’s iconic Capucines bag. \nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      Short-sleeved shirts that are great for Singapore’s weather, and stylish to boot
  </h1>, 'text': ""In spite of its breezy design, which makes it perfect for Singapore’s humid weather, the short sleeve shirt hasn’t received the love it deserves. Perhaps it reminds some men too much of their former school uniforms and they wish to distance themselves from that memory. Or perhaps it is the (ill-placed) perception that only geeks don them.\nEither way, those folks will hardly recognise the stylish and exquisitely printed versions that have been popping up. Looking anything but utilitarian and being far from nerdy, they are a great alternative to dressy but stifling formal shirts. Because after a Work From Home situation for the last 18 months where we have gotten used to wearing clothing that’s actually comfortable, do we really want to slide on a formal shirt that’s too snug at the collar and too unyielding at the shoulders?\nIn these post-COVID-19 days, pursuing a sense of ease is of paramount importance, even if that simply means wearing clothes that make us feel better. Lightweight and loose-fitting short sleeve shirts are the perfect solution as they allow not only freedom of movement, but also expression of individuality. From eye-catching botanical prints to subdued classic monograms, you can easily pick a shirt that best reflects your personality.\nAs we get ready to head back out for a meal at our favourite restaurants or a spin around town, here are some options to prep your wardrobe with. With the dissolution of traditional dress codes compounded by the pandemic, the time is ripe for expression and experimentation.\nNATURE BECKONS\nYou can almost never go wrong with botanical prints. From florals to paisley, plant-inspired patterns are no stranger to fashion – but they have taken on more a graphic and abstract character of late.\nThis cotton-jersey printed shirt from Dries Van Noten’s SS21 collection, for instance, is full of upbeat and tropical motifs. Decorated with flowering cacti, it has an aloha-style cut which promises a comfortable fit. The bold design is balanced with cool tones, so you can command attention without screaming for it.\nIf you are all about foliage, you’ll like Gucci’s vibrant and debonair leaf-print number. Pair it with faded jeans and white sneakers for some street cred or dress it up a notch by tucking it into slim trousers.\nAn uber-casual option for when you actually want to hit the beach, the printed cotton-terry shirt from Orlebar Brown hits the right note. Emblazoned with a tonal palm print, its absorbent fabric makes it perfect for wearing post-swim.\nAnd If classic Hawaiian truly is your vibe when it comes to short-sleeved shirts, go all out with Polo Ralph Lauren's lightweight cotton-poplin offering. The vibrant printed hibiscus has long been associated with this shirt style, and here it is made relevant without being a caricature.\nANIMAL INSTINCT\nAnimal print will never fall out of fashion, and it is possible to wear it without coming across as garish. The key is moderation: Whenever dressing with a statement piece such as this, keep the rest of the outfit muted. Focus on subtle colours and understated detailing to balance your look.\nThis smart shirt from Amiri features a Cuban collar and is printed with a repeating Playboy-style bunny motif. It's cut for a loose fit from lightweight silk-twill, so you’ll feel free and unencumbered. Match this with denim shorts for a casual brunch or smarten up the look with trousers for a sunset cocktail.\nFor the young-at-heart, Saint Laurent offers a cheery outlook with this shirt printed with colourful brush strokes that resemble an abstract take on perched parrots. Woven for a lightweight handle and a fluid drape, it's cut for a relaxed fit and has a 70s-style collar. Style this loose over skinny trousers or tucked into a high-waisted pair of trousers.\nIf you are in the mood for humour, you will appreciate this cotton shirt from Nudie Jeans. Even an arachnophobe will be won over by the graphic skull-faced eight-leggers. Cut from lightweight organic cotton in a relaxed camp-collar profile, it’s the perfect conversation starter for a casual weekend.\nHowever, if you are a beast and prefer to go full-on animal mode, this shirt from Celine Homme is essential. Covered in a pack of contrasting animal prints (because one isn't always enough if you’re a maximalist) it manages to be bold yet palatable.\nLIFE IN MONO\nOne of fashion’s most enduring styles is the monogram print. In an industry where change is the only constant, monograms have become essential for maintaining a brand’s cachet. While they can sometimes be too outlandish, when executed with a restrained hand, they can be highly wearable – even cool.\nTake this oversized Cuban-collar crinkled shell shirt from Gucci. Its baggy and relaxed style makes for easy wearing, and the print of a checkerboard of belts, each fastened with the house's signature GG buckle, is subtle yet distinctive.\nLikewise, the motif print on this shirt from Valentino is at once discreet but recognisable. With a style that is reminiscent of the seventies, it's cut from naturally cooling silk in a relaxed profile. Wear it easily with tailored shorts for a summery look, or with skinny faded jeans for an edgier silhouette.\nIf you are in search of summery vibes, this classic Hawaiian-style shirt from Louis Vuitton is all about embracing the pastel theme. A colourful take on the monogram motif, it is cut from soft cotton poplin and features white metallic buttons. Pair it with white trousers if you are heading to the beach bar, or keep it casual with a pair of denim shorts.\nAnd finally, Burberry’s bold cotton-poplin shirt bears all the hallmarks of its signature check motif, but interpreted in a fresh way with its perfect symmetry. Cut for a boxy fit, it is the perfect way to demonstrate your alliance while injecting a dollop of cool.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      3 Singapore women launch pre-loved kids' clothing platform
  </h1>, 'text': 'Hands up if you’ve tried to sell something – whether it’s a brand new jar of moisturiser, a piece of furniture, a maternity dress or baby shoes your kid never wore – on local resale platforms such as Carousell. \nAnd then you ended up annoyed, frustrated and doing way more work than you intended to, or have time for.\nYes, us too. Faced with countless lowball offers or hagglers asking\xa0“nego?”, or frustrated about having to find time to go to the post office to mail out a cheap item, or figure out when and where to meet up to finish the deal, we’ve thought so many times: “Man, this isn’t worth it.”\xa0\nThen there are the things you buy that arrive too late, or don’t arrive at all (don’t get us started on the kid’s outfit for Racial Harmony Day we bought off Carousell that has, um, yet to turn up.) There’s no recourse for things that go missing, since many resale platforms are buy and sell at your own risk.\nWell, here’s a new local website PreLouLou to the rescue. Started by three Singaporean women who want to make it a breeze for parents to buy and sell pre-loved kids’ items, and propelled by their own less-than-ideal experiences on resale platforms, the fledgling online consignment store kicked off in July with over 400 products, from brands like Armani Baby and Ralph Lauren. The number of items available has since grown to about 500.\xa0\nThe idea is to tap into like-minded parents who buy or receive as gifts high-quality products for their little ones, and inevitably end up with clothing that have only been worn a few times before they’re outgrown, and who are eco-conscious and mindful of wastage. These are the same enlightened folks who wouldn’t think twice about buying a second-hand pair of shorts or shoes, as long as they’re in good condition, because why not?\nPreLouLou will do the work of photographing and pricing the items, writing product descriptions and listing them, and dealing with buyers. They’ll even pick up the pre-loved clothing from sellers for free, if there are five or more items. Those with fewer items can mail them to PreLouLou’s address. \nAccepted items will be listed within 10 days, and if they’re sold, the seller will receive 60 per cent of the selling price within 28 working days of the item being shipped (and not returned).\nIf you’re asking why you only get 60 per cent, consider that the good people at PreLouLou will do all the dirty work for you – all you have to do is let go of your items (which have to be clean and in good condition) and wait for the cash to come back to you. \nThis works if you have no time to sell your stuff and if you were intending to trash them or give them away anyway. If your items don’t sell after a certain period, usually a year, you have the option of having them returned to you, or donated to PreLouLou’s charity partners.\nAnd if you’re going in as a buyer, it’s a good chance to check out pre-loved designer items at prices 30 to 60 per cent lower than in stores. We spied Ralph Lauren shirts from S$38, Paul Smith shorts from S$33, Mini Melissa shoes from S$24, as well as items from well-loved local brands like Sea Apple and Maison Q. The website has children’s clothing, shoes, accessories, swimwear, and sleepwear for 0-12 year olds.\xa0\nThat items have to be designer or a respected brand makes sense – these items are likely to be of a better quality and still be in good condition, and be of a certain value that would make them worth reselling. That said, PreLouLou’s founders tell us they are looking into accepting and carrying more brands. \nCurrently, besides designer brands, they have boutique brands which are harder to find in Singapore, such as Happyology, Kakapo and DotDotSmile, selected high street brands like Zara and Gap, and great local brands, with price points starting from S$10.\xa0\nThe question, though, is whether local parents are willing to pay for second-hand clothes for their precious little ones. \nPriscilla Wuersch-Ng, one of the co-founders of PreLouLou, who has a day job at a global developmental finance institution, told\xa0us:\xa0“There’s definitely scepticism and apprehension in regard to purchasing secondhand, especially for children\'s clothing, as it’s natural for parents to want the newest and best for their kids, but we believe that’s slowly changing here in Singapore.""\nShe added: ""We want to be part of that movement dispelling these misconceptions with our thorough screening and careful classification of our selected pieces. Over time, we hope more parents feel assured and consider PreLouLou first when they are looking for new clothes or one-off occasion outfits for their kids. In fact, more than 10 per cent of our pieces are actually new with tags.”\nAnother thing the founders care deeply about is sustainability. It’s a well-known fact that fashion is bogged down by waste and pollution. It’s the second largest polluting industry in the world – and in Singapore, baby and children’s clothing add up to over 200,000 tonnes of textile waste a year. \nThis is not lost on many young parents, who are increasingly conscious of their part in the mind-boggling and unsustainable practice of buying throwaway kids’ clothes and products.\nSaid\xa0Wuersch-Ng:\xa0“Fast fashion is one of the biggest polluters to our environment, and we are seeing consumers demanding much more transparency from producers around this. While this trend started with the luxury resale market, it has moved towards online thrift stores and children’s fashion recently. As our generation and the next generation of parents start to have children, this mindset shift will spill over to the way they choose to dress their children as well.""\nAnd the founders of PreLouLou are hoping the winds of change and the current burgeoning resale market will help their brand and their cause. \n“The secondhand fashion market is expected to be double the size of fast fashion by 2030. While COVID-19 has put a dampener on overall consumption spends, e-commerce spending has definitely grown because of the shift in consumption patterns to online and away from physical stores,"" said co-founder Lala Wang, a banker who is passionate about reducing fashion waste. \n""We believe this resale boom is driven by a change in consumer mindsets towards more sustainable practices, but also, people are finding out that buying and selling second hand is a great way to save money or make some money from idle pieces sitting in their closets.”\nAnd the response has been encouraging. PreLouLou’s founders said they have received positive feedback from both sellers and buyers, who find their process easy and hassle-free. The brand is hoping to expand their repertoire to include larger items such as nursery furniture, books and toys, and is also looking to list past-season items from local brands to reduce wastage from overstocking inventory.\n""I think the greater challenge isn’t setting up the business, but getting our parent community in Singapore to embrace buying pre-loved and trusting our platform to deliver both quality and affordability for their children,"" said Wang.\n""PreLouLou hopes to be an advocate for a larger movement in Singapore and Southeast Asia towards a more sustainable way to live and consume. We consider ourselves pioneers in changing the way Singaporeans view pre-loved, and hope to work together with like-minded companies to create a better future for the children of our nation.”\xa0\nAvailable at https://preloulou.com.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     style & fashion ', '     children ', '     secondhand ', '     sustainable ', '     online ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      5 things to know about this iconic luxury handbag you should invest in
  </h1>, 'text': 'You already know of Louis Vuitton’s trunk-inspired Petite Malle handbag with its signature monogram motif. Now, pen in the Capucines handbag to your lexicon of LV must-haves.\nLaunched in 2013, this feminine style has already secured its place among the French brand’s pantheon of iconic designs – and for good reason. With plush, supple leather providing a tactile contrast to the bold architectural trapezoid silhouette of the Capucines, this bag is as much a delight to hold as it is to behold.\nJust like how Louis Vuitton builds trunks to accompany the most discerning travellers on their adventures, the versatile Capucines, which comes in a variety of sizes, colours and materials, is designed to be the modern woman’s companion as she goes about her day, no matter her personal style. \nNo wonder even though the bag is but eight years old, the modern icon has already been spotted on the arms of many of the most influential women around the world, from supermodel Gigi Hadid to Princess Charlene of Monaco.\nHere are five things to know about the LV Capucines.\n1. LV’S HERITAGE IS WOVEN INTO THE BAG\xa0 \xa0\nNamed for the first Louis Vuitton store in rue Neuve-des-Capucines in Paris, the bag pays homage to the stylish power women of this neighbourhood, just a stone’s throw from the swanky Place Vendome, one of the world’s most exclusive addresses. \nFor those in the know, the details of the bag also reveal little tales of the brand’s storied heritage. \nFor instance, its engraved rivets are a nod to the Maison’s famous trunks.\nAt the same time, the outline of the quatrefoil clover petal in the cut-out flap mirrors its iconic monogram flower. The flower itself is inspired by the four-leaf clover which was a lucky charm beloved by the founder’s mother. Consider it a not-so-secret talisman for the modern woman.\n2. IT TAKES 250 INDIVIDUAL STEPS TO MAKE A BAG \xa0\nThe clean, elegant design belies the complexity of its creation – it takes 250 individual handcrafted steps to build each bag, in a showcase of Louis Vuitton’s legendary savoir faire.\nStarting with the leather, only the highest grade taurillon calf leather of a thickness between 2mm and 2.4mm is used for a plush touch. \nA leather specialist examines, weighs and even caresses the leather to ensure the grain of the hide is even, the fibres intact and the texture is smooth and velvety.\nThe LV logo is another detail worth admiring. Sheathed in calf leather, the initials are inserted into claws that are set into the grain of the leather, a complex and delicate process that few Maisons are able to execute to perfection.\n3. IT REQUIRES PRECISION SEWING TO PUT TOGETHER\nTake a closer look at the bag – some of the stitches are so tiny, they might very well be invisible, especially around the interior snap hook and closure tab, which snakes between edges and rivets\nAnd to create the distinctive structure of the Capucines, a highly experienced artisan uses the saddle stitch technique in a freehand style which requires precision down to 1mm, a process which requires absolute mastery of this skill.\nEven the edging of the leather, which is meant to protect, define and highlight its colour, is carefully executed. Done by hand, the edging requires four layers to be hand-painted one at a time, with each air-dried and then heated to 46 degrees Celsius to create the perfect finish.\n4. THERE’S A CAPUCINES BAG FOR EVERY AESTHETIC\xa0 \nWhen it comes to versatility, the Capucines is probably one of the most chameleon-like luxury bags currently available in the market. \nThe top handle bag comes in three sizes, MM (31.5cm x 20cm x 11cm), BB (27cm x 18cm x 9cm) and Mini (21cm x 14cm x 8cm), and some versions include a removable shoulder strap to allow the wearer to change up the ways of carrying it and transition easily from casual to formal settings.\nBut that is not all. Every season, there are new iterations of the bag in a wide variety of colourways which range from the most popular hues of the moment to vibrant tri-coloured styles with pops of colour accents.\nThere are also styles that creatively incorporate mixed materials such as tweed, sequins, fabric, plexiglass and even one with a chic python top handle. \nIn other words, there is bound to be a design to suit every style preference, whether you would like to lend a touch of glamour to a street-style outfit a la actress Sophie Turner, dress up a casual outfit like actress Emma Stone, make a statement with your arm candy the way Jessica Chastain does it or everything else in between, really.\n5. THE BAGS ARE A “CANVAS” FOR CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS \xa0\nArtyCapucines, a creative project launched in 2019 by the Maison, follows in the spirit of its acclaimed artistic collaborations with famous artists including Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami and Yayoi Kusama. \nThrough this initiative, a selection of the world’s top contemporary artists is given carte blanche to re-imagine the iconic Capucines according to their vision.\nThere have since been two ArtyCapucines collections featuring luminaries including French artist Jean-Michel Othoniel and Beijing-based Liu Wei. \nAs this is an ongoing collaboration, keep your eyes peeled as these limited-edition pieces are in high demand by fashionistas and art collectors alike.\nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      Midriffs are back – just in time to show off your hard-earned abs and obliques
  </h1>, 'text': ""The global pandemic has affected us all in many different ways. Since the beginning of 2020, while some have turned to cooking and gardening to pass the extra time and calm frustrations, just as many have turned to fitness as a means to deal with the stresses of being cooped up at home.\nExercising to unwind certainly has unquestionable benefits – you’re pumped with endorphins and the toxins in your body are released, helping you naturally feel good overall. And feeling good physically is definitely a good way to cope with the demands and instabilities of our situation. But also, a nice perk out of all that effort is a trimmer body and leaner physique, and fashion houses haven’t failed to notice this.\nIndeed, it appears that designers are keen to support women showing off their hard work. From Gucci to Louis Vuitton, cropped tops have – well, cropped up in myriad styles from casual truncated sweatshirts and knits to dressy blouses shortened just so, in order to showcase hard-earned abdominals and obliques.\nAnd because the cropped silhouette is so versatile, there literally are uncountable ways for you to pull off this look without compromising your personal style. So whether you want to feel comfortable because you are spending your days cocooning at home, or you want to up your glam factor for an intimate dinner for two, it is easy to find ways to incorporate this style into your day-to-day wardrobe.\nIt is time to let the midriff have its moment.\nCOMFY\nThis cotton jersey top from Louis Vuitton is a colourful and whimsical clash between traditional techniques and contemporary style. Casual but dressy at the same time, it stands out with layered inserts and pleated panels of viscose satin. A draped back detail adds dramatic volume to the modern boxy silhouette.\nIf you are looking for something to kick back at home with since social interactions are limited, Gucci’s Hawaii cropped cotton sweatshirt serves up a huge dose of the eighties with its glittered logo and eye-catching neon hues. This retro style will always be a winner, even without the big hair and bold eyeshadow. And the leg warmers.\nHowever, if subtlety is the name of your game, you can instead stay cool with this cropped T-shirt with oversized sleeves from Isabel Marant. Crafted from a breathable cotton blend, it is perfect for your work-from-home arrangement, or for pairing with your daily yoga routine on your balcony.\nCASUAL\nDate nights for two are still permissible with the current regulations, so wow your beau with this delicate linen top from Erdem. Perfect for our humid tropical weather, it's decorated with pretty teal-green roses inspired by prints from the 1930s and has puffy Juliet sleeves that inject a dollop of romance.\nSuch is their legacy that Missoni's knits are instantly recognisable. For something slinky yet demure, this striped top that has been made on the Italian label's looms in a cropped silhouette can be sensuously worn on or off the shoulders. Let the colours pop by teaming yours with neutrals, or a simple white pair of form-fitting jeans.\nInspired by vintage styles and the house of Alaia’s own impressive archives, this top is made from cotton-jacquard for a discreet texture and features wraparound ties that secure with a silver D-ring fastening. You can team it with the matching skirt or a pair of baggy trousers cinched comfortably at the waist.\nDRESSY\nHeading out to the clubs on the weekend is still out of the question, but dressing up for a Friday night in with your best friend is still a fun (and in some ways, extremely comforting) thing to do. This gorgeous cropped open-back satin blouse in a joyful shade of sunflower yellow from Acne Studios is an instant mood-lifter. The raw-edge finish and artful gathering at the back is daring yet delicate. Its versatility means you can easily dress this up or down with a pair of high waisted jeans or a sleek A-line skirt.\nThis tobacco brown organzine top borne out of a collaboration between Italian fashion house Fendi and New York-based visual artist Sarah Coleman is a subtle throwback to the glamour of the seventies. Part of a capsule collection, this design incorporates a new warped logo pattern conceived by Coleman, which sees a sinewy, fluid incarnation of the classic FF pattern.\nPull out all the stops with this high-octane full jacquard number from Balmain. Featuring the new PB monogram pattern inspired by Pierre Balmain's signature, this cropped top boasts commanding, structured shoulders that will help you conquer the attention of any room, if not the world.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style & fashion ', ""     Women's Style "", '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Made just for you: Where to get customised fashion and beauty items in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': ""The ultimate luxury in fashion is not about splashing out on pricey designer togs, but\xa0more about the ability to acquire special items that are made just for you.\nThere’s a good reason why haute couture costs so much – sure, it’s made to fit one perfectly, but at the same time, it’s also about the exclusivity.\nFor those of us who do not possess bank accounts fat enough to pay five-figure sums for a gown, there are attainable options that offer customisability at prices that are a lot more pocket-friendly.\nWe aren’t just talking about clothing, too. Personalisation can be done for quite a number of things – shoes and skincare, for example.\nBest of all, they are all available right here in our Little Red Dot, brought to you by the enterprising and talented people of Singapore. These purveyors of customisable fashion and beauty may have just what you are looking for, whether it’s a made-to-measure fit or a creation that’s truly one-of-a-kind. Here’s a look at some of them.\n\n\n3EIGHTH\nMade-to-measure is nothing new in men’s suiting and bridal wear, but is a lot less common in the womenswear category – especially when it comes to clothing that's not evening wear and cocktail dresses.\nThis makes local label 3Eighth, which is “built upon a dream to put every girl in a suit”, even more unusual in Singapore’s fashion scene.\nBorn out of the founder’s love for shopping in the men’s department and the frustration of being unable to find a size that fits her there, the label is made for like-minded women who similarly like to venture beyond typical women’s clothing styles or would like to add a few suits and shirts to their wardrobe.\nBesides its custom suit service, 3Eighth also offers a made-to-order range of staple shirt styles for women, in which the customer can select their preferred fabric as well as modify the sleeve and shirt length according to their frame or body proportions.\nAvailable at https://www.3eighth.co/.\n\n\nSTATE PROPERTY\nMany local private jewellers\xa0provide a bespoke service, particularly for bridal jewellery. But for those who are looking to have a one-of-a-kind piece made for themselves, which has that edgy, fashion-forward quality rarely seen in fine jewellery, State Property is the go-to brand.\nIt’s known for bringing a refreshingly modern aesthetic to fine jewels, creating contemporary statements for those who are looking for pieces that are distinctly different from the typical designs you’d see at most jewellers.\nIt’s also the first Singapore jewellery brand to be stocked on Net-a-Porter, and counts famous folks including Michelle Obama and Lady Gaga among its fans, which says a lot about its growing global appeal.\nAvailable at https://thisisstateproperty.com/.\n\n\nPALOLA\nThis homegrown women’s shoe brand is the result of the teaming up between a bespoke shoemaker and a leather artisan, who share the vision of “mending the broken bond between wearer and shoemaker”.\nCustomised shoes used to be a luxury few people can afford, while a bespoke footwear service for women is such a rarity both locally and internationally. With Palola, they are now within reach, though you can expect to pay a reasonable premium for the customisation service.\nShoes (loafers, ballet flats or pumps) are fitted during a consultation, while up to 100 different leather and fabric options are available for selection.\nEvery pair of Palola’s shoes – whether made-to-measure or off-the-rack – are hand-lasted, which means the shoe-uppers are stretched by hand over the last, which is the mould that gives the shoe its shape and size. What’s probably a more important benefit that custom shoes provide is a more comfortable fit that accommodates size and width variations between the left and right foot.\nAvailable at https://palola.co/.\n\n\nSCENT BY SIX\nArtisanal perfumes may come a little pricier that the mass-market variety, but, despite that, they are gaining popularity as more and more people are seeking individuality in everything they wear – and that includes their scent.\nAmong the handful of names that have started offering customisable scents in Singapore is Scent By Six, which is founded by a local who used to work for Givaudan – a well-known international fragrance company – and decided to strike out on his own and start a fragrance brand.\nScent By Six currently has six signature scents that you can buy off-the-shelf, but also offers a workshop in which participants can learn more about perfumery and try their hand at concocting their own unique scent.\nThe brand also takes on commercial commissions and has worked on interesting projects such as creating a scent inspired by Chinese herbs for TCM retailer Eu Yan Sang.\nAvailable at https://scentbysix.com/\n\n\nSKIN INC\nThe name of this local skincare brand needs no introduction by now. Having very successfully made its entry into numerous countries around the world, Skin Inc is not just known for being proudly born in Singapore, but first and foremost for its customisable facial serums.\nThese serums contain micro capsules filled with active ingredients – the choices range from vitamin C to ceramides, hyaluronic acid, collagen and more. What was game-changing, when they were first introduced, was that they can be mixed together according to the user’s skincare needs.\nIn other words, one can conveniently address all or most of her skin concerns with just the customised serum, as opposed to having to layer on multiple products.\nDespite facing a perpetually growing number of competitors in the market, Skin Inc has retained a strong presence and is the first Singapore brand to be stocked in global beauty emporium Sephora.\xa0\nIt’s clear that the brand is continuing its development of more customisable skincare products with the recent introduction of a new customisable sleeping mask into its product line-up.\nAvailable at https://www.iloveskininc.com.sg/.\n\n\nTHE GENERAL CO\nYou may have already read about the art of marquage and how the skill became so sought-after that artists, like Singaporean Cherin Sim, have their work schedule solidly booked for consecutive years.\nThe word marquage is a French word meaning “to mark” and in the context of the art, means personalising an item by painting on it. Most of Sim’s clients commission her work to be placed on their designer bags and leather goods, although she’s also drawn on other items.\nNot sure why people would pay to have their expensive possessions “defaced”? One look at the artwork Sim produces, and you’ll understand why.\nThe waitlist for her services currently extends into 2023, which gives you an idea of how the form of customisation remains highly appealing. Sim is also listed as a personalisation artist at The General Co, a collective of craftsmen and artists that are offering luxury craft services, and she also conducts marquage workshops.\nAvailable at https://thegeneralco.sg/.\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Beauty ', '     Skincare ']}"

      No bling, no fuss: The best everyday watches for women to wear in 2021
  </h1>, 'text': 'You may not have a soiree at which to flaunt those diamond-studded skeletonised flying tourbillons for a while, but that doesn’t mean your wrist needs to go unadorned. We’ve rounded up the most wearable women’s watches of 2021 so that you can continue your days in style while discreetly showing off your horological savvy from your next Zoom call to your weekly grocery runs.\nThose models have, until recently, been fairly large and complicated, so this downsized and simplified time and date-only Royal Oak in black ceramic is perfect for those who love the cult design but could do without the predictability.\nImpressively, the 34mm ceramic case and bracelet boast identical finishes – the contrasting brushed and polished surfaces loved by so many – to the metal versions. Another feature that sets this model apart is the use of 18K pink gold bezel screws, instead of the usual white gold, to match the markers, logo and hands.\nBAUME & MERCIER RIVIERA 36MM\nThe bezel is a dead giveaway as to which trend Baume & Mercier has resurrected its Riviera collection for, but who cares about a little contrivance as long as the end result looks good?\nThe new Riviera maintains all of the charm of the 1970s from whence it came thanks to a familiar but well-loved design, and throws in exposed screws and a textured dial to keep things fresh and fashionable for the 21st century.\nThere are four versions of the women’s 36mm models, but the silver-faced Ref. 10615 is the only one that uses the automatic Selita SW200 movement with 38 hours of power reserve and a 4Hz frequency. The rest are powered by quartz calibres.\nBREITLING SUPEROCEAN HERITAGE ’57 PASTEL PARADISE CAPSULE COLLECTION \nLuxury watchmakers realising that precious metals and diamonds aren’t the only paths to women’s wrists has opened up a world of new and stylish options.\nAfter having dabbled with coloured stones in its previous capsule collection, the Chronomat Automatic 36 South Sea, Breitling is now just playing with colours with six models making up the Superocean Heritage ’57 Pastel Paradise range.\nIf it weren’t for their rotating bezels and 100m water resistance, it would be hard to guess these 38mm wrist candies were dive watches, but these largely tone-on-tone designs will be perfect for a breezy beach day.\nCARTIER PASHA DE CARTIER 30MM\nCartier has offered up plenty of shapes to choose from this year, from its iconic Tank and Santos to the nearly forgotten Cloche, but if all you want is a classic round case, Cartier’s pretty good at those, too.\nFollowing a relaunch last year that gave the overhauled Pasha de Cartier convenient interchangeable straps, sapphire case backs, a new crown and personalised engraving options, it is back this year with an even daintier quartz version coming in at 30mm, with options in steel, pink gold or both.\nThere are gold models with diamonds, but we feel the absence of ice enhances the strength and purity of the Pasha’s design language.\nCHANEL J12 ELECTRO\nThis year’s crop of rainbow-hued watches were a lively display of hope, cheer and carat-driven indulgence, but not everyone can or wants to pull off something quite so flashy.\nFor them, we recommend the Chanel J12 Electro, the quietest of the brand’s electro-funk inspired collection. The standard J12 design in smooth, shiny black ceramic gets just a wink of colour with graduated neon rainbow hour and bezel markers.\nThere’s even an electronic playlist to go with it, launched in collaboration with Ed Banger Records and available on Apple Music and Spotify. The quartz-powered 33mm watch is a limited edition of 1,255 pieces and available only at Chanel boutiques.\nLOUIS VUITTON TAMBOUR STREET DIVER\nTrust a fashion house to transform one of the most rugged category watches into an expression of spirited summer refreshment.\nThanks to strategic use of colour, shapes and font, Louis Vuitton’s Tambour Street Diver in Pacific White is as chic as it is sporty. The straps are, of course, interchangeable, too.\nIts 39.5mm stainless steel case makes this an uncommonly small example of a dive watch, which is ideal for smaller wrists, but will still be fit for diving duty as it includes an inner rotating bezel, generously lumed indices and water resistance of 100m.\nThis reference is powered by a time-only quartz movement with a small seconds sub-dial.\nOMEGA SEAMASTER AQUA TERRA 38MM\nClassic, casual and always ready for a day aboard a yacht, Omega’s Seamaster Aqua Terra welcomes a subtle update this year with a new seconds sub-dial and date at 6 o’clock.\nThere are 10 variations of the 38mm models to choose from, which vary between steel and 18K Sedna (rose) gold cases with dials in light green, dark green, linen, or mother-of-pearl.\nWe are partial to the full steel version with the mother-of-pearl hour markers on a satin-brushed dark green dial for its easy elegance and on-trend colouring. Ticking away inside it is the Co-Axial Master Chronometer calibre 8802, which means it is not only highly precise but also resistant to magnetic fields reaching 15,000 gauss.\nPANERAI LUMINOR PICCOLO DUE MADREPERLA \nLaunched in 2017, Panerai’s Luminor Due line was conceived to be the brand’s answer to the slim and elegant dress watch – something it has spent its long history actively avoiding.\nBut love it or loathe it, Panerai has doubled down with its first unquestionably feminine offering, the Luminor Piccolo Due Madreperla. The traditionally chunky Luminor case is now at a demure 38mm in Goldtech (Panerai’s red gold alloy) and matched with a red alligator strap, though this can be easily swapped out for another strap.\nThe dial is mother-of-pearl, and the applied gold indices and hands are filled with green Super-Luminova. The in-house automatic Calibre P.900 keeps it ticking, and will continue to do so for three days without winding.\nRADO CAPTAIN COOK MARINA HOERMANSEDER \nWatch and designer collaborations mean we get the full suite of technical goodies inside an unquestionably solid design, so they’re always worth looking out for.\nIn this case, Rado has teamed up with French-Austrian designer Marina Hoermanseder, whose bright, buckle-loving apparel and accessories are adored by celebrities like Lady Gaga, Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez and more.\nThe 37mm stainless steel watch gets a sprinkle of rose gold colouring and, because this is Rado, the bezel features a polished white ceramic insert. Hoermanseder’s trademark buckle and leather strap can be found on the three accompanying straps in pink, black, and a double tour version in pink – all of which can be effortlessly interchanged.\nRICHARD MILLE RM 07-01 COLOURED CERAMICS \nIn 2019, Richard Mille came in far out of left field with its Bonbon collection, a sugary antithesis to the brand’s typically ultra-tough, athlete-approved performance watches.\nThat lighthearted streak is back this year with a trio of pastel watches inspired by Miami’s Art Deco architecture and fun-loving attitude.\nThe cases are made of TZP ceramic, while the dials are assembled using inserts of ceramic, geometrically pattered rubber and, for the first time in the brand’s history, guillochage. They are powered by the in-house self-winding CRMA2 movement, and each reference is limited to just 50 pieces.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      How 4 Singapore fashion brands grew stronger during the pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': ""A year-and-a-half ago, COVID-19 shook the world and irrevocably changed life\xa0as we knew it. For four of Singapore’s most established and well-loved fashion brands, survival was paramount, with jobs and livelihoods on the line. And with people staying home and not going out or into their offices, things did not look good for fashion retail.\nBut these labels didn’t just survive – they thrived. With much difficulty and struggle, undoubtedly, but all of them launched amazing new collections, came up with fresh offerings and look to be coming out of this bigger, better and stronger.\nHow did they do it? CNA Lifestyle checked in on them.\nLOVE, BONITO\nThere’s a lot at stake for Singapore’s top fast fashion label, with five sprawling stores in major retail malls here; shops in Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia; a huge e-commerce presence; and growing influence in regional and international markets such as Philippines, China, Australia and the US.\nBut where many fashion brands saw empty stores and declining sales, Love, Bonito managed to increase their market share last year, in the thick of the pandemic.\nCo-founder Rachel Lim said it could be attributed to their traction in several international markets, namely the US, Philippines and Hong Kong.\n“We started our journey in Singapore in 2010 and have evolved into a global brand, with international businesses representing 40 per cent of our online revenue,” she said.\n“This has definitely been a challenging period for us. But as our stronghold has always been in e-commerce, we are grateful to be able to consistently achieve strong month-on-month growth trends, despite many of our key markets experiencing lockdown.”\nWhile workwear used to be our strong suit, we knew that work-from-home was here to stay, and pivoted to designing relevant home and comfort wear, which birthed our Loungewear line.\nAn agile approach and willingness to change the gameplan early on in the pandemic put Love, Bonito in good stead.\n“We rejigged our omnichannel efforts to place more emphasis on online vs in-store outreach, and were able to navigate the supply chain process to make key decisions to tweak our categories for the second half of 2020,” said Lim.\n“While workwear used to be our strong suit, we knew that work-from-home was here to stay, and pivoted to designing relevant home and comfort wear, which birthed our Loungewear line.”\xa0\nA strong sense of community, loyalty and pure brand love probably helped as well. If you only had to buy a few outfits in the past year, chances are you’d purchase from a brand whose ethos resonated with you. Which is why Lim works so hard on Love, Bonito’s brand purpose.\n“I knew we did not just exist to sell womenswear, but that through the brand, women would be empowered to have the confidence to become the best version of ourselves,” she told CNA Lifestyle.\n“We understood our community who are now at home juggling multiple roles and continuously engage them through our LBCommunity+ loyalty programme and social media channels, to share relevant resources and knowledge platforms, helping them engage with family members or to simply destress.”\nPandemic or not, Love, Bonito is forging forward. Lim revealed they’re on an exciting trajectory and plan to invest more in new markets, which includes the US and Japan, along with new verticals within the business to further solidify their mission to empower the modern Asian women.\nAlso, shopping-starved fashionistas want revenge. Lim said: “As soon as restrictions were lifted, customers were heading back to the stores and we saw a spike in sales, a phenomenon industry folks would term as ‘revenge shopping’.”\nAvailable at\xa0https://www.lovebonito.com/sg/.\n\n\nTHE MISSING PIECE\xa0\nFrom a brand that made modern cheongsams for style-conscious women during Chinese New Year to having their collections fly off the shelves at any time of the year, The Missing Piece has grown into one of Singapore’s\xa0beloved boutique fashion labels, sought after for their flattering frocks with the signature waist cut-outs.\nIf it weren't for the pandemic, we wouldn't have had the Home range and the swimwear and shoe line.\nPre-pandemic, their CNY collections would completely sell out. Like everyone else, the brand experienced a slowdown during the COVID-19 crisis, but owner Fock Ee-ling (who has a PhD in medical research) told us the brand has still managed steady growth the last few years.\xa0\nAnd although plans to grow into Indonesia and hold a pop-up there were shelved, there has been no need to cut staff or close down stores.\n“Early on in the pandemic, we decided to adjust our business plan and explore new areas for growth within Singapore and our current customer base instead of trying to grow in the region,” said Dr Fock.\n“We started producing masks and exploring new product extensions and product lines which we wouldn't have explored otherwise. We started a TMP Home line, collaborated with Pink Salt to come up with a unique swimwear line, and developed our own shoe and accessory line.”Like all other fashion labels, which remained profitable throughout the crisis, the brand had to be agile enough to quickly pivot. And this meant tweaking designs and focusing more on everyday wear.\nEven though their Chinese New Year collection earlier this year was in peril, as no one knew if we would be allowed to visit our family and friends, Dr Fock pushed on.\xa0\n“We still went ahead and developed our biggest CNY collection to date, but focused more on casual pieces in more formal fabrics that were unique, comfortable and wearable even outside of CNY,” she said. “This proved to be the right decision for us.”\n“This pandemic period was not wasted time,” said Dr Fock. “If it weren't for the pandemic, we wouldn't have had the Home range and the swimwear and shoe line. We are also looking forward to opening our new store at Cluny Court in August, and are building another CNY collection which we can be proud of. I would love to explore some international collaborations down the road.”\nAvailable at\xa0https://iwantthemissingpiece.com/.\n\n\nYACHT 21\nAn urban resort wear label for work and play, with four retail stores and two stockists in Singapore, Yacht 21 started with physical stores in 2009 before going online in 2013 as demand for their easy-breezy holiday dresses and comfy workwear grew.\nBut with everyone’s travel plans cancelled for a year and a half now, founder Jarenis Ho explained that her brand had to move away from promoting travel-friendly collections meant for vacations and pivot to designing functional fuss-free pieces to help their customers adapt to changing lifestyles.\nHer brand had to move away from promoting travel-friendly collections meant for vacations and pivot to designing functional fuss-free pieces to help their customers adapt to changing lifestyles.\n“Our retail stores did better before COVID-19, but our online sales picked up during the pandemic. It was difficult when all our retail locations had to stay closed for months during the ‘circuit breaker’, but I’m glad we managed to pull through as a team and everyone’s jobs were saved. We put more effort into selling online and in the process, discovered different ways to promote our brand via content creation.”\nLike many fashion brands, Ho acknowledged that the pandemic has changed style preferences and shopping habits, perhaps forever.\n“People are more open to shopping online, and working from home has changed the way people dress for work. Restrictions on social activities have made us all cultivate new habits and lifestyles and all this is bringing about new mindsets that may be irreversible.”\nAvailable at\xa0https://www.yacht21.co/.\n\n\nONG SHUNMUGAM\nHow can a designer label specialising in statement occasion wear survive a season where there are precious few occasions to dress up for?\nWhere there’s a will, there’s a way. And perhaps it was instinct or luck, but Priscilla Shunmugam, designer of high-end cheongsams and frocks that cost upwards of S$500, put out her homewear line called Suvarnabumi in December 2019, just before COVID-19 became a trending keyword.\nSales of her Asian-inspired tableware were good, as lockdowns meant fewer OOTDs and more at-home culinary shots. Since then, she has launched another Suvarnabumi collection of modern rattan furniture, and a colourful series of plates and cushions called Tropicana. A more affordable and casual diffusion clothing line called OM also pushed sales, along with fun collabs.\xa0\nShe has launched another Suvarnabumi collection of modern rattan furniture, and a colourful series of plates and cushions called Tropicana.\nThe brand also had its usual Chinese New Year collections of elevated cheongsams in 2020 and this year, Shunmugam worked on the 2021 cheongsam collection in London, where she has been based for the last few years, with the pieces made in Singapore.\n\n\n“At the backend, we are definitely challenged in many ways, and continue to foresee more glitches to come. Our supply chains are all impacted, logistics is a nightmare and we just can’t be as efficient as we once were,” she shared.\n“But quite surprisingly, we are posting record revenue figures. The past four collections we’ve launched have all surpassed expectations. We are struggling at the back but everything is smooth sailing at the front.”\nBeing disciplined with their books and maintaining a positive cash flow for many years also helped the brand stay healthy and retain staff. Despite all that, Shunmugam said: “COVID-19 threw the worst possible blow at us when we were forced to close our London store before we could even open it officially. Two years of planning and spreadsheets gone – just like that. We lost not just money, but a meaningful dream.”\nThe London store remains\xa0closed until the situation stabilises, and Priscilla will now be based in Singapore for the next two years, where she will run things from her by-appointment-only Atelier Ong Shunmugam at Chip Bee Gardens. Her customer base is still 90 per cent local, and 10 per cent international.\n“Because my work and my life are so intricately woven, I can’t quite separate the lessons from the pandemic, but I know I’ve had to learn to let go – of things I cannot control, cannot change or cannot foresee,” she said.\n“I have had the time and headspace to get back into ‘discovery mode’ again, and look around my immediate surroundings with fresh eyes. Nothing will ever be the same again – that’s probably the best lesson COVID-19 has taught me.”\nAvailable at\xa0https://ongshunmugam.com/.\n\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     business ', '     Pandemic ']}"

      Gold, silver, bronze: Which watch case material is best for you?
  </h1>, 'text': 'As watch brands fight for our attention and wallets with an increasing array of available colours, materials, and complications, the options can be overwhelming. But once you’ve settled on a design, your next priority should be the case material, given how often you look at and handle it.\nWhether you care about weight, durability, scratch-resistance or just good ol’ shininess – there are high- and low-tech choices for every consideration. Here are the most popular ones.\n\n\nBRONZE \nDecades of research and development have given us so many high-tech options to choose from that the charm of a low-tech material is becoming increasingly sought after.\nWhen Panerai released the Submersible Bronzo PAM383 in 2011, it was a smash hit. The idea of a watch designed to age with its wearer, like well-worn leather or denim, was romantic and enticing, and it marked the beginning of a horological bronze age.\nTraditionally an alloy of copper and tin, bronze had many applications in maritime equipment because of its anti-corrosive nature, and thus has been a popular choice for today’s (usually limited-edition) dive watches. Like rose gold, brands have played around with the alloy ratios to create a shade that’s just warm or cool enough to their liking.\nWatch owners themselves are known to do their own experiments, too. Online communities and forums are full of bronze enthusiasts sharing tips on how to speed up the ageing process, or to achieve different colours and patterns based on different chemicals and substances.\nThe best part is, any unwanted outcomes can simply be polished off and the case made to look like new again. But for those who want the gold-like glow without the constant maintenance, Omega’s Seamaster 300 Bronze Gold is an alloy that promises to stay shiny for a long time, and won’t stain the skin.\nCARBON\nLighter and stronger than titanium and commonly found in aircrafts, race cars and sporting equipment like racquets, golf clubs and bicycles, carbon fibre is automatically associated with toughness. It even looks the part thanks to a naturally dark colour (therefore negating the need for PVD or DLC coating) and woven pattern.\nWhat we see in watch cases are actually carbon fibres that have been bound with a plastic polymer resin to create a composite material that is light and durable. By varying the types of carbon used, the way the fibre sheets are layered, and the polymer resins used to bind them, one can create a variety of composites with different properties.\nForged carbon composite, for example, is made from small pieces of carbon fibre composites that are pressed into shape as the resin cures. This gives the material a flaky appearance, and the first to capitalise on this was Audemars Piguet when it released a special edition Royal Oak Offshore for the Alinghi sailing team in 2007.\nAs the aeronautical and automotive industries continued to discover new ways to play with carbon, the watchmaking industry continued to adapt them to fashionable use. Girard-Perregaux’s Laureato Absolute Rock uses coloured fibres and carbon-like glass to create a marbled look. Richard Mille often relies on Carbon TPT for its strength and damascene appearance. Bulgari even made a minute repeater out of Carbon Thin Ply, giving the record-breaking watch a rough and raw aesthetic. Because these composites are cut from a larger block, no two cases will have the same pattern.\nPerhaps the only downside of carbon composites is that their incredible sturdiness makes them difficult to recycle, as they can’t be easily melted down for reuse.\n\n\nCERAMIC \nOffered with high shine or smooth matte finishing, the kind of technical ceramic found in watches today can hardly be compared to the stuff that makes pottery. Thanks to Rado’s pioneering efforts in the use of ceramic in the 1960s with the release of the Rado DiaStar, it became the first non-metallic case option for watchmakers to play with. But it wasn’t until Chanel adopted the material for its more massively appealing J12 collection that other luxury brands started taking notice.\nCeramic’s incredible scratch-resistance is great for keeping watches looking brand new, and its imperviousness to UV rays means its colour will never dull. Still, brightly coloured ceramic only started appearing in the past decade, once brands like Hublot figured out how to keep ceramic pigments from fading during the sintering process that gives it its signature hardness.\nCeramic is also lightweight and hypoallergenic, so they make burly sports watches like Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak Offshore, IWC’s Pilot’s Watch Top Gun and Panerai’s Luminor somewhat easier to bear on the wrist. It is, however, not shatter-proof so there’s no guarantee it will survive a really hard knock.\nWhile ceramic itself is not a particularly expensive material, manufacturing it is. Expect watches fully cased in ceramic to be pricier than steel and titanium ones, but cheaper than precious metals.\nGOLD\nForming the backbone of all things luxurious, gold is the ultimate workhorse in haute horlogerie. It’s versatile, it doesn’t tarnish, it has a long history of being made into beautiful objects and, compared to trendy high-tech materials, you never have to explain why a gold watch costs what it does. Some even embrace the metal’s heavy weight – its considerable heft an assurance of opulence.\nGold may be traditional, but modern tinkering has kept it from feeling dated. Hublot’s Magic Gold adds ceramic to the mix to offer scratch-resistance; Montblanc has revived green gold with an alloy incorporating silver and iron; and many brands have formulated their own recipes for red, pink and rose gold, such as Omega’s Sedna Gold, Rolex’s Everose Gold and Hublot’s King Gold.\nAnd it’s not just dress watches that benefit from gold’s versatility. Zenith added a rose gold version of its Chronomaster Sport this year, as did Parmigiani for its Tondagraph GT.\n\n\nPLATINUM \nGold’s heavier and much more expensive cousin will give its owners plenty to brag about. Platinum is about 30 times rarer than gold, and also mined far less. Approximately 3,300 tonnes of gold are mined each year, compared to 190 tonnes of platinum.\nIt may look like white gold, but platinum is a naturally white metal that requires no alloying elements to get its silvery sheen. Because of this, platinum won’t yellow over time, but will require frequent buffing because its softness makes it easier to scratch than gold. It is also this softness and ductility that makes platinum an unpopular choice for chiming watches, as the metal appears to absorb the sound, though some may argue that the resulting sound is cleaner.\nPlatinum’s uniquely cool-toned lustre has largely been left untampered with, but Panerai recently unveiled its Platinumtech Luminor Marina PAM1116, which uses an alloy that is supposedly harder than regular platinum.\nSAPPHIRE CRYSTAL\nIts plasticky appearance won’t win over buyers who want their expensive watches to look the part, but for those who would rather see than be seen, sapphire crystal’s bare-it-all aesthetic is a bold alternative to conventional metals. When paired with a skeletonised movement – especially those with unusual constructions like the Purnell Escape II Absolute Sapphire with two triple-axis tourbillons – the view is breathtaking.\nRichard Mille was the first to develop a case made entirely of sapphire crystal in 2012, and each of the five pieces of the RM 056 made retailed at US$1.65 million (S$2.2 million). Much of that cost was attributed to how difficult sapphire crystal is to cut and shape. With a hardness second only to diamond, the synthetic material (made from crystallising pure aluminium oxide at very high temperatures) is virtually scratch-proof, which is what makes it the default choice for modern watch crystals.\nEnough buzz was generated from the RM 056 that other brands started work on their own sapphire creations, resulting in clear cases that were not only more affordable, but also came in different colours. Hublot and Chanel have even gone as far as to make matching sapphire crystal bracelets this year with the Big Bang Integral Tourbillon Full Sapphire and J12 X-Ray Electro respectively.\nHowever, what makes sapphire crystal so challenging to machine may also be its biggest drawback – brittleness. Hit it hard enough and it might shatter, but sapphire’s superb scratch-resistance will at least prevent micro scratches from weakening the surface over time.\n\n\nSTAINLESS STEEL\nThere’s nothing really exciting about stainless steel, not in usefulness nor in appearance. And yet some of the most in-demand watches of all time are steel ones. The Patek Philippe Nautilus, Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and almost the entire Rolex sports catalog have well-known, years-long waiting lists for their steel models.\nA big part of this has to do with steel’s value, or comparative lack of it. Traditionally, luxury watches were only considered as such when precious metals were used, so up until the 1970s, steel examples were rare, thus driving up auction prices for vintage steel models. Now that steel is a widely accepted material in high-end watchmaking, brands can offer more accessible price points for their products, from entry-level models all the way to grand complications.\nAffordability aside, it’s not like stainless steel is completely without its merits. It doesn’t rust, and it’s hard enough that it won’t dent from regular use. It also holds its finishing well, and the contrast between satin brushed and polished surfaces is often a point of delight. And with great design, the case material almost doesn’t matter.\nTITANIUM\nWhen it comes to comfort, titanium is hard to beat. It’s light, it’s hypoallergenic and it has low thermal conductivity so you won’t have to worry about strapping on an ice cube after waking up in a chilly room (or a branding iron if you left it out in the sun).\nThe world’s first titanium watch was the Citizen X-8 Chronometer from 1970, but due to the difficulty of mass producing such cases, less than 2,000 of them were made. Now, thanks to much improved manufacturing practices, titanium watches are in abundance and are favoured for their strength (about five times that of steel), corrosion resistance and gunmetal hue. While titanium is often executed in matte, brushed finishes, brands like Grand Seiko are known for offering titanium tickers with a brilliant mirrored sheen through a technique known as Zaratsu polishing.\nSpeaking of polishing, expect to do this reasonably often with your titanium watch because the only area in which it loses to stainless steel is scratch resistance. The reason titanium is hypoallergenic is the oxide layer that coats the metal, but this layer is also what’s prone to scratches. Fortunately, it is also easier to buff than steel.\nThere are, however, watchmakers that have found a way to avoid this little inconvenience entirely. IWC’s Ceratanium is a composite material that adds ceramic’s scratch resistance to titanium’s many favourable qualities, while Citizen applies a surface-hardening technology called Duratect to create its Super Titanium.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Asians are spending big on branded jewellery, benefitting mega-brands
  </h1>, 'text': ""Swiss luxury group Richemont is showing off some sparkling numbers. Amid a broad rebound in the luxury sector, it more than doubled sales for the three months to June. The upswing in demand for pricey labels has also helped Burberry to report sales that are back at pre-pandemic levels. But Richemont’s leading position in jewellery should help it to continue making outsized gains.\nThe sustainability of the luxury\xa0recovery now looks assured. There were concerns that a short-term boost from consumers’ inability to splash their cash savings on experiences might reverse once economies reopen.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nYet the resilience demonstrated by mega-brands such as Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels has not flagged. Both are benefiting from a long-term shift towards branded jewellery, particularly driven by Asian clientele. Innovations such as Clash – an edgy, modern and relatively affordable line unveiled by Cartier in 2019 – have proved popular with younger buyers.\xa0\nThere is room to grow market share. Branded jewellery accounts for little more than a quarter of the market at present, far less than other luxury sectors. It could rise to 40 per cent by 2030, said Citi. Not that Richemont will lack competition. Other fashion groups wish to move further into high-end branded jewellery. This was illustrated by rival Kering’s enthusiasm for a tie-up, which was firmly rejected by Richemont's chair Johann Rupert.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nAccordingly, there is not much of a speculative premium in the share price. This has not stopped Richemont from outperforming in the luxury sector this year, rising by 37 per cent. Even so, the shares – on a 2022 price-to-earnings ratio of 27 – trade at a 10 per cent discount to the sector.\nThat discount should close in time, but it will not disappear. Hard luxury like jewellery is more cyclical than fashion or leather goods. Purchases of bigger-ticket items are more likely to be postponed in downturns. But the growth in branded jewellery is a secular trend. Richemont is exceptionally well-placed to benefit.\n© 2021 The Financial Times\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      This jewellery designer wants you to tell your own stories through her pieces
  </h1>, 'text': 'The art of gifting is very much an exercise in storytelling. We want the thing we have chosen for someone\xa0– whether it is a tangible object, an experience or something else\xa0– to not just be about the gift, but more importantly to communicate our feelings to the receiver. We want said gift to be able to encapsulate a message\xa0– a story\xa0– that we hope is understood and appreciated.\nSometimes, our intentions are misunderstood or are just not clear enough. Sometimes what we think are witty and fabulous inventive ways of communicating our wishes and hopes for our friends and loved ones are too witty or too obscure and they go sailing over heads like satellites that have flown off-course. Sometimes, then, it is so much better and easier if we can inscribe our messages directly onto our gifts.\nEnter SOAMI, a local jewellery brand started by Mindy Alethia Chow, a visual communication graduate from Nanyang Technological University’s School of Art, Design & Media.\nSeveral of SOAMI’s pieces, including the current hero product, her Lumiere Classic Bevelled Rings, are designed to give you the space and freedom to inscribe phrases directly onto the jewellery.\n\n\nThis personalisation is integral to the design and has become something that has made Soami a favourite among young couples.\nHI, MINDY. TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF. WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE YOU STARTED SOAMI?\nBefore SOAMI, I was exploring the Graphic Design path as a Visual Communication graduate. I did freelance design work, and MC-ing and hosting on the side. I dabbled in media as a host on Kids Central and did some acting in my earlier years before jumping onto the entrepreneurial bandwagon.\nWHAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR SOAMI?\nIt is so important what we feed our souls\xa0– our mind, thoughts, body\xa0– and realising\xa0that we all need encouragement and kind reminders every day, and I wanted to make that concept a little more ""tangible"" for people.\nWHAT GAVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE TO START YOUR OWN JEWELLERY BRAND?\nAfter graduation, I joined Lululemon. I loved it there and they left a pretty big impact on me. I was surrounded by motivated, supportive people and a team who constantly pushed me to chase my dreams.\nWe had this “Goal Wall” in the store where we would write down the goals we wanted to crush, and everyone could read them and hold you accountable to them. I know now that simply talking about your goals and getting excited about them can steer you in that direction in ways you cannot imagine.\nIn my time there, I would take in all of it\xa0– connecting with the customers, noticing what makes people love the brand so much, why they keep coming back, why anyone would pay so much for a pair of athleisure pants, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed analysing, observing, dissecting and learning the little things that contributed to the success of this global brand.\nThen, it hit me one afternoon as I was folding pants! That I love the idea of building something and watching it grow. Seeing something take its own form gives me so much fulfilment. My time there created a confidence in me that was just waiting for the right, opportune moment to start the fire, and on one of my travels, I met the humblest craftsman, and everything fell into place from there.\nFROM CONCEPT TO ACTUAL LAUNCH, HOW LONG DID IT TAKE?\nI conceptualised the idea in November 2016 and was able to launch in February 2017. So, just three months, actually.\nWERE THERE ANY SURPRISES OR HICCUPS DURING THAT PERIOD? \nIn the first month, I signed up for SOAMI’s very first pop-up booth at Central Mall with a very small inventory that fit into a small container. Along with display props and banners, everything fit into one suitcase; this really tickled me as I looked around and saw the other vendors lugging bags and bags of things, and there I was strutting in with one suitcase like I was going on a holiday.\nThe more surprising thing was that we broke even and made a profit at my very first pop-up! That gave me so much confidence as I knew that there was a demand for whatever I was putting out, and that people appreciated even the very clumsy beginning of our brand and aesthetics.\nThat was definitely very encouraging to me as I was bootstrapping it and still paying off university loans while not drawing a proper salary in the beginning, all while reinvesting almost everything back into the business. This was met with a lot of concerns and discouragement from family and friends, as you can imagine! But I pushed through and they were finally convinced when the courier guy started ringing the doorbell weekly to pick up bags of orders for delivery.\n\n\nHOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR BRAND?\nGraceful, gentle opulence. I want SOAMI to be a brand that invokes a sense of wonder.\nWHAT OR WHO INSPIRES YOUR DESIGNS?\nThe Aletheia Bar + Disk Necklace was an ‘accidental’ design when a disk necklace and a vertical bar necklace were overlapped on the display and a customer had thought that was the design. She got so excited about it so we combined them and it subsequently became a very popular design. Our customers inspire our designs.\xa0By engaging in online and offline conversations with them, we learn a lot about what people are looking for, and find gaps that are not being met.\nI don’t believe in following trends as they come and go very quickly. To me the power combination is timelessness and soul. Timeless aesthetics date back to ancient art history which I like to draw references from, and the soul behind the item is what completes it. When you tie meaning and stories to your products, their value increases significantly. I never underestimate this value that I get to create in anything from SOAMI that would bring people hope, joy and excitement.\nWHAT DO YOU HOPE YOUR PIECES COMMUNICATE TO\xa0YOUR CUSTOMERS?\nOur hope is that anyone who receives and unboxes a SOAMI product will feel so absolutely loved. With butterflies in their bellies and a silly grin on their face. That is one of life’s greatest joys and we always want to create that feeling for people.\nWHAT IS YOUR HERO PRODUCT?\nIt varies during different periods. Right now, it’s our\xa0Classic Lumiere Bevelled Rings. They are simple markers of love and so many couples love them as you can put little discreet messages on these classic bands.\nWHAT ROLE DOES THE ASPECT OF PERSONALISATION/PERSONAL ENGRAVINGS PLAY?\nA massive one! Personalisation has been a big part of SOAMI and our customers love that they can inscribe their personal reminders on our simple jewellery pieces.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO YOU BECAUSE OF WORK, SINCE LAUNCHING THE BRAND?\nSo many! But an unforgettable moment was when my senior pastor, Pastor Joseph Prince bought an item on the webstore for his wife. I couldn’t believe it! It meant and still means so much to me because he has been such a great influence in my life, and the fact that a piece of what I created is in his home is completely surreal to me.\nGetting my own office has definitely been one of the greatest milestones this year. It is a sanctuary, not just to me but also to anyone who comes in. I get full privacy to work and create. With a physical space, you get to create sensory play and manifest the brand tangibly. When customers come in and experience the brand physically, it transcends the online experience.\nAND WHAT HAS BEEN THE TOUGHEST OBSTACLE IN RUNNING A BUSINESS SO FAR?\nAs someone with a design background, visuals and aesthetics are so important to me. The challenge is to divide my time, energy and priorities between aesthetics and the non-design aspects. It is very hard for me to make executive decisions that could potentially compromise the branding and visuals, but I sometimes have to. Some decisions that I make directly affect the business’ vertical growth, and others affect its horizontal growth. I have to consider this in my decision-making processes in order to make informed decisions, as wrong moves can be costly sometimes and I want to avoid paying financially for my mistakes as much as I can.\nWHAT IS YOUR AVERAGE DAY LIKE?\nApart from my appointment schedule, my days tend to be unpredictable and different as I am pretty spontaneous and pretty much down for adventure any time. I could have no plans when I wake up and end up dancing to Big Bang’s live concert on YouTube with a friend by the end of the day.\nThe closest thing to a regime I have is that I’m in the studio office by noon for appointments. Email after email, content creation, styling and photographing products in the studio, jewellery stamping work, administrative nonsense, endless thinking about marketing and\xa0constantly thinking about business development.\xa0It is so hard to step out of my own head when it comes to work but I really try to!\nDO YOU THINK SINGAPORE IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE A CREATIVE? \nWell, Singapore may not be the most conducive place for creatives at this point. Offering an ex-art school student perspective, I find that creative expression here can often feel very contrived and borrowed, what with the struggle for identity, need to be practical, etc.\nYou have to be really, really good to get somewhere and even so it would very likely be milked commercially.\nMy personal struggle was identity and feeling a sense of uprootedness when searching for depth and meaning in my work. Our worldview is also very much painted by a myriad of western influences. It can be very frustrating to find your creative voice amidst all of these.\nNevertheless, I understand that our nation’s young history required a different focus at the beginning, where creativity was secondary to diligence and other nation-building traits. While it can still feel like you’re swimming against the current, we have to learn to swim upstream and work with what we have.\nDO YOU THINK THE AVERAGE SINGAPOREAN ENJOYS SUPPORTING LOCAL BRANDS OR DO THEY PREFER TO ACQUIRE BRANDS FROM OVERSEAS DESIGNERS?\nSingaporeans are generally more accepting of buying from local brands now, but it also really depends on the product in question and the budget and lifestyle of the individual.\nCompared to decades ago, local brands these days have shown impeccable branding and quality at competitive prices. Singaporeans definitely appreciate that. I hear a lot of ""I didn’t know Brand X was a local brand, their branding is so impressive!"" exclaimed with a sense of local SG pride.\nI have come across many who can see past the veneer of an exquisite overseas label that has a certain regality tagged to it and prioritise the functionality instead, and others who would still prefer their trusted European artisans and years of perfected craftsmanship for certain things. Great branding and clever marketing plays a big part in courting consumers and making them fall in love with a brand.\nInstagram and many other platforms have also jumped on board with the Support Local movement. Sticker taps and hashtags featuring local businesses really help.\nI\'m excited that we\xa0– consumers, fellow business owners, organisations like the Singapore Tourism Board\xa0– are channelling more support towards locally-owned businesses and that people are increasingly seeing more value in local businesses. Being a brand in Design Orchard Singapore, I\'m truly encouraged to see the increased support and spotlight on local brands.\nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS?\nOperating the business in such unprecedented, uncertain times, the digital advertising sphere is highly saturated as businesses vie for the spotlight. This has driven up the costs of digital marketing and advertising.\nThe absence of physical pop-ups, workshops and events has pushed the business into the online sphere, mainly.\nThat said, it has been interesting to learn to navigate through this along with fellow business owner friends by finding new ways to engage and switching up our perspectives and methods.\nWHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR SOAMI?\nOur vision is to encourage intentional living and boldness through simple, timeless jewellery and other exquisite creations.\nI want to build an empire out of SOAMI that goes beyond jewellery. I hope everything we create will be centred on love, based on real stories and drenched in meaning.\nANY COOL PLANS FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR YOU WOULD WANT TO SHARE?\nWe have a pretty cool collaboration coming up with a local shoe brand that we\'re excited about.\nWe are also working on our bridal and bespoke fine jewellery line called Dion by SOAMI\xa0– it’s named after my younger brother.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     Culture & Trends ', ""     Women's Style "", '     style ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Why are dive watches so popular even if – let’s face it – most of us don’t dive?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Let’s face it: Mechanical watches are far from a necessity for daily life. They’re less accurate than their quartz-powered counterparts and have only a fraction of the functionality smart devices have.\nAnd when you think about it, the subset of mechanical diving watches are even less so. Swimming pools are rarely deeper than 3m, and recreational diving has a maximum depth limit of 40m. Why on earth would you need a watch with a water resistance of a few hundred metres?\nYou don’t. But dive watches are as popular and trendy as ever – whether you’re talking about luxury pieces like Rolex’s Submariner, Seiko’s more affordable offerings, and everything in-between.\nOne recent entrant in the already-crowded market is Tissot’s Seastar 2000 Professional – and like many other divers, it’s a prime example of the general allure of this type of watch. We break down exactly why.\nTHEY’RE TOUGH AS NAILS\nFrom a purely utilitarian point of view, this is basically a dive watch’s traditional selling point. Since timing is vital to a diver’s safety, such watches are built to resist knocks or shocks that might damage the movement inside.\nThe Seastar 2000, for example, is a whopper of a stainless steel monster with a diameter of 46mm and a thickness of 16.25mm. No doubt it’s an extreme example, even within this line, but that just underscores its point of being no-nonsense.\nA screw-down crown and crown guards further ensure this particular piece stays true to its whopping 600m of water resistance – the depth rating required to achieve the ISO 6424 certification for dive watches.\nBasically, it’s like showing up to a go-kart track in a tank – it’s excessive, but it’s nice to feel safe. Even in the pool.\nYOU CAN TELL TIME IN THE DARK\nLegibility is another default feature in proper dive watches. The time needs to be easily read in conditions as dark and murky as the sea (or when you suddenly wake up with the need to pee), so the numerals and hands are always big, bright and easy on the eyes.\nLike most dive watches worth their (sea) salt, the Seastar 2000 achieves this with distinct hour indices and thick baton-shaped hands, all of which are filled with white luminescent material that glows blue in the dark. The date is prominently displayed through a window at six o’clock (not that you need to know what day it is underwater).\nYOU CAN TIME THINGS WITH IT\nA dive watch’s bezel also has a dedicated function. Being able to rotate, wearers can traditionally time their dives by aligning the minute hand to the desired numerals on the bezel. These typically only rotate in one direction – counter-clockwise – so that an accidental adjustment will only shorten the dive time as opposed to lengthen it.\nOf course, when on land, you can also use it for other important things, like timing your cooking.\nOne important prerequisite for dive watch bezels is that they’re supposed to be easy to grip, which is important for actual divers who are geared up, gloved and in the water. These days, too, many bezels have replaced the old school aluminum material with the virtually scratch-proof ceramic insert.\nTHE DIVE WATCH DESIGN IS CLASSIC\nFunction dictates much of how a dive watch looks, and while that leads to many of them sharing a very similar aesthetic, it’s a formula that works well within the sporty category.\nDive watches don’t have a monopoly on ruggedness, what with pilot’s watches, chronographs and racing-inspired timepieces all vying for your adventure-seeking wrists, but they do have their own unique charm.\nSome also have features you won’t find on other types of watches, like the Seastar 2000’s helium escape valve – an utterly obscure add-on that lets helium molecules escape during decompression following a saturation dive which, of course, isn’t so much a weekend hobby as it is a highly specialised profession.\nTHEY JUST LOOK COOL FOR ANY OCCASION\nOn the flip side, you can always look to how Daniel Craig pulls them off as he dons two different Omega Seamaster watches in Casino Royale – you’d know these rugged tickers can look slick in a suit, too.\nThe key to this versatility lies in the details. For the Seastar 2000, the dials are engraved with a wave pattern and come in\xa0smoky blue, black or green. There is even an option to switch between a rubber strap or a three-link steel bracelet.\n\n\nIF YOU’RE NOT GOING QUARTZ, THE MOVEMENTS ARE LOVELY\nSome dive watches are quartz-powered and have a battery keeping them ticking. But mechanical ones have the added allure (and convenience) of movements, especially automatic ones with a self-winding mechanism.\nBeating away inside the Seastar 2000 is the Powermatic 80 movement, which boasts an anti-magnetic hairspring to ensure optimal precision at all times. Automatic movements like this one will keep running for as long as you wear it, but even if you let the watch wind down, the Powermatic 80 has an above average power reserve of 80 hours.\nYou’ll even be able to admire the movement through the watch’s sapphire crystal caseback. This is a somewhat rare feature in a dive watch since many use solid casebacks, but it is wonderful reminder that this a proudly analogue tool in an eminently digitised world.\n', 'related_topics': ['     timepieces ', '     Watches ', '     fashion ', '     Advertorial ']}"

      Commentary: Chinese fashion giant Shein has taken over the world. It has just met its match
  </h1>, 'text': 'LAUSANNE, Switzerland: If you’re a regular on TikTok, you might be familiar with the cult of Shein, the online fashion retailer.\nUnder the hashtags #shein and #sheinhaul, users post short clips of themselves flaunting their latest Shein purchases, from skin-tight tank tops and plaid skirts to chunky belts and delicate necklaces.\nSome of these users spend hundreds of dollars per haul.\nShein emerged in 2008 out of China’s ancient capital Nanjing. It has since become the world’s largest, purely online fashion company in terms of sales of self-branded products, according to Euromonitor.\nShein’s competitive advantage lies in leveraging hype generated online by Gen Z users over the hottest new fashions, then delivering those pieces on its platform faster than its rivals. Where Zara and others take weeks to ready new collections, Shein presents hundreds of new designs on a weekly basis at about 50 per cent of Zara’s prices for comparable products.\n\n\nSHEIN OUTSHINES ITS RIVALS\nHaving no physical stores, Shein experienced a COVID-19 boon. In September 2020, Shein’s app saw 10.3 million downloads globally, in contrast to the H&M app’s 2.5 million downloads, and Zara’s 2 million. By April, Shein became the most downloaded shopping app in the US.\nToday, Shein is estimated to be worth US$30 billion, and is backed by global investors like IDG Capital and Sequoia. While the company said it has no plans for an initial public offering, an insider said it has employed Goldman Sachs to advise on a potential IPO.\nShein is outshining its fast fashion competitors when their market outlook is dim. Hit by lockdowns, UK retailer Primark lost £1.1 billion (US$1.5 billion) from store closures. It’s a brick-and-mortar chain that has refused to go online.\nMeanwhile, Forever 21 went bankrupt even before COVID-19 hit.\n\n\nThe overall long-term future of fast fashion companies does not point upwards. While Fast Retailing, which owns Uniqlo, almost doubled its value since 2017,\xa0Inditex, owner of Zara, only increased its share price by about 14 per cent, while H&M has shed 17 per cent.\nBut Shein’s competitors aren’t quite these fast fashion stalwarts, or other e-commerce platforms like Amazon. Its greatest competitor is inattention. Whenever customers shopping for clothes find something that diverts their attention away from Shein’s stream of new product launches, Shein’s sales are in danger.\nMaybe this makes Shein an entertainment fashion brand that happens to make money with instant fashion. Where habits and convenience drive users to the big e-commerce giants, surprise and desire attract them to Shein.\n\n\nShein is also positioning itself as a community for fashion enthusiasts by encouraging customers to share their buys on social media. As of July, over 900,000 posts on Instagram featured the tag #sheingals. By building a consumer-centric brand, Shein is seen as much more than just an online store for cheap clothing.\nAnd Shein is also different from other Chinese clothing manufacturers with online stores on Shopee or Alibaba, namely because Shein’s main markets are overseas. Its biggest market is the US.\nGoing forward, Shein, the brand coveted overseas, will find a debut at home easy. This will add the heft of unprecedented scale to its operations and pricing power.\n\n\nTRADITIONAL FAST FASHION STARTING TO LOOK SLOW\nCompetitive pressures also darken the outlook for many fast fashion players. Their business model is based on high-speed replication of new trends.\nTraditional players like Zara and Uniqlo leverage their network of local stores to quickly grasp the sales trends in different locations through their point-of-sales systems and analysis of offline and online shopping habits. They had established a fashion cycle where new items are dropped every six to eight weeks.\nBut new players have beat them at their own game of speed. Shein releases over 5,000 new items every day.\nOnline retailers have direct access to customers. The high quantity and quality of data on what individual customer purchase in combination with their history provides invaluable insights on which items will catch on or not.\nShein grafts information from websites and integrates profiles of customers with predictions about what materials, styles and colours partners should use.\nSuch access to data and the ability to fine-tune products strongly incentivises Shein and other online retailers to avoid a business-to-business model. Shein’s £300 million bid for Topshop in the UK in January indicates that it is aiming for the business-to-customer top spot (ASOS eventually bought Topshop and its affiliates for £330 million).\nIn the past, dealing through retailers would have been the only way for fashion brands to be present worldwide. Today the situation is flipped.\nOnline interactions with customers, one-on-one, can be less complex, even on a global scale, than having local retail representations or distributors that would add regulatory headaches of taxation, disclosure, compliance and possibly consignment sales. A third man in the value chain would only slow down Shein.\n\n\nGROWING CONCERNS OVER FASHION’S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\nWith fast fashion firms under pressure to stay ahead of fashion cycles and entertain customer\xa0desire for the newest styles, there’s a growing countertrend that questions its breakneck speed.\nThe global fashion industry generates about 4 to 10 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.\nAccording to the World Bank, the fashion industry uses 93 billion cubic metres of water every year, an amount that 5 million people could use for consumption instead.\nThe industry also produces about 20 per cent of wastewater worldwide through dyeing and treating fabrics. It dumps microfibers that amount to about 50 billion plastic bottles into the ocean and disposes 87 per cent of total fibre input annually.\nThese negative effects of fashion are predicted to increase by 50 per cent by 2030, as more buy into the ethos of fast fashion: Buy fast, buy new, and dispose prematurely. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the average person today buys and discards about 60 per cent more clothing compared to 2000.\nFast fashion leaders have launched initiatives that boost their sustainability record, though they’ve been met with scepticism. Although H&M has started already in 2010 with its Conscious Collection emphasising organic and sustainable fabrics, the Norwegian Consumer Authority said information provided about the clothing, such as the amount of recycled material in each item, is insufficient.\nA rejection of overconsumption in favour of essentials and basics, espoused by brands like Patagonia, fares better with those concerned about fashion’s environmental impact.\nNew models are emerging fast. Business models of vintage, recycled clothes are quickly losing their stigma in the West.\n\n\nTHE RISE OF AN ALTERNATIVE FASHION INDUSTRY\nThe fashion industry is now at a crossroads, and the path it takes will determine if behemoths like Shein wind up as winners or losers.\nWill companies manage to adapt to a fashion world that embraces sustainability while developing new choices for consumers?\nIn China, the pre-loved clothes business is booming, and not just of the cool vintage, or high-end boutique type. Boring old clothes are becoming a business. Companies such as Yi Jia Yi Clothing, founded in 2006, focus on trading bulk used clothing.\n\n\nThis fits a larger trend of recycling in the East attracting investor attention. The upcoming IPO of JD.com backed Aihuishou, which hawks used electronics, and the rise of trillion-yuan Alibaba resale market Xianyu, show confidence in China`s second-hand goods platforms.\nAs with more sectors and technologies, Asian innovators may provide creative answers to the world’s pressing problems.\nIMD Professors Patrick Reinmoeller and Mark Greeven run IMD`s Asian Innovation Strategies program. Yunfei Feng is lead researcher on Asian innovation and co-author of Mark`s book on The Future of Global Retail.\n', 'related_topics': ['     e-commerce ', '     fashion ', '     China ']}"

      Plus-size men: Where to find XXL clothes that fit and get a style upgrade, too
  </h1>, 'text': ""While the fashion industry may be a lot more inclusive these days – compared to\xa0a decade or even just five years ago – there are some gaps in the market that have not been adequately filled.\nIn Singapore, this includes\xa0options for those whose clothes size go beyond XL.\nIt's not just about the ladies, either – bigger-built\xa0men find it equally difficult to find clothes that work for them. A guy’s sartorial requirements may not, generally speaking, be as varied as a woman’s, but that doesn’t make things any easier in the wardrobe department.\nAmong the grouses heard from a straw poll we conducted: A lack of style options, very low stock levels\xa0and the inability to get larger sizes at the\xa0majority of men’s clothing retailers here.\nOf course, plus-size is also a generic description for your size type – there really is a wide range\xa0in the category. Your height, physique and body shape will also determine what types and styles of clothing will suit you, although it is safe to say that sack-like shirts will flatter nobody.\nWhile it is true that your choices are not as wide-ranging as those available to the average-sized guy here, there's\xa0still a good number of places where you can find clothing that caters to you. Here are a few options – from formal to casual, and at a variety of price points, too.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nAOUT\nIf you are looking specifically for shirts, this Singapore-based label carries a selection of stylish casual and semi-formal options on its website. Sizes go up to XXL, while the entire range is very affordably priced – nothing goes beyond S$49.\nhttps://aoutsg.com/product-category/plus-size/\nASOS\n\xa0\nA post shared by ASOS MAN (@asos_man)\n\xa0\nWho says you need to skip trends if you’re plus-size?

      Commentary: After the coup, Myanmar’s garment industry hangs by a thread
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The future of the garment industry in Myanmar hangs by a thread. Still reeling from the impact of COVID-19, it is now suffering from the aftermath of the military coup.\nAs a result, its remarkable ascent in the export sector has been thwarted, and there are fears that the industry will unravel.\nIn 2019, before COVID-19 struck, about one third (amounting to US$6.5 billion) of all goods exported from Myanmar was produced by the garment industry, according to United Nations Comtrade data.\n\n\nAccording to SMART Textile & Garments, an organisation funded by the European Union (EU) and co-funded by private sector partners, the industry employed 700,000 low-income workers. There were high expectations for strong growth.\nThe onset of the pandemic scuppered this upward rise. The industry was battered by a trifecta: Disruptions in the supply chain from China, plummeting demand from Europe in lockdown and operational restrictions imposed by the Burmese government to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.\nFortunately, an increase in exports to the US and Japan offset decreases in exports to the EU, according to the International Labor Organization. Also, the outlook became more optimistic towards the end of 2020 as China and Europe emerged from lockdowns and the large clothing retailers resumed their orders.\n\n\nCUE THE MILITARY COUP\nHowever, just as supply chains from China were restarted and restored and other logistical issues resolved, the military staged a coup in February.\nThe already frayed seams of the garment industry began falling apart. Strikes have been called for by the garment workers’ union, and martial law in some Yangon townships and roadblocks hindered workers from getting to work.\nArson attacks against factories destroyed capital and property. Cash flow problems and a banking crisis are stalling operations and transportation problems in and out of the country plague delivery schedules.\nConsequently, the garment industry experienced a low point. Big fashion brands such as H&M, Primark, Next and Benetton suspended operations between February and May because of human rights concerns and civil unrest.\nSome factories reported operating at a fifth of their capacity and surviving on orders placed before the coup. Many garment factories closed down.\nAccording to a preliminary survey conducted by the European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar, a quarter of garment workers had lost their jobs by May.\nThis grim situation was slightly alleviated in May when H&M, Primark and Bestseller announced that they would resume business in Myanmar. Their rationale for doing so is garbed in the rhetoric of moral obligation – to their suppliers, garment workers, the economy and the general welfare of Myanmar.\nBy taking a moral stance, these companies are justifying their continued trading in Myanmar in view of the public condemnation of the military coup. This has come from many quarters: The EU in the form of targeted sanctions, international and garment organisations supporting the restoration of democracy and one of the unions of garment workers in Myanmar in the form of work stoppages.\n\n\nKNOTTY POLITICAL AND MORAL QUESTIONS\nHere, we see the interplay of two distinct political and moral orders which have bedevilled Myanmar watchers and stakeholders for decades. Since the coup, every aspect of Myanmar life has become even more politicised and woven into the struggle between the military regime and the country’s citizens.\nIn this case, how can one engage in activities – for example, conduct business, provide healthcare and deliver aid – in ways that unpick the seams of the current military-political order? How should this be done (through sanctions and the termination of trading?), and at what cost to individual jobs and the economy?\nIs this a valid trade-off if individuals, political parties and organisations (trade unions) of Myanmar call for it? Do they speak for all Myanmar citizens?\nThese knotty questions have to be negotiated by individual companies. But the decision may eventually be made for them if operations cannot continue because of financial and logistical problems.\nAccess to cash deposits in banks continues to be an issue, and the transport of goods has been severely impeded by the global five-fold increase in sea freight costs, Myanmar being struck off the sailing plans of shipping lines, premium rates for limited space on air freight and the impact of curfews on ground transport.\nIn addition, escalating violence such as assassinations and bombings in urban settings is creating fear and uncertainty among the public at large and will only aggravate the situation. Given these snags, the likelihood that clothing retailers will relocate to Bangladesh or Cambodia, where costs might be similar or even lower, is high.\nIn that case, the European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar is concerned that the industry will unravel.\nAccording to SMART, 54 per cent of all apparel exports go to European clothes retailers. If they divest, factories will be forced to close, and workers will be made redundant and skilled teams dispersed, causing almost a decade worth of development and know-how to be lost.\nThis will also have a cascade effect on allied industries such as footwear, handbags, logistics and transportation.\nThe outlook at the moment is dismal, and, at present, things are extremely volatile in Myanmar. The future of the garment industry, as well as that of the country as a whole, ultimately depends on whether Myanmar citizens will be able to untangle the snarls in their political system and refashion a political order that ends decades of military dominance and violence.\n\n\nSue-Ann Oh is Visiting Fellow of the Myanmar Studies Programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.

If you think only women with large cups have a tough time finding bras in their size, then clearly you haven’t been listening to those at the other end of the bust-size spectrum, albeit with very different fit issues.\nBut just because it’s difficult to find bras to fit cup AAs doesn’t mean you should cop out completely by going braless because cup AAs also need coverage, lift and support. A good bra can help fill out outfits better, shape a curvier silhouette, and simply provide the necessary coverage especially under a body-conscious look.\n\n\nIf you’ve been on a futile search to find a bra with cups that do not have gaps, or if the bras you buy always end up wearing you, here are some styles that will fit you better.\nTHE BRALETTE\nLightweight bralettes are an excellent option. The triangular cup design may be reminiscent of training bras but lingerie makers have souped them up with sexy lacy designs and pretty pastel hues for\xa0grown-up appeal.\xa0\nFor a little extra lift, reach for lightly padded ones that are great for daytime wear. And in the right fabric like Tencel or cotton, these will work well even under a fitted tee.\nhttps://www.perkbykate.com/\n\n\nTHE DEMI-CUP BRA\nOn the lookout for something with more support? A demi or balconette style has shallow cups that typically cover just two-thirds of the boob and are designed to create subtle cleavage via lifting and compressing the bottom of the breasts.\xa0\nNeedless to say, they are so much sexier than full-coverage bras that are likely to leave some gaps.\nhttps://www.calvinklein.com/sg/home\n\n\nTHE PLUNGE BRA\nAs the name suggests, this bra style has a plunging neckline that draws attention to cleavage. Its triangular-shaped cups are designed to lie flat on the inner outline of the breasts – they fit closely, without gapping. This low-coverage bra style works best for less ample bosoms.\nhttps://www.natori.com/\n\n\nTHE PUSH-UP BRA\nWhen shopping for a push-up bra, resist overcompensating what you lack in volume with push-up padding. A low- to medium-level lift is really all you need.\xa0\nToo high-level a boost can sometimes create an unnatural look – as if wearing an old-fashioned corset, which is not a look you’d want to wear in modern times.\nhttps://lasenza.com/ \n\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      If you weren’t a fan of aviator watches before, these might change your mind
  </h1>, 'text': ""Lewis Hamilton, winner of seven FIA Formula One World Drivers’ Championship titles and face of IWC’s racing-inspired Ingenieur watches for the last eight years, is now part of the brand’s new campaign for its Big Pilot’s Watch family.\nIs having a motorist fronting an aviator’s collection somewhat incongruent? Maybe. Does it really matter? Not in the least. The majority of people who own pilot’s watches aren’t pilots anyway, and if this year’s releases are anything to go by, IWC is trying to broaden the collection’s appeal even further with small but significant changes.\n\n\n“Small” is the keyword here, because two important models – the can’t-miss-it Big Pilot’s Watch and the crowd-pleasing Pilot’s Watch Chronograph – are making the subtle shift to more wearable case dimensions and styles.\nThis change is more noticeable in the new Big Pilot’s Watch 43. While 43mm isn’t exactly what you’d call demure, it is a whole 3mm smaller than many of the existing 46mm models. And when you consider how the 1940 original was a whopping 55mm (which made a limited edition comeback in 2016), this 2021 reference is probably as small as it can go if it wants to keep its “Big” designation.\nGoing along with its less imposing size is a dial design that is clean and simple. There are no complications here, not even a date window or a power reserve indicator – just three hands and the same prosaic indices and numerals that carry the essence of IWC’s Pilot's Watches. So what IWC has offered here is the Pilot’s Watch DNA in its purest form in a pronounced, yet not overpowering, size.\nAll three variants are in stainless steel, with a black or blue dial on a leather strap, or black dial with steel bracelet. The movement, which is finally visible thanks to a sapphire crystal case back, has also been upgraded to an in-house one. The calibre 82100 uses the Pellaton bi-directional winding system, is composed of wear-resistant zirconium oxide ceramic parts, and is decorated with circular graining.\nMany are pleased with IWC’s gradual replacements of third-party movements with its own manufacture ones in recent years, and they can be assured that the same holds true for the Pilot’s Watch Chronograph 41. This, too, has a transparent case back (rather an uncommon feature in this collection) that shows off its new calibre 69385 with column wheel chronograph.\nBeing 2mm smaller than the existing Pilot’s Watch 43mm will surely broaden this cult classic’s appeal, but so too will its new dials in sunburst blue and green. Not only do these coloured variants add some rakish personality to a collection dominated by black faces and military seriousness, but the slimmer profile of 14.5mm (compared to 15.4mm of the larger models) also make the Pilot’s Watch Chronograph 41 more comfortable to wear and less awkward with a formal getup.\nThere are four stainless steel versions to choose from, with blue or green dials with matching calfskin leather straps or steel bracelets. You won’t even have to stick with just one because this watch, together with the Big Pilot’s Watch 43 and many of this year’s releases, features the EasX-CHANGE system for easy strap swaps. There is even an option to add a rubber strap, and the new and improved 100m water resistance for both models means these pilots are now ready for aquatic adventures, too.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Culture & Trends ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Gender-bending, multi-functional styles: Menswear gets experimental in Paris 
  </h1>, 'text': 'If there’s one thing that Milan Fashion Week has shown, it’s that menswear is definitely getting more and more experimental. There was Prada’s rompers, Fendi’s cropped blazers and Dolce & Gabbana’s crystal-studded suits. At Paris Fashion Week, this trend seemed to continue as French\xa0fashion heavyweights revealed their Spring/Summer 2022 collections.\nWhat do you get when you blend formalwear with streetwear? Or menswear with womenswear? The answer – Louis Vuitton’s latest collection. For creative director Virgil Abloh, there’s no holding back. The collection was an exploration of cultural nuances, from chess\xa0to boxing, martial arts, rave and more.\xa0\nBoxing gloves were paired with blazers, suits were cinched at the waist with kung fu-style belts. Blurring gender lines, knitwear was styled with poofy skirts. For accessories, there were soft trunks and Keepall bags in neon and rainbow-coloured palettes.\nIn true Abloh style, there was a lot to unpack throughout the show, including the debut of Louis Vuitton’s Nike Air Force 1 collab.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nOver at Dior, creative director Kim Jones revealed a blockbuster collaboration with rapper Travis Scott, whom the designer described as a “cultural phenomenon”. It was the house’s first time collaborating with a musician on a full collection.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Dior Official (@dior)\n\xa0\nDior’s house codes were mixed with Scott’s Cactus Jack motifs. In a bold move, Dior’s Oblique was reworked to spell “Jack”, featuring on pieces such as knitted vests. Other pieces in the desert-themed collection (a nod to Scott’s hometown of Texas) included snake-printed Saddle belt bags, cactus-shaped jewellery, sequined varsity jackets and flared trousers.\nFor Loewe’s Spring/Summer 2022 men’s collection, designer Jonathan Anderson explored the theme of hedonistic freedom. Inspired by early club culture, the collection featured everything from tinsel-fringed tank tops to zebra motif shorts, neon knits and cotton ribbed vests.\xa0\n“The mood of the collection for this season was the idea of awkward beauty, and how we’re in the optimism stage. This season is more about the action; the action of going out, the action of having fun,” Anderson said in the film.\n\xa0\nA post shared by LOEWE (@loewe)\n\xa0\nHermes’s menswear artistic director Veronique Nichanian presented a collection that was a little more pared back, but probably the most wearable of all.\xa0\nOnce again, Nichanian proved that the devil is in the details. Named Double Game, the collection featured several reversible pieces (including reversible parkas) for multi-functionality. A neutral colour palette was enlivened with blasts of yellow, pink and green.\xa0\n“Suffused with optimism and energy, this creative collection is bursting with the vitality of a world reclaimed,” read the show notes.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Hermès (@hermes)\n\xa0\nPieces that caught our eye included a knit sweater in orange and pink ombre, and a poplin shirt with a double 3D Mors et Gourmettes print. Accessories included casually chic rope belts, plus a weekend bag built on top of a skateboard.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Hermès (@hermes)\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ']}"

      The Singapore-based wellness creative who wants to help you heal yourself
  </h1>, 'text': 'Former architect and interior designer, Mae Kwan White, wears many hats. She is an artist, fashion entrepreneur, yogini, feng shui expert and singing bowl therapist. Through her two related brands, MASE and MASE LIFESTYLE, she wants to make your life a little better, aesthetically and spiritually.\nHaving moved here five years ago, Mae, who ran a successful interior design business in Hong Kong, has been focusing not on how to improve one’s surroundings, but how to improve oneself.\xa0\nThrough her practice, she offers a range of services, including energy-balancing yoga, singing bowl meditation, feng shui, and healing through crystals and essential oils.\nHI MAE, YOU DO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. TELL US\xa0ABOUT YOUR LIFE.\nI was born in London. I\xa0grew up in Hong Kong\xa0and\xa0returned to the UK when I was 13, where I attended\xa0a boarding school in Hertfordshire. I studied architecture at Cardiff University, then moved to London to pursue my dream as a singer-songwriter, before completing my professional training at a London-based architecture firm and became a qualified architect.\nWhilst working as an architect in London, I started to lose touch with my creativity as the work\xa0did not provide the creative freedom that I craved. In 2009, I decided to use most of my redundancy pay on a master’s degree in interior architecture.\xa0\nIt was then that I began to feel creatively challenged as the course had a huge focus on creative thinking.\xa0\nOn the day of graduation, in 2010, I got a phone call from my uncle in Hong Kong, who offered me a job as an apprentice at his friend’s furniture and art gallery, Le Cadre Gallery.\xa0\nWithout hesitation, I took the opportunity to relocate\xa0to Hong Kong. I spent the next two\xa0years working for my mentor Paul Lau, who helped shape the artistic flair I now possess.\nIt was during this time that I set up my interior design business, Mayella Limited, providing high-end interior design services as well as creating bespoke artwork for my clients.\xa0\nIn 2012, I was invited to teach creative thinking and conceptual design in architecture at HKU Space. I found a great deal of enjoyment and satisfaction helping my students find passion and confidence in what they do.\xa0\nIn 2014, the year I became pregnant, I started my passion project MASE, an art-inspired fashion accessories and lifestyle brand that promotes a colourful way of living.\xa0\nMASE began as a creative outlet for me to express my love for nature and architecture, as well as my passion for creative art. My intention was to help others to be expressive and creative with the way they dress.\nWHAT BROUGHT YOU TO SINGAPORE?\nShortly after my daughter Amelia was born, my husband got offered a great career opportunity in Singapore. I was reluctant to relocate at the time as I was very happy with how things were going in my career.\xa0\nIt was an extremely challenging decision for me to leave that all behind, not to mention my family and friends.\nThe first two\xa0years living in Singapore were a little tough for me. I no longer had my mum to help look after my daughter, who had only just turned one, when we left Hong Kong.\nIn the end, I made the decision to focus most of my time on looking after Amelia and MASE, and put the interior design business on the back-burner.\xa0\nIn 2017, though, inspired by an interior design collaboration with renowned feng shui masters,\xa0Chow Ho Ming and his daughter Thierry, I took on a diploma in feng shui design.\xa0\nThen, after spending most of 2018 playing and getting certified as a singing bowl practitioner, I decided to launch MASE Lifestyle, a wellness brand dedicated to mind, body and space.\nYOU BEGAN\xa0EXPLORING WELLNESS IN THE EARLY 2010S. WHAT PROMPTED YOU TO START THIS JOURNEY?\nI have always been a sensitive soul\xa0and with that level of sensitivity, one can go haywire without the right guidance and spiritual practice. I’m very blessed to have a few very close friends who have always been there for me when I need their support.\xa0\nOne of them urged me to attend Hindu philosophy classes with him at an ashram. He told me that with my empathic sensitivity, it’s easy for me to become emotionally drained and overwhelmed, which could easily lead to depression.\xa0\nThat was my first wake-up call, the need to find balance in life, and to learn about myself and my destiny.\nTELL US\xa0ABOUT YOUR TRIP TO BALI IN 2013.\nBali will always hold a special place in my heart. The energy there is incredible and you feel it the moment you step off the plane.\xa0\nIn March 2013, I decided to take a two-week holiday in Bali, mainly to visit the holy water spring at Tirta temple for mind, body and soul cleansing. One of my signature bags, Falling Water,\xa0captures my first visit at the temple.\nA post shared by Mae White | Wellness Creative (@maselifestyle)\nUnbeknownst to me, Nyepi\xa0– the Balinese Day of Silence – which falls in March, is a day reserved for meditation and self-reflection. The whole island shuts down on that day and most Balinese Hindus would spend the entire day fasting and meditating.\xa0\nI was advised to stay in my hotel room in respect of this sacred tradition, and since I had already started to meditate regularly at this point, I decided to do that and tune in to the collective healing energy.\nThis was when I had the vision of creating a business that would be entirely driven by all aspects of my creativity; at that point, the business was about my art prints.\xa0\nI never doubted what came to me that day in\xa02013,\xa0and in fact, the first MASE bag collection was created within a month upon my return to Hong Kong.\nWHAT ARE\xa0THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOUR BUSINESSES? IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.\nAs of last summer, MASE is a Singapore-based fashion accessories label that specialises in leather and fabric handbags featuring my vibrant art prints. All MASE handbags are now available online and at Design Orchard in\xa0Singapore.\nMASE Lifestyle was also relaunched in summer 2020 as a wellness creative brand that offers wellness services and products created and designed by me.\xa0\nIn addition to the restructuring of my business model, a TU-LA Wellness series was added to the list of wellness services I provide under MASE Lifestyle.\xa0\nThe idea is to create a full, sensory experience that can help people find balance in life. A typical programme comprises\xa0energy-balancing yoga, singing bowl meditation, healing crystals and essential oils.\nWHICH BUSINESS OCCUPIES MORE OF YOUR TIME?\nMost of my time is spent on the wellness services these days. Although I seem to be working most of the time, including the weekends, it doesn’t really feel like work since I enjoy what I do and most importantly, the work I do is equally therapeutic for me as it is for my clients.\xa0\nWhen you have your own business, you don’t really get to switch off completely, but it makes a huge difference when you have a passion for it.\nHOW DOES ONE BECOME A SINGING BOWL PRACTITIONER? WHAT CAN SINGING BOWL THERAPY ACCOMPLISH?\nI got certified at the Singing Bowl Gallery after an intense course learning how to conduct singing bowl therapy and sound bath sessions.\xa0Due to my musical background, playing singing bowls came naturally to me. I’m definitely an intuitive player whereby I play according to the energy I feel from my participants.\nA post shared by Mae White | Wellness Creative (@maselifestyle)\nThe sound and vibrations of the singing bowls can help us reach different states of consciousness. The sound\xa0can actually slow down your brain waves to make you feel relaxed, from beta all the way to delta, which is associated with deep sleep.\xa0\nApart from using them for meditation practice, singing bowls can be used for easing pain such as headaches and migraines, improving circulation, releasing tension\xa0or blockages, opening the energy flow and stimulating the immune system.\nYOU DO SO MANY THINGS. WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THEY ASK YOU WHAT YOU DO, HOW DO YOU USUALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION?\nI’ve always found it quite challenging to explain what I do as a profession, mainly because it would take me hours to explain absolutely everything!\xa0\nHowever, what ties them all together is that everything I do is creative-based, entirely driven by my intuition and life experiences.\xa0\nSo if someone is expecting a simple answer, I would say I’m a wellness creative, but that usually prompts the person to ask more questions as it’s not exactly a straightforward answer.\xa0That just sums up everything I do – it is never straightforward.\xa0\nI’ve always liked to challenge the status quo.\xa0I’ve never been someone who would blindly accept information that is fed to me.\xa0I definitely wasn’t an easy student at school!\nWHAT IS THE BIGGEST AND MOST FREQUENT MISCONCEPTION ABOUT WHAT YOU DO?\nIn the recent years, a lot of my clients refer me as their ""healer"". Personally, I think it’s a huge responsibility to call myself a healer.\xa0\nWhat I do is use my gifts to help others find balance, so that they can activate their own healing ability. We can all heal ourselves;\xa0we just have to know how to get there.\nYOU’VE LIVED IN LONDON, HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE. HOW DIFFERENT ARE THESE\xa0CITIES AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS YOU LOVE AND ALSO DRIVE YOU NUTS ABOUT LIVING HERE?\nThe UK will always be my home. I spent most of my adulthood there and had the most amazing time living in London. I miss the art and music scenes the most.\xa0I miss going to the concerts, music festivals, art galleries, museums and the list goes on.\nHong Kong is also my home because that is where my family and childhood friends reside. Hong Kong is a fast-paced city, so it’s easy for people to get stressed and feel out of balance.\xa0\nI was definitely affected by it when I moved back in 2010, but thanks to my spiritual teacher’s guidance\xa0and support from close friends and family, I eventually found my feet and created a great work-life balance.\xa0I started hiking on a regular basis, especially the hiking trails that end with an infinity pool, such as the one in Tai O.\nA post shared by Mae White | Wellness Creative (@maselifestyle)\nI think it’s difficult not to like Singapore due to the amount of greenery it offers. My favourite thing has to be the colonial shophouses.\xa0\nI feel extremely lucky to have found my current showroom in the beautiful row of shophouses along Petain Road, above Yoga In Common, where I host most of my TU-LA Wellness series.\xa0\nIf there is one thing I’m still trying to get used to, it is the heat and the lack of distinct seasons. I miss autumn!\nWHAT OR WHO INSPIRE YOU?\nI find a lot of people very inspiring but here are some significant people who have inspired me the most: My great grandfather and grandfather.\xa0\nI was born into a very artistic family. My great grandfather was Kwan Wai Nung, also known as the Calendar King\xa0in Hong Kong, who famously did the Twin Girls\xa0artwork for Hong Kong cosmetic brand Kwong Sang Hong, and the posters for Tiger Balm.\xa0\nMy grandfather, whom I was very close to as a kid, was also an artist. I still remember him telling me that there’s no such thing as black in this world, only very dark shades of blue.\nMy dad, his siblings and his cousins are all very artistic. One of them is my uncle, Bing Kwan, an award-winning architect, whom I became very close to when I moved back to Hong Kong.\xa0\nHe taught me the importance of understanding the poetics of space and the art of interior styling that is both practical and aesthetically pleasing.\nThe greatest influence of all has to be my mum’s career in fashion. She was the merchandising director at Versace Hong Kong and China for over 20 years.\xa0\nI often reminisce on my time spent in her office at The Landmark. The room was filled with colourful sketches and photos of Gianni Versace’s signature vibrant prints; it’s not surprising that my work is so colourful!\nApart from my family, the two\xa0years I spent working at Le Cadre Gallery, under owner Paul Lau, has greatly influenced my taste in art and interior design.\xa0\nPaul is very well respected in the design industry in Hong Kong due to his effortless yet eccentric way of styling an interior space with bespoke furniture and artwork.\nWHAT IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SINCE\xa0STARTING\xa0MASE LIFESTYLE?\nAfter years of learning and fine-tuning my skills, I’ve finally found my happy place with MASE Lifestyle. The brand encapsulates every single talent I possess, with the intention of making wellness accessible for all.\nAND WHAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST OBSTACLE YOU HAVE HAD TO OVERCOME?\nI have always been aware of the expectations that society has upon us. Social conditioning is something that I’ve done a lot of research on as I’ve learnt to think outside the box and live beyond the limits imposed by society.\xa0The downside is, that life can become a little challenging when you are not following the rules set by others. But once you have found your unique self-expression and formed your own ideals, life becomes so much more interesting.\nA post shared by Mae White | Wellness Creative (@maselifestyle)\nTHIS IS A SUPER ASIAN QUESTION:\xa0WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK OF YOUR CAREER SHIFT?\nIt took them a while to accept the changes I have made in my career throughout the years but at the end of the day, they just want me to be happy.\xa0\nMy dad is a very traditional man. He wanted me to become a doctor when I was in\xa0high school.\xa0But I remember asking him, ""Dad, do you really think you can trust me with a needle?"".\xa0I’m terrified of needles!\nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC BEEN FOR YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS?\nMeditation is more important than ever during the global pandemic. One of the common causes for unhappiness is the idea of not being in control of your life.\xa0\nWith all the uncertainties we are facing right now, we must learn to tune in to our intuition for guidance, and find calm and peace within ourselves.\xa0\nWe can always control how we feel but we can never control what happens around us. The key is let go of all the fears and worries and accept change as it comes.\nANY EXCITING PLANS FOR THE REST OF 2021 YOU CAN SHARE?\nThere’s a lot to be excited about! My brand strategist and I have been spending a lot of time planning the TU-LA Wellness series, which will hopefully kick-start again in July at Yoga In Common.\xa0\nThere are several exciting projects in the pipeline, such as my exclusively curated TU-LA events at the Mandala Club, a private members’ club formerly known as the Straits Clan, which will be launched in\xa02021.

      Commentary: How sneakers went from sports shoes to become cultural symbols and cult items
  </h1>, 'text': 'NOTTINGHAM, England: Sneakers,\xa0once the symbol of athleticism, have transcended their primary function to become commercial and fashionable objects of desire.\nFrom sportswear and street style to catwalk fashion, sneakers have made their mark as cultural commodities.\nThe global sneaker market valued at approximately US$79 billion in 2020 and is predicted to reach US$120 billion by 2026. With such huge growth, it is unsurprising that they are considered big business.\nSuch are the strides in the sneaker industry that a new exhibition at London’s Design Museum explores how the shoe became an undisputed cultural symbol of our times.\n\n\nCOMFORT IS KING\nThe last decade has seen a huge shift in how sneakers are worn. Donning a pair is no longer frowned upon in the workplace or on more formal occasions. Even British etiquette experts Debrett’s have given their seal of approval, deeming them socially acceptable for smart casual occasions.\nThe continued dominance of the athleisure trend has had a significant impact on the growing sales of sneakers – along with the pursuit of comfort. This only grew more during the pandemic as lockdowns made people further prioritise comfort, which resulted in a rise in sales of loungewear, athleisure and flat shoes, like sneakers.\nAs such, sneakers have moved from the niche to become coveted as fashionable objects. Footwear is now the biggest selling category in the online luxury market and sneakers have made a significant contribution to this growth.\nHigh fashion brands from Gucci to Balenciaga are setting the pace in the luxury sneaker market. In 2017, Balenciaga’s Triple S became the biggest seller in the luxury sneaker market and its popularity seems unstoppable.\nTo understand how the sneaker has emerged to become a footwear phenomenon, it is important to trace its legacy from function to cultural icon.\nFROM TENNIS SHOE TO TRACK\nThe earliest sports shoes were created by The Liverpool Rubber Company, founded by John Boyd Dunlop, in the 1830s. Dunlop was an innovator who discovered how to bond canvas uppers to rubber soles. These were known as sandshoes and worn by Victorians on their beach excursions.\nHistorian Thomas Turner defines the latter decades of the 19th century as a time when industrial progress and social change were twinned with a growing enthusiasm for sporting pursuits, in particular lawn tennis.\nThis resulted in the need for a more specialised type of footwear, which Dunlop’s rubber sole could fulfil. Dunlop launched their now iconic, Green Flash model in 1929, which was worn by tennis legend Fred Perry at Wimbledon.\n\n\nOther significant sports shoes of the 20th century included the Converse All Star, designed for basketball. However, it is Adidas and Nike that have both shaped the sneaker’s evolution from sport to style.\nFounded by Adi Dassler in Germany in 1924 as “Gebruder Dassler Schuhfabrik”, the company later rebranded as Adidas in 1949. The brand created the first track shoe with a complete leather sole and hand-forged spikes, which was worn by Jessie Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.\nNike was created by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight in 1964 as Blue Ribbon Sports and became Nike Inc in 1971. This coincided with the running craze that hit America.\nNike’s first commercial design was the Cortez, cushioned for running. The Cortez was worn by Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, securing Nike’s cultural status.\n\n\nTHE COMMERCIALISATION OF COOL\nResearch by the sociologist Yuniya Kawamura on sneakers defines three waves of the phenomenon. The first wave in the 1970s was defined by an underground sneaker culture and the emergence of hip-hop.\nAdidas’ Samba design, as a key example, became a key part of Terrace Fashion within football fan subculture. In 1986, Run-DMC released the song My Adidas, leading to a sponsorship deal with the brand. This forged the sneaker’s deep-rooted place in popular culture.\nThe second wave of the phenomenon began in 1984 with the launch of Nike Air Jordans. This gave rise to the commodification of sneakers and their desirability as status items, fuelled through celebrity endorsements.\nFor Kawamura the third wave is marked by the digital age and the resulting growth in sneaker marketing and resell culture. The global sneaker resale market was valued at US$6 billion in 2019 and is forecast to be worth US$30 billion by 2030.\nThe growing presence of “sneakerheads” who collect and trade sneakers have ensured that they maintain cult status. Nike and Adidas routinely release limited editions shoes associated with a celebrity, hip-hop star or athlete.\n\n\nIt is not unusual for people to go to extreme lengths to get their hands on these rare models, queuing through the night. Examples include Nike Air Yeezy 2 Red October, and Air Jordan x 1 Off-White Chicago.\nThese shoes have a retail value of US$190 to US$240 and are reselling for between US$1,695 and US$6,118. The lucrative sneaker resale market has created a new cult of sneaker enthusiasts who through entrepreneurial spirit are generating significant hype along with personal income.\nFrom sport to fashion, sneakers dominate the consumer market. Yet, despite their adoption by the mainstream, sneakers retain their coolness as cultural icons.\nNaomi Braithwaite is Senior Lecturer in Fashion Marketing and Branding at Nottingham Trent University.

      Sneaker heads, Louis Vuitton has now unveiled a Nike Air Force 1 collab 
  </h1>, 'text': ""While at the helm of menswear at Louis Vuitton, designer Virgil Abloh has displayed a knack for blending luxury with streetwear. His latest collaboration? A collection of Nike Air Force 1 sneakers\xa0that are sure to fly off the shelves once they hit boutiques.\nThe shoes made their debut at Louis Vuitton’s Spring/Summer 2022 menswear show in Paris, streamed online on Jun 24. Portrayed as a short film titled Amen Break, the collection was showcased in an abstract retelling of rapper Lupe Fiasco’s martial arts background.\nA total of 21 colourways were showcased, including low\xa0and mid-top versions of the shoe. The panels of the shoes showcase Vuitton’s classic monogram prints. “AIR” with quotation marks are printed on the midsoles and “LACET” (the French word for laces) on the lace tips. The quotation marks are a signature of Abloh’s own brand Off-White.\nThe shoes also feature a small neon green\xa0tag on the side. On the tongue is a label with the\xa0Louis Vuitton\xa0name alongside the Nike swoosh.\nIn its show notes, Louis Vuitton said, “For Spring-Summer 2022, Virgil Abloh collaborates with Nike on bespoke Air Force 1s, fusing the trainer’s classic codes with the insignia and materials of Louis Vuitton in homage to the hip-hop culture that shaped him.”\nLouis Vuitton’s collaboration with Nike isn't much of a surprise. Abloh’s Nike collabs with his own label Off-White are incredibly popular.\nDetails of the Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force 1s, however, are still under wraps for now. When asked about the shoes’ release date, Abloh told fashion publication\xa0WWD, “Stay tuned for more details.”\xa0Our bets are that once released, this will be a hugely sought-after collection across the globe, rivalling that of 2020's Air Diors.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Introducing the world’s first four-faced watch, priced at a cool S$2.2m
  </h1>, 'text': 'Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Reverso watch is indubitably one of the most famous rectangular watches in existence, rivalled only by Cartier’s equally illustrious Tank. There are many reasons for its desirability, from its timeless Art Deco style to the multitudinous options available, but not the least of which is its ability to be reversed to reveal another face, bearing another dial, decoration or personalisation. What fun!\n\n\nThe first Reverso dates back to 1931, when a request from India for a watch that could be worn during polo matches led the manufacture to come up with its swivelling solution. By flipping the case over, the dial and glass could be protected. It is ironic then that there are now Reverso models so complex and delicate that they would barely be safe from a walk down a busy street.\nBut the tradeoff for safety is unbridled showmanship.\nAt this year’s Watches & Wonders, on the 90th anniversary of the Reverso, Jaeger-LeCoultre unveiled the Hybris Mechanica Calibre 185 Quadriptyque. With 11 complications, four faces and 12 patents following six years of development, this is the manufacture’s most ambitious Reverso yet.\n\n\nLet’s take it one dial at a time. The first face proudly displays the time with two blued hands, a flying tourbillon at 7 o’clock, and an instantaneous perpetual calendar. The latter means all the calendar indications – the big date at 5 o’clock, the windowed day and month in the centre, and the barely-there leap year at the far right corner – jump forward instantly at midnight.\nOn its flip side, it displays the same time (not to be confused for a second time zone) but through a digital jumping hour aperture and white minute track instead. The minutes are indicated by a red pointer mounted on a smoked sapphire disc. At the bottom you will be able to see the minute repeater’s gongs and hammers, and its governor at 9 o’clock. The repeater, which is activated by a slider above the crown, uses a number of the brand’s innovations that ensure a louder, clearer sound and removes pauses between chimes.\n\n\nThe third face rests inside the watch’s cradle, and is arguably the most interesting one. There is a laser-engraved moon phase at 12 o’clock as seen from the Northern Hemisphere, and it will not need correction for 1,111 years (the high watchmaking\xa0standard is 122.5 years). On the lower left portion of the dial is an indicator for the draconic cycle, which tracks upcoming solar and lunar eclipses;\xa0and on the right is the anomalistic cycle indicator, which shows us the moon’s current distance from the earth. Including the regular moon phase, which is also known as the synodic cycle, this is the first wristwatch to display all three cycles at once.\nFinally, the very back of the watch reveals another moon phase, this time as seen from the Southern Hemisphere, and below it is a star chart engraved on dark blue lacquer. As the case back reveals, this is a limited edition of only 10 pieces in white gold. Each one comes in a box that has a built-in, smart setting mechanism so the time, calendar and astronomical indications can all be easily and correctly adjusted no matter how many days have elapsed since it was last worn.\nConsidering the 800-part Calibre 185 takes watchmakers six months to assemble, the Quadriptyque’s €1.35 million (S$2.2 million) price tag seems painfully justified.\n\n\nA COMPLICATED ICON\nThe reason Jaeger-LeCoultre can achieve such mechanical proficiency (and such aspirational pricing) is because it has had a lot of practice pushing the boundaries of this tiny flippable watch. Here’s a quick look back at the Reverso’s most important, complicated pieces for an idea of how this expertise was refined for this year’s piece de resistance.\n1991 TO 2000: REVERSO COMPLICATIONS SERIES\nIt took another 60 years from its founding for the collection to start including complications. Before that, improvements were being made to the case, making it water-resistant and easier to swivel.\nThe first complicated model was the Reverso Soixantieme, a 500-piece limited edition for the collection’s 60th anniversary. It had an unusual central date hand, a power reserve indicator, and was the first to have a transparent case back.\nIt doesn’t sound like much, but the Soixantieme was really just the jumping off point for the entire Reverso Complications Series, where the brand’s goal was to create six complicated Reverso watches in a decade.\nWhat followed were the Reverso Tourbillon, Reverso Repetition Minutes, Reverso Chronographe Retrograde, Reverso Geographique and Reverso Quantieme Calendrier Perpetuel, with 500 of each example made.\n2006: REVERSO GRANDE COMPLICATION A TRIPTYQUE\nSome time between a two-faced Reverso and this year’s four-faced one, there was the Grande Complication a Triptyque.\nIt was released to celebrate the collection’s 75th anniversary and was also stuffed with complications: Tourbillon, sidereal time, sunrise and sunset indicators, equation of time, zodiac calendar and a star chart of either the Northern or Southern Hemispheres.\nIt used an ingenious mechanism to advance the watch’s many indications – if the watch was closed at midnight, a pin would extend out of the main case movement to trigger a pusher inside the cradle, thus advancing everything at the same time. This very same solution is used in the Quadriptyque.\n2008: REVERSO GYROTOURBILLON 2\nJaeger-LeCoultre’s magnificent example of a multi-axis tourbillon first debuted in the Gyrotourbillon 1 in the round Master case back in 2004, and then reappeared in the Gyrotourbillon 2 with an increased movement frequency of 4Hz, as well as a new cylindrical balance spring.\nThe tourbillon’s outer carriage would complete one rotation within a minute, while the inner carriage takes 18.75 seconds. A slimmed down version of the watch, known as the Reverso Tribute Gyrotourbillon, was introduced in 2016.\n2011: REVERSO REPETITION MINUTES A RIDEAU\nThis isn’t the loudest or thinnest chiming watch out there, but it is one that can only be executed in a Reverso. “Repetition minutes a rideau” roughly translates to “minute repeater via curtain”, and it is this venetian blind-style covering that sets this watch apart.\nSliding open the white gold curtain not only reveals the beautiful watch face, but also activates the repeater – a quirky feature meant to recall the curtains opening at an opera.\n2020: REVERSO TRIBUTE NONANTIEME\nThe Quadriptyque wasn’t the only watch created to celebrate this year’s anniversary. While not as mechanically expressive, the Reverso Tribute Nonantieme does have its own charm, and introduces a brand new display to the Reverso family.\nThe front has the classic offerings of a big date, moon phase and subsidiary seconds, but the watch’s second dial is a semi-digital jumping hours with minutes on a disc. A day/night indicator is beautifully rendered on a blue lacquer plate decorated with small golden stars, and the entire figure eight-shaped configuration is outlined with gadroons.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ']}"

      Post-pandemic joy: Men’s summer fashion for 2022 is a breath of fresh air
  </h1>, 'text': ""If you’re dreaming of days when you can leave your dreary sweatpants and loungewear behind (and we mean for good), those days are not too far away. At Milan Fashion Week, designers presented their menswear collections for Spring/Summer 2022 – a time when the dark days of isolation are (hopefully) far behind us.\nAfter the difficulties we’ve all been through, designers offered some form of escapism and freedom in their collections. Dark colours made way for lighter hues, constricted clothing gave way to heightened hems.\n\n\nPrada, for one, took its boys to the beach. In a show titled Tunnel to Joy, Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons explored a “utopia of normality”. In the collection film, models first walk through a red tunnel, before eventually emerging on a Mediterranean beach.\nThey’re dressed in romper suits, bucket hats (some with functional slits to hold sunglasses), knitted bibs, big shoulder bags, oversized blazers and swim-ready short shorts. It was a seamless transition from the indoors to the outdoors with clothes one might dream about wearing on one's next summer paradise trip, whenever that will be.\nAt Fendi, the Roman city landscape informed the collection’s colour palette. Earthy nudes featured alongside hints of neon, pink, grey and black. The midriff-baring cropped tops and jackets were a highlight (although this means shedding that pandemic belly bulge), paired with cargo shorts or low-rise trousers.\nDolce & Gabbana took a more dramatic approach. It held one of the few fashion shows that took place live, with a thousand-coloured lights illuminating the old Metropol cinema in Milan. Poplin shirts, knit sweaters and denim pants were embedded with crystals. These are clothes surely designed for life outside the house.\n\n\nA post shared by Dolce&Gabbana (@dolcegabbana)\nThe suit remained at the core of Brunello Cucinelli’s collection, albeit reinvented in a fresh and relaxed manner. With a neutral colour palette, single or double-breasted jackets are paired with roomy trousers. These suits are “synonymous of elegance, but not the Wall Street kind of business suit”, said Cucinelli. The collection also features denim jeans, suede vests, plaid shirts and knitted jackets, offering the flexibility to dress up or down.\nArmani on the other hand opted for a colour palette of navy and black, with pops of white, red and green. The collection – which featured trousers, sweaters, vests\xa0and button-up shirts – took inspiration from sportswear for a casual\xa0yet sophisticated feel.\xa0\n“The overall attitude is very light, because I think we have all learned to be informal and more relaxed in the way we dress. Reimagined, so it is no longer composed of a blazer and a pair of trousers,” Armani said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Men ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Easy styling hacks to hide those ‘man boobs’ by wearing the right clothes
  </h1>, 'text': 'Out of all the body hang-ups that guys are painfully conscious about, having man boobs is probably right up there on the list.\nFor those who have it, “moobs” pose a tough challenge when it comes to dressing oneself. Save for that baggy tee that looks like a sack, they show through most tops.\n\n\nWhile we are all for body positivity (yes, it’s not just a women’s thing), we’re not discounting the fact that some gentlemen may want to know how to choose clothes that can work around their heavier chest. And that inevitably means finding tops that can conceal or visually diminish it.\nGentlemen, if cardio and bench presses aren’t helping out much, there are quicker and easier methods you can use. Learn to achieve it by making smart wardrobe choices and employing visual illusions with the clothing you wear.\nWEAR DARKER COLOURS\nYou probably already know this – light colours will tend to emphasise the appearance of bulges. Which is why it’s best for you to stay away from white, bright and pastel colours, as these will do the opposite of concealing your chest.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that all you can wear is black. You can bring colour into your wardrobe by way of darker shades of all your favourite colours instead.\n\n\nCHOOSE THICK, MATTE FABRICS\nSoft fabrics that tend to drape, such as rayon and silk, will not flatter your physique. These will visually make bumps and bulges appear more prominent, even if the cut of your shirt is loose. Fabrics that have shine will have a similar visual effect, too, so stay away from tops that are made with them.\nLook out instead for stiffer, thicker, matte fabrics like cotton, poplin, broadcloth or linen, which won’t cling and, at the same time, offer form and structure.\n\n\nPICK PRINTS WISELY\nSome prints can actually help conceal moobs – there are no hard and fast rules as to which will do the job better, however.\nBefore a purchase, always try them on to see if they work for you – remember that the design may not look the same on you as it does on others or the model, as it depends on where the print sits on your body.\xa0\nThe same applies for repeated patterns like checks or plaids. You’ll need to be wary of stripes though, whether they be vertical or horizontal, as they can appear distorted depending on your body shape. They may appear warped across your chest or belly – basically anywhere that’s bulging – definitely not a look you’d want to wear.\nNOT TOO TIGHT, NOT TOO LOOSE\nFitted tops are a no-go for obvious reasons, but don’t size up your tees or shirts by too much either, as doing so will only make you look sloppy and shapeless. The key is to find a size that fits you nicely without hugging the areas that you don’t want people to notice.\nLAYER UP\nThe easiest way to conceal moobs? Cover them up with outerwear. Admittedly, it’s not always achievable in Singapore’s heat. But when rainy weather allows for it or if you know you’re going to be spending most of the time in air-conditioning, a jacket – whether formal or casual – can be a great style tool for you.\nStay away from knits like sweaters or cardigans though, as they are soft and tend to emphasise body bulges.\n\n\nTRY COMPRESSION UNDERSHIRTS\nSpanx for men – yes, it exists, and don’t mock it until you’ve tried it. A compression undershirt can work wonders for your physique while remaining invisible beneath your clothing.\nBesides holding in the chest area, it’ll sculpt and lift other bits of your torso as well, and instantly help smooth things out generally. You can find compression shirts by sportswear brands too – these work well as undershirts, too, even though they are intended for sports purposes.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Livestream sales of luxury items are popular in China, but not Singapore. Why?
  </h1>, 'text': 'With lockdowns and working from home now a way of life, it is no surprise that global e-commerce is experiencing an explosive growth. In particular, online sales via livestreams are booming, and nowhere is this more apparent than in one of the most digitally advanced markets in the world – China.\nFor the fashion world in particular, livestreaming is no longer perceived as a marketing tool for cheap brands selling at massive discounts. Its popularity has reached such feverish pitch that luxury brands can no longer afford to ignore it.\n\n\nThe potential is tremendous. According to Jing Daily, China bucked the global luxury market’s downhill trend by posting a phenomenal 48 per cent growth in 2020. As of December 2020, China’s livestreaming audience hit 617 million, an increase of 57 million users since March 2020. Of this, 388 million people have made purchases via livestreams compared to 300 million in 2019.\nSo 2020 became the year that luxury brands and retailers moved into the live broadcast arena. French luxury house Louis Vuitton hosted its first livestream on luxury retail application Little Red Book (Xiaohongshu); Net-a-Porter sold luxury bags with A-list Chinese influencer Mr Bags on Alibaba’s Taobao Live platform; Kering-owned Bottega Veneta’s collaboration with China’s “Lipstick King” Austin Li saw 230 Mini Pouch bags sold for 12,300 yuan (about S$2,550) each in 10 seconds; and Moncler is now directly managing its own e-commerce following a successful Weibo livestream for the 7 Moncler Fragment Hiroshi Fujiwara collection last July, which generated 32 million views in one day.\n\n\nWith such phenomenal results, why then is the use of livestreams for retailing luxury items trudging along in Singapore instead?\nMrs Florence Low, founder of luxury independent consignment platforms LuxLexicon and LuxCollate, cites a smaller land mass and proximity to the physical retail experience as key reasons why Singaporeans are only just warming up to the idea of livestream shopping.\n“[China’s] geographical vastness makes livestream shopping more appealing compared to a trudge to a physical store,” explained Low. “On the other hand, Singapore, with its small size and great transport infrastructure, means one can access the products in person in mere minutes, hence providing neither a push nor motivation for livestream shopping.”\nLuxLexicon focuses mainly on pre-loved and brand-new Hermes bags while LuxCollate retails other European luxury brands. During last year’s Circuit Breaker, Low started retailing the items live on Facebook and Instagram when LuxLexicon’s store at The Centrepoint was shut.\n“The main motivation at that time was to maintain a digital touchpoint with our customers and enhance their engagement with our brand. Also, lockdowns everywhere led to a massive increase in social media usage, and we wanted to capture and increase eyeballs to our social media feed with an improved, richer content,” said Low.\nHer livestreams average 300 viewers, with the highest attendance so far being 651 on June 6. The typical profile is female, either a professional or business owner, and aged between 30 and 50.\n\n\nDuncan White, the Asia-Pacific marketing head for Vestiaire Collective, a retail platform for pre-owned fashion, echoes similar observations. He said: “We have seen the growth in terms of the use of this channel for fast\xa0fashion and FMCG products and more recently began to also see it as an avenue for higher price point items. However, this is still at the\xa0relatively early stages.\n“Singapore as a market is also defined by proximity, with luxury retail locations being easily accessible to consumers to\xa0interact with the product at any time they want. The notion of using live commerce as a platform for luxury would also then serve to build\xa0product awareness as opposed to purchase conversion.”\nSo far, Vestiaire has done livestreams only for the Hong Kong market, where it works with influencer hosts to retail bags, shoes and accessories. But there are plans to host one for Singapore “in the upcoming months” said White.\nThere are pros and cons to livestreaming, he added. While it may be an attractive interactive shopping experience where popular hosts talk through the specifications and conditions of the pre-loved items, and offer styling tips, viewership can vary depending on interest level in the topic and pre-event publicity efforts.\n“As products still have a relatively higher sale point, users may still prefer to view the product in person before making a purchase\xa0decision, Also, each item is a unique piece, so there needs to be a balance in terms of ensuring a good breadth of products to counter\xa0user fatigue for a\xa0better return on investment.”\n\n\nStyle Theory, Southeast Asia’s largest circular fashion platform offering rental, resale, consignment and restoration services for design apparel and bags, has held livestreams in-store with hosts such as beauty influencers Drea Chong and Cheryl Wee and later on Instagram.\nCo-founder and chief operating officer Raena Lim said: “We found that what worked for our personality-led livestreams pre-COVID-19 was the high levels of immediate audience-host interaction, and the potential for hosting post-livestream fringe [physical] events that would bolster RSVP interest and set the stage for higher engagement at future virtual or physical events.\n“With our livestreams on Instagram, there is tremendous potential for further innovation in content and format, especially as platforms themselves roll out new features to enable seamless streaming and collaboration.""\nLim finds that her experiences with customers in Singapore and Indonesia have been “promising because of the openness of these consumer markets” and the credibility the brand has built over the years. The audience tends to be 85 per cent female in the age range of 25 to 40 years old.\nLim said: “As an established resale platform for luxury bags in Southeast Asia, we are also able to offer our livestream customers interest-free payments plans and a competitive returns policy, giving shoppers the ability to purchase high quality, high-value bags through livestreams with confidence.\n“We\'ve seen different levels of engagement across the different formats, but typically with the addition of a KOL [key opinion leader] or online personality, viewership is higher – sometimes in the four-digit range – as we are able to tap into their following as well.”\nLouis Vuitton’s Little Red Book debut was compared with other Taobao rooms selling discounted fast fashion, while Dior’s broadcasts have drawn flak for boring conversations and a lack of diversity. The path to ringing tills is not smooth-lined, but paved with considerations on technicalities, brand exclusivity and identity, and audience affinity.\nOne of the benefits of livestreaming is its ability to bring a product to life in a more experiential way, said Net-a-Porter’s chief marketing officer Sheena Sauvaire. “[Customers] can see details of the products close-up, hear about the brand story, ask questions live and see how our editors style each piece. As the stream is in the site, when customers are more developed in the purchase path, it has a greater propensity to drive product sales.”\nOn the other hand, LuxLexicon’s Low feels that a physical store is “still better in creating that dimension of human touch and warmth and providing an immersive brand experience for shoppers, more so for luxury retail given the need to touch and feel a physical item.”\nLuxury brands are thus likely to tread the livestream ground cautiously until they’ve a solid strategy in blending offline and online touchpoints, such that one inspires confidence to purchase high-priced items in the other.\nStyle Theory’s Lim said: “Livestreaming, especially when live product reviews or styling elements are introduced, helps to bridge the gap between shopping online and trying it in person. It lends itself particularly well to luxury retail as it can provide an interactive, personalised experience that shoppers seek when booking private viewings in offline spaces. This closes the loop for them when it comes to shopping for luxury online.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     China ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     e-commerce ']}"

      Malaysian fashion designers talk candidly about staying in fashion during the pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': ""It’s been a turbulent year, to put it lightly, for fashion. Not only has the pandemic changed the way people shop for clothes, it’s also affected what we shop for. With demand for loungewear being at an all-time high, we find out what happens when fashion designers renowned for creating occasion wear have no occasions to design for.\n\n\nALIA BASTAMAM\nRenowned for her sensual gowns which celebrate the female form, Alia Bastamam’s designs are the favourite\xa0of celebrities and socialites. Just this year, mega-influencer Neelofa and top model Alicia Amin chose Bastamam’s gowns for their weddings.\n\n\nA post shared by Neelofa (@neelofa)\nSince forsaking a career in architecture for fashion design, Bastamam has established her own atelier creating made-to-order pieces and a ready-to-wear label called Alia B, which was launched two weeks before the lockdown last year and saved the fashion house during the 2020 Hari Raya season.\nEven though the pandemic has affected not one but two festive seasons, the designer remains optimistic.\n“Despite the challenges and restrictions faced during the pandemic, we’ve kept our momentum by churning out key collections for both our brands with a\xa0focus in digitalising our reach and, in turn, our sales. Sales were up 30 per cent in 2021, with the Eid collections for both our brands selling beyond our expectations,” she said.\nAdapting to this new normal, Bastamam revealed that her design approach has changed: “Instead of statement pieces for the runway, I’ve been creating more wearable looks that are versatile and functional in terms of everyday lifestyles, all while staying true to my resort aesthetic which is already apt for the current situation.”\nGoing forward, Bastamam resolves to continue honing her signature: “We have plans to create more Resort collections that will expand the distribution channels to captivate the luxe traveller market, locally and internationally, in the hopeful future.”\n“Despite the challenges and restrictions faced during the pandemic, we’ve kept our momentum by churning out key collections for both our brands.” –\xa0 Alia Bastamam\n\n\nKHOON HOOI\nKnown for his fine tailoring and exquisite use of fabrics, Lee Khoon Hooi – known simply as Khoon Hooi –\xa0has been one of the leading lights in the Malaysian fashion industry since starting his fashion house in 1999.\nThe celebrated designer, whose spin on traditional kebayas and qipaos during the festive seasons are hotly anticipated, also has a global reach with clients from West Asia.\nWith local and international travel being the exception rather than the norm nowadays, Khoon Hooi’s business has taken quite a hit. “Although we’ve performed well for the local festive bespoke market,\xa0the recovery will not be evenly felt across this year with the interstate closures.\n“On the international wholesale front, sales performance\xa0has\xa0become extremely rocky as a result of disrupted supply chains and cancelled orders,” he revealed. “Consumers are adjusting to their new life indoors and\xa0are\xa0not shopping for\xa0occasion wear.\xa0That consumer sentiment is reflected in the decline of sales, especially in our Middle East market.”\xa0\nHowever the designer credits the quick adaptability of his team to helping the business hold steady – whether it’s making the best of existing resources or adjusting their capabilities in the current environment.\nAn example of this is the birth of a lifestyle collection of up-cycled fabrics from the brand’s archive that would have otherwise\xa0gone into the landfill. These easy to wear contemporary separates come in accessible price points for the\xa0“masstige” market.\nWhile the designer continues to come up with feasible strategies to keep his brand going, he recognises that this lull in business is a good time to explore in-depth research: “We would like to be more data-driven, by understanding our target market, consumer preference and social media trends.\n“[We want to create] pieces consumers are most likely to purchase and at the same time innovate with a direction. I hope that we continue to be\xa0creative and original and work well in a team that allows for self-expression.”\xa0\n\n\nMELINDA LOOI\nMalaysia’s doyenne of fashion design, the irrepressible, multi-award winning Melinda Looi\xa0marks her 20th year in the industry this year.\nWhen the pandemic hit Malaysia hard in March 2020, Looi, who runs various labels and an interior design arm while juggling six children, spearheaded MODAforFrontliners, which mobilised fashion designers into sewing much-needed Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the country's medical front-liners.\nOn the business front, Looi is frank about how tough it’s been. “Our focus is on occasion wear and there were not many events and hardly any weddings so we had months where we lost up to 70 per cent of our monthly revenue. We made adjustments to our offerings but it will still remain as one of the reddest years in the books,” she said.\nHowever going forward, Looi says they’ve made three mains changes: In product offerings with face masks and more casual wear; in distribution by pushing e-commerce; and in marketing, which has become more personable while at the same time being 95 per cent digital.\xa0\nThis being so, Looi longs to go back to her couture roots: “As a designer, I wish to focus on my couture line. Bring back the glory days of high fashion. As a business we are still in the middle of rebuilding and re-strategising, we have implemented some measures but implementation of changes are far from over, and you are never certain what will happen next anyway.”\n\n\nSYOMIRIZWA GUPTA\nIndian-Indonesian designer Syomir Izwa is the creative director of his hip label, the name being a homage to his birth name, Syomir Izwa Sen-Gupta.\nThe designer, who shot to fame designing modest-yet-edgy stage wear for superstar Yuna, has also found success commercially with commissions from online retail companies like Zalora.\nLast year was significant for the brand as it saw the launch of Gupta Homme, a line of menswear in collaboration with corporate magnate, Datuk Wira SM\xa0Faisal\xa0SM\xa0Nasimuddin. But this was a bright spot in an otherwise muted year.\n“It was such a challenging year, especially for business owners with limited resources. Our physical sales dropped 40 per cent, however, we managed to gain back with our online sales, which we recently developed through our website that was launched in August last year. We have been maintaining that ever since,” stated Izwa.\nTo adapt, Izwa explains that they had to pivot from depending on Hari Raya or weddings for a significant chunk of their income to being creative and exploring what the brand can offer.\n“With this challenging time, brands, especially designer labels, became more aware of what society needs. There is more consciousness with every campaign and product or collection\xa0produced during this period,” he stated.\n“We also downsized our team and since the only way to move forward is to be digital, we had to adapt and pre-plan everything in advance as we are fully operating online now! Another beautiful thing that happened from this was the willingness of different brands to work together embracing collaborative projects.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Pandemic ']}"

      The Singaporean jeweller whose fashionable mum inspired her love of style
  </h1>, 'text': ""Certified gemologist and designer Alexandra Alberta Yeo founded her eponymous jewellery brand in 2010 and quickly made a name for herself in London, where she was based at the time.\nOver the last decade, Yeo, a Singaporean who has lived and worked in both the US\xa0and\xa0UK, has been heralded as a designer to watch. In 2014, the Alexandra Alberta Baroque Collection was named one of the Top 5 Emerging Designer Collections in the United Kingdom by the very industry-respected Professional Jeweller Magazine.\nFashionistas, influencers and media alike note Yeo's ability to combine playfulness and whimsy with sophistication and elegance.\nHaving moved home a few years ago, she is hard at work designing new collections as well as improving her brand’s online presence, embracing the reality that e-commerce is very much the future of retail.\nDID YOU ALWAYS KNOW YOU WANTED TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL THINGS?\nWhen I was little, my mother had many pretty things, namely, jewellery from brands like Givenchy and Chanel that she would buy on her trips to Paris and Italy.\nMy mother was a fashion buyer, so she has excellent taste. She had this beautiful box of jewels of many different colours, and I would take them out every day and admire them. I was so lucky. She would buy me very unique, cute clothing from Paris. During my free time at home, I loved to style myself with her beautiful jewellery and clothing, sometimes scarves and things.\nSo, yes, from a young age, I was very fortunate to be exposed to beautiful things. Because of that, I think my sister and I grew to love beautiful things. That definitely inspired me to create jewellery that I hope people see as beautiful.\nYOU WORKED AT SOME GREAT LUXURY BRANDS WHEN YOU STARTED YOUR CAREER. WHAT LESSONS DID YOU LEARN FROM YOUR EXPERIENCES THERE THAT YOU HAVE CARRIED OVER TO YOUR OWN BUSINESS?\nI have\xa0been fortunate\xa0to have lived in Los Angeles and New York, both during college and when I started my career. I spent my summers and time after college working for designers and fashion houses I admire and love: Rag & Bone, Opening Ceremony and Lanvin.\xa0 What I learnt from these amazing creative companies is that it is really important to form relationships with your clients.\nI also learnt that it is really important to sharpen one’s design vision, and be really clear about the brand’s ethos.\nWHEN AND WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO MOVE INTO JEWELLERY?\nI moved into jewellery after working at some fashion jobs. I felt that my interest really was focused on jewellery. I felt that my forte and passion had always been in accessories. As a student growing up, I’d always get caught for over-accessorising! So, after a few stints in fashion, I enrolled at the Gemological Institute of America in New York.\nAND WHAT DOES ONE LEARN THERE? HOW DOES ONE TRAIN TO BE BOTH A GEMOLOGIST AND A JEWELLER?\nTraining to be a gemologist, you have to complete coursework in both Diamonds and Coloured Stones. Mine was done at GIA New York but there are other schools offering this programme. I also went on to do training in jewellery design at Central Saint Martins as well as at the GIA in London for technical drawings. I would say the Gemology courses are challenging. Gemology is a science that is about accuracy and precision. So, you need to score 100 per cent for your tests. Any less is not accepted.\nDID YOU ALREADY HAVE A PLAN FOR ALEXANDRA ALBERTA WHEN GOING THROUGH YOUR GIA COURSES?\nNo, I did not. But prior to graduation, my best friend’s boyfriend approached me to custom-make an engagement ring for her. It was a pink kunzite spodumene, pink tourmaline and diamond ring.\nWorking on that first commission prompted me to start my own business. The decision to start the business came quite naturally. It was an easy one actually.\nHOW DO YOU DEFINE THE STYLE OF YOUR PIECES?\nI would say the style of my pieces is whimsical and edgy.\nI am inspired by architecture, nature and unusual colour palettes. I like to find inspiration in the details. As I said earlier, I’ve loved jewellery since I was a child and channel this youthful love into my designs as well.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU TO DATE BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESS?\nWell, I would say just having amazing people believing in me enough to commission me to create unique and special pieces for them. I also really enjoy re-creating and rejuvenating their pre-loved pieces, injecting new and fresh life into them.\xa0\nAdditionally, seeing my jewellery pieces physically in stores, and now online with amazing retail partners, is definitely very gratifying.\nAND WHAT WAS THE TOUGHEST OBSTACLE YOU HAD TO OVERCOME?\nThe initial few years was the toughest. I had to build everything from scratch. No one prepares an entrepreneur for just how much you have to do yourself. But it’s all worth it in the end.\nI UNDERSTAND YOU’RE BACK IN SINGAPORE NOW. ARE YOU BACK PERMANENTLY OR JUST DURING THE PANDEMIC?\nI’m back in Singapore permanently now after living in Los Angeles, New York and London. It’s great to be home.\nWHAT, IF YOU HAD TO SINGLE OUT CERTAIN PIECES, ARE YOUR HERO PRODUCTS?\nMy Khrysler Earrings are definitely iconic to my brand. They are strongly inspired by the Art Deco era.\xa0They are from the METROPOLIS collection. The EXOTICA durian earrings also are special as they are a tongue-in-cheek representation of Southeast Asia. That first ring I made for my best friend is still a very special piece for me. First, it was for my best friend and second, it helped catalyse my company (into being).\nThere are other great pieces I am proud of, such as a rare 8-carat flawless ceylon sapphire encrusted with diamonds, and my multi-gem pastel shade earrings mixed in with diamonds.\nWHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS BESPOKE?\nAbout 40 per cent of my business is bespoke. I really enjoy the process of making something unique for a customer. It’s a little more personal. I love getting to know clients, learning about them and what defines their style.\nWHAT, IN YOUR OPINION, DEFINES LUXURY?\nLuxury is being able to have something unique, something well-made, something long-lasting.\nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS?\nWe have placed more effort into revamping our website as\xa0– and I am sure most people would agree\xa0– the Web is the future. However, I still believe in in-store products. Something like jewellery sometimes needs to be touched and tried on.\nANY COOL PLANS FOR THE YEAR YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE?\nYes, I have some new collections that I will be launching. And I am working on a new sustainable concept. Stay tuned.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     Culture & Trends ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Victoria's Secret swaps Angels for female empowerment – will women buy it?
  </h1>, 'text': ""The Victoria’s Secret Angels, those avatars of Barbie bodies and playboy reverie, are gone. Their wings, fluttery confections of rhinestones and feathers that could weigh almost 30 pounds, are gathering dust in storage. The “Fantasy Bra”, dangling real diamonds and other gems, is no more.\nIn their place are seven women famous for their achievements and not their proportions. They include Megan Rapinoe, the 35-year-old pink-haired soccer star and gender equity campaigner; Eileen Gu, a 17-year-old Chinese American freestyle skier and soon-to-be Olympian; the 29-year-old biracial model and inclusivity advocate Paloma Elsesser, who was the rare size 14 woman on the cover of Vogue; and Priyanka Chopra Jonas, a 38-year-old Indian actor and tech investor.\nThey will be spearheading what may be the most extreme and unabashed attempt at a brand turnaround in recent memory: An effort to redefine the version of “sexy” that Victoria’s Secret represents (and sells) to the masses. For decades, Victoria’s Secret’s scantily clad supermodels with Jessica Rabbit curves epitomised a certain widely accepted stereotype of femininity. Now, with that kind of imagery out of step with the broader culture and Victoria’s Secret facing increased competition and internal turmoil, the company wants to become, its CEO said, a leading global “advocate” for female empowerment.\nWill women buy it? An upcoming spinoff, more than US$5 billion (S$6.7 billion) in annual sales, and 32,000 jobs in a global retail network that includes roughly 1,400 stores are riding on the answer.\nIt is a stark change for a brand that not only long sold lingerie in the guise of male fantasy, but has also been scrutinised heavily in recent years for its owner’s relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and revelations about a misogynistic corporate culture that trafficked in sexism, sizeism and ageism.\n“When the world was changing, we were too slow to respond,” said Martin Waters, former head of Victoria’s Secret’s international business who was appointed CEO of the brand in February. “We needed to stop being about what men want and to be about what women want.”\nThe seven women, who form a group called the VS Collective, will alternately advise the brand, appear in ads and promote Victoria’s Secret on Instagram. They are joining a company that has an entirely new executive team and is forming a board of directors in which all but one seat will be occupied by a woman.\nRarely has a company so dominant in its sector been exposed as trailing so far behind the culture as Victoria’s Secret was in the wake of the #MeToo movement.\nIt was, Rapinoe said bluntly, “patriarchal, sexist, viewing not just what it meant to be sexy but what the clothes were trying to accomplish through a male lens and through what men desired. And it was very much marketed toward younger women.” That message, she said, was “really harmful.”\nVictoria’s Secret’s cultural influence is a product of its industry standing. Though the company’s share of the US women’s underwear market dropped to 21 per cent last year from 32 per cent in 2015, according to Euromonitor International, it is still a powerhouse. Its next closest competitor is Hanesbrands, with a 16 per cent share.\nFounded in 1977 as a store where men could feel comfortable shopping for lingerie, even the name referred to male fantasies of prim Victorian ladies who became naughty in the boudoir. Retail billionaire Leslie H Wexner bought Victoria’s Secret in 1982 and turned it into a phenomenon that helped shape society’s view of female sexuality and beauty ideals. Central to its ethos were the “Angels”\xa0– supermodels like Heidi Klum and Tyra Banks who posed exclusively for the brand, often in G-strings, stilettos and wings. In 1995, it introduced the Victoria’s Secret fashion show, a sort of cross between a runway show and a pole dance that aired on network television for nearly two decades.\nIt has taken years for Victoria’s Secret to acknowledge that its marketing was dated. In that time, the value of the brand eroded and a slew of competitors grew in part by positioning themselves as the anti-Victoria’s Secret, complete with more typical women’s bodies and a focus on inclusivity and diversity.\nThe brand has also come under fire after Wexner’s close ties to Epstein came to light in 2019 and a New York Times investigation last year showed that Wexner and his former chief marketing officer, Ed Razek, presided over an entrenched culture of misogyny, bullying and harassment.\n“I’ve known that we needed to change this brand for a long time, we just haven’t had the control of the company to be able to do it,” Waters said. As for the Angels? “Right now, I don’t see it as being culturally relevant,” he said.\nRazek and Wexner will not be a part of the new Victoria’s Secret, which will split from L Brands and Bath & Body Works to become its own public company this summer. (The pandemic scuttled a sale to a private-equity firm and swallowed US$2 billion in revenue.) There are more women in charge, including a new chief marketing officer, Martha Pease, who has led the Collective initiative. The stores that survived a year of culling are becoming lighter and brighter, and mannequins\xa0– which have typically been a size 32B\xa0– will come in new shapes and sizes. The Angels imagery, which once even appeared on store bathroom TVs, will be phased out. The company will still sell products like thongs and lacy lingerie but its purview will expand, especially in areas like sportswear.\n“In the old days, the Victoria brand had a single lens, which was called ‘sexy,’” Waters said. While that sold for decades, it also prevented the brand from offering products like maternity or post-mastectomy bras (not considered sexy) and prompted it to sell push-up sports bras (sexy, but not so popular). It also meant, he said, “that the brand never celebrated Mother’s Day.” (Not sexy.)\nThere are plenty of people who do, in fact, find motherhood seductive, but the myopia of the Victoria’s Secret lens was such that they were never acknowledged, let alone listened to.\n“As a gay woman, I think a lot about what we think is sexy, and we are afforded the ability to do that, because I don’t have to wear the traditional sexy thing to be sexy and I don’t think the traditional thing is sexy when it comes to my partner or people I’ve dated,” said Rapinoe. “I think functionality is probably the sexiest thing we could possibly achieve in life. Sometimes just cool is sexy too.”\nVictoria’s Secret, which did finally introduce a Mother’s Day campaign last month and even featured a pregnant model, will soon begin selling nursing bras. It also said it would work with its new partners like Rapinoe and Chopra Jonas on product lines set to appear next spring.\nWhile it was “probably time for the Angels to go,” the lingerie powerhouse will have to strike a balance between moving forward and maintaining existing customers, said Cynthia Fedus-Fields, former CEO of the Victoria’s Secret division responsible for its catalog.\n“If it was a US$7 billion business pre-COVID, and much of that US$7 billion was built on this blatant sexy approach, be careful with what you’re doing,” she said.\nAccording to Raul Martinez, who joined as creative director in January, every aspect of the brand is being reconsidered.\n“It has to have a purpose, a reason, be there for the consumer to say: 'Wow, they’re really evolving,'” he said, acknowledging that it was his 15-year-old daughter who convinced him to join Victoria’s Secret. “She said, ‘Dad. Do it for us. The Gen Zs’,” he recalled.\nStill, the question remains: Why would women like Rapinoe and Chopra Jonas want to risk their names by placing their stamp of credibility on Victoria’s Secret? The line between selling out and infiltrating from within can be hard to discern.\n“Of course there will be people who are like, ‘Does this make sense?’” said Rapinoe, who acknowledged that when she was first approached, “I, too, was like ‘What? Why do you want to work with me?’” She said she had been convinced by the willingness of the brand’s executives to acknowledge their mistakes and history, and by the fact that her role is not limited to the typical “brand ambassadorship,” but extends to consulting on language the company uses, the assortment of products it offers and narrative it’s putting out.\nElsesser said her decision to join Victoria’s Secret “goes back to the sheer metrics of the situation.”\n“I didn’t start modelling to just do all the cool stuff; I did it to change the world,” she said. “With platforms like VS, where you enter the living rooms of all people, that’s where you make radical change.” She saw part of her role as lobbying for Victoria’s Secret to increase their sizing to XXXXXL, she said. (It currently carries up to 42G in bras and XXL in nightwear.)\nThe VS Collective also includes Valentina Sampaio, a Brazilian trans model; Adut Akech, a model and South Sudanese refugee; and Amanda de Cadenet, photographer and founder of #Girlgaze, the digital platform for female photographers. All of them, in the words of Rapinoe, are people who were not “typical brand targets in the past.” As for the fashion show, Waters said it would most likely return in 2022 in a very different form. What the brand will offer soon is a podcast featuring the women in the collective, a medium that requires no visuals.\n“To rebrand is going to take a lot of steps to ensure that they have the consumer trust, that this isn’t just inclusivity-washing,” said Erin Schmidt, a senior analyst at Coresight Research.\nVictoria’s Secret is betting a chunk of its marketing budget that persuading such unexpected personalities to join their cause will in turn convince consumers, and potential investors, to similarly believe in its shift, giving a new meaning to halo effect.\nAs Rapinoe said, “I don’t know if Victoria has a secret anymore.”\nBy Sapna Maheshwari and Vanessa Friedman © 2021 The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/business/victorias-secret-collective-megan-rapinoe.html\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Culture & Trends ', ""     Women's Style "", '     celebrity ']}"

      Singapore designers turn to loungewear, the pandemic's sleeper fashion trend
  </h1>, 'text': 'It took a bleary-eyed glance in the bathroom mirror for entrepreneur Nora Lim to come to an epiphany.\n“Stirring from a night of interrupted sleep, I did not feel good when I saw myself in my husband’s old t-shirt and my tattered shorts,” Lim said. “As a mother, my time for rest had clearly become an afterthought – although I knew that rest and starting my day right is important especially to my mental and emotional wellbeing.”\nThis realisation inspired her to think about coming up with more appropriate apparel. Together with co-founder Heng Juit Wen, they designed and launched Selenightco, a sleep- and loungewear brand comprising a range of pyjamas, camisoles and kimonos.\nWhile the concept of loungewear – or PJs – is not new, it has only been in recent years that this category of clothing has become more attractive to both designers and customers alike.\nFrom mass brands like Love, Bonito to independent labels such as Beddoni, Perk By Kate and Bells & Birds, there are now many Singapore-based brands offering various loungewear options.\nKate Low, founder of loungewear and lingerie label Perk By Kate, said the concepts of self-care and hygge (a Danish term for “cosy”), which were popularised in the last few years, were a key driving force behind the newfound love for loungewear.\n“No one can effectively recharge with mess all around at home, so it takes a conscious effort to declutter, to fill your personal space with objects that spark joy, create your very own sanctuary, and then put on the right clothing to help you fully immerse in that restorative process,” said Low.\n\n\nThe pandemic and the resultant work from home measures have further cemented loungewear as a staple in a woman’s wardrobe. And in the past year, the concept has evolved into multi-functional and versatile outfits to be worn not just for sleep but throughout the day.\n“Women are paying more attention and demanding more from their loungewear. There are blurred lines in physical and mental spaces for work, play and rest. Understandably, there are blurred lines with what we wear too,” said Heng of Selenightco.\n“People who are working from home also want something more presentable other than their old\xa0T-shirt and shorts. Something that they can look good and feel good in, plus take them from Zoom call to nap in seconds.”\nDemand for such pieces is certainly on the rise, with sales in the loungewear category doubling over the past year, the founders said.\nMany women treat their pieces, which come in comfortable materials such as breathable cotton and indulgent silk, as resort wear. For instance, a smart piped pyjama top will look chic when paired with jeans or gold toned accessories like hoop earrings. Or else, a kimono can be quickly thrown over T-shirts or slip dresses when one has to answer the door or accept an urgent Zoom video call.\nNow that stylish loungewear has become an essential part of many women’s wardrobes, brands expect them to remain a staple even after the pandemic is long over.\nAmanda Koh, founder and designer of Bells & Birds, observed: “It is now common to share life’s daily moments on Instagram – and this includes an emphasis on #metime and #selflove. And when we can travel freely again, people will take their Instagrammable loungewear pieces with them on their trips, too.”\n\n\nFeel like slipping into something comfy and trendy too? Here are the most popular styles from six Singapore labels to check out.\nPERK BY KATE\xa0LUCIE LOW-BACK DRESS, S$109\nMade in elegant matte satin, this low-back lounge dress\xa0might look ultra-dressy but scores high on the comfort factor, too, thanks to its elegant drapes. Plus, with slip dresses all the rage now, this piece can also double up as a slinky number for your next big night out.\nhttps://www.perkbykate.com/\nSELENIGHTCO\xa0THE SIGNATURE PYJAMAS SET, S$118\nThe quirky dandelion print of this eco-friendly PJ set\xa0(it’s made from Tencel and viscose fabrics) is a cool conversation starter for stilted Zoom meetings or even chance encounters with acquaintances when you drop by the nearby supermarket to pick up groceries.\xa0\nAnd when it is bedtime, think of the soothing, floating motion of dandelions to lull yourself gently to sleep.\nhttps://www.selenightco.com/\n\n\nBEDDONI\xa0ISABELLE DRESS, S$125\nLightweight and roomy, this pillow soft rayon kaftan\xa0oozes easy breezy style.

      Southeast Asian shoppers are now buying more luxury goods on Zalora
  </h1>, 'text': 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, luxury shopping\xa0thrived online. Just by sitting in the comfort of their homes, consumers could shop from a wide range of luxury retailers, carting out with a simple click of a button.\nFor shoppers, e-commerce sites such as Farfetch, Net-A-Porter and MatchesFashion are some of the most popular. But Zalora, a Southeast Asian online fashion and lifestyle destination, is now emerging as a contender in the luxury e-commerce space.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nSince its introduction in 2020, luxury has been the fastest growing category among Zalora’s offerings. At the end of 2020, around its 10.10 and 11.11 sales, the platform reported strong numbers of luxury and premium purchases. Since then, the category has been one of the fastest-growing segments with unique customers outperforming others by ten times, Zalora said in a press release.\nWhile Zalora’s main customer base consists of those in the 25-to-35 age group, unique luxury buyers are mostly aged 36 and up. Though all of Zalora’s markets saw an increase in luxury interest, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines reported the most significant growth. There was a noticeable interest in bags, wallets and shoes.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nIt’s a trend that can be attributed to a new landscape for e-commerce in the region. Evolving demographics and a rising middle class “make Southeast Asia ripe for the business of luxury”, Zalora said. Shoppers are more mobile-savvy and connected, while brands have moved quickly to adopt e-commerce in the face of the pandemic.\nZalora’s Luxury section features brands such as\xa0Balenciaga, Burberry, Celine,\xa0Gucci,\xa0Prada and Saint Laurent. Items include bags, shoes, jewellery, watches, sunglasses and more.\n“As shoppers continue to prioritise quality over quantity, and look for ways to invest in more high-value items that provide superior quality as well as the best after-sale satisfaction, we expect that interest in luxury products will continue to grow in the long term. We will continue strengthening our relationships with our brand partners, and expanding our luxury and premium international brand offering,” said Eric Cheang, Buying Director at Zalora.\nZalora is now hosting its inaugural Luxury Festival, happening till Jun 20. Over 6,000 items from brands such as Balenciaga, Burberry, Chloe, Gucci,\xa0Prada and more are now on sale.

      Is vegan leather more durable than animal leather? Should you switch?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Handbag collectors alert! At Senreve’s stylish pastel-hued pop-up store at Takashimaya Shopping Centre, a rainbow coloured array of leather arm candies are tantalisingly displayed, beckoning the bag lady to pick up one – or eight.\n\n\nBesides the attractive range of colours, the bags by the Instagram-famous American brand, which is favoured by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Kristen Bell, come in a variety of leather textures. These include leathers with a sturdy pebbled grain and an embossed crocodile pattern.\nThere is also a range of vegan leather bags that are practically indistinguishable from animal leather. For those who have long associated faux leather with the squeaky and non-durable PVC pleather of yore, this new alternative leather will come as a revelation – and might even convince some to invest in more consciously made luxury products. Not only does Senreve’s vegan leather pretty much look and feel like the real deal, it is also resistant to scratches, stains and water, ideal for the modern woman on the go.\n“We decided to create luxury vegan products three years ago because there were a lot of women in our community who wanted to have more of an animal-free vegan lifestyle. That includes what they eat and the products they use on a daily basis,” said Senreve founder and CEO Coral Chung.\nThese days, being environmentally conscious is luxe. In recent years, major fashion brands like Armani, Gucci and\xa0Versace\xa0have pledged to go fur-free. Some luxury brands are also beginning to invest in developing and using animal-free leather in a bid to challenge long-held notions that only animal leathers are worth the price tag. Besides synthetic materials, other forms of vegan leather can be made from plant-based matter, such as pineapples, apples, cacti, corks and mushrooms.\nCase in point: Cartier and Hermes have recently launched new products made with plant-based leather.\nCartier’s latest Tank Must watch collection includes models that have non-animal vegan straps made from apples grown for the food industry.\nFor its autumn/winter 2021 collection, Hermes unveiled a new version of its Victoria bag that is made with Sylvania, a mushroom-based material made in collaboration with Californian start-up MycoWorks. This sustainable leather, which has been tanned and finished in France by Hermes’s tanners to refine its strength and durability, has an amber hue and natural patina that many have come to associate with the brand’s animal leathers.\n\n\nCloser to home, handbag designer Ethan Koh is currently developing a vegan leather made from a plant species from Brazil and he hopes to be able to announce more details later this year.\nBut while it is easy enough to jump on the vegan bandwagon for the feel-good factor, it is also worth asking if buying alternative leathers are indeed that much better for the environment. The answer, it turns out, is that it is complicated.\nWhile vegan leathers do score high on the cruelty-free factor since animals are not killed for their production, there are detractors who say that alternative leather materials can also lead to a certain amount of environmental damage.\nWhether they are made from plastics or plant-based materials, vegan leathers require the use of water and energy to process to create the look and feel of animal leather. Plus, leathers made of plastic generally take years to break down and could release toxic chemicals in the environment, such as microplastic contamination in water and the food chain.\n\n\nA post shared by SINBONO.COM (@sinbono_official)\n\n\nNevertheless, the Environmental Profit & Loss sustainability report by luxury conglomerate Kering finds that the impact of vegan leather production can be up to a third lower than real leather.\nFor independent designer Jyoti Singh, creative director and founder of Singapore brand Jo Kilda, these considerations were important factors in her design process.\n“I have always loved the stylish, edgy and luxurious look of leather but could never get myself to own one,” she said. It was only when she discovered PU (a type of plastic) leather, which she says both looks and feels good to touch, that she was convinced to take the plunge.\n“There are several factors to consider when evaluating both vegan and animal leather options: Animal welfare is our utmost priority along with care for the people making products for us, as well as waste, greenhouse gas emission, water usage, just to name a few,” she said.\nThis material is used in her signature range of vegan leather apparel, which includes pleated skirts that are technically difficult to execute. The collection, which she launched in 2018 at New York Fashion Week, ranks among her most popular, making the challenges of using vegan leather such as sourcing for the right material, well worth the effort.\nSenreve’s Chung agrees that there are a different set of challenges to overcome in using this relatively new material compared to regular leather. The brand’s vegan leather was created using a complex blend of man-made synthetic materials that are treated to imitate many of the qualities valued in luxury leather goods such as durability, texture and suppleness. It took the brand 18 months of development together with its tannery partners to ensure they achieved the quality they wanted.\nShe also made it a point to ensure the eco-friendliness of the production process. “It was critical for us that all of the materials, components and dyes were all vegan, not from animal or animal byproducts. We also as much as possible want to use materials that are eco-friendly, biodegradable and recyclable as well,” Chung added.\nThey also had to work with partners and factories that were typically more used to working with animal leather. “They had to understand how the materials would interact with the hand-painted edge paint, how durable it was, the tensile strength and many other factors that were new and different,” she said.\nThis summer, to cater to the ever growing demand for vegan products, Senreve is introducing a new cactus leather material which has a softer and more supple quality, making it suitable for new bag silhouettes that are less structured and more lightweight.\nBest of all, the cactus leather is not only guilt-free, it is also good for the environment. Chung said, “We like that it’s plant-based, and also the cactus plants regenerate and capture carbon from the atmosphere as they grow.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Grand designs: the refugees in Paris with an eye on fashion

      Not all feet are the same – how to choose the right shoe shape for a flattering look
  </h1>, 'text': 'Shoes are essential to completing your daily look – perhaps more so than a bag, we dare say. Choose the right pair and they can instantly elevate your outfit, boost your confidence and enhance how your figure and legs look.\nIt’s one of the reasons why so many women are willing to bear with the discomfort of walking the entire day in five-inch heels.\nBut heel height isn’t the only feature about shoes that can significantly alter how your feet and legs look – the shape of the toe box can also do the same, albeit in a different way.\nYou may have realised that you tend to gravitate to a certain type of toe shape when shopping for shoes. Or perhaps you have never paid much attention to this particular aspect of your footwear, and simply went for whatever looked great on your feet.\nGuess what, the shape of these shoes that you love was definitely a factor – whether you were aware or not – in their appeal to you.\nFeet, of course, come in different sizes, lengths, widths and shapes too, which means not every type of shoe will flatter the pair that belongs uniquely to you.\nAnd it’s not just about aesthetics – wear a pair that doesn’t suit your feet, and it can cause so much pain that you won’t be able to walk.\nHave you found one that works best for you? If not, CNA Lifestyle lists down what’s available out there and what each different shoe shape can do for the aesthetics of your feet.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nPOINTED TOE\n\xa0\nA post shared by Louis Vuitton (@louisvuitton)\n\xa0\nOn days when we want to look extra polished, we have a tendency to reach for a pair of pointed-toe shoes. Not only do they pull together a formal work outfit, they can make a casual jeans-and-tee ensemble look smart too.\nThat’s not the only reason why many women love pointed-toe shoes. Design director of Charles & Keith, Frederika Stevens, told us that it has got to do with the visual effects it has on the foot too. “Pointed toes (and diagonal straps) will elongate and slim the foot, which is usually what women want,” she said.\nThe shape of the pointed-toe shoe will suit those with narrow feet best, in terms of fit and comfort, but you can make it work too if you have feet that are of an average width or slightly wider than average.\nIt may sometimes help to go half or one full size up for pointed-toe shoes so that you’ll have more room in the toe box of the shoes. If doing so makes the shoe a little loose around the heel, using heel liners can easily fix the fit issue.\nThose with very broad feet (especially when they are also short in length) will do best to stay away from them, as they are bound to have a restrictive, uncomfortable fit on your feet. What’s more, they may even have the opposite visual effect on them, making your feet appear broader and shorter than they actually are.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nALMOND OR TAPERED TOE\nThe almond-toe shoe may not be nearly as sharp as the pointy-toe shoe is, but it has the same slimming and elongating effect on feet, albeit without the pain that the latter can inflict on feet that do not suit its shape.\nStevens says that the almond-toe is a good alternative to the pointed-toe shoe for ladies with broad and fleshy feet. “Having said that, every brand’s shoe cutting is different, so it does not mean that those with broad feet can’t wear pointed-toe shoes at all. It really boils down to how particular the individual is about the look, as there are people who insist on wearing pointed toe shoes even though they have broad feet,” she added.\nIf you need more room in the front of the shoes, look out for those that come with a peep-toe opening as this will help accommodate your feet. “Criss-cross straps or T-bar strap designs also help to ‘narrow’ down the appearance of broad feet as well,” Stevens said.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nROUNDED TOE\n\xa0\nA post shared by Hermès (@hermes)\n\xa0\nThe one shape that will work great on all types of feet is the universally flattering rounded toe. Whether your feet are narrow or broad, or if your toes are stubby or long, this classic shape will suit you. They are also the most comfortable shoe shape, too – think ballet flats, which are essential for days when you are likely to be up on your feet for long periods of time.\nThe round-toed heeled pump is a versatile classic and works especially well for those with large feet who would like to visually minimise the length of their feet with the right shoes. If this describes you, a pointed toe may not be ideal (particularly if your feet are also narrow) as the sharp silhouette will only serve to further elongate them.\nAccording to Stevens, the round toe is one of the highlights in recent shoe trends too. “We are starting to see a tendency for round-toe shapes with heavier outsoles, which are in line with the gender-neutral look.”\n\xa0\n\xa0\nBOXY OR SQUARE TOE\n\xa0\nA post shared by Roger Vivier (@rogervivier)\n\xa0\nThis edgy shoe shape was a pre-pandemic hit in 2020, and it looks like they are here to stay for a while longer than we had expected. It’s not strictly “covered” shoes that can have a square toe, too – Stevens said that the shape is also seen on many open-toed sandal designs, which are very popular right now.\nBut even if you’re not one to blindly follow fashion trends, the square-toe shoe could be a comfy, foot-flattering yet interesting choice for a wardrobe staple – just pick one that has a slightly tapered toe-cap instead of one with an exaggerated square shape.\nStevens agreed that the square-toe shape is suitable for all feet types, both fit- and style-wise.\xa0\n“We see that the broader square toe is appreciated by a younger customer either on boots or shoes with heavy outsoles. Women who prefer very feminine styles might not immediately gravitate towards this style,"" she said.\n""Though if the square toe is more subtle, it is definitely easier on the eyes of more conservative individuals. In that case, it can be considered to be more classic and versatile when it comes to styling an outfit.\nThese can also have a foot-elongating effect, without being too challenging to wear – in other words, they are perfect for wide feet or those who cannot bear having their toes smooshed together by their shoes for the entire day.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     health ']}"

      Creative Capital: The Scandinavian expatriate championing batik through modern fashion
  </h1>, 'text': 'As part of my research for this column, I am constantly scrutinising local design competitions. Last year, in one of the hardest year’s for retail to date, the Textile and Fashion Federation (TaFF) Singapore ran a competition that invited designers to “explore what it means to create a Singapore-inspired capsule collection in men’s and women’s apparel.” The event was part of TaFF’s mission to promote, support, and develop the local fashion industry.\nAll five finalists are worthy of note. When looking at the designers behind the brand, one stood out, not just for its beautiful use of batik – a heritage art form and craft that deserves a lot more attention – but also for the surprising fact that the founder and designer, Mette Hartman is a 56-year-old Norwegian expat. Not exactly who I had imagined behind Martha Who’s cool, modern batik kaftans.\nHI METTE, TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF\nI was born in Norway but have lived abroad for three decades, in America, Sweden and Singapore for the past 13 years.\nI moved to Singapore with my family for a job. Initially, I was engaged in the expat and Scandinavian community here. Then I fell in love with Singapore and the people. I decided this was home. We settled down here and I became a permanent resident.\nI have a passion for travel, I tend to combine business trips to meet family and friends overseas. My three children are all studying in the UK.\nOutside the office, I am happiest with my friends, socialising and doing charity work. I am a foodie, particularly enjoy joining my monthly cooking club.\nWHAT INSPIRED YOU TO START YOUR OWN FASHION BUSINESS?\nI founded Martha Who\xa0because I wanted to find a way to promote batik art globally. The original idea started from an ethos of developing a sustainable brand that preserves this amazing but endangered artform of hand painted batik.\nWHAT DO YOU LOVE ABOUT BATIK?\nThe arts, heritage and culture. Batik making is just like creating a painting. I think it’s very beautiful and these old techniques are important.\n\n\nFROM CONCEPTION TO LAUNCH, HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE?\nI soft-launched Martha Who on a small scale with only a few thousand dollars. I flew to Sweden with this little collection of batik silk scarves. A friend of mine was the founder of a fashion agency and she put my brand into multi-brand stores in Sweden and Norway. After a couple of years, I launched a capsule of robes, kaftans and scarves at Tangs Orchard. In Singapore, the oversized shawls are often used as beach sarongs and the smaller scarves as hijabs. This was so interesting to me. I never imagined that these scarves would be so versatile.\nDO YOU THINK SINGAPORE IS SUPPORTIVE OF CREATIVE INDUSTRIES?\nYes. I am very impressed by the new team behind The Textile and Fashion Federation (TaFF) drive to support local designers. TaFF helped me with local awareness, and has been very supportive while giving me media exposure and the opportunity to retail at Design Orchard. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has also been very supportive in growing local brands. Through both organisations, I have gained invaluable knowledge from mentors and industry experts.\nWHO IS MARTHA WHO? IS THERE A STORY BEHIND THE BRAND NAME AND WHO IS YOUR IDEAL CUSTOMER?\nMartha is the name of my good friend’s daughter. I had originally wanted to name it after my daughter, but she was a teenager then. She thought it was too embarrassing and did not allow me to use her name.\nMy ideal customer is a returning one. Returning customers are the best! I feel a deep sense of pride when I see my customers dress up in Martha Who clothing for special occasions like weddings and celebrations.\n\n\nWHAT IS YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS AND THE PRODUCTION PROCESSES LIKE?\nI always find inspiration and work in some way directed by nature. My designs often feature a fusion of traditional and abstract prints. For me, it’s better to focus on a few products that I’m known for and doing smaller collections more frequently. This allows me to deliver from the studio to the stores when I want to. It gives me more breathing space and I can focus on making unique one of a kind designs; you will never find two of the same pieces. The fabrics are made by hand in small workshops then flown to Singapore where the pieces are cut, embellished and sewn by hand in my studio.\nWHAT IS YOUR HERO PRODUCT?\nSince the launch of the kaftans,\xa0 the black and white abstract motif has been our best-selling style. I find myself coming back to and reinventing and reinterpreting this design. The next collection I am planning is a set of black and white abstract batik through which I aim to pay homage to Martha Who’s own development throughout the years.\nThe maxi kaftan in silk crepe is also super popular.\nDO YOU EVER FACE ANY ISSUES BEING A EUROPEAN CHAMPIONING SOUTHEAST ASIAN TEXTILES?\nOh yes, there have been both cultural and language barriers. My Bahasa is quite limited and even though my master batikers speak English, miscommunication is still far from infrequent.\nFortunately, I have spent a lot of time in Indonesia and we have worked together over many years. I have changed my way of communication so that we work more effectively together, rather than simply trying to impose English.\nUnderstanding their cultures has made it easier for me to do business in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nWHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY LIKE FOR YOU?\nMy morning starts with breakfast on my balcony. I start the day with admin work. Even though I like the creative process better, I think production and logistics and up-to-date book-keeping are all equally important to know for my business. After lunch, I will drop by Design Orchard for a quick chat with the staff or make deliveries before heading to the studio which is located near City Hall. I will work on production until around 7pm. For dinner, I will go out with colleagues or friends or simply head home and cook.\nLate in the evening is the time when I am most creative and when I work on new designs and patterns. This is also the time when I make international calls to my loved ones in Sweden. Before going to bed I will climb the staircase in my condo to get my exercise or take a bicycle ride around Marina Bay Sands.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR MARTHA WHO JOURNEY SO FAR?\nDefinitely, it was being a finalist in an eight month long design competition, Singapore Stories 2020.\nI am very happy and proud that I was able to create an innovative fashion capsule during lockdown. It was so much stress and fun competing for the Singapore Fashion Award Trophy. Even though I didn’t win, I am so glad I have helped to drive Singapore fashion to the stage because there are so many great designers out there. I have so many good moments together with the other contestants and the team when we met during castings and filming days. We actually got the rare opportunity to tour the vaults of Asian Civilisations Museum’s Heritage Conservation Centre led by one of the judges, Kennie Ting, Director of ACM, and Jackie Yoong, Curator for Fashion and Textiles & Peranakan Art.\nFor the competition I was inspired by the rich tapestry and vibrance of the Peranakan culture. I challenged myself and presented a resort collection ‘Peranakan Tea Party in the Garden’ which received wide praise.\n\n\nWHERE CAN OUR READERS BUY YOUR PRODUCTS?\nI’m excited to offer Martha Who products at Design Orchard, SocietyA, Takashimaya and Four Seasons Hotel. Monument Lifestyle Duxton and Tiong Bharu are my latest stockists who will showcase my label when things opens up again.\nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS?\nEven though I have tried to adapt and recover from the COVID-19 Pandemic, I still struggle. We were hit hard during the Circuit Breaker because physical stores were my only sales channel. Suddenly I had no sales. The artisans in Indonesia could no longer produce. I had to quickly engage my sewers here in Singapore to use the excess silk fabric into reusable face masks. After the reopening, some retail partners had closed, some only open for appointments.\nBefore the pandemic, my customers were mostly tourists and expats, so now I am working hard to create local brand awareness. Even that is difficult. Collaborations, pop-ups, photoshoots – regrettably all have had to be postponed. I understand these measures are very necessary but it is still very difficult to cope.\nI am so thankful for all the support Taff, STB, and Design Orchard has given me during this uncertain time we are going through.\n\n\nANYTHING EXCITING PLANNED FOR 2021?\nYes, some very exciting things. From June 25 to\xa0Oct 31, I will display one of my works as a part of a special exhibition at Asian Civilization Museum (ACM). #SGFASHIONNOW is an exhibition exploring designs and concepts reflective of Singapore fashion and Asian heritage today. It is such an honour to be exhibited in a museum.\nThere will also be a Resort Pop Up at Design Orchard, from Jun 18 to Jul 22. There, I will showcase a set of black and white abstract batiks through which I aim to pay homage to Martha Who’s own development throughout the years.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Asia ']}"

      What happens when you sprinkle gold dust on a carbon watch? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'For the past 60 years, Corum’s Admiral collection has been synonymous with sailing. Even if it wasn’t named after an international yachting regatta (the Admiral’s Cup), the 12 nautical pennants on the dial found on many of the Admiral watches have made that connection clear.\xa0\nOf course with a history this long, fun deviations are to be expected. Literal case in point: The new Admiral 45 Automatic Openworked Flying Tourbillon Carbon & Gold.\nThe collection’s signature dodecagonal case and flag-shaped indices are still present, but they’ve been given a glamorous makeover thanks to a sultry black and gold livery and a brand new case material. By mixing layers of carbon composite with resin and 18K\xa0gold glitter, the resulting effect is not only striking but also random, thus ensuring no two cases are identical.\nThere’s no dial, so you can see the open-worked CO 298 movement and its one-minute flying tourbillon in all its gala-worthy glory. The rest of the watch face dutifully follows the theme: Gold-toned brass minute ring on the flange, black pennants, gold dauphine hands filled with black SuperLuminova.\xa0\nFlanking the tourbillon are a power reserve indicator at 3 o’clock and a three-minute regatta countdown at 9 o’clock. The brass rotor, shaped like a sailing ship wheel, dominates the view of the exhibition case back. At rest, the watch will run for 72 hours.\nAt 45mm this is by no means a subtle watch, and the crown guards shielding the red gold crown adds to its imposing profile, but it won’t weigh down the wrist. Being carbon composite, the case actually weighs 2.5 times less than titanium and is 4.5 times lighter than stainless steel. The strap is another brazen fusion of sporty and dressy, being made of rubber and synthetic textiles with genuine gold stitching for accent.\nThis won’t be anyone’s daily watch, but Corum’s Admiral 45 watches often aren’t anyway. They’ve shown up with bright skeletonised dials, in bronze, in wood, and even in some combination of the three, but dull they are not. In fact, we’ll bet the owners of the 48 pieces released will be the most interesting folk at boat shows.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ']}"

      Women celebrities who remind us to feel good and embrace body positivity
  </h1>, 'text': 'Women and how they look\xa0are often subjected to attention that can occasionally be undue. And, it appears,\xa0it’s no exception for celebrities who seemingly lead perfect lives – with seemingly perfect bodies.\xa0\nSinger and songwriter Camila Cabello was body shamed earlier this month when images of her in a bikini enjoying a beach day out with her boyfriend Shawn Mendes surfaced.\nBut if there’s one thing we love about Cabello, it\'s that she took the unkind comments in her stride and focused on the good instead, thanking fans for the love that they showed her. Her fans swiftly came to her defense with body-positive comments such as, “You are a beautiful normal woman being, just like the rest of us fleshy beings!”\nHere\'s what female celebrities have shared recently about body issues and how they deal with them.\xa0\nFLUCTUATING IN WEIGHT IS NORMAL \nSinger and actress Selena Gomez\xa0was reflecting on some of her past wardrobe choices from 2007 to 2021 in a\xa0Vogue interview that ran\xa0on Wednesday (Jun 9).\xa0\nThe 28-year-old revealed that when she was wearing a Celine dress during The Dead Don’t Die premiere in New York in 2019, “it was another moment in her life where she had fluctuated in weight”.\n“And I am very honest with the people in my team, so I didn’t want to wear anything tight. And then I tried this dress on and I felt so beautiful,” she said. \xa0\xa0\nGomez also shared the same struggle of fluctuating a lot in weight when she wore a Vera Wang dress during the 2015 Met Gala. “And I remember this night specifically, I didn’t feel good about my body.”\nWhile she expressed immense gratitude for the opportunity to ""work on a dress that fit her body"", it was still\xa0one of those enlightening moments where she felt like she “doesn’t need to be that 19-year-old body shape anymore”.\nBEING AUTHENTIC IN HOW YOU LOOK CAN BE A GOOD THING \nTitanic actress Kate Winslet recently spoke up about her conversation with film director Craig Zobel when he wanted to edit\xa0out her “bulgy bit of belly” from an intimate scene in the HBO hit series Mare Of Easttown.\n“Don’t you dare,” she told Zobel.\nIn a New York Times interview on May 31, Winslet shared in greater detail about “having no filters” and staying as true as possible to her character.\n“Listen, I hope that in playing Mare as a middle-aged woman – I will be 46 in October – I guess that’s why people have connected with this character in the way that they have done because there are clearly no filters,” said Winslet.\xa0\n“She’s a fully functioning, flawed woman with a body and a face that moves in a way that is synonymous with her age and her life and where she comes from.”\nThe mother of three also warned young actors to not equate social media fame with the hard work of\xa0acting.\nIn the same interview, she said: “What worries me is that faces are beautiful. Faces that change, that move, are beautiful faces, but we’ve stopped learning how to love those faces because we keep covering them up with filters now because of social media and anyone can photoshop themselves, and airbrush themselves, and so they do.”\nFEELING GOOD ABOUT ONESELF IS IMPORTANT \xa0\nSpeaking of young celebrities, 19-year-old Billie Eilish caused a stir recently when she started looking different from her usual portrayed self.\nKnown for her baggy sweatshirts and straight, neon green hair, she got people talking when she appeared in a revealing corset and a wig on the cover of the June 2021 issue of\xa0British Vogue.\nShe explained that her body “was the initial reason for her depression when she was younger” that was made worse by an injury, forcing her to quit dancing. She started wearing baggy clothes then.\n\xa0\nA post shared by BILLIE EILISH (@billieeilish)\n\xa0\nHowever, her new look is ""all about what makes you feel good"".\nShe took to Instagram to post more pictures of\xa0the shoot, and said, “I love these pictures and I loved doing this shoot. Do whatever you want whenever you want.”\nWhether\xa0or not we rely on fashion to help us with confidence, ladies, maybe it’s time to put Eilish’s advice into practice: “If you feel like you look good, you look good.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     Culture & Trends ', '     fashion ', '     Beauty ']}"

When you can talk face-to-face, these things are much easier.”\nDespite the challenges imposed by timezone differences and the pandemic – as well as competing offers from other groups – the two parties announced on Mar\xa05 that Jil Sander would be joining the OTB portfolio, which includes Diesel, the denim brand that Rosso founded in 1978, alongside Maison Margiela, Marni and Viktor & Rolf, as well as production and distribution companies Staff International and Brave Kid.\nWith 2020 sales of €1.3 billion (S$2.1 billion) – down 14 per cent from the previous year due to the pandemic – OTB (which stands for Only the Brave) is now one of Italy’s largest luxury groups, behind Prada (€2.4 billion in revenues) and ahead of the Tod’s Group (€637 million).\n\n\nRosso, who with his tattooed fingers and black denim jacket looks more like a record label owner than a luxury goods executive, will not say what he paid for Jil Sander, which became famous in the 1990s for its refined, minimalist clothes.\nJil Sander has changed hands several times in the past quarter-century. From 1999 to 2006, it was part of the Prada Group, where disagreements with Prada's Patrizio Bertelli led to designer Jil Sander’s swift exit (she returned briefly in 2003-04), and later the appointment of Raf Simons as creative director. It was sold to a private equity group in 2006, and then acquired by Onward Holdings for €167 million in 2008 (where Sander was again briefly reunited with her brand).\n\n\nA post shared by JIL SANDER (@jilsander)\nFor most (and possibly all) of that time, Jil Sander did not turn a profit. And despite the excellent creative leadership of husband-and-wife team Luke and Lucie Meier since 2017, the brand reported a loss of US$21.2 million (S$28.1 million) on revenues of ¥11.3 billion (S$136.6 million) in the year ending February 2020. What makes Rosso confident he can make it profitable?\n“This is our track record,” said Rosso, pointing to the success of earlier acquisitions such as Maison Margiela. To start, Jil Sander’s revenues need to grow “at least three to four times”, he said. That means adding to its network of 44 stores, expanding into China and the US, and “developing areas of the collection they have not been able to develop”. (He did not specify which, but Margiela, which added shoes, bags, belts and fragrance after joining OTB, offers a template.)\n“The idea, the style, the look of the brand, everything is already there,” Rosso said of Jil Sander’s purist aesthetic. “I don’t want to change the creative team. What we have to change, to reinforce, is management.”\n“If you want to keep a company cool, you have to maintain investment and creativity, then you need to be stronger in marketing, technology. But the first thing is creativity.” – Renzo Rosso\n\n\nTHE RISE OF DIESEL\nRosso, 65, is an unlikely entrepreneur. Born to a farming family in northern Italy’s Po Valley, his moneymaking instincts manifested early: As a teenager, he ran an at-home tailoring shop and stitched bell-bottomed jeans to sell to friends. He studied textiles at the Marconi Institute in Padua, a degree he chose because he heard it was easy.\nIn 1975, at age 20, he joined clothing manufacturer Moltex. Three years later, with a US$4,000 loan from his father, Rosso bought a 40 per cent stake in the company and changed the name to Diesel. He bought the remaining shares for US$500,000 a decade later (while relinquishing his shares of the other brands in the group).\nThe company expanded rapidly, helping propel the designer denim craze taking off in the 1980s. Diesel’s style-driven, vintage-looking denim, savvy merchandising and rebellious ad campaigns attracted young shoppers newly flush with cash. Annual revenues climbed from US$2.8 million in 1985 to US$25.2 million in 1987; by 1989 it had expanded into women’s jeans and was selling in 40 countries. It remains the biggest business in the OTB group (OTB does not break down revenues for individual brands).\n\n\nA post shared by Diesel (@diesel)\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Rosso started building OTB, which he likes to describe as an “alternative luxury” group. In 2000 he bought out Staff International, which manufactured and distributed Diesel’s premium line, and two years later took a majority stake in Martin Margiela (now Maison Margiela).\nIn 2008 he took a controlling interest in Viktor & Rolf, the Dutch couture house behind the best-selling Flowerbomb fragrance, and in 2012 agreed to acquire a majority stake in Marni, an Italian ready-to-wear label popular with the art crowd, replacing founder Consuelo Castiglioni with former Prada designer Francesco Risso in 2016. A minority stake in Californian label Amiri followed in 2019.\n“Probably Renzo has had this vision [for a luxury group] since the beginning,” said luxury sector M&A specialist Mario Ortelli. While OTB lacks the marketing and distribution synergies of larger conglomerates such as LVMH or Kering, what sets OTB apart is its manufacturing base and Rosso himself.\n“Whereas other groups are driven more by the logic of brand management and distribution, Rosso is more focused on the product itself and on the creative process than, for example, [Kering founder Francois-Henri] Pinault and [LVMH founder Bernard] Arnault,” Ortelli said.\nRosso, who is a father of seven, keeps a busy schedule of brand and board meetings. In addition to OTB, he owns shares in about 20 other companies, including Yoox Net-a-Porter (he was an early investor), Depop, London’s Chiltern Firehouse restaurant, and ventures in wine and organic agriculture. To decompress, he meets his personal trainer every morning at 6am and spends his weekends outdoors on his farm.\n\n\nTAKING A GAMBLE\nPerhaps Rosso’s greatest gamble came in 2014, when he hired the disgraced designer John Galliano to oversee Margiela. Galliano had been dismissed from Dior in 2011 after footage of him airing anti-Jewish remarks at a Paris restaurant were uploaded online, and despite Anna Wintour’s efforts to rehabilitate his image, he was an outcast. The pair met in secret for two years before agreeing to work together.\nFinancially, the bet paid off. Only one retailer dropped the brand on hearing of Galliano’s appointment, and brand revenues doubled over the next five years. Last year’s sales climbed 20 per cent from 2019 in spite of the pandemic. Footwear and denim are performing particularly well, said Libby Page, senior market editor at Net-a-Porter, adding that the retailer has expanded its buy of the brand’s Replica sneaker and hoof-shaped Tabi shoes.\n“The secret of Margiela is John Galliano. He is not a designer, he is a couturier,” said Rosso, who added that sales growth is coming from “every single area”. Accessories, shoes and bags now account for 65 per cent of revenues, he said; ready-to-wear, the other 35 per cent. The breakdown for Marni is similar.\n\n\nA post shared by Maison Margiela (@maisonmargiela)\nWhile Rosso was building the group in the early 2000s, his core brand was beginning to suffer. By 2016 Diesel was in the red; its customer had aged, and its jeans and other apparel had fallen into the trap of heavy discounting. “It became too commercial,” Rosso said. He rejoined the brand for two years, parting ways with artistic director Nicola Formichetti and filing for US bankruptcy protection to extract the business from expensive store leases.\nRosso decided to take the brand upmarket, drawing in more fashion-conscious customers via a series of clever marketing campaigns (including a New York pop-up store pretending to sell Diesel knock-offs), and higher-priced collaborations with designers including A-Cold-Wall’s Samuel Ross and Gosha Rubchinskiy.\xa0\nBy the end of 2019, Diesel was back in the black. Luxury veteran Massimo Piombini was made Diesel’s new CEO, and last year Y/Project’s Glenn Martens, a designer known for his denim, was appointed creative director. Martens’ vision for the new Diesel will debut at the menswear shows in Milan this month.\n“If you want to keep a company cool, you have to maintain investment and creativity, then you need to be stronger in marketing, technology,” Rosso said of Diesel’s turnround. “But the first thing is creativity.”\nWith his work at Diesel done, Rosso is now in a position to add further to the OTB portfolio – and he says he’s interested in acquiring more brands. Ortelli suggested Etro and other companies around the €300 million revenue mark as possible targets, though arguably Etro lacks the “cool factor” that would make it a good fit for OTB.\nRosso owns 90 per cent of the group; his two sons from his first marriage, Andrea and Rosso, the remaining 10 per cent. (Both work at the company, and his daughter Alessia works in marketing at Diesel North America.) Though Rosso said he does not plan to retire in the next five years, he intends to leave OTB in the hands of his family: “Everything is prepared for the company to run without me.”\nRENZO ROSSO’S ROAD TO SUCCESS\n1978\nAfter three years at Moltex, Rosso establishes Diesel brand\n1985\nRosso takes full control of Diesel\n2000\nAcquires Italian manufacturer Staff International\n2002\nOnly the Brave (later OTB) established, bringing all of Rosso’s fashion companies together under one umbrella\n2006\nGroup takes full control of Maison Margiela\n2008\nMajority stake acquired in Dutch couture house Viktor & Rolf\n2012\nAgrees to acquire majority stake in Milan luxury label Marni\n2015\nTakes full control of Marni\n2019\nMinority stake acquired in Los Angeles label Amiri\n2021\nJil Sander added to OTB portfolio\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2021 The Financial Times\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Italy ', '     business ']}"

      New fashion exhibit shows how women's roles changed in Singapore and China
  </h1>, 'text': ""There are many factors affecting how women dress themselves. Be it a new job or a lifestyle change, women’s clothing continue to accurately represent a country’s political, social and economic advancements.\nAnd according to archival documents, women experienced the most significant changes from the late 1880s to the 1970s – at least in Singapore and China.\nA new exhibit at the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall is putting the spotlight on women and their key contributions to society by way of fashion and more.\nTitled Modern Women of the Republic: Fashion and Change in China and Singapore, it opens on Saturday (Jun 12) and runs until Dec 12.\n“Fashion, besides being a form of self-expression, is often a reflection of the times. This is why we chose fashion as a medium to tap into broader conversations to discuss women's multi-faceted and ever-changing roles across history,” explained Tan Yan Ni, an assistant curator at Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall.\n“It is also timely for us to explore this topic as 2021 is the Year of Celebrating SG Women, and we hope to spark off more discussions among Singaporeans about what constitutes a modern woman today,” Tan added.\nHere's what you can expect from the three-part showcase.\nIMPACT OF POLITICAL CHANGES ON WOMEN\nAmid the uncertainty and turmoil faced by the citizens from the 1890s to the 1930s, the Chinese government called for a ban on the practice of foot and breast binding.\nAs the country embraced more freedom, more local tailors in China started to employ Westernised design elements on the cheongsam for a more fitting\xa0effect.\nKnown as the golden age of the cheongsam, the period from the 1920s to the 1940s was also the time\xa0the idea of a “modern woman” and her role\xa0was formed.\nINFLUENCE OF PRINT MEDIA ON WOMEN'S\xa0FASHION\nThe exponential growth of print media the likes of fashion magazines and editorial ads from the 1930s to the 1960s had inevitably led to women having increased appetites for consumerism.\nThink bold experimentations and evolving new concepts of modernity in the everyday life.\nWhile the Chinese used to deem body-hugging swimsuits as “scandalous”, they became widely accepted in Singapore as they were often featured in the press and print collaterals.\nPOWER DRESSING FOR WOMEN\xa0\nThe final part of the exhibition shines a spotlight on how fashion empowered working women in Singapore's early days.\xa0\nAs more women joined the workforce and became financially independent from the 1950s to the 1970s, they became more aware\xa0about\xa0their appearances. This gave rise to the increasing popularity of the fashion and beauty industries.\nThanks to increased exposure to films depicting Western-inspired fashion and trends, feminine designs like a cinched waist and an A-line skirt were\xa0highly sought after by young working women as imported fabrics were made affordable.\nAnd if you’re one for small details, look out for a special scent permeating the memorial hall (Hint: It should smell like a perfumed cosmetic product). A clever\xa0tie-up with Swiss perfumery Givaudan, it was created with the intent to throw visitors back in time.\nThe exhibition, which runs from Jun 12 to Dec 12, will be open from 10am to 5pm from Tuesdays to Sundays at Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall. \n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Culture & Trends ']}"

Due to some, well, financial challenges within the company, the brand eventually fell out of favour in the noughties before making a comeback in the 2010s, having been bought over by South Korean company Sungjoo Group.\nAfter a significant reinvention into a new school luxury brand, MCM is now a cult classic among\xa0some of today’s hottest celebrities, rappers, musicians and athletes, including Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Chris Brown, Billie Eilish, Cristiano Ronaldo and more.\n\xa0\nA post shared by MCM (@mcmworldwide)\n\xa0\nMCM fever also swept through the K-pop celebrity scene, popular with\xa0big names such as Rain, G-Dragon and Lay Zhang. In particular, it was the brand’s iconic studded backpacks that brought it back to the mainstream.\xa0\nFun fact – while MCM used to stand for founder Michael Cromer Munich, it now stands for Modern Creation Munchen.\nThis year, MCM is celebrating its 45th\xa0anniversary and to mark the occasion, the brand is unveiling a new monogram, the first new print in its history.\nThink of MCM and the Visetos Monogram immediately comes to mind. Now, the iconic monogram will take on a vintage aesthetic with the Vintage Jacquard Monogram, created using a weaving technique traditional of The Bauhaus Textile School.\nVintage jacquard monograms have become somewhat of a trend as of late. Think Louis Vuitton’s Since 1854 collection and Gucci’s Epilogue collection, where the iconic monograms of the two houses were given a vintage, worn-in effect.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThe MCM Vintage Jacquard Monogram is created in three colourways – antique grey, modern blue and royal red. A capsule collection has been launched to mark the anniversary of the brand, featuring iconic handbags and silhouettes such as the Stark, Tote, Klassik, Satchel and the Wilton Chain.\nOther accessories include bucket hats, AirPods pro case (to hold your TraceTogether token, perhaps?), stoles, shoes as well as home accessories such as cushions, slippers and more.\nMCM’s Vintage Jacquard Monogram collection is now available in stores and online at www.mcmworldwide.com\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      The rise and rise of Levi's: Why is this American denim icon back in the limelight?
  </h1>, 'text': ""More than a year after working mostly from home, and going out less, many of us have gotten unspeakably bored with athleisure, loungewear or just plain ol’ singlets and shorts.\nAt the same time though, we are not quite ready to embrace full-on dressing up yet – nothing too revealing, tight, stiff, starchy, formal, fussy or trendy, please, because that would make us want to run home and crawl back into our pyjamas.\nThat’s probably the reason why the old school denim jean\xa0is back.\xa0They\xa0are safe, comforting and digestible, having been tried, tested and trusted for generations.\nThey’ve been around since Levi’s created them in 1873 as a workmen’s staple. By the 1930s, they had come to be considered an essential building block of any (male or female’s) wardrobe.\nAcross the decades, denim jeans proved to be amazingly versatile.\xa0\n\n\nThey could be acid-washed, stonewashed, faded, whiskered, ombred, or dyed in any colour. Embellished, ripped, shredded, distressed, patchworked, embroidered upon.\nThey could come in low-, mid- or high-rises, with cuts that varied from ultra-skinny to skinny to straight to tapered to flared to bootcut to baggy.\nHemline options covered butt-cheek-baringly short Daisy Dukes to knee-length to capris to ankle-grazing and even floor-sweeping lengths.\nThey were super democratic in that they could be found anywhere from thrift stores to department stores to luxury boutiques, and at any price point ranging from a few bucks to several thousand dollars.\xa0\n\n\nBut no matter what denim trends came and went, and which jean brands rose and fell (you can bet that the Carhartt/Rag and Bone/Everlane/Madewell/Heron Preston millennials and Gen Zs would not believe how big labels like Gloria Vanderbilt, Jordache, Fiorucci, Sasson and Guess were in their heyday), old-school Levi’s remained steadfastly unshakeable, a Rock of Gibraltar in the sea of denim.\nAs Whowhatwear.com noted last year: “Why everyone loves Levi’s, even though there are so many competitors on the market. The answer is pretty simple: They're affordable, trendy yet classic, celebrities wear them, and they fit well.”\nDuring a time when we’re impatient to return to life as we knew it before the pandemic, while facing fear and anxiety about when and whether the pandemic will end, we need something that represents solidity, familiarity, freedom, ruggedness, comfort and youth.\nThey're affordable, trendy yet classic, celebrities wear them, and they fit well.\nThat’s probably why so many luxury brands have collaborated with the American jeanswear manufacturer of late.\nThere’s Valentino x\xa0Levi’s, which sees the Italian fashion house doing co-branded Levi’s 517s. The medium-wash boot-cut jeans were designed in 1969, with a gentle flare below the knee.\xa0\nThe Vintage model uses authentic vintage 517s dating back to the 70s, of which only 517 numbered limited edition pieces are available, while the Re-Edition version is a perfect replica of the original. Both sport jacrons (yes, there is a name for that leather patch on the back of your jeans) bearing both Levi’s and Valentino branding, as well as a red Valentino x Levi's print detail on the inside of the seat where your butt cheeks would be if you had the jeans on.\nThen there’s Miu Miu x Levi’s, which is part of its Upcycled by Miu Miu initiative to promote circularity and sustainability in product cycles.\xa0\nThis sees a selection of vintage Levi’s 501 jeans and Trucker jackets from the 80s and 90s, given a touch of girly freshness by way of crystal, pearl and embroidery embellishments, or reworked with add-ons such as puff sleeves or patchwork in silk, lace and leather. And the usual beige Levi’s jacron replaced with a powder-pink co-branded one.\nAnd of course, there's that ongoing debate between Boomers and their baggy 80s-style Dad/Mom jeans, versus Millennials who, thanks to Hedi Slimane, have\xa0been wearing skinny jeans since 2005 (even if they themselves were far from skinny), and most recently, Gen Zs who declared skinny jeans to be dead.\nAs The Guardian noted recently: “There has been an increased focus on body inclusivity in fashion in recent years … this chimes with Generation Z’s social activism and calls for greater diversity … On TikTok, Gen Z users have advocated for baggy jeans instead of slim-fit – eschewing the prescribed idea that thinness is attainable. According to market research company Edited, sales of men’s relaxed fit jeans have increased by 15 per cent and women’s wide-legged jeans are up 97 per cent”.\nWell, considering that denim jeans were originally designed as a more comfortable and casual alternative to the more restrictive fashions of its time, and considering the extra weight we’ve put on thanks to stress/boredom-induced pandemic snacking, that may not be a bad thing.\n\n\nTHE MOST BELOVED CLASSIC JEANS STYLES FOR MEN\n1950s: Marlon Brando wore 501 Original Fit denims in The Wild Ones, making them the denim of choice for subsequent bad boy celebs such as James Dean and Elvis Presley. The original classic that started it all in 1873, the straight cut 501\xa0sits on the waist, and has a button fly.\n1960s: Denim flares and bell bottoms were the perfect foil for the hippie vibes of the era.\n1970s: The flares got bigger to accommodate disco dancing in platform shoes, and to balance out the big hairdos, such as afros, on top.\n1980s: Pop star Nick Kamen (who died recently) created a sensation as the star for the TV ad that saw him strip down to his boxers as he washed his 501 Original Shrink-to-Fit, the raw denim version of the 501s, in a public launderette.\nGuys, if you don’t want to be arrested for indecent exposure, here’s how to shrink yours to fit at home: Buy a pair with your true waist size but with an inseam two sizes larger than what you usually wear. Put them on, and sit in a warm bath, then wear them till dry. Other trends include acid or stone washed jeans, rips, and tears.\n1990s: The grunge movement led to jeans becoming extremely distressed to the point that there was more hole than fabric. But as rap and hip-hop became more popular, the jeans got baggier and saggier.\n2000s: Low-rise and bootcut, or low-rise and skinny, were the way to go.\n\n\nTHE MOST BELOVED CLASSIC JEANS STYLES FOR WOMEN \n1950s: Stars such as Grace Kelly wore straight leg dark-wash denims in a relaxed fit, with turned-up cuffs, paired with men’s style button-down shirts, or tight sweaters, while Doris Day preferred knee-length capris. Brigitte Bardot paired high-waisted ankle-length jeans with a white T-shirt tucked in.\n1960s: Dark-wash jeans were still favoured, with Jane Fonda and Marilyn Monroe wearing them with men’s style white shirts, and brown leather boots and belts.\n1970s: Wide-legged, flared, or bell-bottomed was the way to go, preferably with contrast stitching. Light and medium washes were especially popular.\n1980s: The then-15-year-old Brooke Shields made waves with her “Nothing comes between me and my Calvins” jeans ad for Calvin Klein in 1985. Other popular brands included Jordache, Guess, Wrangler, Sasson, and of course, Levi’s. Princess Diana popularised mom jeans, but skin-tight,\xa0 acid-washed and ripped styles were all the rage too.\n1990s: Low-rise bootcut jeans (worn with skintight or cropped tops), defined the era of minimalism), with Alexander McQueen’s iconic bumster jeans causing many women to flash butt cracks and thongs.\n2000s: Skinny jeans and jeggings became the de facto denim style.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Culture & Trends ']}"

      Hublot’s new all-sapphire Big Bang watch hides absolutely nothing 
  </h1>, 'text': 'We can’t judge the watchmakers that are playing it safe this year (or really, any other year). Sometimes, consumers just want more of the same thing in slightly different colours, sizes and materials, and watch brands are rightfully trying to sate these highly particular – if utterly unexciting – demands.\nBut there are rebels in every fan base and in the world of haute horlogerie, Hublot and its fans count among them. Whether it’s debuting the world’s first brightly coloured ceramic cases or boldly releasing watches that are deliberately hard to read, Hublot ensures there’s never a dull year.\nThis doesn’t mean Hublot ignores trends. It released the Big Bang Integral last year in response to the rise of steel watches with integrated bracelets. The follow-ups however, are usually far from conventional. After a trio of coloured ceramic variants launched this January, the Big Bang Integral announced its most ambitious reference at this year’s Watches & Wonders: The Big Bang Integral Tourbillon Full Sapphire.\nThis isn’t Hublot’s first sapphire watch (that would be the Big Bang Unico Sapphire from 2016) but it is the first to use this much of the fussy material. The case is made from 37 components, five of which are in sapphire, and out of the 165 components that make up the bracelet, 22 are in sapphire. The brand also had to develop titanium inserts specially for this bracelet, and these were machined in such a way that they don’t protrude on either side of each bracelet link.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nPossibly in an attempt to one-up Chanel’s J12 X-Ray, which was the first fully sapphire watch when it was unveiled last year, Hublot’s contender features a flying tourbillon at 6 o’clock. The automatic HUB6035 also features three sapphire bridges, and a platinum micro-rotor positioned at 12 o’clock for a bit of pleasing symmetry. It operates at 3Hz with a power reserve of 72 hours, and has a water resistance of 30m.\nThe Big Bang Integral Tourbillon Full Sapphire’s overall case design and size (43mm by 15.25mm) also makes this a more rugged alternative to Chanel’s 38mm J12 X-Ray, but you’ll have to move fast because it is a limited edition of only 30 pieces.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     jewellery ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ', '     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      From apprentice to fashion icon: Ivory Coast's Pathe'O, 50 years on
  </h1>, 'text': 'ABIDJAN: When 20-year-old Pathe Ouedraogo left his Burkina Faso village in 1969 in search of a better life in neighbouring Ivory Coast, his dream was to return with a bicycle and a transistor radio to prove he had made it.\nHe was too thin to work on a cocoa farm, so took the chance to learn how to make clothes instead - a decision that propelled him to fashion stardom. ""The most accessible job at the time was to be an apprentice tailor,"" said Ouedraogo.\nThe man mostly known as Pathe\'O is now celebrating a 50-year career during which his signature casual shirts and dresses in vibrant African prints and fabrics have graced the shoulders of celebrities and political luminaries including Nelson Mandela.\nHis big break came in 1994 when South African singer Miriam Makeba bought four shirts from him as a gift for the former South African president. Mandela wore one and mentioned Pathe\'O\'s name when asked about its origins during a trip to Paris.\nThe publicity sparked a rush of orders and sales that emptied his shop and propelled him to the forefront of the fashion scene.\nHe met Mandela in 1998. ""It was a meeting that changed my life,"" Pathe\'O told Reuters. ""In the village we would hear about Mandela and Apartheid and all the rest, I never thought I\'d be a tailor, even less dress him.""\nHe marked his five decades with a glitzy show and the launch of a new boutique in an upmarket Abidjan neighbourhood, whose walls are adorned with pictures of him with famous people including Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote and Morocco\'s King Mohamed VI, and presidents including such as Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Alpha Conde of Guinea wearing his shirts.\nPathe\'O now sees his mission as doing more to promote African fashion.\n""Africans themselves are still adverse to wearing what is made in Africa.

      Everything you should know about the most famous handbag in the world
  </h1>, 'text': 'Few things in fashion, or indeed the world, have made an imprint as deep as the impression the Chanel Classic Flap has left on women. The handbag enjoys iconic status unlike that of any other luxury accessory – it is not merely a fashion statement or status symbol, but one that has come to carry special significance in popular culture.\nSo pervasive is its influence that almost everyone – fashion-conscious or not – can recognise it, while handbag addicts deem it the ultimate bag to add to their collection.\nWhy is the Classic Flap so wildly popular and sought-after? For those in the know, it has to do with its history and origins, the many stylistas and celebrities who have been seen with it, its versatility and functionality, and not least, its distinctively classic, elegant yet surprisingly modern design – an unmistakable mark of the legendary woman behind it.\nANATOMY OF AN ICON\nFormally christened the 11.12 bag by the brand, the Classic Flap is a reinterpretation of the 2.55 bag that was designed by Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel in February 1955 (this date explains the numbers featured in its name).\nHow, then, did the 11.12 get its numerical reference? It is said that it simply originated from the style code that was given to the bag model.\nIntroduced by Karl Lagerfeld in 1983, the 11.12 may look similar to its predecessor, but in fact carries several design features that are distinctly different. The most prominent of these is the turn-lock clasp: On the 2.55, it is rectangular, while on the 11.12, it takes the form of Chanel’s interlocking double-C logo. Notably it goes down in fashion history as the first Chanel bag that features the interlocking double-C logo.\nApart from that, the shoulder strap is also different across both models. The 2.55 is given a fully metal chain strap, while the 11.12’s strap has leather woven through the chain links.\nToday, the 11.12 is available in an array of sizes, from mini to jumbo to maxi, with the medium remaining arguably one of the most popular size options.\nA BAG WITH COCO\xa0CHANEL’S SPIRIT\nLike many other iconic fashion statements that Chanel herself designed, the 2.55, which the 11.12 is based on, was revolutionary at the time of its creation. A trend-defying design back in the Fifties, it literally turned the handbag (designed to be carried in the hand back in the day), into a wearable accessory.\n“Tired of holding my bags in my hands and losing them, I added a strap and wore them over my shoulder,” Chanel once said.\nWith its shoulder sling, the 2.55 freed the hands of women – a design element that’s so simple yet made such a difference in its functionality. Another ingenious feature is the adjustability of the chain strap\xa0– this meant the bag could be worn at different lengths to suit the height or preference of its owner.\nWhile maintaining the 2.55’s luxury appeal and having it crafted out of supple lamb leather that was originally the preserve of glove makers, Chanel ensured that it was functional for everyday use and not an accessory that only served an aesthetic purpose.\nYet another practical feature to be found in the bag, as well as the 11.12, of course, is the inclusion of multiple pockets. These seven compartments, thoughtfully laid out for organising a woman’s daily essentials, hide an interesting story that fans of the bag have been passing around – it is said that Gabrielle Chanel used to hide her love letters in the zip pocket located underneath the uppermost flap of the bag.\nNo one can really say if it’s true or not, of course, but here’s one thing we are sure of – it’s a story that certainly adds to the handbag’s allure.\nTHE LEGACY OF ARTISANAL CRAFT\nAs well-known and well-loved as the 11.12 bag is these days, not everyone is aware of the level of skill with which it is made. These bags are famed for their high prices that are known to exhibit an escalating trend, of course, but there’s a reason (multiple, in fact) why it is worth the premium price tag.\nThe Ateliers de Verneuil-en-Halatte, one of Chanel’s prized Metiers d’art (a title that pays homage to the brand’s small specialist artisanal workshops) is where every single 11.12 bag is given its form.\nAccording to Chanel, only artisans who have trained for four to five years and have mastered each gesture and every technique required in production are entrusted with the immense responsibility of crafting an 11.12 bag. The entire process entails 15 hours of work and up to 180 operations, each of which is to be meticulously and precisely carried out.\nIt all begins with the cutting of the material, whether it is leather or a seasonal fabric that is drawn from the current pret-a-porter collection. For every single bag, the ideal cutting points must be accurately pinned down so that all the pieces will meld together harmoniously. With fabrics like tweed, the motifs must be impeccably aligned for symmetry as well as to meet perfectly at the seams – no simple task, if you know how complicated some tweed patterns can be.\nThe bag is given its iconic diamond-shaped quilting via a “point droit de couturiere” stitching technique. The double-C logo is then emblazoned across the underside of the flap with needle and thread.\nOne distinctive feature of the 11.12 is how it is given structure and volume with a “bag in bag” construction technique. The entire bag is actually made by slotting one “bag” (which forms the interior) into the other (which forms the exterior) and then fusing the two together.\nThe two are mounted by hand, then turned the right way round using the ""pique-retourne"" (stitch and turn) method, which is also used by Chanel’s pret-a-porter ateliers. ""Points de bride"" stitches are then put in to hold the two layers firmly together.\nThe bag’s burgundy leather interior lining is yet another recognisable Chanel signature, one that adds an elegant element of interest to the bag and is said to represent the colour of the uniform that Gabrielle Chanel wore in the convent she grew up in.\nBut did you know that the lining actually began as a raspberry red before evolving to the burgundy that is used today?\nNever one to overlook details, Gabrielle Chanel insisted that the bag – like the rest of her fashion designs – looked as beautiful on the inside, as it did outside.\nDISTINCTIVELY DESIRABLE\nThe world’s most famous bag clearly has no lack of fans – whether they be celebrities or women who want to add to their wardrobe an investment accessory that will stand the test of time and trends.\n\n\nA post shared by CHANEL (@chanelofficial)\nDutch supermodel Rianne van Rompaey is one of them. “Everybody, since you’re a little girl, knows what the classic Chanel bag looks like. It has such a history. And especially in fashion, every season everything changes so fast, it’s nice to see these classic bags that have been around for so long. Reinterpreted every time, but with the same DNA. It’s the most famous bag in the world. There is something of a fairy tale about it,” she said.\nWithout a doubt, the recognisability and timeless elegance of the 11.12 are key reasons behind its popularity and desirability. But it’s not simply just that. This bag seems to possess an unusual quality that no other luxury bag has – making it the ultimate bag that’s right at the top of many a handbag wish list.\nTake it from yet another supermodel fan of the bag, Imaan Hammam, who sums this up so beautifully: “I think every girl’s biggest dream is to own a Chanel bag. I was able to buy my first Chanel bag when I was 17, and I remember saving so much money for it – it was a mini version of the 11.12, black on black, and I still have it. This bag is just very chic, elegant, very feminine. When I wear it I feel effortless and powerful.”\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bNow, what woman wouldn’t want the same for herself?\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Your watches are now made from recycled fishing nets and used aerospace titanium
  </h1>, 'text': 'Luxury timepieces are usually built to last, but don’t let their longevity fool you into thinking that that’s enough to lessen the damage all that manufacturing is doing to the planet. One can even argue that their intrinsically excessive nature is not doing the earth any favours. That being said, the luxury consumer is changing.\nAccording to a 2020 report from Bain & Company, there is heightened environmental and social consciousness among the well-heeled. Boston Consulting Group offered similar insights, suggesting that the COVID-19 crisis has made people more conscious of sustainability and the environment.\n\n\nIt will take a while before sustainability becomes the norm on the brand side of things, but a handful of watchmakers are already doing their part for their industry.\nLast year, Ulysse Nardin unveiled the Diver Net concept watch, featuring a case and case back made from recycled fishing nets and a bezel and bezel insert made from recycled PET. Its strap was also crafted from fishing nets, and it used a transparent ceramic glass instead of sapphire crystal because the former required fewer resources to manufacture. It was also around this time that Breitling started using new packaging that was made entirely from upcycled PET, and released its third watch made in partnership with sustainable apparel brand Outerknown.\n\n\nOther efforts are less immediately obvious, but set a fine example of what sustainable practices should look like: Girard-Perregaux and Boucheron both source 100 per cent of their gold through the Kering Ethical Gold Framework (KEGF) and have dedicated spaces for beekeeping, among other measures.\nBlancpain also regularly dedicates its resources to scientific marine expeditions and environmental initiatives like the World Ocean Summit. Whenever it releases a Fifty Fathoms Ocean Commitment watch, €1,000 (S$1,600) from the sale goes to a charity that supports marine conservation.\nAnd the momentum is growing as more big names join the cause this year, making it easier than ever before to ride the real green trend (green-coloured timepieces being the other\xa0major trend for 2021).\n\n\nCARTIER TANK MUST DE CARTIER\nWhenever Cartier releases a new collection, we’ve come to expect the brand to provide every combination of case material, size, gem-setting and movement imaginable. But what we didn’t foresee was the introduction a new solar-powered option in its relaunch of the Tank Must de Cartier.\nPerforations in the dial’s Roman numerals allow light in to power the photovoltaic “SolarBeat” movement, and offers a convenient 16 years of battery life. What’s more, 40 per cent of the optional non-leather straps are made from plant matter, using waste from apples grown in the food industry in Switzerland, Germany and Italy. These too, benefit from Cartier’s QuickSwitch strap-changing system.\nIWC TIMBERTEX\nA watch strap made from trees sounds like the exact opposite of eco-friendly, but IWC’s TimberTex is not just responsibly manufactured, but also cruelty-free and not plastic or petroleum-based.\nTimberTex is composed of 80 per cent natural plant fibres, and the cellulose used comes from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)’s sustainably managed forests in Europe. They are then brought to Italy to be crafted using traditional paper-making techniques, coloured with natural plant-based dyes, and padded with recycled microfibre.\nThese water-resistant straps – available in dark blue, dark brown and black – will currently fit the Portugieser Chronograph, Portugieser Automatic 40, Portofino Automatic and Portofino Chronograph.\nPANERAI SUBMERSIBLE ELAB-ID PAM01225\nPanerai is leading the pack in terms of just how much of a watch can be made from recycled materials, because the Submersible eLAB-ID PAM01225 proves that the answer is, “almost all of it”.\nThe case, sandwich dial and bridges use “Ecotitanium”, a titanium alloy recycled from the aerospace industry, the escapement uses recycled silicon, the strap is made out of recycled fabric and even the lume, gold hands, rotor and other movement parts use recycled-based material. All of that totals 98.6 per cent of the watch being made from stuff that used to be other stuff. This is a limited edition of 30 pieces.\nPrefer the shine and weight of stainless steel? Panerai has also released a trio of Luminor Marina eSteel watches this year with cases and dials made from recycled-based steel alloys, in dark blue, green or grey. These derive 58.4 per cent of its weight from recycled-based materials.\nULYSSE NARDIN DIVER X SKELETON\nIt’s too bad that Ulysse Nardin’s Diver Net has yet to make it to regular production, but we can still enjoy the Diver X Skeleton in the meantime. Carbonium, an extremely lightweight and robust aerospace material made from the same fibres as those used for aircraft wings and fuselages, was first seen on the Freak X, and now graces the bezel and barrel cover of this futuristic dive watch.\nBecause Carbonium is manufactured from waste materials, it has a 40 per cent lower environmental impact compared to carbon, but it also boasts its own unique pattern which is achieved by subjecting carbon fibres to high temperatures and pressures. Limited to 175 pieces.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ']}"

      Disney's Cruella: Louis Vuitton handbag, De Beers jewellery spotted in the film
  </h1>, 'text': 'Disney’s live adaptation of iconic villain Cruella de Vil has arrived, and we have to say, aside from the plot, the fashion is just as intriguing.\nCruella depicts the early days of the 101 Dalmatians’ villain as a young fashion designer in 1970s London. It shares the story of how the young orphan, first introduced as Estella, evolves into Cruella, the queen of mean.\xa0\nEmma Stone plays the iconic villain while Emma Thompson plays Cruella’s nemesis, the\xa0vindictive couture designer Baroness von Hellman. In the film, the two battle it out for the title of the world’s cruellest, albeit best dressed woman.\n\n\nThe show’s costumes, designed by Oscar-winning Jenny Beavan, are a real feast for the eyes. Cruella is dressed to kill in blood-red ballgowns, showstopping military jackets, embellished motocross trousers and billowy balloon skirts.\nMeanwhile, the Baroness is\xa0dressed in a Dior-inspired wardrobe of brown and gold tones. Compared to Cruella’s punk aesthetic, the Baroness’ fashion is described as ""slightly old-fashioned"".\nIf you’re catching the movie, keep a lookout for these luxury fashion accessories\xa0featured in the film.\nLOUIS VUITTON CAPUCINES HANDBAG\nWhen designing Stone’s Cruella wardrobe for the movie, Beavan stayed away from fashion labels. Stone does, however, carry a Louis Vuitton Capucines bag. “We had the opportunity to collaborate with Louis Vuitton and incorporate their iconic Capucines bag into Cruella’s look,” Beavan said in a video that Louis Vuitton created for the film.\n“It does add a touch of class to this woman that she may not have previously had,” Stone, who is a Louis Vuitton ambassador, said in the video.\n\n\nA post shared by Louis Vuitton (@louisvuitton)\nThe Capucines is one of the brand’s classic handbags. Launched in 2013, it is named after the Rue Neuve-des-Capucines in Paris; the location of Louis Vuitton’s very first store.\nThe actress also wore a black Louis Vuitton suit to the film’s premiere in Los Angeles. She accessorised the ensemble with black stiletto pumps and a bright red Petite Malle clutch.\nDE BEERS JEWELLERY\nThe movie features a number of De Beers high jewellery pieces, particularly worn by Thompson as the Baroness. These include the five-line necklace and three-line earrings in white gold from the Arpeggia collection, inspired by Beethoven\'s\xa0Moonlight Sonata.\n\n\nA post shared by De Beers (@debeersofficial)\nThe Diamond Legends by De Beers Cupid necklace, which consists of two symmetrical lines of princess-cut diamonds, outlined by a row of marquise-shaped stones, also make an appearance.\xa0\n“The Baroness needed serious accessories to match her style of dressing, so it was wonderful to use the elegance of De Beers diamonds to complement her red-carpet outfits,” Beavan said in a statement. \xa0\nTOM DAVIES EYEWEAR \nEyewear designed Tom Davies designed a total of 120 custom frames for Cruella. As Estella transforms into Cruella, her glasses become more erratic in style.\xa0\n“I went for an open and soft round frame which is a bit younger, cooler and approachable for when we first spend time with her. There is an innocence about the shape. As the movie progresses and Estella starts to become Cruella, the frames become a little more spikey like a\xa0cat eye,” Davies said in an interview with L’Officiel USA.\nKeep a lookout for the Baroness\' extravagant sunglasses\xa0too.

      The 29-year-old Singaporean illustrator who counts Chanel, Dior as clients
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you shop regularly at ION Orchard, you would have seen Grace Ciao’s illustrations around the mall. When the mall reopened after Singapore exited the Circuit Breaker\xa0last year, it collaborated with the Singaporean artist to produce a series of illustrations outlining\xa0enhanced safety measures. \xa0\nHer stylish and elegant drawings remind shoppers to check in with SafeEntry, wear a mask at all times, and to maintain a safe distance. They inject a sense of fun, and a human touch, into what would otherwise be dull and unexciting signage scattered around the mall.\nThe talented 29-year-old artist, and recent Forbes 30 Under 30 listee, has been illustrating professionally for eight years now. Her works have caught the attention of international luxury brands, including the likes of Bvlgari, Boucheron, Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Dior, Pomellato\xa0and more. She’s also a familiar face at VIP fashion, jewellery, beauty and lifestyle events in Singapore.\nHer journey, Ciao shared with CNA Luxury, was one that began on Instagram. “Since a very young age, I’ve always loved drawing. I used to doodle a lot on my school textbooks, or even on loose paper lying around the house. But I never went to art school,” she said.\n“Living in a pragmatic society like Singapore, I never knew that I could make a living out of becoming an artist, so it wasn’t a career path I even considered,” Ciao continued.\xa0 “When my mum saw me drawing too much, she would say things like ‘focus on your studies’, ‘go to university’ and ‘get a good job’.”\nAfraid to break the mould, Ciao took the more conventional path. “I studied in a junior college. Following which, I went to a local university and studied business. While I didn’t think of becoming an artist, I did want to be an entrepreneur.”\nThe pressure of having to keep up her good grades in her youth meant that her love for drawing took a back seat. But a university exchange programme to the Netherlands, and her subsequent travels around Europe, ignited her passion once again.\n“When you travel around Europe, you tend to see a lot of street artists around, something you don’t usually see in Singapore. For example, you can be having tea at a cafe, and an artist would be painting underneath the Eiffel Tower in Paris. I was very inspired, and it motivated me to pick up drawing again,” shared Ciao.\n“Living in a pragmatic society like Singapore, I never knew that I could make a living out of becoming an artist, so it wasn’t a career path I even considered.” – Grace Ciao\nGOING VIRAL\nBack in Singapore, Ciao would spend hours in her hostel room in school, drawing on her sketch pad. The subject of her drawings, she shared, are mostly women and girls. “It’s sort of like a representation of myself,” she reflected. “I used to draw mums with their daughters, girlfriends hanging out, and as I grew older, I started watching a lot of fashion shows. So I began drawing runway outfits.”\nCiao would upload her works on her Instagram account, eventually building a substantial following. One day, a wilting rose on her study desk, given to her by an admirer, caught her eye. “I started placing the petals on my drawing, and I got carried away.” She ended up creating a couture gown made entirely of rose petals.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\n“My likes on Instagram suddenly blew up to a few hundreds. I realised I must be doing something right, so the next day, I bought another flower and tried again.”\nThe flower girls, whom she affectionately calls Bloom Belles, have now become her signature. Ciao’s works on Instagram eventually caught the attention of US entertainment site Buzzfeed, which described her illustrations as “unconventional”.\nThe viral nature of the article started attracting more followers to her Instagram page, including those from the US, Singapore and around the region. Today, Ciao has over 78,000 followers on the social media platform.\n\n\nSCORING HER BIG BREAK\nCiao scored her big break in 2014, when she was still a student in university. Swiss watch company Jaeger-LeCoultre (JLC) had sent in an email, expressing their interest to fly her to Hong Kong for a timepiece showcase they were holding.\n“As a student, to have such a big brand approach you was quite amazing. I was even scared that it wasn’t real,” quipped Ciao.\nAfter a couple of meetings with the JLC Hong Kong team, Ciao flew over to the city to do a live art demonstration for the four-day press and VIP event, held at the International Financial Centre. “I did some drawings of gowns and cocktail dresses to pair with the timepieces showcased.”\nFrom there, Ciao says that her career began to blossom naturally. She soon caught the attention of other luxury brands, and quickly became a constant presence at VIP, press and customer events for Chanel, Dior, Elie Saab and more.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\nWith a list of notable names as clients, Ciao decided to take the plunge and pursue a full-time career as an artist after graduation.\nWhile there was concern from her mother that she would only be “famous for a while”, Ciao was certain that success was in her own hands. “It’s within my control to make sure that this career is sustainable. If I’m no longer famous, I would have to think of ways to branch out. I always felt that whether I am successful or not is on me, it’s not circumstantial,” she reasoned.\xa0\n\n\nEVOLVING THROUGH THE YEARS\nAs a Singaporean artist working with top international brands, Ciao says she feels “honoured and humbled”. “I see it as a validation of my work.”\nThese days,\xa0“people don’t see me as just an artist, but more of a business”, Ciao said.\xa0Over the years, she has taken great care to innovate. It’s where her business background, and knack for entrepreneurship, have certainly come in handy.\nAside from live art demonstrations and workshops, Ciao also does art licensing for advertisements and commercials, as well as merchandising and brand collaborations.\xa0\nOn hindsight, this has proven to be a shrewd move, considering how events are almost non-existent in a pandemic era. While Ciao used to fly to countries and cities like Japan, Shanghai and Beijing for events, the pandemic has put a stop to her travels. “Thankfully, I have evolved. You can’t be too fixated on one aspect of the business,” she said.\nIn 2015, Ciao collaborated with beauty brand Estee Lauder to create illustrations for a collectible series of liquid compacts. “When I saw my products on the shelf, and people wanting to buy them and own them, that really made me feel fulfilled as an artist,” she said.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\nA year later, she illustrated her Bloom Belles for a UK TV commercial for women’s personal care product company, Soft & Gentle. “They animated my girls and brought them to life. It was something I had never done before.”\nThere are\xa0also the illustrations she has done for ION Orchard, which Ciao said “helped to present information in a digestible way”. “This is the value that artists can bring, where they make things simpler and easier to understand,” she added.\nThrough the years, Ciao has also had the privilege of illustrating portraits of local celebrities, her favourite of which was JJ Lin. When the singer was announced as ambassador for OSIM in 2019, the brand engaged Ciao for a custom illustration.\xa0\n“I couldn’t give him the portrait in person, but I posted it on my Instagram. He actually commented on the post to say thank you, and then he followed me! That was quite cool,” Ciao chirped.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\nOther celebrities and influencers she has illustrated include Rebecca Lim, Arissa Cheo and more. “I also did an illustration of a Singapore minister, but I wouldn’t consider him famous,” she laughed.\nFor those who’d like to get their hands on a custom illustration from Ciao, once a year, she takes in orders from the public, a service she describes as a “small access” to her works, which are usually reserved for clients and high-end brands.\nHowever, to maintain the exclusivity of her works, and to balance her demanding schedule, orders for custom portraits are limited, Ciao stressed. “Clients would also have to wait at least three weeks for the illustration to be complete,” she said.\nCHASING HER OWN DREAM \nSoon, Ciao’s dream of seeing her ethereal gowns worn in real life will come to fruition. She recently collaborated with a Japanese bridal company\xa0to design a collection of wedding gowns.\xa0\n“Some brands have used my illustrations on their apparels, but this is the first time that my designs are turning into ready-to-wear gowns,"" she shared.\xa0\nDetails are still kept under wraps as the launch of the collection has been pushed back due to the pandemic. But Ciao is excited to see her designs come to life. “I’m getting married soon, so I was thinking of asking them to ship one of my gowns to me!” she quipped.\nAs a creative in Singapore, Ciao admits that not everyone “understands what I do”. “People don’t really appreciate the value of art in Singapore. Last year, there was talk that artists are non-essential. But I don’t really care what people say. As long as I am happy by my standards, good by my standards, then that’s fine,” she stated.\nReflecting on her career, Ciao is thankful to be able to live out her dream. “Throughout my youth, I felt like I was always chasing other people’s dreams. I was trying to take the prestigious route, going to a local university, studying business, even doing an internship at a bank at one point. But now, I’m chasing my own dream and working hard for myself.”\nLooking towards the future, she hopes to one day see her signature Bloom Belles turn world-famous. “My idea is to make them so popular to the point that everyone knows who they are,” she said, before taking a pause.\n“I don’t know if it’s a good comparison, but they could be as famous as Hello Kitty or Mickey Mouse. I know it’s a bit farfetched, but why not, right?” she continued with a smile.\n""I don’t really care what people say. As long as I am happy by my standards, good by my standards, then that’s fine.""\xa0– Grace Ciao\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     fashion ']}"

      Vacheron Constantin is back with three more watches you can’t buy
  </h1>, 'text': 'The biggest names in watchmaking have earned their place in many winders and wishlists by making watches that appeal to as many people as possible. Vacheron Constantin obviously does this, too, releasing every year a plethora of timepieces that cover everything from the simple to the complicated, the sporty to the elegant, and the bedazzled to the meticulously handcrafted.\nBut the truly heart-stopping pieces are the ones it can make to appeal to just one person: You. That is what Vacheron Constantin’s Les Cabinotiers department was set up to do. Whether it is to customise existing models or to build completely original ones based on their customers’ wildest fantasies, the highly skilled team behind Les Cabinotiers are up to the task.\nSince the options seem endless, Vacheron Constantin releases a handful of one-of-a-kind models every year not only to remind its clients of what its watchmakers and artisans are capable of (i.e a lot), but to serve as inspirations for future horological dreams. The brand’s theme for 2021 is Le Temps Celeste, meaning Celestial Time, and the three unique pieces recently unveiled at Watches & Wonders are indeed out of this world.\n\n\nARMILLARY TOURBILLON PERPETUAL CALENDAR – PLANETARIA \nAn armillary sphere is a crude model of the universe made up of a framework of rings used by early astronomers to demonstrate the movements of heavenly bodies, and it is this ancient tool that inspired the conception of the Armillary Tourbillon Perpetual Calendar – Planetaria.\nThe dial provides a lot of information, but everything has been thoughtfully laid out for easy reading. To start with, the hours are placed in the sub-dial at 3 o’clock, sharing the space with a precision double moon phase.\nTwo more spheres (weighing just 0.12g each) are located at the top and bottom of the dial, representing the Northern and Southern hemispheres respectively, and these complete rotations in opposite directions along the 24-hour scales that rim each globe. The tinted sapphire crystal halves that sit above the globes also act as day/night indicators.\nThe northern sphere is also where you’ll find the retrograde day of the week, while the southern one is dedicated to retrograde months. On the far right arc of the dial is a retrograde date, and a tiny aperture at 4 o’clock reveals the leap year.\nFinally, the eye will be drawn to the double-axis tourbillon and its spherical balance spring – an arresting example of the popular complication that Vacheron Constantin first made for the Reference 57260 in 2015, the most complicated pocket watch in the world.\nThe Calibre 1991 that resides in this 46mm by 20.2mm pink gold case was four years in the making and is made up of 745 components. The movement itself, which has been certified with the Hallmark of Geneva, is a manual winding one measuring 35mm by 11.2mm, and has a power reserve of approximately 60 hours.\nMINUTE REPEATER TOURBILLON SKY CHART LEO CONSTELLATION JEWELLERY\nSince this year’s theme is dedicated to the heavens, a constellation motif is apt, even if the chosen constellation seems somewhat arbitrary. Still, this watch could be a teaser for what Les Cabinotiers will able to accommodate in terms of specific astrological Zodiacs (to go along with its annual Chinese ones for extra luck).\nThe watch’s namesake dominates the top half of the dial, where brilliant-cut diamonds are set in the constellation of Leo. The hand-guilloche that fleshes out the lion’s form was apparently an added challenge for the craftsmen, as the rose engines used to engrave its polygons and lines are traditionally used to engrave more circular, geometric patterns.\nIn the lower half, a stunning one-minute tourbillon spins away as it bears the small seconds hand. The chamfering and polishing of the tourbillon’s bar alone took 36 hours of manual work.\nThe watch is also equipped with a minute repeater – the same one first used in the 16-complication La Tour de I’lle watch created for the brand’s 250th anniversary in 2005 – as well as a rotating star chart on the back.\nAnother poetic complication borrowed from the legendary Reference 57260, the star chart completes one rotation every sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds). An off-centred ellipse also highlights the current position of the stars in the Northern hemisphere.\nThere’s just enough bling on this piece as well. A hundred baguette-cut sapphires are split among the bezel, lugs and crown, and the 45mm white gold case is paired with a dark blue alligator strap with a gem-set gold buckle.\nCalibre 2755 TMRCC is the movement taking care of it all, and the 413-part movement will require manual winding every 58 hours.\nREGULATOR PERPETUAL CALENDAR – MOONLIGHT JEWELLERY SAPPHIRE \nPerpetual calendars are one of the most complex endeavours in watchmaking, and all too often they look the part, too. There do exist examples that streamline the indications to the point of being austere, but this lightly iced model by Vacheron Constantin finds a happy middle ground by using a regulator-style dial.\nRegulator watches (and historically, clocks) are characterised by hours and minutes that run on different axes. The hours are usually placed inside a sub-dial while the minutes are centrally mounted, as seen here in the Regulator Perpetual Calendar – Moonlight Jewellery Sapphire.\nBy highlighting this 18th-century style, the brand has stuck to the use of just two sub-dials, with the lower one dedicated to a highly precise moon phase encircled by a date indicator. Meanwhile, the day and month can be read from small apertures on either side of the hours sub-dial in the top half of the watch face.\nIn order not to disrupt this pleasing symmetry, the leap year has been placed unobtrusively at 4 o’clock within the hours sub-dial.\nArtistry fills up the rest of the space. Radiating from the centre is a spiral guilloche that meets a ring of 36 baguette-cut diamonds alternating with 10 sapphires. Beyond that, another 44 baguette-cut diamonds sit in a white gold bezel measuring 42mm wide.\nOn the back, you can admire the movement’s circular-grained mainplate, bridges decorated with Cotes de Geneve, and more guilloche on the 18K red gold oscillating weight.\nAside from the rotor, the entire watch stays true to its cool, frosty theme, as it comes with a matching dark blue alligator strap and an 18K gold pin buckle set with 12 baguette-cut diamonds.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     investment ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ']}"

      It’s going to take a g-force of 30,000g to damage this watch
  </h1>, 'text': 'The inside of a jet cockpit can be pretty brutal, which is why watchmakers like IWC have dedicated a large chunk of their know-how to making its pilot’s watches extra durable with proprietary case materials like the lightweight, hard and scratch-resistant Ceratanium (a patented material made of ceramic and titanium).\xa0\nWith the exterior taken care of, it was time to look inwards, and after eight years in development, IWC’s answer to that is finally here in the form of the Big Pilot’s Watch Shock Absorber XPL.\nEven in more civilised life, watches are prone to the accidental knock or drop, so IWC created a new, patented shock absorber system dubbed the “SPRIN-g PROTECT”. It uses a cantilever spring (the part coloured gold) to suspend the movement inside the case, and is made out of Bulk Metallic Glass, a material manufactured to be much more elastic than conventional metals. The crown’s winding stem was also engineered to allow the movement to displace independently of the case and spring.\n“When a watch suffers an impact, the movement and its components are subjected to high g-forces. If a pilot accidentally hits his watch against a hard surface in the cockpit, for example, accelerations are in the range of 300g to 1,000g,” explained\xa0Dr Lorenz Brunner, IWC’s department manager of research and innovation.\xa0“Our shock absorber system protects the movement so efficiently that it survived accelerations in excess of 30,000g in impact tests.”\xa0\nThese tests were conducted by the Fracture & Shock Physics group at the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University, so you could probably get away with hurling the watch Richard Mille-style onto the ground as a party trick without worrying about damaging the movement.\nTo reduce the weight and mass that the shock absorber has to hold, the Big Pilot’s Watch Shock Absorber XPL uses a titanium casing ring for the system, and runs on a lightweight version of IWC’s 32000 movement series created specially for this watch.\nThe in-house 32115 calibre uses a base plate made of aluminium alloy, but aside from that you’ll find all the other specifications familiar: 4Hz frequency, 120-hour power reserve, 100m-water resistance and bidirectional-pawl Pellaton winding system.\nDespite being the first watch out of the IWC Experimental engineering division (the “XPL” in the name stands for “experimental”), the design is fairly traditional. The 44mm Ceratanium case is dressed in a matte black finish and encloses a simple black dial with uncharacteristically small Arabic numerals.\xa0\nOnly 30 pieces will be made, with 10 pieces released a year, and will be available exclusively at IWC boutiques or through its concierge service.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ']}"

      On women's fashion and body positivity: Is the term ‘plus-size’ outdated?
  </h1>, 'text': 'When it comes to fashion and how women style themselves, those with bigger silhouettes are often told to go for loose dresses and dark colours for the longest time.\xa0\nThe rationale is that these are ways to “hide” their bodies to “help” them look smaller.\nIt’s slowly looking like the type of advice that isn’t ageing well.\n“Sack dresses and dark colours are ways to make yourself look ‘slimmer’ or hide your ‘extra weight’ – which really doesn’t positively impact a woman’s esteem,” explained Mary Victor, the Singaporean makeup artist and plus-sized model behind the movement #TheBodyWithin.\n“This is still society’s way of telling us that, if you’re big, you still need to hide yourself.”\nBecause of that mindset, older, curvy women tend to wear clothes that are loose and dark because showing one’s curves might look “indecent” or “not flattering”.\nBut with greater advocacy for body positivity and conversations in the media and social media to establish more acceptance of women of all sizes, the world of fashion is slowly but surely embracing beauty in bigger sizes.\n\n\nBODY POSITIVITY AND LISTENING TO OURSELVES\nWhat exactly is body positivity? Victor defined it as a way to promote self-love and positivity regardless of how your body looks.\xa0\n“This helps with confidence and is a way for those with disabilities or struggling with disorders\xa0or self-love to find peace and happiness with themselves,” she said.\nHowever, Victor also highlighted that body positivity can sometimes lead to something toxic “where we might end up being overly positive that we forget that we still need to validate our negative feelings”.\nInstead, she advised: “Listening to ourselves even on a bad day might actually help us heal a lot more. That’s body neutrality – it focuses on appreciating what amazing things your body does for you and teaches you to accept the\xa0changes your body goes through.”\n\n\nMeanwhile, fashion stylist Joshua Cheung believes\xa0that body positivity is two-fold:\xa0How we feel about our own bodies, and how media outlets and fashion houses portray body ideals through their images of models and celebrities.\n“Do they represent all of us, in all our different shapes, sizes, colours? With the same imperfections? Are they portrayed or styled in a manner that reflects and commands dignity and respect?” he said.\n“I believe both these factors are dependent on each other – we are exposed to what is ‘socially acceptable’, and we begin to feel that way about ourselves, or we already feel that way about ourselves and it\'s reinforced by the socially acceptable that we see out there.”\nDIVERSITY IN MAGAZINES, ON THE RUNWAY AND TV\nIn the aesthetically-driven world of fashion, purveyors have long favoured slim and sleek silhouettes. These often-unrealistic body ideals have been blamed for placing unnecessary pressure on girls and women to conform, resulting in some of them falling prey to anorexia or bulimia.\nCheung described how fashion houses would make a line of clothing in one standard size for their runways.\xa0\n“As such, if you were a model, you would want to fit into that one standard size during the fitting, especially if you wanted to walk the runway for that fashion house. These are the same clothing items that were used in shoots for magazine shoots, celebrity dressing and so forth. So this one-size-fits-all brand of beauty was everywhere.”\nBut he pointed out that attitudes towards bigger silhouettes are experiencing a welcome change.\xa0\n“We are certainly seeing a lot of diversity in magazines, on the runway, on TV. We\'re even seeing icons celebrating their imperfections, and they\'re being put front and centre.”\nCheung said that with changing mindsets, consumers now want to see people who are like them in positions of prominence, and brands, too, would have to follow suit to connect with consumers.\xa0\nHe also highlighted that younger consumers are also veering towards the raw and diverse.\xa0“They champion diverse causes and if media outlets, fashion houses and music houses, want to appeal to them, they\'ll have to cater to their tastes.”\n\n\n‘WOMEN SHOULDN’T COMPROMISE ON STYLE’\nVictor shared the sentiment. “I finally am seeing a little change. With brands hiring more inclusive and diverse models, I see many women feeling more comfortable with who they truly are. Which is amazing!""\nShe added: ""With more women slowly opening up about their journey with their body and mental health, this has motivated many brands to include all sizes for every body type.”\nSo with greater acceptance, bigger women are finally having more fun with fashion.\xa0\n“Globally, many body neutrality/positivity movements have shown that women shouldn’t compromise on style and that\xa0if brands can make garments for smaller sizes, they can make them for all sizes,” said Victor.\nShe added that social media has also been a huge help bringing the discussion to the forefront.\n“Social media has been helping majority of curvy women with how they can style themselves without hiding their curves and I’m living for it. It has even taught me a new sense of boldness I never thought I could achieve,"" she said.\xa0\n""Two years ago, if you asked me to wear a crop top with pencil skirt, I would freak out.\xa0But now, I can wear that anywhere, anytime without even thinking about if it’s ‘flattering’ to society’s standards,” she said.\xa0\n\n\n‘PLUS-SIZE IS A NORMAL SIZE’\nBut, Victor cautioned, there is still room for improvement. “I can’t simply go out to shop for a 1X-3X size at any store. I have to first do research if a store has that sizing and majority of the physical stores here don’t.""\nOn the positive side, ""our local small business fashion brands are doing amazing things for the community by including all sizes without hesitating. Some even offer to ask for your measurements to give you the perfect fit and for brands to put so much effort to improve inclusivity in Singapore, I see a lot of changes happening for women who felt like they were never seen.”\nWhile Cheung agreed that more labels are making clothes for bigger women, he hoped for greater progress. “There\'s more to do in terms of providing options for curvy women, though,” he said.\nAnd then of course, there\'s how\xa0 you describe things. Simply put, will the term “plus-size” ever go away?\xa0\n“‘Plus-size’ is there to help curvy women shop easier knowing that a specific brand serves that size but ideally, the term shouldn’t even be there in the first place! Plus-size is a normal size and should be categorised with all the smaller sizes. And fashion brands should start having all sizes instead of S-L,” said Victor. \xa0\nWhile it is wonderful to see that change is taking place when it comes to body acceptance, what’s also important to remember is that good health remains the priority, as Cheung reminded.\n“I agree with celebrating diversity, and having ample representation in the media,"" he said.\nHowever, he added, ""I would caution that we shouldn\'t be advocating unhealthiness, for the sake of size diversity. It\'s a very thin line. So we have to find a middle ground and that middle ground is healthy"".\n\n\nWHERE TO SHOP\nCheck out these clothing retailers who embrace bigger sizes:\n\n\nSTYLE TIPS\nMake your clothes work for you with these tips from fashion stylist Joshua Cheung.\n\n\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': [""     Women's Style "", '     fashion ']}"

It was being run by Angela Missoni’s daughter, Margherita Maccapani Missoni, who stepped aside, while its future is being decided.\nCEO Livio Proli told Women\'s Wear Daily that the family backs his five-year plan to restructure the company after the impact of COVID-19. Missoni reported a net loss in 2020, with a 33 per cent decline in revenues from 110 million euros (US$134 million) in 2019.\n“Angela is showing sensibility and courage as well as foresight with this decision, which will contribute to kick-start the third cycle of the company with a new injection of energy and creative strength,” Proli said. “She will accompany the evolution of the brand, but she realised she would have conditioned the company in staying on"" as creative director.\nOne goal is to reach more younger customers, expanding from the brand\'s “extremely loyal customer base of over-40s,” he said.\nProli said the nearly 70-year-old brand needs to be “dusted off and made more relevant and cool.

But in a year that’s proving not much lighter than the last, these unapologetically vibrant wrist candies are just what we need to brighten up our days.\n\n\nBREITLING CHRONOMAT AUTOMATIC 36 SOUTH SEA CAPSULE COLLECTION \nBreitling has the reputation of being among the burliest of watch brands, but it actually has a history of making a handful of women’s timepieces since the 1940s.\nThat handful is quickly snowballing into a truckload, seeing as the new ladies’ Chronomat 32 and 36 released last year had seven and 10 versions respectively.\nJoining the offerings this year is the limited-time South Sea Capsule Collection. There are three versions in steel, with a lacquered dial in beige, midnight blue or mint green, with matching alligator straps.\nEach one channels tropical energy with its warm, sparkly gem-set bezel, subtle golden hands and diamond-set hour markers. They are powered by the COSC-certified Calibre 10, with a 42-hour power reserve.\nCHANEL ELECTRO\nSome of you may have hung up your party hats long before the pandemic, but that doesn’t mean the aesthetic of 80s electro needs to be retired.\nThis year, Chanel leans hard into the music genre’s culture by injecting electronic funk into four of its collections: J12, Boyfriend, Code Coco and Premiere.\nThe most extravagant of these lie in the J12 range, flaunting bezels and hour markers set with baguette-cut sapphires paired with bracelets and cases made of trendy materials like ceramic and sapphire crystal.\nThe high jewellery showpiece, the J12 Electro Star, adds a twist on the rainbow theme by setting the coloured sapphires in the winding rotor and the bracelet links’ sides. If you find rainbows a styling nightmare, the J12 Electro Box spreads the colours out with 12 watches, each one set with 46 sapphires of a single colour.\nFRANCK MULLER VANGUARD SKELETON SAPPHIRE COLOUR DREAMS \nThere are so many variations of Franck Muller’s Vanguard watch – a sporty take on the brand’s famous Cintree Curvex tonneau-shaped watch case – that there is almost certainly a Vanguard to suit every mood. Even a zany one.\nThe Vanguard Skeleton Sapphire, which first showed up in 2017 with a sapphire case and icy white movement and strap, is back this year in full colour.\nThis Colour Dreams edition reveals the skeletonised movement in an explosion of shades, and the colours even extend to the crown and the text on the case. Given the plasticky look of sapphire crystal, this watch runs the risk of looking like a toy, but a plaything this is not. The manual-winding FM 1740-VS is an in-house calibre that offers a hefty seven-day power reserve.\n\n\nHUBLOT BIG BANG MP-11 POWER RESERVE 14 DAYS 3D CARBON RAINBOW \nHublot’s Big Bang MP-11, with its seven barrels, two-week power reserve and powerful bulging case is a pretty serious watch. And it has been appropriately fitted in the past with pretty serious materials like 3D Carbon, sapphire crystal, high-tech ceramic and scratch-resistant gold. This year, it comes in a much cheerier mood.\nNo stranger to unlikely material combinations, the 45mm carbon fibre case has been bedazzled with 48 stones comprising rubies, amethysts, blue topazes, green tsavorites, and sapphires in hues of pink, blue, yellow and orange. The HUB9011 is an in-house automatic movement, and has a water resistance of 30m.\nPIAGET LIMELIGHT GALA PRECIOUS RAINBOW \nWhile some watchmakers need only set their watch bezels with precious stones to add a flash of glamour, Piaget prefers to do things the hard but breathtaking way. This version of its iconic Limelight Gala watch uses the brand’s signature Palace decoration. These fine lines are hand-engraved so each dial took two hours just to decorate, with another eight hours spent on the bracelet, which was also assembled by hand.\nThe 32mm rose gold case is then crafted using the serti descendu technique, also known as cut-down setting, that involves carving out special grooves in the gold so that the gems set in them will sparkle not just from the top, but from the sides as well. Gem-setters then had the added challenge of having to find coloured sapphires and green tsavorites in progressive sizes for the Limelight Gala’s distinctive bezel shape.\nROGER DUBUIS EXCALIBUR GLOW ME UP\nRoger Dubuis’ rainbow is one you can only see in the dark. Once the lights are out, the 60 baguette-cut diamonds on the bezel and parts of the movement light up like a little disco.\nAchieving this effect involves filling the stone-setting grooves with coloured Super-Luminova, while a second, patented process enables the lume to be applied on the angles of the movement and the star-shaped bridge.\nIn the day, it looks like a diamond-set, pink gold version of the brand’s new Excalibur Single Flying Tourbillon. Though the overall design is highly reminiscent of past Excalibur watches with flying tourbillons, this year’s series features a new movement (the RD512SQ), a thinner profile and a slightly more streamlined design. The Glow Me Up is limited to eight pieces.\nZENITH DEFY 21 FELIPE PANTONE\nArgentinian-Spanish artist Felipe Pantone has no connection to the famous colour matching system, but he does have a strong affinity for the use of bright shades.\nHis collaboration with Zenith last year saw the watchmaker’s main building facade clad in Pantone’s vivid artwork, and the partnership returns this year with the artist’s first watch project.\nZenith’s Defy range already has a series of brightly coloured novelties this year in gem-set green, blue, purple and orange, but Pantone’s take is far less conventional.\nThe multi-coloured bridges, hands and indices is the result of a special surface treatment using PVD and silicon particles, and required months of trial and error to find the solution that would give off this particular rainbow hue.\nOther elements that make this Defy special include lightning-shaped hands; moire-effect stripes on the movement and sub-dial; a grid pattern on the black ceramic bezel; and the characters “F”, “P”, “#” and “1” (representing Felipe Pantone and Zenith’s El Primero movement) engraved on the corners of the case.\nLimited to 100 pieces, each watch comes with a book-like presentation box bearing an original miniaturised painting by Pantone and a signed certificate, and an additional rubber strap with a rainbow insert. Available exclusively at Zenith boutiques and online shop.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     timepieces ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Coming soon to Singapore: Louis Vuitton’s collaboration with the NBA 
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’re a fan of basketball and Louis Vuitton, you might want to bookmark\xa0May 28. That’s the date that the Louis Vuitton x National Basketball Association (NBA)\xa0collection drops in stores and online.\nThe French fashion house first announced a three-year creative partnership with the NBA in January 2020. Now in its second season, the latest collection is inspired by 1990s basketball mania, designed by creative director Virgil Abloh.\nSome key pieces were conceived alongside streetwear and luxury sportswear designer Don Crawley. Crawley was formerly Kanye West’s manager, and was integral to the latter’s rise to fame as a clothing designer.\nThe collection draws inspiration from the wardrobe of a professional basketball player and revolves around three dress modes – travel, game and press conference.\nFor travel, casualwear manifests in relaxed takes on suits such as a blouson and trouser quilted in the pattern of the Louis Vuitton floral motif, a logo-adorned hoodie, a technical parka matched with performance trousers and more.\nTaking cues from the game itself, informal blousons, shirts and shorts are adorned in graphic, multicoloured letters spelling out Louis Vuitton – each font referencing the typeface of an NBA team – while shorts are emblazoned with the house’s varsity-style logo.\nThe press conference wardrobe takes on a more professional aesthetic with a boxy black tailored suit, overcoat and a graphic-embossed leather bomber jacket.\nBags in the collection include ball pouches and basketball carries, for those who are true fans of the game. Leather bags, including the Keepall, soft trunk and more feature a grain developed to evoke the texture of a basketball.\nJewellery features in the collection too, a tribute to accessories worn by basketball players in the 1990s. Chain necklaces are magnified to extra-large dimensions while a boxy ring fronts the LV x NBA logo, a reference to the league’s championship ring.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     sport ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ']}"

      Gucci marks 100 years with exhibit on radically shifted codes
  </h1>, 'text': 'Alessandro Michele has radically shifted Gucci codes and challenged fashion norms in his six\xa0and a half\xa0years as creative director of the brand founded by Guccio Gucci as a travel bag company in Florence 100 years ago.\xa0\nTo mark the centenary, Michele has curated an exhibition in the Gucci Garden gallery, on Florence\'s Piazza della Signoria, that underlines some watershed moments in his era. Those include an advertising campaign for perfume featuring a transgender model, an all-Black cast for the pre-Fall 2017 campaign and a lipstick campaign featuring everyday faces in all their imperfections.\xa0\nThe exhibition will be reproduced in seven cities, including Shanghai, Tokyo, Sydney and Seoul.\xa0\nThe 48-year-old designer credited CEO Marco Bizzarri, who tapped an unknown Michele from the Gucci design team to take over as creative director in January 2015, with allowing him leeway to go beyond the usual schemes driving the luxury business model.\xa0\n""No one would have wanted, we can say it, a transexual in the world of beauty,"" Michele told reporters Thursday in Florence.\xa0\nHe said the campaign, featuring Hari Nef, Petra Collins and Dakota Johnson walking through a field of wildflowers, proved conventional fashion world wisdom wrong by creating ""an absolutely up-to-date female imagery.""\n""If fashion and the fashion market want to continue to have a stage, there needs to be some sort of movement. That campaign, in a very gentle and very poetic way, gave space and voice to a world of very different femininity,"" Michele said.\xa0\nLikewise, Michele said the casting of only Black models in the 2017 campaign was at the time a breakthrough, noting that ""things have changed in a dizzying and very fast way in the last year.""\nThe pandemic year has been a year of collaborations, including with North Face, and Ken Scott and Doraemon. A tie-up with Balenciaga will reach stores later this year. Gucci revenues rose 20 per cent\xa0to 2.16 million euros (S$3.49 million) in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period last year, Women\'s Wear Daily reported.\nMichele\'s eclectic style, which has gone a long way toward mainstreaming genderless codes, especially for men, has created a sort of tribal following. Dubbed the Gucci Gang, Michele has fully embraced the power of that very distinct crowd during his pandemic year collections, which have been unveiled as digital presentations.\xa0\nThose collections include this year\'s Aria\xa0that ends with the runway cast converging dreamily in a garden, to Ouverture\xa0last November, with videos by Gus Van Sant featuring an Italian actress moving through a rarified Roman landscape with her Gucci tribe.\xa0\nMichele said the brand\'s real-life fans defy easy description, ranging in age ""from 10 to 90.""\xa0\n""It has happened that someone who could be my mother\'s age greets me, or that Marina Cicogna (an 86-year-old film producer) tells me, \'When I go in the store, I find crazy things,\'"" Michele said.\xa0\n""It is strange because [we]\xa0also manage to dress someone who is 13 years old. Not only: Yesterday a young person stopped me who had a tattoo that said ""Blind For Love,"" and it was not the first,"" Michele said, referring to one of the popular slogans that have adorned his creations.\xa0\n""Evidently it was a strong detonation of something that already existed,"" Michele said of his collections.

      Confident women and the art of power dressing in a #woke world
  </h1>, 'text': 'Power dressing has always captured the zeitgeist of the moment. Originating in the 70s, it peaked in popularity in the 80s and 90s when “I mean business” suits and heavily-padded shoulders became a staple for women trying to make an impact in the workplace.\nThe 80s movie classic Working Girl not only celebrated women getting ahead in the corporate world, it celebrated the culture of power dressing, with Melanie Griffiths’ wardrobe evolving to embrace wide-shouldered, authoritative blazers and tailored suits as she journeys to the top.\nWith the increasing number of women entering the workforce in the 80s, there was a need for women’s fashion to borrow from the corporate wardrobes of men in order to embody the strength and authority needed for credibility in the workplace – in short, to fit in with the boys.\nPower dressing used to refer to the “battle gear”, said personal stylist Fumi Lee, “that people wear to important meetings and business occasions. It focused on strength and career which, of course, may still apply to the business world these days. But now, it’s changed to refer to outfits of a certain style, put together to bring out the individual’s personality”.\nThe 1990s and noughties saw more relaxed silhouettes as women started to cement their place in the corporate world. The look softened with fluid lines and feminine touches such as softer shoulders, and more sensual cuts and fabrics.\nWhen the #MeToo movement started to create an impact in 2017, highlighting gender equity and sexual respect, power dressing too began embodying a look that focused on defying norms, expressing strength and celebrating femininity. The movement’s awakening of the collective conscience around gender inequality has naturally influenced fashion – in a #woke culture, women decide how they should look, what they want to wear and what makes them comfortable.\n\n\nThen came the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In a year of lockdowns and working from home, virtual connections took over the world and power dressing again took on a different turn.\nOver Zoom and Teams meetings, people got a glimpse into each other’s homes and lives. Dressing comfortably took precedence over dressing formally. After all, it may seem like too much effort to put on a formal blazer when you’re remaining in the confines of your home, especially not with children tugging at your sleeves, and when everyone else you’re connecting with is in hoodies and t-shirts.\nWhat came from the experience is that people got to be at ease with their appearance, know what they feel comfortable in and feel assured to present their real selves.\nBut after many months of attempting to conduct ourselves professionally in trackies, T-shirts and dishevelled hair, many women are now longing to return to some semblance of formality in their work appearance. With vaccinations rolling out, societies embracing a new normal and the corporate world returning to a different version of the work environment as we know it, how can we dress for the workplace?\nOne thing’s for sure, power dressing isn’t going away any time soon. What it has evolved into is a more self-assured, self-aware look, with a touch of personality. “Power dressing is now a tool to bring out one’s individuality,” said Lee.\n\n\nSo whether it’s a blazer, power heels or tailored suit with a softer cut, the trick is to inject your own personal style into it and to feel completely comfortable doing it as you climb your way up the corporate ladder. In a #woke new normal society, the rule in power dressing is\xa0– have fun as you dress for success but don’t forget to be yourself.\nSo if you’re looking to reinvent your wardrobe to return to the office, here are some things to look out for when you put together a wardrobe to complement your winning ways in the new normal work environment\nBROAD SHOULDERS\nFor days when you want to make a statement, go wide with dramatic shoulders. If the sharp-shouldered Balmain look is too much\xa0for you, opt for padded shoulders that immediately create\xa0a strong silhouette.\nGo for an oversized, padded blazer for a more chic look. Strong shoulders are not only impressive, they’re also flattering for all body types. Best of all, they go well with everything – a silk button-down or worn with jeans and a shirt. Just change the shoes and accessories to switch from day to night or wear it with dresses, pants or pencil skirts.\nBLAZING IT\nIf you want to ease into going back to the office but still cut a professional figure, perhaps opting for casual blazers with a softer silhouette can add an air of formality without overdoing it. Best of all, it’s flexible enough to be worn at a formal event or a more casual social outing. VVB by Victoria Beckham features relaxed blazers that will make the transition back to the office comfortable yet stylish.\n\n\nGO BRIGHT\nEnough of the dreariness that was 2020. It’s time to celebrate the new normal by injecting some yellow and pink into your work wardrobe. If you prefer a subtler effect, try pairing a tank top in pink or yellow with a neutral skirt or pants or accessorise in these colours. But if you like it bolder, choose a dress or pair of pants in either colour to make a statement. Draw inspiration from Tom Ford and Valentino who went bright and zesty with their recent collections.\nMAKE IT MONOCHROME\nIf you just can’t find it in yourself to slay with colour, you’ll be happy to know that monochrome is so on trend and perfect for the corporate setting. Take your cue from Chanel, Jil Sander and Proenza Schouler for that monochrome effect. Pair white and black separates or opt for dresses and suits that feature a monochrome design. Black and white are always winners in the corporate setting.\xa0\nWIDE-LEG WINNER \nRoomy trousers that cut an elongated silhouette are both comfortable and sophisticated. Opt for a silky pair for that super fluid, sensual look or go with bold hues such as red ones by Fendi for extra punch. Double up with a soft blazer for an overall relaxed look or pair it with a fitted vest for a chic ensemble.\nADDITIONAL POWER DRESSING TIPS\nPersonal Stylist Fumi Lee recommends these tips to help you win at the art of power dressing:\n', 'related_topics': ['     women ', '     fashion ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style "", '     Career ']}"

      Creative Capital: The Indonesian creating fancy fans inspired by wayang kulit
  </h1>, 'text': 'How do you shop for someone who has run one of the country’s top fashion magazines for years?\xa0That\xa0was the dilemma my wife recently faced\xa0when\xa0she had to look\xa0for a birthday present for a close friend, who is also a respected and well-known trendspotter.\xa0\nShe decided that the present should bring together East and West, and it should be from Singapore or the region\xa0but also have global appeal. It should be by an up-and-coming designer that our fashion-savvy friend would be proud to talk about whenever she used the gift.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nMy wife ended up purchasing\xa0a fan from Pubumesu, a\xa010-year-old brand founded by Singapore-based, Indonesian designer Putri Soediono. Her leather fans, made by artisans skilled in producing wayang kulit puppets, have fast become one of the must-have accessories among tastemakers\xa0who admire artistry, craft, and a little wit and heritage.\nAnd we’re not just talking about local tastemakers. In 2019, Pubumesu launched on Net-A-Porter\xa0and can be found in stores in the US, UK, UAE, South Africa, Maldives, Turkey, Malta and Indonesia.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nHI PUTRI, TELL ME ABOUT YOUR LIFE BEFORE PUBUMESU. I UNDERSTAND YOU\'VE WORKED AT SOME VERY RESPECTED FASHION HOUSES BEFORE.\nOh my god, where do I\xa0start? I was born in Jakarta\xa0but grew up in Singapore, and from the age of five\xa0to 18, I studied\xa0at the Overseas Family School. I would definitely call myself a third-culture kid, feeling more at home in Singapore but still feeling connected to Indonesia.\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nLater, I was accepted at Central Saint Martins (CSM) and off to London I went. That would definitely be the most anxious yet exciting time of my life. There were so many things to see and experience. I mean, right outside my campus, we saw a new Banksy artwork sprayed across the road one day.\xa0I then moved on to\xa0Cordwainers at\xa0London College of Fashion to pursue a degree in fashion accessories.\nI was a sponge, immersing\xa0myself wholeheartedly in the London life, going to BoomBox at Shoreditch to watch Jodie Harsh spin, dancing with my girlfriends at the Notting Hill Arts Club\xa0– all while taking in the culture and history that the city had to offer.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nMy life in London opened my eyes to the fashion world and how to take something from concept to the shop floor. I saw what it took for a business to sustain itself through working at Vivienne Westwood, and what it took for a business to develop and grow at Linda Farrow.\xa0Someone had told me\xa0when I was at CSM:\xa0“You don’t think clothes and you’re too loud for jewellery”.\xa0On hindsight, that is true and I definitely preferred working with leather.\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThen\xa0came 2009 and it was hard to find work. I returned\xa0to Singapore with my tail between my legs. I\xa0allowed myself to take a step back and figure out what I could do with all this experience that I had accumulated. I launched Pubumesu in 2011.\xa0\nBefore that, I worked\xa0with my family at their education business in Central Java, Indonesia, and spent a lot of my time\xa0travelling around the archipelago looking for suppliers and craftsmen.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nWERE YOU CREATIVE FROM YOUNG? WERE\xa0ART AND DESIGN ENCOURAGED BY YOUR PARENTS?\nDefinitely! Art, whether it was music or design, was always encouraged in my house. My mother is a classical pianist. I trained as a classical singer and my grandmother definitely encouraged this when she saw that I had\xa0potential beyond just a hobby.\xa0\nI can definitely say that my grandmother paved my career for me. She made me take art lessons when I started drawing family and friends for fun,\xa0and singing lessons when she saw that I had no fear to get up on stage and entertain.\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nI think in her mind, she wanted to give me all the tools available\xa0so I could master my craft\xa0if, or when,\xa0I did choose to pursue art as a career. My initial\xa0dream was to be a classical singer but my parents shot down the idea of me going to Juilliard.\nWHAT DOES THE BRAND NAME PUBUMESU MEAN?\xa0\nPubumesu is simply an anagram of my full name,\xa0Putri Bunga Meita Soediono. It is a literal\xa0translation\xa0from Indonesian to English:\xa0“Princess"", ""Flower"",\xa0""May"" and ""Soediono""\xa0(my family name).\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nHOW LONG DID IT TAKE FROM CONCEPTION TO LAUNCH? TELL ME ABOUT THAT JOURNEY.\nThis is another long story but the seeds of Pubumesu\xa0were planted during\xa0university. I remember the exact time and place I thought of Pubumesu. It was after a business lecture at the Cordwainers campus and I was discussing one of my papers with the tutor, talking about why there were not many known Asian designers promoting their cultures in\xa0the fashion scene. That tutor encouraged me to take the leap. From there, the idea went into my final degree collection, which\xa0was driven by the concept of modernising traditional craftsmanship while preserving traditional techniques.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nBetween 2009 and 2011, I developed\xa0a lot of samples, travelled\xa0all over Indonesia and allowed\xa0myself to discover new mediums and techniques. Through this journey of discovery, the concept evolved into wanting to tell the story behind the products, highlighting the men and women, and the time and hands that\xa0made the pieces that I designed.\xa0\nLuckily, a friend of mine let me sell my products at Potatohead Bali, and it was there that I was able to test my price points, quality and branding. We\xa0sold\xa0out at the boutique and that gave me the confidence to launch at Blueprint Singapore, which, at the time, was the tradeshow to be at in the region.\xa0We then joined the Keepers Designer Collective and\xa0ended up selling in Tangs. Despite that gradual success, it still was not the\xa0massive break that we needed.\nWHAT WAS YOUR VERY FIRST DESIGN?\nMy very first design was the Durian bag. It was simply a tote that was covered in spikes. The idea came about on my sourcing trips during the durian season. For my Market Collection, I was able to recreate this tote into a clutch version.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nHOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THE IDEA TO SPECIALISE IN FANS?\nAs mentioned, I started doing bags first\xa0and it was really difficult to get my foot in the door, especially when you are competing with larger and more established accessories brands. My biggest issue as a company was that we did not have a very good entry-level product.\xa0\nMost accessory brands would\xa0produce card holders and wallets but I felt that this was wasteful and pretty dull. It was during the making of Market Collection, my second collection, when\xa0I focused on a\xa0photo of fish arranged like a fan\xa0in a basket\xa0taken\xa0at a wet market. Eureka! Fish fan!\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nI went to my bag factory in Central Java and started to develop a way to make fan blades out of leather. We dipped the leather into hot oil, water, but that\xa0did not work. After a month of failed\xa0samples, I stumbled across a village that specifically makes wayang kulit (shadow puppets)\xa0and found a workshop that made traditional Javanese fans.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nHOW LONG DOES EACH FAN TAKE TO PRODUCE? WHAT IS THE PROCESS?\nIt takes three\xa0weeks to make one fan: Two\xa0weeks to stretch, sand down\xa0and dry the leather, and the last week to\xa0cut, punch holes, paint\xa0and sew.\nWHAT GAVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE AND COURAGE TO START THE COMPANY?\nI knew I had a story to tell, a story about finding balance between old and\xa0new, East and West. I wanted to show the world that Asian designers have a lot to show in terms of culture and history, and I wanted to show that we were not just a region that produced cheaply made things or a culture that gets wrongly appropriated.\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThis rang true when the ikat\xa0craze came about and the\xa0motif was everywhere! Being Indonesian, I knew which ethnic culture it\xa0belonged to and its history, but no one else did. We educate ourselves on Chanel or Hermes, so why can’t we educate others about our own rich Asian history?\nWHAT DO YOU HOPE YOUR PRODUCTS SAY ABOUT YOU AND\xa0THE CULTURE FROM WHICH YOU DRAW INSPIRATION?\nI hope people can first see how much fun I have with fashion, because if I can’t give you that sensational feeling that I have, then I feel like I have\xa0failed as a designer or an artist.\xa0\nSecond, I hope people can see that the traditional can be beautiful in a contemporary sense, and that there is still a place for it in this ever-changing and modernising world we live in.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nDO YOU THINK IT IS HARD FOR ASIAN DESIGNERS TO BREAK INTO GLOBAL MARKETS?\nBefore social media, yes, it was hard for Asian designers. You needed to have a lot of capital to get the right showroom, tradeshow or PR company. Today, though, the world is so small. With just a touch of your finger, you can connect.\xa0\nAnd, today, many retail buyers like to find brands on Instagram. Also, at the end of the day, if you have an amazing product that looks like nothing anyone has ever seen\xa0and an amazing story behind it, it’s more likely to be\xa0a success.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nWHAT PART OF YOUR WORK DO YOU ENJOY THE MOST?\nThere are two things that I love the most about what I do. The first is being able to materialise the ideas in my head. The second is knowing that what I’m doing helps the community.\xa0\nFrom just the fans we make, we have\xa0been able to bring\xa0life back\xa0to a very old art form that no one outside of Indonesia really knows about –\xa0and making sure that it can last for generations to come. Seeing the production develop from a single craftsman to a village industry is very rewarding.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nWHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS THAT YOU DIDN’T EXPECT?\nRejection. Besides affecting cash flow, it also affected my confidence when someone did not buy into the product that I have\xa0created. For a lot of us designers and artists, everything we conceptualise has a small part of our soul in it.\nWHAT ARE ONE OR TWO OF THE MOST REWARDING MOMENTS FOR YOU SINCE STARTED PUBUMESU?\nThe most rewarding would be retailing at Browns in London. Other than\xa0it being a very exclusive boutique nestled behind Bond Street, it gave me the gratification I needed as a designer and business owner. I used to shop\xa0there with my grandmother and dream about one day having my pieces displayed there. I slowly manifested that dream.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThe second is seeing how happy people are when they see my pieces for the first time. With my fans, they’re in awe of how beautiful they are;\xa0with my bags, they’re in awe of its quality.\nWHAT IS YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS?\nI take\xa0inspiration from everything in my life, for example with the\xa0Market Collection, I took inspiration from my trips to the wet market with my grandmother. I wanted to create wearable versions of what we see when we’re in the market:\xa0Banana leaves, fish, fruits, and vegetables.\xa0\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nThen, I start sketching out the ideas I have in my head, just to flesh them\xa0out.\xa0This helps me with conveying my idea before I take it to the process of sampling. I would\xa0love to say that I’m the kind of designer who\xa0creates beautiful sketch books with every collection, but I tend to just draw on loose paper and compile them all\xa0into a file at the end.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThen, I make spec sheets or blueprints of my sketches, so I can send them over to the workshop or factory for sampling. If I’m designing a bag, I’ll try and make the patterns myself first, so that the person making my sample has an immediate idea of what I want. Designing to me is basically imagining a final product in my head, then figuring out how to make an IKEA\xa0manual for someone else to make it for me.\nWHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY IN YOUR LIFE LIKE?\nIt is quite dull! I walk my dog, tidy up the house, and around 9am, I check my emails. I break for lunch at 12pm\xa0and work until 6pm, work out and then cook dinner. Hopefully, I am in bed by 10pm.\xa0\nThere are\xa0a lot more administration\xa0and logistics to handle now that we have\xa0become international. But when I need to be creative, I have to allocate a week for that as it is quite difficult to switch between my creative and business heads.\xa0\nI’m also really lucky that I have\xa0figured out a way to work remotely even before the pandemic.\xa0But if we had the ability to travel again, I would\xa0be making\xa0sourcing trips every quarterly and checking on the production in Indonesia.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Pubumésu (@pubumesu)\n\xa0\nDO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE ALREADY ACHIEVED SUCCESS OR ARE YOU STILL AIMING FOR GREATER HEIGHTS?\nOh no,\xa0I have\xa0only broken the first glass ceiling!\xa0We still need to figure out how to expand, find investors\xa0and keep building the brand without sacrificing our original vision. And this is just the business side of things.\xa0\nMy next goal would definitely to be like Mansur Gavriel, where we can start doing apparel;\xa0I hope that will happen in the next few years. There are\xa0still so many things to make and explore, and there is really no limit to what a creative mind can do.\xa0\nIS THERE ANYTHING EXCITING IN THE WORKS THIS YEAR THAT YOU CAN SHARE?\nWe are launching at\xa0Farm Rio in the US at the end of May, so that is pretty exciting. They have stores in New York, Miami\xa0and Los Angeles.\xa0\nDue to the pandemic, our exclusive collection launches at\xa0Liberty of London and Harrods fell through last year, so we are trying to regain\xa0those lost deals for the next two years when the world starts to come out of this global crisis.\n', 'related_topics': [""     Women's Life "", ""     Women's Voices "", '     Accessories ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Despite the pandemic, Alexander McQueen had a ‘record’ year in 2020
  </h1>, 'text': 'There are few fashion labels that outlive their founders. There are fewer still that go on to flourish, to become globally recognised brands, ratcheting up hundreds of millions of euros in sales per year. That this happened to Alexander McQueen after the suicide of designer Lee McQueen in 2010 is nothing short of extraordinary. It was a business then both rooted in a singular founder and, at the time, just barely eking a profit.\nIts survival owes much to the vision and devotion of McQueen’s steadfast deputy of 14 years, Sarah Burton, who has honed the house’s reputation for acute tailoring and romance whilst introducing clothes that are softer, more feminine and easier to wear.\nIts continuation also owes a debt to former McQueen chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd, who backed Burton over suggestions of poaching a better-known designer from another house and also laid the foundation for McQueen’s global expansion, and to Kering founder and chair Francois-Henri Pinault, who recognised the power of the McQueen brand and rejected the advice of those within the group who thought it best to bury the label with its founder.\n\n\nIf that team set the stage for McQueen’s evolution, it is 47-year-old Emmanuel Gintzburger who has been charged with executing and enlarging it.\nGintzburger, a loquacious former Saint Laurent retail executive who cut his teeth at Louis Vuitton and Sephora, took the helm at McQueen in 2016 following Akeroyd’s decampment to Versace. For five years he has guided McQueen’s global expansion with a steady hand, doubling its store count to 100 between 2017 and the end of 2020, and broadening the label’s offerings in footwear, menswear and leather accessories.\n“The ambition has very much been to transform McQueen from one of the creative designer brands into one of most powerful luxury houses in the world,” said Gintzburger over a Zoom call in late March from McQueen’s headquarters in Clerkenwell in London, where the French national has been working through most of the pandemic.\n“Four to five years ago, the brand was very much on a designer brand model, very much focused on ready-to-wear, very much [driven by] a small number of very strong international clients sold through mainly US and European wholesale channels,” he explained.\n(As of 2014, ready-to-wear accounted for just over half of sales, and leather goods only a fifth; today the spread is “much healthier across categories”, Gintzburger said.) “The objective we have is to scale up, work across channels, categories and age groups . . . starting from retail.”\nKering, which also owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, does not break out revenues for McQueen. But the brand has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of about 15 per cent for the past six years, with revenues doubling from just over €250 million (S$400 million) in 2014 to more than €500 million last year, Citigroup analyst Thomas Chauvet estimates. In its first-quarter earnings report last week, Kering said McQueen and Balenciaga’s performances were “outstanding”, with growth “particularly robust in their retail networks in North America as well as in Asia-Pacific”.\nGintzburger said McQueen had a “record” year in 2020, increasing sales and market share in spite of myriad challenges imposed by the pandemic. That was thanks to an aggressive retail expansion now in its fifth year – McQueen opened 22 locations last year, including Miami and Tokyo.\n“We’ve mainly been focused on flagships in China, the US, Korea, the Middle East and Japan – locations that are very strong with local clients, [rather than] destinations relying on tourism,” he explained.\n\n\nGOING LOCAL\nThat focus on local customers, which began three years ago, played out handsomely in 2020, when few people were able to holiday abroad. (Many luxury stores, particularly those in European capitals and in Southeast Asia that catered largely to visitors from China and the Middle East, had to suddenly pivot their focus to regional customers last year.)\nIt also helped that McQueen had taken greater control over its e-commerce operations (formerly facilitated by Yoox Net-a-Porter) and has been steadily curtailing its wholesale channels, “focusing on key partners” over a broad network, said Gintzburger. The company is also transitioning from a wholesale to a concession model with e-tailers including Net-a-Porter, MatchesFashion and Luisaviaroma, which gives the brand control of inventory and pricing.\nExpanding the product assortment and price range has been vital to customer recruitment, particularly among younger clientele who don’t necessarily want to commit to one of the label’s nipped-waist trouser suits (from £2,000; S$3,700) or magnificently constructed dresses (worn most famously by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for her 2011 wedding to Prince William).\nIn lieu of a head-to-toe look, a younger customer might instead pick up a gold-tone skull ring set with crystals and faux pearls (£220), a waist belt in black leather (£650), or one of the brand’s ubiquitous white trainers with their distinctive exaggerated soles (£390). The handbag offer has also expanded, though the brand has yet to deliver a hit to rival its trainers.\nComing out of the pandemic, Gintzburger thinks we’ll see greater diversity in how people dress. Thus when it comes to product assortment, “the wider you are, the better positioned you are”.\nThe pandemic also gave McQueen an opportunity to overhaul its delivery and markdown schedule. Collections are now sold at full price for more than six months after arriving in stores, instead of only three to four.\nLike fellow Kering brands Gucci and Bottega Veneta, McQueen has not taken part in digital fashion weeks during the past year, instead unveiling collections on its own schedule. When physical shows resume, will McQueen return to Paris Fashion Week? Gintzburger demures, saying that in the current environment, “it is impossible to plan six months ahead”.\n“What we know is right for sure is that moving the presentation of the collection closer to the moment it’s delivered in store works for us,” he said.\nGintzburger’s crystal ball might be cloudy when it comes to fashion weeks, but he is confident in forecasting one long-term development: The shift from a “linear” fashion model, in which products are made from finite resources and ultimately discarded, towards a “circular” model, whereby materials and products are designed to be perpetually reused and regenerated into new products. “Linear models are finite,” he said.\nHe says that Burton and her team are focused on designing products from good materials that are season-less and made to last, and reusing fabric where possible. The company has also endorsed the second-hand market, partnering with resale platform Vestiaire Collective (which parent company Kering recently took a five per cent stake in) to help collect gently worn pieces from customers that can be resold on the site in exchange for store credit.\nWould McQueen consider reselling second-hand garments and leather goods via its own retail channels? “Everything is possible.”\nRecently, Hermes revealed that it was working on a bag made of a leather alternative derived from mushrooms, seen as a response to growing concerns about animal welfare and the environmental impact of rearing cattle and tanning leather. Gintzburger said McQueen is also testing alternatives to animal leather, although there are not yet plans to bring any products to market.\nKering boss Pinault has made no secret of his ambition to see McQueen surpass €1 billion in annual revenue. Gintzburger said the brand’s ability to increase market share during the pandemic has given the company confidence in its strategy; now, with a global vaccination rollout under way, he’s focused on accelerating it. Key targets include customers in China, the US, Korea and Japan.\nBut it’s imperative not to grow too quickly. The challenge for a brand such as McQueen is to maintain its creative, emotional and artisanal qualities as it expands.\n“How do you scale a brand without losing the essence of what the brand represents?” he asked rhetorically. “When you’re on a smaller scale, it’s possible. But as you start to grow . . . it’s not a given.”\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2021 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     celebrity ', '     Rebecca Lim ', '     Desmond Tan ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Ladies, here are 6 tell-tale signs it’s time to replace your worn out bras
  </h1>, 'text': 'It might seem like an odd topic to broach, but if you ask around, you might be surprised at how most women don’t know when they should be replacing the bras in their wardrobe.\nGuess what, though: They are not exactly wrong, because there isn’t a definite time span by which you should do so.\nIt really depends on a few factors, including the quality and make of the undergarment, which will directly influence how long it will last you. At the same time, the frequency of wear and level of rotation you put your bras on will also directly affect how quickly they wear out.\nFor example, if you find yourself always reaching for the same few basic bras despite owning a drawer full of other options. This naturally means that those essential pieces are likely to wear out way ahead of the other bras that you wear much less often.\nHow you wash your bras also impact their lifespan. Hand-washing will, of course, be the best option – otherwise, you can zip them up in a laundry bag before putting them on the gentle cycle in the washing machine. Tossing them into the dryer is not a good idea, as the heat will break down the elastic over time.\n\n\nAs a general guideline, you should check your bras to see if they need replacing around the six-month mark.\nThey may need to be replaced for reasons other than wear and tear – weight fluctuation or body changes as a woman moves through different stages of life are two important ones. Wearing an ill-fitting bra doesn’t just create an unflattering silhouette, it can also lead to health issues such as neck ache or backache because of a wrong fit or inadequate support.\nTrust us, you will be able to see and feel it when the time comes to replace your bra. Just pay attention to these signs and try not to put off shopping for new ones for too long.\nTHE BAND HAS GOTTEN LOOSER \nFor most people, the band on the bra tends to deteriorate the fastest in comparison to the other parts of the undergarment. You should already know this tip by now – when buying a new bra, always ensure that you can wear it with the band secured on the outermost hook.\nDoing so will ensure that there’s as much room as possible to adjust the fit so as to compensate for the inevitable, gradual slackening of the elastic in the band that goes around your back. If you’re already wearing your bra on the innermost hook, it’s about time you replaced it.\n\n\nTHE STRAPS ARE STRETCHED OUT\nBra straps constantly slipping off your shoulders are a sure sign that they have lost much of their elasticity. If you’ve already tightened them as far as possible, it’s high time to toss out your bra. In some cases, you may be able to simply replace the straps and make the bra go a longer way – but don’t let that allow you to hold on to one that’s visibly reached its expiry date.\n\n\nTHE CUPS HAVE LOST THEIR SHAPE\nWhether they are padded or not, the cups will stretch out with wear over time. This means that the bra will no longer be as supportive as when it was first purchased and worn. Once the cups stretch out, they may not fit your boobs as perfectly as before.\xa0\nYou might see gaps or “depression” lines that are caused by the upper rim of the cups pressing down on your breasts. These fit issues can become apparent through your clothes, when you’re wearing an outfit in a stretchy or drapey fabric.\nPadding will also thin out over time or may develop a wrinkled or lumpy appearance with repeated washing – it’s not a good look especially if you’re wearing a tighter-fitting top or dress. In case you didn’t know it, it’s also a glaring signal to others that you’re wearing an old bra that’s clearly due to be chucked.\n\n\nSo what if the fabric on your bra cups is pilling? No one can see it anyway, right? You’re wrong if you think that. Pilling can show up as unsightly texture under your clothing, particularly those in a thin or stretchy fabric. Besides that, it’s simply a fashion and personal-grooming don’t.\nWhat you wear underneath your clothes can affect how your silhouette looks, as well as the impression you make on others. Such are the little details that people may glimpse on closer interaction with you, even if they, of course, won’t be constantly staring at your boobs.\n\n\nYOU’VE LOST WEIGHT, OR PUT ON A FEW POUNDS\nWeight fluctuation happens to the best of us, whether you’re on a diet, had too much to eat in the recent months, have recently gotten pregnant or are currently going through menopause.\nFor most women, the boobs are often the first area of the body to change, following weight loss or gain. This means that it’s important to replace your bras when either happens, so as to ensure wearing comfort.\nThere’s no point in putting up with a too-tight bra while trying to lose the extra pounds you’ve packed on of late. Buy a couple of bras in your new size and wear them for now, and save those that you previously wore for when you’ve finally lost the weight. Because, as we all know it, an ill-fitting bra can be an absolute pain to wear.\n\n\nYOUR BREASTS HAVE CHANGED\nIt’s inevitable that a woman may experience changes to her bosom because of age and hormonal fluctuations. Over time, breasts may lose fat, causing breast tissues to lose elasticity and skin around the chest area becomes thinner. Besides some level of sagging, the girls may become less firm and either get bigger or smaller depending on the individual (since hormonal changes may also cause bloating or weight fluctuations).\nWhen the usual cup or band size no longer fits, it’s best to get refitted for a new bra size that will better suit your needs. Sometimes, you might find that a different bra style may be what you require instead — for example a more-supportive, full-coverage bra, while others who have lost breast volume may prefer a bra with padding that provides extra lift.\nIt’s wise to get a refitting every year or so – no matter what your age is – as a professional will be able to spot any fit issues that you might have missed. Get a fitting, too, if you’re shopping for bras from a brand that you’ve never worn – fit and size can vary slightly from brand to brand and a minor variation can make a whole lot of difference.\nIn fact, do it whenever you feel that your bras are fitting differently or uncomfortably. It doesn’t cost you anything and will save you the money you might spend on buying a bunch of bras that are still of the wrong fit.\n', 'related_topics': ['     women ', '     fashion ', '     shopping ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Fashion industry evolves as the COVID-19 pandemic forces a rethink
  </h1>, 'text': 'The pandemic has torn a multibillion-dollar bite out of the fabric of Europe\'s fashion industry, stopped runway shows and forced brands to show their designs digitally instead.\nNow, amid hopes of a return to near-normality by the year’s end, the industry is asking what fashion will look like as it dusts itself off and struggles to its well-heeled feet again.\nAnswers vary. Some think the Fashion Week format, in use since the 1940s, will be radically rethought. Others believe Asia will consolidate its huge gains in influence. Many see brands seeking greater sustainability to court a younger clientele.\n“The impact of the pandemic will be unquestionably to increase the importance and influence of Asia on fashion,” said Gildas Minvielle, economist at the Institut Francais de la Mode in Paris.\n“Luxury in Europe has already rebounded but it’s only because it’s globalised, only because of Asian buyers,"" Minvielle said. ""They spent on European brands.”\nAsian buyers are still considered a largely untapped market, yet their wealth has recently tipped over that of Westerners. China, in particular, was already considered the worldwide engine of growth in the luxury industry before the pandemic. Its quicker containment of the virus will leave it in an even stronger position.\n“In the next 50 years money will come from the East as it has been (coming) in the last 50 years from the West,” said Long Nguyen, chief fashion critic of The Impression.\nThis could see a designer aesthetic that panders more to Chinese tastes.\nAnother trend that\'s been strengthened during the pandemic is the decision to forgo the frenetic pace of runway calendar shows.\nAs the virus tore across the globe from East to West, these morphed overnight from a live, in-person, sensory experience to a pre-taped digital display released online. Many predicted devastation for the industry, but houses have proved surprisingly resilient. That\'s because the system was already overdue a shift.\nSince the advent of social media, brands have become much less reliant on traditional advertising outlets such as fashion magazines. Now, they create their own online channels, circumventing the glossies, to get their designs out.\n“Each brand is a media entity unto itself,” Nguyen said, calling the way the industry operates “obsolete”.\nMoreover, as buyers themselves move online, houses have necessarily become much less dependent on traditional sales outlets such as department stores.\nSome houses have done better than expected with the new digital format. Smaller brands, in particular, have welcomed the break from staging runway shows that can be astronomically expensive – for relatively little return.\nThe virus saw many brands, including Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Bottega Veneta of French luxury giant Kering, tearing up the traditional calendar to show their new collections when it suits them – both creatively and financially. Saint Laurent started the trend last year, drawing headlines for quitting Paris Fashion Week to “take control of its pace”.\nThe advantage for these brands is to set dates on their own terms, with collections that don\'t compete with others for attention at the same time. Yet many nostalgic critics, buyers and consumers argue that nothing can replace the physical runway experience.\n“Brands have been deciding more and more when their optimal time to show is... They want to control their business more and that is their right,” Pascal Morand, Paris fashion federation Executive President.\n“But this is not the end to Fashion Week. No matter what people say they are all awaiting a return to the runway and to come back to the physical experience.”\nStella McCartney, who unveiled her fall collection off-schedule last month, said that the industry has been seriously questioning the relevance of seasons “even before COVID”,\xa0as climate change has sadly highlighted how absurd it is.\n“There was a moment at the beginning of lockdown – in the sky there were no airplanes, you could hear birds,"" McCartney said. ""Everyone was talking about nature reclaiming its rightful place,” she added, expressing frustration with the industry’s lifestyle that requires thousands of kilometers of travel per year.\nMcCartney said that across the industry now there is a sense that brands must embrace sustainability “in order to survive”, especially to attract the young, more environmentally conscious consumer.\nOne example of such eco-thinking is in reducing waste in collections. Luxury giants have been criticised in the past for burning unused or unsold luxury goods.\nAnd McCartney also doesn’t seem to think that this will be the end of the runway show.\n“I don’t think we will throw away where we are today and I don’t think we’ll dismiss where we were yesterday,"" she said. ""It took me a while, but I miss the energy at the end of the show, the engagement with my community, I miss seeing clothes in real life and moving, expressions of the models, the sound. That is the art.”\n(Source: AP)\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Beyond KonMari: How to declutter your pandemic wardrobe
  </h1>, 'text': ""Get-togethers are being planned without Zoom links. Restaurant diners are venturing back inside. As the vaccine rollout continues to gain speed, more companies are reopening their offices. We’re officially heading into new times.\nFrom a wardrobe perspective, these developments have generally meant one thing: Putting on non-stretchy pants again.\nButtons and zippers and buckles are back, and with them more difficult decisions about what to wear to be seen in the world. After a year spent without such choices, this hasn’t been the easiest transition for many.\nFor those who’ve neglected their closets during the pandemic, returning to a full wardrobe can feel more like a confrontation than a homecoming.\n“I feel like people need to be reintroduced to their closets again,” said Allison Bornstein, a celebrity stylist who began offering virtual styling sessions to non-celebrities early in the pandemic – and last month was her busiest month to date.\n“People are like: ‘Okay, it’s time to re-enter the world, and I need help. I have all this stuff, I don’t know what I want to wear, and I don’t like anything that I have,’” Bornstein said.\nProfessional organisers have been fielding similar complaints. Pia Thompson, founder of the home organisation company Sweet Digs, said she recently worked with a client who hadn’t even glanced at her dresses in a year. “Do I still want to wear any of these?” the woman asked while they sifted through her closet.\nSpending parts of the last year in confinement has made people question their lifestyle – their social circle, their self-identity and now their wardrobe. If the world outside doesn’t look the same anymore, why should they?\n“People see this as a time to really figure out how they want to show up now,” Thompson said. Figuring that out can mean experimenting with your appearance. But to get there, experts agree, you must first purge.\n“Get rid of the stuff that doesn’t feel like it fits your lifestyle anymore,” Bornstein said. “Get rid of the stuff that you’ve never liked. Decluttering makes it so much clearer to see what it is that you actually want to wear.”\nTHE RULE OF THREES AND THE KONMARI\nThere are many approaches to the closet purge. Nikki Boyd, the author of Beautifully Organized,\xa0recommends starting by arranging your closet by category – tops, bottoms and so on – then sorting each category by colour.\n“You’re able to see things like, ‘Why do I have 20 black shirts?’” she said.\nFrom there, Boyd suggested setting a few hard rules tailored to your needs. For example: Mo more than three of anything, including black shirts.\n“It’s just like anything else: No guidelines, no structure,” she said.\nA more emotional approach to decluttering comes from the school of Marie Kondo, the author, Netflix star and container manufacturer: Does the item you’re touching spark joy?\n“You get a thrill, your energy rises, you feel it in your heart as opposed to your head,” said Thompson, a “KonMari” consultant in training, describing what you’re supposed to be feeling when the response to joy is “yes”.\nThe KonMari method generally starts with clothes, then moves on to books and papers before ending with sentimental keepsakes – the idea being that clothing is the easiest to discard and personal souvenirs are the hardest. Except that’s not always true; clothes can carry as much baggage as mementos.\nWhen Rebekah Love found a pair of Levi’s that fit perfectly, she wore the jeans for years, until they eventually tore in the crotch. Even then she didn’t want to let them go. She realised they represented a rare kind of “understanding,” she said. “I found a brand that understands my body.”\nNow, as a professional organiser, she encourages people who cling to unworn clothing to identify what those pieces represent for them. She takes a holistic approach to organisation, comparing mediocre outfits to unsatisfying relationships: “If you were around somebody who didn’t make you feel good about yourself, would you continue to hang out with them?”\nDON'T JUST DISCARD, DONATE\nThe pandemic has inflated a classic closet problem: Holding on to things that no longer fit. A survey of more than 3,000 people by the American Psychological Association found that 42 per cent\xa0of them gained more weight than they intended in the pandemic. Within this group, the average weight gain was 29 pounds, with a median gain of 15 pounds. The prevailing advice is to let go of these aspirational clothes.\n“You reach for a pair of jeans that don’t fit, and that just ruins your whole day,” Bornstein said. “If they’re not an option to wear at this moment, just get them out of there.”\nStoring ill-fitting clothes in a suitcase or box is an option, however, if you expect or hope they’ll fit again someday (though Kondo may not approve). If you’re determined to keep these clothes in your closet, Boyd recommends tagging their hangers with a sticker. If you go six months without reaching for the tagged clothes, throw them out. But throw them out responsibly.\nWaste in fashion is a well-documented problem; a McKinsey report in 2016 found that “for every five garments produced, the equivalent of three end up in a landfill or incinerated each year.”\nInstead, used clothing can be donated to the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross or Goodwill.\nMadewell turns used denim into housing insulation through the Blue Jeans Go Green campaign, and the North Face sends unwanted clothing and footwear to the non-profit Soles4Souls. (Both retailers accept items from any brand, in any condition, and provide a store credit in return.)\nOnline resale platforms like TheRealReal consign luxury goods, and ThredUp consigns everything else. Poshmark and Depop allow sellers to list and ship items directly to buyers.\nWHEN CLUTTER ISN'T THE PROBLEM\nEven after a closet is edited and organised, getting dressed again will require practice.\n“When we’re not used to it – when we’re putting on sweatpants or staying in our pajamas or just wearing the same kind of thing every day – we’re out of practice,” said Bornstein, whose clients include actress Katie Holmes. “It is really daunting.”\nHer advice is to dedicate time to trying on clothes and experimenting with outfits. Take photos of your favourite combinations, put them in a folder on your phone, and refer to them like a catalogue when you need inspiration or need to get ready in a hurry.\nThis process requires a great deal of self-awareness. Boyd believes that a wardrobe should always feel relevant – that “your closet, at every point in your life, should represent you in that time.” As one of Love’s hypothetical questions goes: If you had to buy that piece of clothing today, at full price, would you honestly buy it?\n“It’s not just about decluttering and creating systems,” Thompson said. “It’s a matter of really being honest about the kinds of things you want to do with your life, and then making sure that you have clothing that supports those things.”\nThis doesn’t have to be an existential crisis. It can be as simple as roller skates.\n“If a client tells me they want to go roller skating, I know they’ll need to have their skates at the front of the closet, as opposed to way in the back of the closet, where they have been,” she said.\n“An organised closet represents who you are and who you want to be. It represents your truth.”\nBy\xa0Jessica Testa\xa0©\xa0The New York Times\xa0\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/at-home/virus-clothes.html\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     shopping ', '     retail ', '     Wellbeing ']}"

      Gucci celebrates 100 years with Alessandro Michele's Aria collection
  </h1>, 'text': ""Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele is celebrating the fashion house’s 100th anniversary this year, giving historic sweep to a collection unveiled virtually on Thursday (Apr 15)\xa0that embraced its equestrian heritage, borrowed references from the Tom Ford-era and outright stole from the French brand Balenciaga.\n“Gucci was born under some kind of constellation, because the power it holds is nearly inexplicable,’’ Michele told a video press conference.\nThe celebration party was set in a film-set version of London’s Savoy Hotel, where fashion house founder Guccio Gucci got inspiration to return home to Florence and open his own leather goods shop, specialising in travel bags that he had admired working as a bellhop.\n\n\nA post shared by Gucci Official (@gucci)\nThe collection was titled Aria,\xa0a reference to another Italian creation, lyric opera. Models walked down long corridor runways outfitted with hundreds of flashing cameras nailed to the wall in the place of absent paparazzi. A medley of Gucci-themed pop songs – proof, if needed, of the brand’s enduring relevance – provided the soundtrack.\nThe first look was a jag on Tom Ford’s 1996 red velvet suit, with a kinky leather harness over a powder blue shirt. Michele said in notes that he had “plundered” the “sexual tension” of Ford’s decade at Gucci from 1994-2004.\n“Tom understood right from the beginning that Gucci had some kind of magnetism, this cult power,” Michele said.\nMichele, who took over as creative direction of Gucci six years ago, put a fetishised spin on Gucci’s trademark equestrian references, including riding caps, fringed leather riding crops and spit-polished boots mixed with glamorous sequined evening wear, or subverted with erotic sheer dresses of logo-emblazoned netting. Models dangled long jewellery from their noses.\n\n\nA post shared by Gucci Official (@gucci)\nIn one of the collection's most surprising turns, Michele borrowed, or hacked, looks directly from Balenciaga, the Paris fashion house owned by the same parent company, Kering. They included a version of the Balenciaga Jackie bag and a glittery silver suit emblazoned with both Gucci and Balenciaga.\n\n\nThis was the first collection of 2021 for Gucci, which has left the fashion calendar and committed to only presenting two collections a year. The video presentation stuck strictly to the runway format during a pandemic year of experimentation that has all but shut down in-person shows.\nReflecting on the century marker, Michele said Gucci's magic is its ability to redefine itself over time, unbeholden to any strictly defined image.\n“I am trying to renew for the millionth time this brand, this name, this myth, this saga, because Gucci is a complex container that holds many, many things,” Michele said.\n(Source: AP)\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The true cost of demand for cheap clothes, to you and the environment
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: These are items Singaporeans can get more cheaply now than 10 years ago.\nIn fact, clothing prices have fallen to their lowest in a decade, according to the Consumer Price Index for last year — thanks to an explosion of retailers, including Zalora and Pomelo, competing on online platforms since 2010.\nWith prices going from as low as S$3 to S$15 for trendy clothes, Singapore’s e-commerce revenue from apparel and footwear jumped more than eightfold between 2016 and last year, from S$52 million to S$442 million.\nBut fast fashion comes at a price: The fashion industry released 2.1 billion tonnes of carbon emissions in 2018, according to McKinsey — more than the airline and shipping industries combined (900 million and 1.1 billion tonnes respectively).\nIs there a happy balance between bargain hunting and saving the environment? Or is the cost of cheap fashion greater than people expect? The programme Talking Point investigates.\nIT’S THE SUPPLY CHAIN\nOne factor in fast fashion’s prices is volume of production. Some “mega” e-commerce retailers can release between 500 and 1,000 items per category every week, said MDIS School of Fashion and Design lecturer Kae Hana.\nA top can be designed, produced and marketed so quickly that e-commerce has made fashion go even faster, “and it’s now called ultra-fast fashion”.\nIn this business model, retailers first find a trending style and create designs in small batches to test demand. If sufficient demand arises, more of those successful designs are produced to capture sales.\nThis can be done in double-quick time because of vertical integration in the supply chain. “(These e-commerce players) own the production companies … the fabric dyers (and) the logistics companies,” she cited.\nThis process, from concept to sales, takes as fast as two weeks or less. And with consumers “across the world”, the more an item is produced, “the cheaper it gets”.\nThe fashion industry’s long supply chain, however, is a reason for its high carbon emissions, said Chu Wong, the country co-ordinator of Fashion Revolution Singapore.\n“It starts with the agricultural and the petrochemical industries for the raw materials. It goes on into the manufacturing industry for the fibres to be turned into fabrics and eventually into clothing,” she said.\n“It touches the packaging industry (and) logistics industry. Eventually, it gets to the retail industry and to us.”\nThe low prices also lead to overconsumption and overproduction, she said. “Cheap fashion tempts us as consumers to purchase more because of the accessibility, and so more is produced. And that’s what makes cheap fashion so dangerous.”\nShe added that synthetic fibres, such as acrylic and nylon, are often used “because they’re cheaper” than natural ones. But they “have a higher carbon footprint” — the extraction process “is very energy-intensive” as they are oil-based fibres.\nECO-FRIENDLY AND INEXPENSIVE?\nThe more sustainable options include fabrics such as recycled polyester and Tencel. The latter is derived from wood pulp, usually from the eucalyptus tree.\nBut shoppers can do more than look at the fabric to find out how sustainably produced an item of clothing is, advised Susannah Jaffer, the founder of online platform Zerrin, which curates options in sustainable fashion.\n“Natural materials, like linen, Tencel (and) bamboo, are definitely more sustainable … because (they’re) biodegradable (at the) end-of-life,” she said.\nBut you need to go a little bit deeper … read labels, do research on brands. Also, look at how much information they’re sharing.\nSustainable clothing is not all that better for the environment either. For example, recycled polyester is made from recycled plastic and polyethylene terephthalate bottles but is not biodegradable, she cited.\n“When it comes to organic cotton, it uses less pesticides when it’s produced. However, it still takes 2,700 litres of water to produce an organic cotton T-shirt … the same as it would a traditional cotton T-shirt,” she added.\n“That’s more than we’d drink in two and a half years.”\nUsually, sustainable clothes are more expensive owing to their production methods and are produced in fewer numbers than those made from more conventional fabrics.\nAnd that higher cost is the main barrier stopping Singaporeans from buying sustainable clothes, according to a DBS “conscious fashion” survey in 2019.\nJaffer said many fast-fashion brands are able to produce cheaper clothes in their “sustainable capsule collections” because they still produce “over 90 per cent of their collections through the traditional fast-fashion model”.\n“It’s not possible (to have sustainable fashion at cheap prices) because you have to think about the additional costs of production, for better quality materials,” she added. “That could cost (sustainable brands) 50 per cent, 60 per cent more.”\nCOST VS QUALITY\nDespite the higher price tags, clothes made from sustainable materials are often more cost-effective in the long run.\nWATCH: Capsule wardrobe challenge: I survived on 5 clothing items for 10 days (9:04)\nWhen Talking Point put clothes made from different fabrics — including bamboo, cotton, linen, polyester and Tencel — through washing, comfort and durability tests, Tencel clothes retained their colours and shapes better after 30 washes, compared to cotton and polyester clothes.\nCheap clothes are suitable for short-term wear, after which many Singaporeans would donate or discard them.\nAccording to a CNA report in 2018, however, only about 10 per cent of the clothes given to the Salvation Army, for example, are sold in its thrift shops, while the remaining 90 per cent are exported.\nDaro Tan, a manager at SNI Trading, which has been exporting second-hand textiles for more than 10 years, said many of the clothes it receives go mainly to countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and South Africa.\nHe said exporting used clothing for reuse is more suitable than recycling, as each piece of clothing may comprise many materials, making recycling “too time-consuming” and manpower-intensive.\nImport restrictions in other countries, however, are making things more difficult for his company. These countries, he said, want to focus on their domestic clothing industries instead of depending on imports.\nSince 2018, tighter import restrictions have led to a 40 per cent drop in Singapore’s second-hand clothing exports. In 2019, of the 168,000 tonnes of textile and leather waste generated here, only 4 per cent was recycled, i.e. exported.\nThe rest ended up being incinerated. “It’s really a huge waste,” said Tan.\nSo what can be done to solve the problem of buying and throwing away cheap clothing to the detriment of the environment?\nWATCH: The full episode — Our love for cheap clothes: What’s the true cost? (23:54)\n“Perhaps less is more,” said Talking Point host Sharda Harrison, who created four different looks for herself from the same black outfit by, for example, combining it with jeans and different accessories.\n“With a bit of creativity, I can change up my style with clothes I already have and do my little part in saving our planet.”\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      Why Lena Dunham is championing high fashion for plus-size women
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the 10 or so years since she first became famous, Lena Dunham has been many things. She has been a wunderkind, a writer-director-actor-producer of both feature films and television series, voice of her generation, David Remnick mentee, Golden Globe winner and representative of liberal white privilege.\nShe has been a Vogue cover girl, newsletter maven and subject of social media shaming. Also head of her own book imprint at Random House, endometriosis and hysterectomy survivor, and oversharer.\nShe has been so many things, in fact (seriously, has it been only 10 years?), that it is kind of extraordinary to realise that one thing she hasn’t been is that increasingly beloved side hustle of almost anyone in the public eye: A fashion designer.\nOf course, that may be because another thing she has been is an often unfairly mocked presence on the red carpet, subject of cavalier memes and style police cruelty.\n“I am not,” she said recently, “a celebrity who’s ever been asked to represent a product. I am not a person for many reasons who anyone even wants to represent a product.” She does, however, love clothes.\nAnd in the process of wearing a lot of clothes, and getting a lot of clothes “slightly wrong”, and being attacked for the clothes she wore, she discovered a hole in the market. So being Lena Dunham, she decided she was the one to fix it.\n\n\nA post shared by 11 Honoré (@11honore)\nRecently, the 11 Honore x Lena Dunham debuted, a collaboration between Dunham and the e-tail site that has championed high fashion for plus-size women, getting runway designers to make their brands accessible beyond size 10.\nIt will be 11 Honore’s first celebrity foray, and it is a tightly edited collection of only five items, because, Dunham said, “I’ve totally given up on the idea of being any type of impresario or person who had something to say to everyone”. She was speaking over a Zoom call from London, where she has been holed up shooting a film.\n“Right now the only thing I’m doing is speaking about my own experience,” she said. “So this clothing line is a direct response to my experience.”\n\n\nIntroducing Lena, version 8.0 (or 15.0?): Humble-but-enthusiastic body-neutral advocate and new celebrity designer, at peace with herself and about to emerge into the world once more.\nNot just because she has another movie on the way (besides the film she is working on in London), called Sharp Stick and written during pandemic summer as “a meditation on the complexity of, uh, female sexual desire and how it intersects with trauma”.\nBut also because she is not only the designer of the clothing line, along with Danielle Williams Eke of 11 Honore, but its face and model. Yup, she’s putting herself out there again.\nShe knows what that may entail.\nBODY POSITIVITY… SORT OF\nAfter years of having a complicated and very public relationship with her body, of yo-yoing in weight because of medical and personal issues, Dunham, 34, has come to terms with it.\nLast March, she got the coronavirus. Everyone knows this, because she later posted “My COVID story” on Instagram, where she has 2.8 million followers. Though she has recovered, the disease affected her pituitary gland and left her with partial adrenal insufficiency, she said, so she is taking steroids.\n“Not the cool kind that make you muscular,” she said. “Just the kind that make your face fat. I’m trying to roll with that. Trying to be chin positive. I can deal with anything, but a triple chin is a hard place to land.”\nStill, she is careful to thank her medical team and talk about how she knows she is privileged to have access to private health care and to be able to do a job.\n\n\nA post shared by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham)\n“It doesn’t mean I haven’t felt a lot of body hatred in lockdown,” she said. She is not a fan of some current terminology, of words like “plus” or “curve” or “body positive”.\n“The thing that’s complicated about the body positive movement,” she said, “is it can be for the privileged few who have a body that looks the way people want to feel positive. We want curvy bodies that look like Kim Kardashian has been upsized slightly. We want big beautiful butts and big beautiful breasts and no cellulite and faces that look like you could smack them on to thin women.”\n“I have a big stomach, I always have. That’s where I gain my weight – especially after early menopause, I have a straight-up gut, like an old man – and that’s not where anybody wants to see flesh. It’s not like if I posted a sensual nude of myself on Instagram, people would be marvelling at my beautiful derriere.”\n\n\nA post shared by 11 Honoré (@11honore)\nAs she said this, she did not sound angry or depressed or like she was sticking it to the man. She sounded sort of resigned and amused at herself. She was sitting in a very white room with a fireplace, wearing a cable-knit cardigan and lots of rings on her fingers. Her hair was long, and her bangs were short. In the middle of the conversation, she suddenly began chomping on a sandwich, which made her laugh.\n“It seems appropriate for this interview that I eat this large baguette,” she said.\n‘WE’RE GOING TO PUT A WATERMELON ON YOUR SKIRT’\nDunham had been contemplating getting into fashion long before the pandemic began. She had originally thought she would make a full-fledged collection from size 0 to 20, because… well, she doesn’t really do half measures.\nBesides, she’s smart enough, and does enough research, to know that there is a proud history of female designers getting into the business because they know what is missing, whether it’s Coco Chanel or Donna Karan or even the Olsens. But, she said, “there was so much I didn’t know about the infrastructure”.\nIn 2019, she met Patrick Herning, the owner and founder of 11 Honore, where she happened to be a frequent shopper. The two bonded over proselytising for plus-size figures and began hatching a plan. Because Herning had recently introduced a private label line, he had the supply chain and design staff in place for Dunham. All she had to bring were the ideas.\n“I said, ‘You’re an actor, you’re a storyteller, let’s do this, and then we can do a sequel – \xa0Season 2,” he said.\nHere’s where she started: “What I really love in fashion is a certain level of playfulness and winky intelligence that people just don’t think bigger women want or understand. No one thinks plus women have a sense of humour, and if they do, it’s, ‘We’re going to put a watermelon on your skirt, you sassy girl!’ None of it has subtlety or true sophistication.”\n\n\nA post shared by 11 Honoré (@11honore)\nShe continued: “There’s so much judgment around bigger bodies, and I think one of the judgments is that bigger women are stupider. They eat too much and don’t know how to stop. Thin women must be discerning and able to use their willpower. Bigger women must be limited in their understanding of the world, and they keep doing things that are bad for them. The amount of people who have written to me on my page: ‘You’re promoting obesity. Don’t you understand you’re killing yourself. Are you stupid? Why are you doing that?’”\nFor her, fashion is character. She has a new boyfriend, whom she met in London – “It’s been a few months,” she said. “I feel really lucky.” He is a musician, she added, raised in England and Peru, and “the greatest person I’ve ever met”\xa0– and when she borrows his hat and leather jacket, she said, “I want to man-spread!” She considers the designers she loves, including Rachel Comey and Giambattista Valli and Christopher Kane, to be artists, so when she wears their clothes on the red carpet she is celebrating their art.\n“That’s why I never understand why anyone would want to go out on the red carpet in a nude column dress,” she said.\nWHAT DESIGNERS DON’T UNDERSTAND\nThe clothes Dunham has helped make for 11 Honore are not exactly nutty – they definitely are not going to change the world – but they have a little lift. She describes them as clothes for a day walking around SoHo doing all sorts of things.\nThey were inspired, she said, by the women she remembers from the 1990s, like Cindy Sherman and Kiki Smith, who would clomp around in men’s shirts and Yohji Yamamoto skirts and unbrushed hair because their very active minds were on other things. That’s a description that may overexcite those who associate her with elitism, but also one that is not entirely inaccurate.\nDunham’s mother, the artist and photographer Laurie Simmons, named each look after one of the family’s old haunts in SoHo, like the original Dean & DeLuca store on Broadway (now closed), which is the name of a navy pinstriped suit with scalloped hems on the jacket (Dean) and skirt (DeLuca).\nDunham’s father, Carroll Dunham, who is a painter, made the print for a geometric floral dress with an asymmetric hem that is called Madderlake, after a florist that also used to be on Broadway. The capsule collection costs between US$98 (S$131) for a ribbed mock-turtleneck cotton jersey tank and US$298 (S$399) for the jacket; sizes run from 12 to 26. (She herself has “settled into a size 14 to 16”.)\nDunham said she spent a lot of time on the fit because one of the things most designers don’t understand is that making clothes for bigger bodies doesn’t mean just adding more fabric or cutting the waist wider. You need to employ darts differently to encompass stomach curves and bottom curves and upper arms that swell in the heat.\nShe really wanted to include a miniskirt because whenever she tried to find one, it would hitch up in the back and, she said, “I can’t wear it because I’m basically showing what my mother would refer to as my pupick”.\nShe refuses to wear Spanx – most of the time, she said, she barely wears a bra — and none of the clothes she made require it. The one time she did wear a corset to an event, Glenn Close cut it off her in a bathroom.\n“She had a little butterfly scissor like a friggin’ angel,” Dunham said. (It was unclear why Close would have brought sewing scissors to a gala, but – be prepared!)\n“She also gave me the best advice. I was crying in my heels, and she said, ‘You get platform boots from a rave store, and you wear those.’ And I did, and I have. So, thank you, Glenn Close.”\nBy Vanessa Friedman © 2021 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     women ', '     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Ladies, clogs are back. But will you put your feet in them?
  </h1>, 'text': 'As I tried out a pair of black studded Hermes clogs, my husband pipped: “You look like you’re going to an S&M party in a cheese factory.” Apparently he hasn’t gotten the memo about how they are the “it” shoe of spring 2021.\nThe concept of an “it” shoe might seem a bit dated, a bit Sex And The City, but clogs are staging yet another comeback. Their revival was cemented by the Hermes spring/summer 2021 show, where every model wore a studded pair with a subtle H in glossy tones of chestnut, vanilla and black.\nFellow luxury players Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Celine all have their own spin on the shoe of the season. London-based designer Molly Goddard teamed up with Ugg on bright platforms, Hunter has introduced colourful rubber ones suited to gardening, while JW Anderson’s so-called “loafer mules”, with giant gold chains, begs the pressing existential question of where loafers end and clogs begin.\nThe archetypal carved wooden Dutch clog dates back to as early as the 13th century, but the shoe has had multiple incarnations since, appearing on 19th-century dairy farmers, in Van Gogh’s paintings and teamed with flares by Abba.\n\n\nWhat defines a clog now is fluid: Is it the wooden platform sole, typically with a leather upper? Or perhaps it’s the wide closed toe and open back. Birkenstock considers its Boston style – a flat mule that became ubiquitous over lockdown – a clog; Louis Vuitton’s version is a curious mash-up of a court and a clog.\nCertainly, clogs have a mixed reputation. For Colville designer and former British Vogue fashion director Lucinda Chambers, they are “both sturdy and cool”; to others they are lumpen and functional, to be accessorised with a deli counter hygienic hairnet.\nThey have a claim to being feminist footwear in the sense of subverting stereotypical notions of what is attractive, with a hippo-like heaviness that makes them if not the ultimate ugly shoe then at least an ungainly one: Christian Louboutin, purveyor of overtly sexy stilettos, once declared, “I hate the concept of the clog! It’s fake, it’s ugly and it’s not even comfortable.”\nThanks to their heritage as practical workwear, they are used to semaphore a cultivated artiness of the Kinfolk magazine-reading, ceramics-making, Margaret Howell-wearing variety.\n\n\nHowever, many styles can be difficult to wear. With its heavy wooden soles, the classic clog can be about as uncomfortable as the silences on a EU vaccine negotiation Zoom call.\nWhen Swedish Hasbeens clogs became popular in the UK some years ago, I planned to buy a pair, but the shop assistant was discouraging. “You won’t wear them,” she said, “they are hard and impossible to walk in.” But everyone deserves a second chance, which is why I found myself road testing the latest incarnations.\nWith its heavy 4.5cm wood sole, the Hermes pair initially felt quite destabilising. The curve at the front meant I rolled forward slightly as I walked, and lifting my feet took extra effort, as if moving through toffee.\nAfter a while, however, the extra height and solidity grew on me and I was . . . soled. Unlike traditional Dutch wooden clogs (which used to be burnt as firewood after they wore out) there was also a decent amount of cushioning on the insole. However, as a sneaker addict I still wouldn’t wear them to walk for more than five minutes.\n\n\nThe most comfortable pair of wooden clogs was Ancient Greek Sandals’ new closed-toe style, with memory foam padding on the insole. Co-founder and creative director Christina Martini said\xa0that the type of wood is crucial – she used pine because it’s light.\nHowever, Martini pointed\xa0out that comfort is all relative and “if you are used to wearing sneakers and switch to clogs, then you just won’t feel like you are flying because they don’t have a flexible sole. Since the pandemic, everybody’s comfort level is set at Birkenstocks and trainers.”\nAnd context is everything. While Martini used to click-clack around Paris in high-heeled Vuitton clogs, in Corfu where she lives, clogs are unsuited to the Greek island’s charmingly uneven pavements.\nShe saves them for wearing indoors in her studio, styled with wide-leg jeans and chunky wool socks, long dresses or wide black culottes and a white T-shirt for a clean look, deeming them “the perfect midseason shoe”.\nColville’s Chambers relishes this versatility too, saying: “You can be smart with them or a little bit country. I wear them with a stout, flecked black-and-white\xa0fisherman sock and then barefooted in summer.”\nAnd herein lies the real joy of clogs: Hermes’ sleek pair instantly updated my wardrobe in different ways. A black twill jumpsuit I’d worn with trainers looked more pulled together, less Kwik Fit; a floral midi dress shed its slightly “basic 2019 influencer” air and acquired some 70s Talitha Getty or Stevie Nicks bohemianism.\nLevi’s 501s with an oversized hand-knit sweater and thick flecked socks imparted a certain “Scandi architect with her own cinnamon bun micro-bakery” vibe (am I getting carried away here?).\nAs instant updates go, they are a winner, my husband grudgingly agreed. That’s after telling me the rather fetching Gucci pair with furry wool sprouting from them looked like I’d stepped on a troll. (I should point out that I don’t hugely care what he thinks of my footwear, but there’s no one else around to ask.)\nHowever, words failed him when it came to Hunter’s new utilitarian Play clogs in yellow, which resemble rubber ducks for your feet. Yet after just 20 minutes of me wearing them around the house and in the garden, he was asking if they came in men’s sizes and the slippery slope to slip-ons was complete. If 2020 taught us anything, it’s that life’s too short for shoelaces.\nBy Carola Long © The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     women ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      How Kim Kardashian’s billion-dollar brand Skims defies the pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'Not long after Kim Kardashian West launched her shapewear brand Skims in 2019, pandemic lockdowns consigned its body-fitting product line to the back of consumers’ closets.\nBut Skims survived. Moreover, it has become a billion-dollar business.\nThe company has raised US$154 million (S$206.62 million) in new funding, which Kardashian West said had lifted its valuation to US$1.6 billion. It is a heady amount for a not-quite two-year-old clothing brand, even one led by someone with her star power.\nIt also cements Kardashian West’s status as a billionaire in her own right. In announcing her entry into that club recently, Forbes estimated Skims’ value at much less than that. She will remain Skims’ biggest shareholder after the deal, and she and her business partner, Jens Grede, will control a majority stake.\nSkims benefited from a well-timed introduction of pajamas and loungewear, with product lines such as the “cozy collection” bolstering sales as women have traded form-fitting styles for sweatpants. But shapewear made Skims famous, and it remains the company’s central product line.\n\n\n“We’re your basics go-to,” Kardashian West said in a Zoom interview as she prepared for a photo shoot, even as “we’re still able to keep that shapewear core.”\nTo justify its valuation, she is counting on a return to normal – or, at least, to squeezing into tightfitting clothing again – to keep up the momentum.\nSkims is not the first billion-dollar business associated with the Kardashian empire, or with Kardashian West. She sold a minority stake in her cosmetics line to the makeup giant Coty, valuing it at US$1 billion. Her sister Kylie Jenner sold a majority stake in her own cosmetics line, also to Coty, in a deal that valued it at US$1.2 billion.\nSkims also isn’t Kardashian West’s first foray into clothing. She and her sisters Khloe\xa0and Kourtney had a line with Sears that essentially served as a licensing deal over which she had little control.\nKardashian West said she was deeply involved in Skims, from helping to design fabrics and collections to picking photographers for product shoots to studying sales data. (And like most things Kardashian, Skims has at times been a family affair: Kanye West, Kardashian West’s now-estranged husband, was “super involved” in the beginning, giving frank criticism of early designs for Skims packaging, she said.)\nSkims is one of several new e-commerce-first clothing brands – a group that also includes Heist Studios and Honeylove – to spot an opportunity in the shapewear business, which has for decades been dominated primarily by one company, Spanx.\xa0\nBefore 2020, when sales of shapewear dropped 30 per cent, the category consistently generated just over US$500 million in sales a year, or three\xa0per cent\xa0of total apparel sales, according to NPD. Like other shapewear startups, Skims was aiming for the younger end of the market.\nSkims defined itself with an emphasis on inclusivity, offering nine sizes, up to 5X, in as many skin-tone shades. Within its first nine weeks, it had racked up 2 million names on its waitlists, Grede said. To date, Skims has sold more than four\xa0million units, with a customer retention rate of over 30 per cent. Skims products are also sold at the high-end department stores Nordstrom and Britain’s Selfridges and several online retailers.\nSkims faced challenges even before the pandemic. One was of Kardashian West’s own making: The company was initially called Kimono, until accusations of cultural appropriation prompted her to change the moniker. (“Even when it seemed innocent to me,” she said, “people didn’t see it that way.”)\nThen, in addition to declining shapewear sales during the pandemic, the company suffered delays in sourcing raw material for its fabrics, which hampered its ability to develop, produce and ultimately sell new products.\n“We had to figure out different factories and had to get creative,” Kardashian West said. Even so, Skims reported US$145 million in sales last year, and expects to roughly double sales to US$300 million this year.\n\n\nBy last fall, the company was being courted by potential investors. Kardashian West and Grede eventually homed in on Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm that has backed consumer businesses like the eyewear brand Warby Parker and the cosmetics company Glossier. (Kardashian West’s social circle includes Thrive’s founder, Joshua Kushner, and his wife, model Karlie Kloss.)\nThe round also includes funding from two existing investors, Imaginary Ventures and Alliance Consumer Growth.\n“We have been continuously impressed by Skims’ ability to connect with consumers on a personal level and keep them coming back for more,” Nabil Mallick, a partner at Thrive, said in a statement.\nWhat’s next for Skims depends on how the pandemic has reshaped the clothing market. “Shapewear, which is really bought for an occasion, has been downtrending during the pandemic, and downtrending substantially,” Grede said.\xa0\nHe expects an eventual “rebalancing” of sales across product categories, with demand returning. The signs from retailers such as Anthropologie, which said last month that seven of its top 10 bestselling items online were dresses, suggest that shoppers may be planning to resume dressing more formally.\n\n\nKristen Classi-Zummo, an analyst at NPD, offered a more cautious take, reckoning that the category would rebound, though customers who have grown used to comfort will insist on easy-fitting apparel even as they reembrace some aspects of shapewear.\n“I do think we’ll get dressed up again,” Classi-Zummo said, “but I do think it will look and feel different.”\nKardashian West said she hoped to build Skims into a “multigenerational brand that will be around for a very long time.”\nBut she did not rule out eventually selling the business – so long as she retained a role in its operations. “I think I’m open to the conversation, for sure,” she said. But “I would never want to give up my process. I would hope that whoever we partner with in a sale one day would believe in that, too.”\nBy\xa0Michael J\xa0de la Merced\xa0© 2021 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      The Met Gala is returning – with 'more intimate' version this year, larger one next year
  </h1>, 'text': 'The Met Gala is coming back. Actually, twice.\xa0The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced on Monday (Apr 12) that the annual high-wattage celebration of both fashion and celebrity – cancelled last year because of the pandemic – will return in person, first in September, then again in 2022 in its usual slot of the first Monday in May.\nThe galas\xa0–\xa0a “more intimate” version on Sep\xa013 of this year and a larger one on May 2, 2022\xa0–\xa0will launch a two-part exhibition, a survey of American fashion to be on view for almost a year.\n“In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” opening Sep\xa018, will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the museum’s Costume Institute and “explore a modern vocabulary of American fashion”, the museum said. Part two, “In America: An Anthology of Fashion,” will open in the museum’s popular American Wing period rooms on May 5, 2022, and will explore American fashion, with collaborations with film directors, by “presenting narratives that relate to the complex and layered histories of those spaces.” Both parts will close on Sep\xa05, 2022.\nFilmmaker Melina Matsoukas (Queen & Slim) has been commissioned to create an open-ended film to project in the galleries, with content changing during the course of the exhibition.\nThere was no immediate word on who the celebrity hosts, or chairs, would be for the galas, traditionally a heady mix of luminaries from fashion, music, film, TV, sports and other arenas. The first gala in September will be smaller, and held in accordance with government coronavirus guidelines. The second next May is intended to be larger, in line with previous galas which typically hold about 550 guests.\nThe gala is a major fundraiser, providing the Costume Institute with its primary source of funding. In 2020, the gala was cancelled but fans were invited to engage in a social media challenge to recreate favourite red-carpet looks.\n“Fashion is both a harbinger of cultural shifts and a record of the forces, beliefs, and events that shape our lives,” said Max Hollein, director of the Met, in a statement. “This two-part exhibition will consider how fashion reflects evolving notions of identity in America and will explore a multitude of perspectives through presentations that speak to some of the complexities of history with powerful immediacy.""\nAs always, the exhibits will be the work of star curator Andrew Bolton. “Over the past year, because of the pandemic, the connections to our homes have become more emotional, as have those to our clothes,” he said in his own statement. “For American fashion, this has meant an increased emphasis on sentiment over practicality.”\nHe said that in accordance with this shift, Part One of the exhibition will establish “a modern vocabulary of American fashion based on the expressive qualities of clothing as well as deeper associations with issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion”.\nAs for Part Two, it will “further investigate the evolving language of American fashion through a series of collaborations with American film directors who will visualise the unfinished stories inherent in The Met’s period rooms”.\nIn addition to Matsoukas, other confirmed collaborators from the film world include cinematographer Bradford Young, whose projects have included Selma\xa0and When They See Us;\xa0production designers Nathan Crowley and Shane Valentino; and Franklin Leonard, film executive and founder of The Black List, a listing of top unproduced screenplays.\n(Source: AP)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Entertainment ', '     fashion ']}"

The award will be presented by Bridgerton\xa0actor Nicola Coughlan during the 23rd annual ceremony, which will take place on Tuesday on Twitter.\nRhimes and Beers both gave credit to the costume designers who have worked with them. The award honours individuals who demonstrate support of costume design and creative partnerships with designers.\n“This feels more like a giant compliment to the costume designers that we’ve gotten to work with over the years,” said Rhimes, founder of television production company, Shondaland. She said several costume designers helped her understand the different nuances of fashion.\n“I was somebody who started off my career at Grey’s Anatomy\xa0wearing pyjama paints, sweats and the same red T-shirt to work every day,” she continued. “I had no fashion sense whatsoever. I find it fascinating that I knew nothing about clothes, but costumes designers taught me about fashion and how the details can tell a story.”\nBeers said costume design has been a huge focus on their projects, because she says a character's wardrobe draws the most scrutiny.\n“Costume design is one of the few areas in our business that everybody has an opinion about,” said Beers, who has worked alongside Rhimes on other hits shows including Scandal,\xa0How To Get Away With Murder\xa0and Private Practice.\xa0The women have been longtime producing partners since 2002.\n“It’s the ability to take into consideration so many points of view while at the same time finding ways to innovate and create trends and create looks,” she said. “It’s getting the world to get onboard with a different style of dressing.”\nPast award recipients include Meryl Streep, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Clint Eastwood and Guillermo Del Toro.\nGuild president Salvador Perez said the Rhimes-Beers duo has created “cultural-defining TV moments” with the support of their collaborators and costume designers.\n“They are originals; fierce, brilliant women who create rich worlds, characters and stories that enhance our lives,” said Emmy-winning costume designer Ellen Mirojnick, who worked as a costume designer on Bridgerton.\xa0“It’s truly been a gift collaborating with them.”\nLyn Paolo, an Emmy-winning costume designer, called both women innovative collaborators.\n“Every new world that they present is a lush landscape in which I have room to create beautiful pictures, a world where the clothes can help to tell a small part of the story,” said Paolo, who worked with them on Scandal\xa0and How To Get Away With Murder.” “I love that those landscapes include diversity, challenge norms, and allow for strong female leads.”\nRhimes and Beers said they feel humbled and encouraged by the praise to better themselves.\n“We’re constantly trying to improve,” Beers said. “I don’t think we ever take it for granted and that we can do better in every step of the way.

      In Singapore, are corporate executives still ordering tailor-made suits?
  </h1>, 'text': 'The smart tailored suit that is a staple of sartorially discerning C-suite wardrobes has taken a huge cut lately because of the pandemic.\nAlmost all the bespoke tailors that CNA Luxury spoke to reported a marked drop in business as international arrivals dry up, and local executives continue to work from home and not go on business trips.\n\n\nWell-known bespoke tailor Kevin Seah, who runs his eponymous menswear boutique, said: “Our business was badly affected last year. We definitely\xa0see less demand for suit orders as most of our clients are working from home and cannot travel.”\nCustomers are now opting\xa0for classical-style suits in roomier fits rather than slim-fit silhouettes. Also popular are lightweight hand-block-printed shirts and Japanese cotton seersuckers as well as shorts, chino trousers and made-to-order golf trousers – hinting at a much more casual wardrobe.\nFounder and creative director Chong Han San commented: “With almost non-existent business travel, we have zero overseas clients coming in for tailored suits and even the locals do not have the need to make business suits for their important overseas business trips.\n“For now, most of our suit business [is geared towards] wedding events.” Also dominating demand: Tailored shorts, cotton chinos and casual blazers like bomber or safari jackets.\n“We have been showing more casual items such as linen or patterned sports jackets and relaxed linen trousers. We’ve also managed to come up with a system of accepting bespoke and made-to-measure orders online, from clients overseas whom we’ve never met before. This is something new for us.”\nHe said: “The soft and gentle-cut suits are popular with my clients as they want to look at ease in a suit that is also comfortable to wear. I’m starting to introduce ready-to-wear casual pieces like knitted polos and T-shirts to cater to the dress-down office environment.”\nIts managing director Fong Loo Fern said: “Many are going for the casual, relaxed ‘tech [executive]’ look, like [pairing] a round-neck tee with a jacket.”\nThe wedding market has been the saving grace for most tailors during this challenging period. “It is the only area with demand for suits now,” said Q Menswear’s Chong.\n\n\nTHE STORM HASN’T PASSED YET\nOverall, uncertain economic realities still prevail.\nFong said: “We still have customers coming in for classic suits, but they’re looking for more economical options such as suits that can be re-worn after the wedding. We also have younger men, just out of university, looking for work suits, but the numbers have gone down. Retail is still challenging.”\n“Most men are budget-conscious in Singapore. Now that we can’t travel, we do get clients who would have otherwise gone to Bangkok for their suits. They find ours value for money,” shared Fong.\nBut there is a sense of hope that the tills may be ringing more for these tailors in 2021. Alvin Lin, co-owner of The Prestigious Bespoke Tailors, said that while customers have become more price-sensitive, sales in the first quarter of 2021 saw a year-on-year 39 and 45 per cent increase compared to 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n“While sales has consistently increased year-on-year since our relaunch in 2016, the double digit percentage growth this quarter was not something we could forecast even as late as December 2020. This is even more astonishing considering that our House did not establish any new product line nor nurture new customer segments,” said Lin.\nQ Menswear’s Chong shared that although he has not observed an increase in suit orders yet, the number of appointments to make work shirts doubled in the week following the announcement.\nAccording to Lin, The Prestigious generated the equivalent of its monthly sales average on Mar 27 alone, with the highest commission being S$14,000.\nLin said: “From January, and especially in February and March 2021, we noticed the return of C-suite and senior executives who would spend anywhere from S$7,000 for a suit to a S$40,000 commission. We still have the occasional wedding suit transacting at S$5,000 to S$10,000 during this period, but this would be rarer for now.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     business ', '     fashion ', '     Men ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Here’s why certain types of jewellery can cause your sensitive skin to flare up
  </h1>, 'text': ""Do you love wearing jewellery but unfortunately, you have\xa0a skin allergy that cramps your style? Perhaps you have a grandmother who\xa0told you to wear real gold pieces instead of costume jewellery because they\xa0won't cause any\xa0flare ups.\nWell, it turns out grandma is partially right because\xa0there are certain types of jewellery that are\xa0not good for sensitive skin.\xa0\nHowever, that doesn't mean all costume jewellery is a no-no.\xa0\nAccording to Trixie Khong, who owns costume jewellery labels By Invite Only and The Mindful Company, besides gold, there are other materials that those with sensitive skin can reach for. “Materials like copper, platinum, stainless steel and sterling silver are less likely to cause a reaction,” she explained.\n\n\nA post shared by By Invite Only Jewellery (@byinviteonlystore)\nAnd apparently, not all gold is safe, either. “Avoid white gold as it is often alloyed with nickel or cobalt that irritates the skin,” cautioned Khong.\nInstead of ruling out costume jewellery altogether, it is more important to find out what exactly triggers your flare ups, she advised. “If the wearer is allergic to a particular metal, he or she should avoid wearing jewellery with that particular metal, even if it doesn’t contain any harmful ingredients that irritate the skin.”\nHere are some tips from Khong\xa0on how to live your best embellished life.\n\n\nCAN PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN WEAR COSTUME JEWELLERY?\n\n\nA post shared by By Invite Only Jewellery (@byinviteonlystore)\nYes, they can. However, if the wearer is allergic to a particular metal (not to be confused with skin sensitivity), he or she should avoid wearing jewellery with that particular metal, even if it doesn’t contain any harmful ingredients that irritate the skin.\nHOW WILL YOU KNOW WHAT MATERIAL YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO? \nSensitive skin are skin types that are prone to inflammatory adverse reactions. For example, eczema sufferers\xa0often experience flare ups during very cold or hot weather conditions. Nickel, lead and cadmium are often culprits of skin irritation, hence, they are not suitable for those with sensitive skin.

      Australian fashion designer Carla Zampatti dies at 78 after a fall
  </h1>, 'text': 'Australian fashion icon Carla Zampatti, known for elegant designs and efforts to empower women over more than half a century, has died aged 78 after a fall in Sydney, her family said on Saturday (Apr 3).\nActors Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett, as well as former prime minister Julia Gillard, were among the influential Australians who wore the clothes of Zampatti, hospitalised last week after a fall at an outdoor opera performance.\n""She continued to thrive as a businesswoman through enormous radical and social change, designing clothes for women fighting for liberation through the women\'s rights movement in the 1960s to empowering women today,"" the family said in a statement.\nIn the early 1970s, Zampatti became one of the first designers to introduce swimwear into her collections in then socially conservative Australia.\nBorn in Italy in 1942, before her family emigrated to Australia in 1950, Zampatti produced her first small fashion collection in 1965 before setting up Carla Zampatti Pty Ltd five years later.\n""It is amazing what you can do with an incredible amount of youthful optimism and very little money,"" Zampatti told the Australian Associated Press in 2009.\nA savvy businesswoman who opened dozens of boutiques across Australia, Zampatti held several directorships, and served as chairwoman of Australian public service broadcaster the Special Broadcasting Service.\n""We have lost a truly great and inspirational Australian,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, adding that Zampatti was not only a fashion industry icon but a pioneer as an entrepreneur and a champion of a multicultural approach.\n""Her contribution to our nation will be timeless, just like her designs.""\nOn Zampatti\'s online memorial page, a customer who identified herself only as Louise wrote, ""It is true of every piece I wear from the CZ line – I feel confident, elegant and empowered ...\xa0Thank you for the years of inspiration.""\nZampatti was the mother of three children from two marriages and a grandmother of nine, her family said.\n(Reporting by Lidia Kelly; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ']}"

Here are the best ensembles to consider for your grand office return.\xa0\nCRASH LANDING ON YOU\nYes, it’s been more than a year since hit K-drama Crash Landing On You was released, but we still can’t get over the swoon-worthy fashion from the show.

Pair with a mini handbag for an elevated casual look.\nSTART-UP\nOn casual Fridays, put on a pair of high-waisted jeans, then throw on a light cardigan. In Netflix’s Start-Up, jeans are Bae Suzy’s go-to wardrobe staples as she makes a case for smart casual.\nFor guys, take a page out of Kim Seon-ho’s book and try a colour-coordinated suit.

      Commentary: China's boycott of H&amp;M, Nike and other big brands is really bizarre
  </h1>, 'text': 'SHENZHEN: A day after China had retaliated against the European Union for its sanctions against a few Chinese officials and one entity in Xinjiang, China\'s Central Youth League called for the boycotting of H&M.\nIt pointed to the Swedish consumer clothing giant’s statement of not using cotton from Xinjiang in line with the Better Cotton Initiative, the largest cotton sustainability programme in the world.\nMimicking similar terminology by Chinese diplomatic wolf warriors led by Yang Jiechi, one of China’s highest ranking Chinese Community Party politburo members in charge of China\'s foreign relations, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the youth league declared online that ""Xinjiang cotton doesn\'t eat this s***”.\nChina\'s state media and netizens quickly joined in the growing Xinjiang cotton campaign. Targets have since been expanded to include major brands such as Nike and Adidas.\nBIZARRE TIMING\nWhat\'s bizarre about this campaign is that the ""patriotic activities"" are not well coordinated. The timing of the boycott is puzzling. H&M had made the statement one year earlier, on Mar 20, 2020.\nTo raise a ruckus over it now throws into sharper focus the fact that Chinese media had been silent on the statement for the whole year.\nTo add to the confusion, these ""patriotic activities"" did not seem supported by the security forces.\nA woman, who was holding up a sign against foreign products in front of an H&M store in Zhengzhou, was quickly detained by local police. This was in spite of foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying\'s public announcement that the Chinese people were allowed to express their patriotic emotions.\nAround that same period, on Friday (Mar 26), amid the surging patriotic fervor engulfing the country, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also reportedly visited a factory in Jiangsu that supplies boycotted companies including Nike and Adidas.\nDEFLECTING ALLEGATIONS OF GENOCIDE\nOn the surface, the campaign appeared to be escalating already heated disputes between China and Europe over Xinjiang.\nBut a deeper look reveals how the campaign may actually be serving a second purpose of deflecting attention away from the thornier issue of allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity in breach of the United Nation\'s Genocide Convention.\nBranded by the Chinese media as the ""common enemy of humankind"", Mike Pompeo declared on his last day in office (Jan 19) as US Secretary of State that China was committing crimes against humanity, and specifically, the crime of genocide in Xinjiang.\nAccording to Pompeo, China was intent on destroying ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs in Xinjiang with numerous detention camps and sterilisation programmes involving Uighur women.\nDespite a change in party and US President, Pompeo\'s characterisation of China\'s policy in Xinjiang has been picked up by his successor, Antony Blinken and has gained traction.\nOn Mar 9, a newly established think tank in Washington DC, the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, issued a report on Xinjiang prepared by more than 50 global experts in international law. The report claims to have found evidence for violations of every single provision of the UN\'s genocide convention by the Chinese government in Xinjiang.\nAt his meetings with Dr Yang and Dr Wang in Anchorage, Alaska 10 days later, Blinken expressed deep concerns of the US and its allies over this issue as well as other matters such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyberattacks on the US, and the South China Sea. His brief remarks were countered by a long lecture by his counterpart, Mr Yang.\nIt was at these meetings that Yang registered his displeasure by famously saying that ""we"" the Chinese people won\'t give a damn, or more precisely ""we the Chinese people don\'t eat that s***"".\n\xa0A GATHERING COALITION\nFollowing the heated exchanges in Alaska, Blinken put together a coalition against China over this issue quickly. Altogether, 32 countries condemned China over genocide in Xinjiang, including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the 27 countries of the EU.\xa0\nFor the first time in 32 years, the EU sanctioned China over the issue. After China responded by issuing\xa0sanctions against 10 individuals (including many members of the EU parliament) and four entities, the EU decided to suspend its review of the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment.\nChina now finds itself increasingly isolated in the Western world. From its perspective, this is largely due to the fact that China is rising economically, politically and militarily, and Western countries, especially the US, cannot accept this fact.\xa0\nBut it’s worth recalling that in his recent news conference, US President Joe Biden had acknowledged China\'s ambitions and was prepared to compete with China in a race.\xa0\nUltimately, it does not matter who emerges the economic champion so long as the risk of war is managed. This likelihood must be managed. There cannot be an outbreak of conflict between two nuclear superpowers.\nProfessor Bo Zhiyue is founder and president of the Bo Zhiyue China Institute, a consulting firm providing services to government leaders and CEOs of multinational corporations.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     Xinjiang ', '     US ', '     fashion ']}"

      Returning to the office? Singapore women share tips on what to wear
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s been more than a year since we packed up our office desks and made working from home the norm. Although we’ve slowly been transitioning back to the office, come Apr 5, up to 75 per cent of staff can return to the workplace.\nWhat this means is that it’s time to say goodbye to wearing sweatpants while on Zoom calls, and hello to dressing up for more days in the office. But after getting used to our WFH casuals, that transition may be hard for some of us.\nTo help you out, CNA Luxury spoke to a number of women in the corporate sector\xa0to find out what they’re planning to wear. Overall, the consensus is that after getting a taste of what working in complete comfort is really like, back-to-office work wear will be more casual and relaxed. Here’s what they had to say.\nCAECILIA CHU, CEO, YOUTRIP\n“Casual work attire\xa0has\xa0been the norm for virtual meetings at home. That will probably reflect in my choice of outfits and makeup as well, at least initially. Given that it has\xa0been almost a year where I’ve hardly worn heels, I’ll probably opt for more comfortable flats. A lighter shade of makeup will be what I’m more used to,” said Caecilia Chu, CEO of multi-currency wallet app\xa0YouTrip.\n“In-and-out of the office, my choice of attire has always been about staying practical while looking sharp. Staples that I recently bagged include a good wrinkle-free jacket and a classic day-to-night handbag that’s presentable for both meetings and after-work activities. To top it off, I also recently purchased a classic pair of aviators made for any occasion and outfit, be it business, casual, or even for an evening dinner with the team,” Chu shared.\nRHONDA WONG, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, OHMYHOME\n“I love being at the office. It is my second home where we work, dream and laugh. We’ve created a comfortable and family-friendly office so we’re looking forward to hanging out again,” said Rhonda Wong, CEO and co-founder of property app\xa0Ohmyhome.\nIf you’re one who’s constantly pressed for time, Wong has a tip. “I’m a big fan of [monochromatic]\xa0clothes. They are timeless, tidy and professional looking. This preference grew out of the schedule constraints that I had to work around especially after founding Ohmyhome.\xa0\n""With the limited time available to me, I decided that it was important for me to be efficient, and working with [monochromatic] clothes helped to cut down on the time spent trying to put together a smart and professional looking outfit,” she said.\nRACE WONG, CPO\xa0AND CO-FOUNDER, OHMYHOME\n“I\'m definitely looking forward to going back to the office. I think many of us are tired of scheduling Zoom meetings and the lack of collaboration that comes with remote work,” shared Race Wong, chief product officer\xa0and co-founder of Ohmyhome.\n“Especially since I’ve just given birth, I\'m so looking forward to swapping my maternity outfits to a fresh wardrobe. My new items will definitely include activewear work clothes as\xa0I have a fitness goal to get back in shape after pregnancy. We have a huge office with lots of open space and being in activewear will allow\xa0me to run around the office for meetings. For formal meetings, all I need is a black blazer to complete the [corporate] look,"" she added.\xa0\nTJIN LEE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MERCURY MARKETING & COMMUNICATIONS\n""I’m not actually buying more formal corporate wear, as I had\xa0plenty of that before COVID-19. Instead, I’m investing in smart casual, work-from-home pieces that can also stand up to client meetings, such as unlined jackets, short-sleeved tailored tops, and\xa0wide-legged culottes that I can wear with dressier flats or low heels,"" shared Tjin Lee, managing director of public relations and events firm\xa0Mercury Marketing & Communications.\xa0\n""I love sprucing up my back-to-work outfits with accessories and of course, my signature red lipstick! I find everyone is dressing down more these days. Perhaps we’ve become accustomed to seeking comfort first! I look for pieces which combine style and comfort,"" Lee continued.\xa0\nVAL YAP, FOUNDER AND\xa0CEO, POLICYPAL\n“My style on normal workdays would be to hop into a pair of comfortable jeans, put on a blouse and throw on my denim jacket – it does get icy cold in the office at times. On other days, I stick to my trusty timeless blazer when I am meeting external and internal stakeholders in the industry,” said Val Yap, founder and\xa0CEO of insurance broker\xa0PolicyPal.\n“Working from home has definitely changed my style of dressing. Being in the insurance industry for the past five years, I met multiple stakeholders in back-to-back meetings. My working style comprised professional working attire, for example, throwing on blazers and suits for important meetings.\n""But with working from home in the past year and conducting meetings virtually, I have started to incorporate a more business casual look. The shift towards a more casual dressing has increased my confidence, comfort, and focus. I would say at the end of the day, it is important to find the right balance between going smart-casual and professional,” she added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     office ', '     Singapore ', '     business ', '     WFH ', '     Pandemic ', ""     Women's Style "", '     fashion ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Creative Capital: The 28-year-old industrial designer of bags and furniture
  </h1>, 'text': ""Karyn Lim, 28, is a young industrial designer to watch. Having just completed her Master’s at Switzerland’s Lausanne University of Art and Design, she has returned home in the midst of the pandemic and nonetheless launched her first line of furniture products, titled Cloud.\nIn the course of her practice, she has also worked with internationally known brands such as La Prairie, Samsung and Zanotta.\nThe enterprising designer also looks after communications at Industry+, a local design and manufacturing studio working with many of Asia’s best designers.\nYou can bet Industry+ head honcho PC Ee is paying attention to his PR manager’s creative output, and it might not be too far off in the future that Industry+ produces her pieces.\nHI, KARYN. WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO PURSUE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN? WERE YOU ALWAYS CREATIVE AS A CHILD?\nI didn’t always know that I wanted to be a designer. As a child, I was always curious about the “why” behind things, and I would bother adults around me with incessant “why”s. They were all very thankful when I took my questions to search engines and the Internet. I enjoyed understanding how things worked, why they existed and why we used them. Perhaps this curiosity, coupled with a keen interest in crafts, was a primer to my pursuing industrial design. The active decision was only made much later, when I had the opportunity to study abroad with like-minded people from every corner of the world. I guess you could say that I had met “my people”, and wanted very much to stay a part of this international community.\nWHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK OF YOUR CHOICE?\nMy family has always been supportive. They have never complained about the amount of space I take up at home with my materials, or the mess I make, especially when working on projects.\nDO PEOPLE GET WHAT YOU DO EASILY OR DO YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IN DETAIL?\nI find that using the term “product design”, although not all-encompassing, usually helps the layman grasp the idea of industrial design more quickly.\nHOW DIFFICULT IS IT FOR A YOUNG DESIGNER TO MAKE HER OR HIMSELF KNOWN?\nI guess it really depends on his or her definition of being known, by whom they want to be known and more fundamentally, whether they want to be known. I’d say it’s not difficult to put work out these days — a self-made digital portfolio is not difficult to set up. And social media is pretty much a free resource. Perhaps the real challenge in making oneself known is defining what one should be known for. \xa0\nDO YOU HAVE A DESIGN AESTHETIC OR STYLE YET?\nI might describe my work as contemporary and minimalist. Lately, I’ve been focusing on sculptural objects and projects that work with craft communities.\nIS THERE A WORK THAT YOU’VE DONE THAT YOU FEEL REALLY REPRESENTS WHO YOU ARE AS A DESIGNER?\nIt’s an old one, and also one that was borne from lots of hard work and naivety. The Transformation Bags is a series that I developed in 2015. I might have made at least a hundred rough to refined prototypes while trying to understand the system, and streamlining a method of production. It was with this project that I first exhibited in Milan during Design Week, and in other major cities including Jakarta, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and of course, back home in Singapore. This project is also likely the one that propelled me into committing to design.\nOF THE PROJECTS YOU HAVE DONE SO FAR, WHICH WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING AND WHY?\nMy most recent project, Cloud furniture, is probably the most challenging to date. Although the pieces are aesthetically simple and minimalist, they were conceived in a time that was quite the opposite. I had returned prematurely to Singapore due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and had to conceptualise and produce new work with limited access to materials and without a proper workshop to experiment in. I was holding much uncertainty in my headspace. Producing a physical prototype in Singapore was challenging during the circuit breaker, and I felt a great sense of relief when the project was finally submitted.\xa0\nWHAT IS YOUR OWN CREATIVE PROCESS LIKE? ONCE YOU GET A BRIEF, WHAT DO YOU DO?\nAsk questions. It's important to me to try to understand the client’s wants, needs and desires. I try to first define parameters, feel out if any can be pushed or not, and then put together a mood board or draft to capture the intention, and to check that the client and I are on the same page.\nIN ADDITION TO BEING A DESIGNER, YOU WORK FOR INDUSTRY+. WHAT IS YOUR ROLE THERE?\nI handle communications at Industry+. One might call it a millennial job as it covers a broad spectrum of responsibilities that are not clearly defined. At Industry+, I have been involved in conceptualising and producing design showcases including 1KM: Jalan Besar (2017) that was an open-house of creative studios and retail points within the neighbourhood; and helped set up an e-commerce shop made-in-co.com (launched in 2019) featuring selected works of independent design studios.\nWILL INDUSTRY+ SOON BE PRODUCING ANY PIECES BY KARYN LIM?\nWell, Cloud is the first piece of furniture that I’ve designed and had made. There are other pieces that still exist as digital files or hand doodles. Industry+ already has some new pieces lined up to be launched. However, if I were to receive an order for Cloud, it would most likely be produced with one of our manufacturing partners.\nDO YOU THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES IN SINGAPORE FOR DESIGNERS LIKE YOURSELF?\nI’m an optimist. I believe that there will always be opportunities wherever we are as long as we keep our noses down and keep doing our work well.\nDO YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO WHO DESIGNS THE OBJECTS AROUND THEM?\nOne thing I’ve noticed is that people do care where the objects are made, where they were bought and the brand of the object. It would be just one more information tag to add onto the marketing information of objects. People will pay attention to who designs the objects if brands and retailers push the information through.\nWHAT’S YOUR DREAM PROJECT?\nIf I had the luxury of space and resources, I would love a shophouse to keep my passions in. It would be a gallery for contemporary design, art, and lifestyle objects on the ground floor, potentially with some light F&B, and my studio and home upstairs.\nWHO ARE YOUR OWN DESIGN HEROES, LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY?\nThere are so many! I’ve always admired the well-balanced compositions of Pierre Charpin. I enjoy the playfulness and strong technical knowledge in Ingo Maurer’s lighting designs. I see a lot of grace in the mobiles of Alexander Calder. Locally, I respect the work of Hans Tan and his ability to tastefully retain cultural motifs in his porcelain pieces.\nDO ISSUES LIKE SUSTAINABILITY PLAY A ROLE IN YOUR DESIGN PROCESS OR PHILOSOPHY?\nAs designers, it is also our responsibility to care about the impact that our work has on this earth. Sustainability is always a point of consideration. We can strive towards it but it is quite challenging to be entirely green in a business that thrives on consumerism. I think it will take time for formats to change. I believe that design can be a useful tool for positive social impact. In this time of global economic recession, I find it meaningful to design products that can be handcrafted in small batches by craft communities that need work to sustain their livelihoods and the existence of their craft. \xa0\nIn 2016, I worked together with an Indonesian friend, Fani Atmanti, to produce a version of the Transformation Bags using wood carved by craftsmen on Nias Islands. We named these bags Omo, borrowing the name from ‘omo sebua’, which refers to their traditional house that also inspired the flattened form of the bag.\nANYTHING EXCITING IN 2021 YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE?\n2021 for me is a continuation of everything that had its timeline stretched out by 2020. I’m in talks with a local brand about a potential project, and will share more once we launch it.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', ""     Women's Voices "", '     homes ', '     fashion ']}"

      Chinese apps join celebs in backlash against Western fashion brands over Xinjiang
  </h1>, 'text': 'China\'s top ride-hailing app dropped Swedish fashion retailer H&M from its listings as Chinese celebrities stopped endorsing foreign labels in a growing uproar over Western accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang.\nH&M faced a public backlash in China when social media users in the country circulated a statement the company made last year announcing it would no longer source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of the use of forced labour by Uighur Muslims.\nWestern governments and rights groups have accused authorities in the farwestern region of detaining and torturing Uighurs in camps, where some former inmates have said they were subject to ideological indoctrination.\nBeijing denies the accusations and describes the camps in question as vocational training centres which help combat religious extremism.\nSearch results for H&M in the Didi Chuxing ride-hailing app for all of China\'s major cities yielded no results on Friday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe backlash against H&M caused Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, shopping app Meituan and the maps app for search engine Baidu Inc to each remove the Swedish retailer from their listings.\nOther overseas brands, including Burberry Group PLC, Nike Inc, and Adidas AG have also faced an online blowback for making similar statements regarding their sourcing of cotton in Xinjiang.\nThe Human Rights section of H&M\'s website hmgroup.com on Friday no longer carried the link to the 2020 statement on Xinjiang. The statement could still be accessed through the page\'s direct address.\nStatements expressing concern about or intolerance of forced labour in Xinjiang previously seen on the websites of Inditex, VF Corp, PVH and Abercrombie & Fitch were no longer available on Thursday.\nFollowing enquiries by Reuters, VF Corp pointed to a statement on a separate section of its website that said it did not source from Xinjiang. A Google cache showed the statement had been added in the last four days. VF did not respond to a question asking why the statement had been moved.\nPVH, Inditex and Abercrombie & Fitch did not respond to a request for comment.\n""We have to stand by the brands keeping statements condemning slavery and shame those who are taking them down. This is a defining moment for these brands,"" said French MEP Raphael Glucksmann, one of 10 EU individuals sanctioned by China who has run social media campaigns calling on retailers to stand against forced labour in Xinjiang.\n""Consumers in Europe need to place counter pressure on companies retracting their statements.""\nCHINA CELEBS DROP BRANDS\nA message on the Chinese Weibo account of the German fashion house Hugo Boss said on Thursday that it would ""continue to purchase and support Xinjiang cotton."" Hugo Boss said on Friday that it was not an authorised post, and had been deleted accordingly.\nIn an email to Reuters on Friday, company spokeswoman Carolin Westermann said that an undated English-language statement on its website stating that ""so far, HUGO BOSS has not procured any goods originating in the Xinjiang region from direct suppliers"" was its official position. The cotton row has spilled over into the entertainment world, with Chinese celebrities dropping several foreign retail labels, including six US brands such as Nike.\nNew Balance, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger and Converse, owned by Nike, have come under fire in China for statements saying they would not use Xinjiang cotton.\nOther brands affected include Adidas, Puma and Fast Retailing\'s Uniqlo.\n""I can confirm that Uniqlo\'s Chinese brand ambassadors have terminated their contracts,"" said a Fast Retailing spokesperson.\n""Regarding cotton, we only source sustainable cotton and this has not changed.""\nAt least 27 Chinese movie stars and singers have declared in the past two days that they would stop cooperating with foreign brands.\nTheir decision was widely praised by Chinese internet users for being patriotic and trended high on the popular Twitter-like microblog Weibo.\n""I have bought these kinds of products in the past and this situation doesn\'t mean that I will now throw them away, destroy them or something like that,"" said graduate Lucy Liu outside a Beijing shopping mall.\n""What I\'ll do is just avoid buying them for the moment.""\nBeyond the fashion and retail industry, China sanctioned British organisations and individuals on Friday over what it called ""lies and disinformation"" about Xinjiang, days after Britain imposed sanctions of its own.\n""China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not to go further down the wrong path,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. ""Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions.""\nThe sanctions are the latest sign of deteriorating relations between London and Beijing, including China\'s crackdown on dissent in the former British colony of Hong Kong, which had been guaranteed its freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n(Reporting by Ryan Woo and Gabriel Crossley in Beijing, Josh Horwitz in Shanghai, Victoria Waldersee in Lisbon, Anna Ringstrom in Stockholm and William James, Sarah Young and Paul Sandle in London; Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and Daniel Wallis)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     celebrity ']}"

      Zoe Tay, Stef Sun and more attend Louis Vuitton's fashion show in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': ""Although fashion weeks in London, Paris and Milan have gone digital in recent times, on Tuesday evening (Mar 23), fashion returned to the physical catwalk as Louis Vuitton held the first runway show in Singapore since the pandemic began.\nThe French fashion house staged its Women’s Spring/Summer 2021 Spin-Off show at the ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands. The basement of the museum, an area called the Oculus, was transformed into a fashion show venue,\xa0with green screens as a backdrop.\xa0\nThe reason for this was that the show was “phygital”. Viewers at home could tune in to the livestream at 7.30pm, where they would see extracts from Wim Wenders’ iconic movie Wings Of Desire projected onto the screens.\nAt the ArtScience museum, a total of 112 guests arrived at the show in Louis Vuitton masks. Inside the venue, they were seated on green cubes, spaced\xa0apart in accordance with safe distancing measures. Prior to entry, temperature checks and SafeEntry scans were also conducted.\nThe night was a star-studded affair, with celebrities like Zoe Tay, Rebecca Lim and Desmond Tan in attendance. Also lending glamour to the evening were Joanne Peh, Jesseca Liu, Chantalle Ng, Ayden Sng and model/photographer Chuando Tan.\nSinger/songwriter Stefanie Sun made a rare appearance. The last time she attended a fashion show was ten years ago, she told CNA Lifestyle.\n“I did feel a bit conflicted about attending a show during this time,” Stefanie admitted. “But at the same time, I feel like it has been challenging for a lot of us in the creative line, whether it's\xa0fashion or music, but what we saw today was quite representative of having all these challenges, all these measures, and still going ahead with all the hard work you’ve put in. I thought (Louis Vuitton) did a pretty good job today,” she added.\nRight before the show, an unexpected downpour occurred. Rain streamed into the venue through the Oculus’ skywell, delaying the start of the show by 20 minutes. But the rain only added to the experience, some celebrities said.\n“This is my first time watching a fashion show in the rain. The experience was extremely interesting, I guess it added to the entire feel of the show because you don’t know what to expect. The entire Spring/Summer collection was a mix of different factors. We didn’t know what to expect, just like the weather itself,” said Rebecca Lim.\n“The minute we stepped in (to the venue), rain was falling down from the ceiling. I thought it was part of the installation. It was really wonderful,” said Chuando Tan.\nChuando also felt a sense of pride that Louis Vuitton chose to hold a fashion show in Singapore.\xa0\n“I feel really blessed to grace a fashion show in person. The pandemic has been going on for a while now, and all fashion shows around the world have\xa0gone digital. Yet here we are, a French powerhouse holding its first full-fledged fashion show in this new normal right here in Singapore. How cool is that?” he said.\nLocal models took to the catwalk to present a total of 69\xa0looks, derived from Louis Vuitton’s Spring/Summer 2021 Collection and the Summer 2021 capsule collection. Both collections were designed by womenswear artistic director Nicolas Ghesquiere.\nThere were T-shirts and tank tops with graphic prints in pop colours, chicly tailored blazers and pants, swimsuits in Louis Vuitton’s signature monogram, as well as an array of bags and accessories.\nAlthough the show presented a women’s collection, Desmond Tan spotted some accessories that he could see himself wearing.\xa0\n“I was very focused on the bags, I thought some of the pieces were very fantastic. I like the play of different textures in terms of the metallic looks, some shimmery stuff. I thought I would be able to carry off some of (those looks). I think it would be interesting to have them in my wardrobe,” he said.\nZoe Tay, on the other hand, loved the vibrancy\xa0of the summer collection, she told CNA Lifestyle. “The summer collection gives a lot of energy, a lot of colours and vibrancy. It’s like going to the beach, it was very casual,” she said.\nReflecting on the show experience, Ah Jie added: “It was raining today and everyone was worried that the show might not go on. But the show still went on. It was nicely done, and everyone was so happy.”\nThat’s perhaps symbolic of the times. Even in a pandemic, the show must go on.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     celebrity ', '     Singapore ', '     ArtScience Museum ', '     Marina Bay Sands ', '     MBS ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Indian lingerie model, 52, hopes to inspire inclusivity, change
  </h1>, 'text': 'MUMBAI: A 52-year-old Indian lingerie model is pushing e-commerce firms to hire older women for their advertising campaigns, challenging what she says are the ageist norms practised by many companies.\nGeeta J, a former teacher who took to modelling when she turned 50, says she wants innerwear companies in India to be more inclusive and avoid featuring only younger women in their promotion drives.\n""Are women no more fit to become a lingerie model past a certain age?,"" Geeta has said in an online petition on Change.org, captioned with the hashtags \'#AgenotCage\' and \'#LingerieHasNoAge\', which she started this year.\nHer job is bold and unusual in the largely conservative Indian society where religious and cultural norms limit women\'s freedom to dress the way they want.\nSuch norms are even more restrictive for women over the age of 40, Geeta told Reuters in an interview.\nMore than 11,000 people have signed up to support her petition, which is addressed to the chief executive of the popular innerwear company Zivame.\n""This will lead to a change in the mindset of people in our country who think that after 40, women should dress and behave in a certain way,"" Geeta said in the petition, adding that she hoped it would lead to more companies following suit.\nZivame\'s head of marketing\xa0Khatija S.

      Famed Tiffany &amp; Co jewellery designer Elsa Peretti dies at age 80
  </h1>, 'text': 'Elsa Peretti, who went from Halston model and Studio 54 regular in the 1960s and \'70s to one of the world\'s most famous jewelry designers with timeless, fluid Tiffany & Co collections often inspired by nature, has died. She was 80.\nShe died Thursday (Mar 18) night in her sleep at home in a small village outside Barcelona, Spain, according to a statement from her family office in Zurich and the Nando and Elsa Peretti Foundation.\nPeretti\'s sculptural cuff bracelets, bean designs and open-heart pendants are among her most recognisable work. She lent her classical aesthetic to functional goods, too, including bowls, magnifying glasses, razors and even a pizza cutter done in sterling silver, a metal she favored and helped popularise as a luxury choice.\n""Elsa was not only a designer but a way of life,"" Tiffany said in a statement Friday. ""Elsa explored nature with the acumen of a scientist and the vision of a sculptor.""\nBorn in Florence, Italy, to wealthy, conservative parents and educated in Rome and Switzerland, Peretti moved to Barcelona in her 20s and began working as a model, where she tapped into a community of artists that included Salvador Dali, according to an August profile in The Wall Street Journal\'s magazine. A short time later, she decamped for New York and started modelling for Halston and other top designers, jumping into the art and fashion jet set. It\'s then she began to make jewellery, tapping the designers she worked for to incorporate her pieces.\nIt was Halston, a close friend, who introduced her to the highest echelons at Tiffany, an exclusive collaboration that lasted throughout her career.\nThe outspoken Peretti began designing for Tiffany in 1974. In celebration of the 50th anniversary of her signature wrist-hugging Bone Cuff, Tiffany launched fresh versions, including some with stones of turquoise and jade.\nDescribing herself as ""retired"" to the Wall Street Journal, she kept her hand in, communicating with artisans around the world and checking on the work of her ateliers.\n""Her inspiration was often drawn from everyday items – a bean, a bone, an apple could be transformed into cufflinks, bracelets, vases or lighters,"" the family statement said. ""Scorpions and snakes were turned into appealing necklaces and rings, often in silver, which was one of her preferred materials. She herself stated that \'There is no new design, because good lines and shapes are timeless.\'""\nOf Peretti\'s designs, Liza Minnelli told Vanity Fair in 2014: ""Everything was so sensual, so sexy. I just loved it. It was different from anything I\'d ever seen.""\nPeretti\'s more than three dozen collections for Tiffany established her in luxury, but she also understood the need for budget flexibility among consumers. She was behind Tiffany\'s Diamonds by the Yard line that began in 1974, based on the idea of spreading out the stones on a simple chain and offering them at a range of price points. Today, the line goes for US$325 to US$75,000 (S$436 to S$100,660).\n""You need to be able to go out on the street with your jewellery,"" she told the Journal. ""Women can\'t go around wearing US$1 million.""\nPeretti\'s designs are in the permanent collections of the British Museum in London and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, among others. In recognition of her work, Tiffany established the Elsa Peretti professorship in jewellery design at the Fashion Institute of Technology, the first endowed professorship in the history of FIT.\nShe was also a philanthropist, establishing her foundation in her father\'s honour in 2000. It supports a range of projects, from human and civil rights to medical research and wildlife conservation.\nThe small village of Sant Martí Vell, where she died in Catalonia, was always close to her heart, the family statement said. In 1968, she bought a mustard-yellow house there and lovingly restored it over the next 10 years. She went on to have entire swaths of the village restored, acquiring and preserving buildings, including a church. She also supported excavation of Roman ruins and the archiving of the village\'s history and established a working vineyard that has put out wines under the Eccocivi label since 2008.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     celebrity ']}"

      Love Chanel No 5? This necklace interprets the iconic perfume with diamonds
  </h1>, 'text': 'Ever since its creation in 1921, the iconic Chanel No 5 has become arguably the most renowned\xa0fragrance in the world. A century later, Chanel has created an exquisite high jewellery necklace dedicated to the perfume.\nFeaturing an enormous, emerald-cut diamond weighing 55.55 carats (of course), the necklace is the piece de resistance\xa0in the new Collection No 5, the first high jewellery collection dedicated to a Chanel perfume. The collection will comprise a total of 123 pieces.\nThe necklace celebrates all the facets of the prized perfume, starting with the specially cut 55.55-carat centre stone that echoes the silhouette of the No 5 bottle. The D flawless diamond is surrounded by 104 round and 42 baguette diamonds that recreate the profile of the perfume bottle stopper and the bottle’s shape.\nThe pendant is then complemented by a cascade of pear-shaped diamonds of varying sizes that surround the central diamond, each cut one by one. The necklace’s fastener is also shaped like the number five\xa0– Gabrielle Chanel’s lucky number – embellished in diamonds.\nThe necklace was designed by Patrice Leguereau, director of the Chanel Fine Jewelry Creation Studio. Through the necklace, Leguereau hopes to bring together the two domains of high jewellery and perfumery. \xa0\n“Gabrielle Chanel approached these two universes with the same visionary values, focusing on audacity and the quest for excellence. I wanted to rediscover that creative gesture with this collection, which has been conceived like a journey through the meanderings of the No 5\xa0perfume’s soul, from the architecture of the bottle to the olfactive explosion of the fragrance,” he said.\nFor all its beauty and desirability, it’s a necklace that money can’t buy. Chanel has chosen to keep this treasure in its Patrimoine archives in Paris.

      Work-from-home fashion: How to enhance your ‘office’ image with 5 new trends
  </h1>, 'text': 'Have you been turning up for Zoom meetings in the same jacket/shirt/tee for the past year? You might want to consider shaking things up on the style front – a smarter, sharper looking will definitely help give the impression of a more efficient you, especially in the eyes of the bosses.\nWith many of us still working from home, the concept of workwear has understandably seen a visible shift – pre-pandemic office wear and what we now wear when we WFH being two completely different dress codes.\nSo where and how should one begin this fashion shakeup? The recently launched Spring/Summer collections is a good place to start.\nCNA Lifestyle picked the stylish brains of Libby Page, the senior market editor of Net-A-Porter, an online luxury fashion retailer,\xa0on how to shop, and even more importantly, how to style these new pieces for critical Zoom success.\n“I am always looking for pieces with versatility that can easily transition,” shared Page. “Dressing down translates well into real life, considering the reality that we are currently living in.”\nBut before you jump the gun and take the idea of dressing down literally, know that Page is in fact referring to a new fashion movement that has gained traction with the work-from-home cohort.\n“Wardrobe heroes that are wearable for a long time to come has started a buy-now-wear-forever trend that translates well into real life,” said Page. “Investment buys are a key. These pieces transcend time, have duality and can be worn multiple ways.”\n\n\nScroll down for a list of fashion expert-approved wardrobe looks you should invest in.\nAN UPDATED\xa0KNIT DRESS\n“A personal favourite would be knit dresses,” said Page. “I’ve always tried to approach shopping with a purpose, ensuring pieces have longevity and timeless appeal.”\nA big part of why knit dresses have enjoyed a resurgence has a lot to do with how comfortable they are to wear. Slipping into a knit dress for a WFH Zoom session is quick and fuss-free – no ironing required.\nTo get knitwear to look like executive-wear, Page suggested adding leather detailing. “The leather detailing on the Bottega Venetta leather-trimmed ribbed dress makes it extra special. Anything from the brand is an investment piece right now.”\nIf you already own a knit dress,\xa0add a leather necklace or bracelet or earrings to personalise and update it in a pinch.\n\n\nA\xa0SLOUCHY CARDIGAN\nAccording to Page, the new working wardrobe runs the gamut of boyfriend-style polo tops, cardigans and maxi cardigans. The unstructured nature of these wardrobe favourites have endeared them to many WFH staffers.\n“The Row’s slouchy silhouette is my personal favourite and the cardigan shown on the runway had a transitional appeal which has grown immensely,” said Page. “I always opt for a matching set for ease of getting dressed.”\nA slouchy cardigan is especially apt for moments when you need an outer piece that instantly ‘upgrades’ the basic tee you have on – perfect for that 9am team huddle when you want to look\xa0ready for a brainstorm session.\nIf, like Page, a matching set is what look you’re going for, colour code the set for an instantly coordinated look\xa0– tone-on-tone is a failsafe route to looking pulled together in a snap. Or layer different textures for an extra hit of style – for example, a cotton tee with a cotton cashmere maxi cardigan.\n\n\nRED COLOUR\n“Designers embraced an optimistic view for Spring/Summer 21, with styles coming in a sea of bold, bright colours in a multitude of fabrics and textures.” Page highlighted. “Red, in particular, was the standout colour for the season, in modern elegant and eye-catching styles.”\nRed is a very powerful enhancer with immense social influence. In a scientific finding, researchers found that the colour red actually leads to the viewer favouring one candidate over another. It’s a no-brainer then about what you should wear to the next virtual pow-wow.\nStandout red-coloured staples like a silk blouse, a maxi cardigan, a knit dress are choice additions to your current WFH wardrobe.\n\n\nTIE DYE\n“Many are craving escapism and the designers have perfectly captured this through colour, texture and prints such as tie dye,” said Page. But not just any tie dye will do. “Look for pieces with versatility that can be worn out, or at home.\nFor work-related virtual sessions, resist reaching for Bali-bought tie dye pieces unless you can’t care less about being labelled the office hippie.\nTo make tie dye work-appropriate, Page suggested introducing pieces that have “exciting but easy silhouette and shapes”. A tie dye long-sleeved tee in monotone\xa0or a coloured tie dye shirt are fun pieces for casual Fridays or simply to make your\xa0Zoom appearance more on point.\n\n\nTHE NEW LITTLE BLACK DRESS\nThe black dress is officially back. “We have seen an interesting mix of designers tapping into this iconic piece,” said Page. “I’m looking to Khaite for their beautiful and subtly sexy black dresses.”\nIf all-black feels a tad too sombre, consider black dresses with intricate details or joyful prints that will save you the hassle of accessorising a plain black dress.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     WFH ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Mechanical watches might be status symbols, but don’t overlook quartz timepieces
  </h1>, 'text': 'We’ve been loving the efforts watchmakers have made in recent years to give the ladies more mechanical movements. But as much as brands are trying to demonstrate just how much they understand women understanding horology, they are also shrewdly aware that quartz pieces aren’t going anywhere.\nNor should they. What quartz watches lack in gloriously storied pasts they make up for in accuracy, convenience and unbound style. Just let these battery-powered beauties show you.\n\n\nBVLGARI LVCEA INTARSIO \nBulgari unveiled many entrancing novelties for the ladies at the LVMH Watch Week in January, but we’d like to bring your attention to the most versatile of the lot: The Lvcea Intarsio.\nThe mother-of-pearl dial has been crafted using intarsia, which is a technique similar to marquetry except it uses pieces or chunks of material rather than veneers to create the design.\nWith or without diamonds, the Lvcea Intarsio is a work of art you can wear to work, even if it’s your home office.\nCARTIER PANTHERE DE CARTIER MANCHETTE\nThe beauty of quartz movements is that their compact size allows the lines between watch and jewellery to be blurred.\nCartier’s Panthere de Cartier collection is most commonly seen in the guise of a littler, sparklier Santos-Dumont, but when that dainty watch face fuses with a dramatic cuff, the effect is dazzling.\nThis particular model in yellow gold and black lacquer is a numbered limited edition of 100 pieces.\nCHANEL PREMIERE EXTRAIT DE CAMELIA\nThe Chanel No\xa05 perfume bottle lid and the camellia – Mademoiselle Chanel’s favourite flower – are timeless motifs that the fashion house will not soon give up using.\nHere they have joined forces for a classic dress watch with a playful twist in the form of a Premiere case with a charm attached to the crown.\nThere are two editions, both in 18K yellow gold, with either a black lacquer dial or one set with 116 brilliant-cut diamonds. Each is a limited edition of 1,000 pieces.\nHERMES NANTUCKET\nYou may be more familiar with a leather-strapped Nantucket but Hermes has always been comfortable dabbling outside its specialty with skins.\nBorrowing the design cues of the anchor chain links in its Chaine d’ancre bracelet, the slim rectangular watch gets a slightly more glamorous update with new bracelets replacing the straps.\nThere are also diamond-set options for both the steel and rose gold models.\nPATEK PHILIPPE TWENTY~4 MANCHETTE\xa0\nRound or rectangular, Patek Philippe’s Twenty~4 watches bank on straightforward design and a comfortable bracelet to encourage everyday use.\nThe two new Manchette models provide a more casual look thanks to Arabic numerals and baton indices replacing the Roman numerals and diamond hour markers of their predecessors.\nBoth references are in steel, with a blue or brown sunburst dial and diamonds on the stepped rectangular case.\nPIAGET POSSESSION\nThe absence of a winding rotor doesn’t seem like a huge loss when you have a spinning diamond-studded bezel to play with instead.\nThere are multiple variations to this fun little feature in Piaget’s Possession line, but the one pictured here is the Ref. G0A44282 which has an 18K rose gold case set with 42 brilliant-cut diamonds, paired with an interchangeable blue alligator strap.\nVACHERON CONSTANTIN EGERIE QUARTZ\nDitching the somewhat forgettable tonneau design of the original 2003 Egerie, Vacheron Constantin updated its only women’s collection last year with thoughtful details that exude femininity.\nThe interchangeable straps that are included with each watch are already a convenient bonus, but the quartz model, presented in 18K pink gold with a diamond-set bezel, makes it all the more fuss-free.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     timepieces ', '     Singapore ', '     women ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Accessories ']}"

In 2019, prices of Hermes handbags increased by 13 per cent.\xa0\nAMR is a research firm that analyses the\xa0art, antiques and collectibles market.\xa0\nAn established online auction presence, and the appetite for relatively affordable luxury pick-me-ups during the pandemic, particularly in Asia where many bag collectors are based, helped the asset class retain pole position, Knight Frank said in a press release.\nBy comparison, prices of fine wine, which came in second place in the KFLII, rose by 13 per cent. Classic cars came in third place, with prices rising by six per cent. Ferraris performed particularly strongly, Knight Frank said.\n\n\n“The market for luxury collectables, which relies on the auction market for much of its profile, is clearly badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

      What’s trending in fashion? A new Birkin, oversized jackets and sheer dresses 
  </h1>, 'text': 'As the grand finale of fashion month, Paris Fashion Week never disappoints with head-turning looks debuting on the runway. This season, designers proved once again why the City of Lights remains the world’s unbeatable fashion capital.\nEver since luxury houses pivoted to digital runway showcases, Hermes’ fashion week films have been one to watch. This time, the house presented what it called a triptych of shows, kicking things off in New York (with a dance choreography) before moving to Paris (for the fashion runway) and concluding in Shanghai (with a second dance choreography).\nAs a typically traditionalist brand, Hermes’ clothes were focused on leather-accented ensembles with subtle accents. It was the accessories, however, that stole the show. The iconic Birkin bag was given a style upgrade with a detachable compartment that can be used as a clutch.\xa0\nOther covetable accessories seen on the runway include a new Double Tour strap for the Apple Watch Hermes, and the Kiss Holder, a leather necklace meant to hold your lipstick.\nOver at Chanel, it was a succession of tweed coats for a ski-themed collection. Virginie Viard took her Chanel girls to the streets of Paris, before bringing them on a night out at Castel, a club favoured by the fashion crowd. Here, models took off their coats, revealing sheer dresses, delicate blouses and slinky bandeau tops.\n\n\nNever one to stray from drama, Louis Vuitton’s runway show took place at the Louvre, filmed in the deserted Michelangelo and Daru galleries. The collection was all about volume, with supersized dresses, voluminous tulle skirts\xa0and oversized jackets.\xa0\nAccessories, including sure-to-sell-out bags, incorporated Greco-Roman inspired drawings by renowned Italian art atelier Fornasetti.\nNotably, models walked to a soundtrack created by Daft Punk, the Parisian electronic duo that recently announced their break up after 28 years of making music. \xa0\nTitled Disturbing Beauty, Dior’s show was a fairytale-inspired theatrical spectacle, filmed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. In particular, Little Red Riding Hood was given an edgy makeover, as Maria Grazia Chiuri filled the runway with hooded capes, black leather dresses and princess-style tulle gowns.\nFashion week\xa0was also sprinkled with celebrity stardust, with supermodel Gigi Hadid making her return to the runway at Versace.

      Guys, it's all in the shoulders: Tips on how to make your clothes fit right
  </h1>, 'text': 'The shoulders play an important role in defining a man’s figure, and can significantly affect how well a guy can carry off clothes – especially when it comes to structured items of clothing like dress shirts, jackets and coats. But, of course, the shoulder’s proportions should not be considered alone, but alongside the other parts of the body as a whole.\nThe ideal body shape for men should be proportionately top-heavy – in other words, it looks like a trapezoid or an inverted triangle, in which the shoulders should be wider in comparison with the waist and hips. That aside, a guy’s height and whether or not he has a paunch will, naturally, also affect how things look overall.\nWith all that said, here’s why strong, angular shoulders are a great asset – they can do a lot for a guy, even if he is on the short side or carrying a little more weight than his frame allows for. They can help make up for what your figure lacks elsewhere or even conceal its flaws – within reasonable expectations, of course.\nNo worries, though, if yours fall short of the ideal or are making it difficult for you to find clothes that look good on you. It all boils down to knowing what will work for you, whether your shoulders are built like boulders or are on the thinner side. Arm yourself with these essential dressing tips and make them look the best they can be.\n\n\nHIGH OR STRAIGHT SHOULDERS\n\n\nA post shared by Aaron (@aaronkwokxx)\nThose who have high shoulders like Hong Kong actor Aaron Kwok typically also have a short or thick neck. If this describes you, you’ll need to pay particular attention to the necklines and collars of your shirts and tops.\nBesides obviously staying away from shoulder padding in your suit jackets, it will also help to address the appearance of a short neck. The first rule you’ll need to follow is to avoid shirts with high collars, of course. On occasions when you must wear a tie, ensure that the knot is not too small, which can make your neck appear even thicker and shorter.\nCrew-necked T-shirts are not for you as the higher neckline on them will emphasise the appearance of a short neck and high shoulders. Go for V-necks instead, as the style will visually lengthen the neck and help downplay your shoulders. The same is true for those with ramrod-straight shoulders, who will also do well to avoid tops that are striped or have prints that accentuate the lines of the shoulders.\n\n\nSLOPING SHOULDERS\n\n\nA post shared by 이동욱 (Official_Instagram) (@leedongwook_official)\nPadding in jackets is a great idea, as it can help level the sloping lines of your shoulders. You’ll also need plenty of structure – go for thicker fabrics that provide it, as well as shirts and jackets that are well constructed. Striped (both vertical and horizontal) shirts and tops are not ideal for you as they can highlight the steep gradient of your shoulders.\nThose who have a more pronounced slope in their shoulders like Korean actor Lee Dong-wook may notice that their shirts are constantly creasing or bunching up around the chest, armpit and upper-arm area. If that is the case, you may find it necessary to get your shirts made to measure in order to eliminate the problem. A customised fit will accommodate the shape of your shoulders better, which you’ll find is well worth the trouble and expenditure.\n\n\nBROAD OR WIDE SHOULDERS\n\n\nA post shared by 박서준 (@bn_sj2013)\nWhile broad shoulders are often seen as a desirable trait in men’s figures, they can sometimes be disproportionate with the rest of the body, particularly in men with small hips and a slim waist.\nThis obviously means that you should be avoiding shoulder padding in your jackets – if you want them to have a more structured, formal look despite the lack of shoulder pads, buy them or have them tailored in a thicker and stiffer fabric.\nThat said, broad-shouldered men such as Korean actor Park Seo-joon\xa0actually has the best frame for carrying off a deconstructed jacket in softer fabrics such as linen. If you’re thinking of adding an outerwear piece to your casual wardrobe, you might want to consider that.\nIf you’re very muscular, on top of being broad-shouldered, keep in mind that your shirts and tops should be loose enough to comfortably accommodate the bulk of your upper body. Going up a size could work better for you, as long as the bottom half of the shirt or top doesn’t look ridiculously loose on you. For the correct T-shirt fit, check that the shoulder seams end where they should – right at the corners of the shoulders, and not anywhere further inwards towards the neck.\nGive some thought to what you wear on the bottom half of the body too, as the right pants can definitely help balance out your upper proportions. Straight- or slim-cut trousers that are cut just that little bit loose are the best options for you. Stay far away from tapered pants or skinny jeans, as these will only make you look even more top-heavy. Some other clothing features that are likely to add bulk to your shoulders include horizontal stripes, large prints and large lapels on jackets.\n\n\nNARROW OR SKINNY SHOULDERS\nNo surprise here – men with narrow or skinny shoulders must generally dress in the opposite way that broad-shouldered guys should dress. Many of the things that do not work for bulky and wide shoulders will work well for you, and these include tapered pants, skinny jeans, printed tops and jackets with shoulder pads.\nBe careful of going OTT with shoulder pads though, as they can potentially overwhelm your slimmer frame. Structure is your best friend – look out for shirt or jacket fabrics that make your shoulders look more prominent and angular.\nMake like Korean entertainer G-Dragon and try layering with outerwear to\xa0help add bulk to the upper half of your body.\xa0Shop around for a few jackets that you can wear often and will fit with your personal style, be they sporty, denim, casual or semi-formal.\nOne thing you’ll need to avoid is the body-con T-shirt, which will highlight your narrow or skinny shoulders. At the same time, don’t go for too large a size when it comes to your tops either, as oversized clothes will not add bulk, but instead, further diminish your frame. Your clothes should fit you perfectly.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Men ', '     style ']}"

      Once upon a time in Versailles: Christian Dior conjures up edgy fashion fairytale

      This Singapore couple runs one of fewer than 10 tie ateliers in the world
  </h1>, 'text': 'As a university student, Gerald Shen was finicky about his sartorial choices. When he wanted to make pocket squares, he asked then-girlfriend Diana Chan, a crafts aficionado, to sew one with some of the vintage fabrics they had bought from Japan.\nThe final product turned out so well that they made more of the same from the remaining fabric and sold them online. The response was so encouraging that they opened Vanda Fine Clothing in 2011, a few months after Shen’s graduation.\n\n\nShen and Chan, now married, make classically-inspired ties, pocket squares and scarves with another seamstress on their team. Each product is crafted by hand in their Singapore workshop and includes Asian-inspired designs such as the Chinese zodiac and Singapore’s discontinued floral coin series. The couple, who are in their early 30s, are entirely self-taught.\nShen said, “People don’t associate artisans with two young graduates like Diana and myself. About half the visitors that come to our workshop are very surprised to find that 100 per cent of the work is done on our premises.”\n“When we started the business in 2011, Singapore was known as a sartorial wasteland to many menswear aficionados. We wanted to flip the entire notion and show that Singaporeans can actually put out something good in terms of menswear,” said Chan.\n\n\nAccording to Shen, a good tie should not only be “supple and lively” but also comfortable to wear in Singapore’s hot and humid climate.\nAt Vanda, the ties, which include four-fold and unlined six-fold versions, are cut on the bias at a precise 45-degree angle such that they drape naturally with fluidity. Instead of a flat crease, the edges are meticulously hand-rolled and stitched to ensure fullness. “That eventually results in a 3D plump finish that feels very tactile when you touch it,” Chan explained.\nThe duo design and make about 100 ties each month. They are obsessive about the details to the point of re-doing something over and over until they feel they’ve achieved the desired result. But they stop short of calling themselves “artisans”.\n“I think it’s a title that somebody bestows upon you. We’re just regular craftspeople doing things to the best of our abilities,” Shen said humbly.\nCustomers, who are mostly professionals with a discerning taste for old-world classics and styles, are appreciative of the couple’s thoughtful service, which takes into account the wearer’s body and facial features in the creation of the perfect tie with the right-sized knot.\nDespite a waiting list for Vanda’s bespoke ties, Shen and Chan end their day at 5pm every day so that they can spend time on other recreational pursuits. Shen reflected, “When we started the business, we were not even taking a day off. After a couple of months, we decided to take one day off and we realised how important that was for our mental health.\n“We like what we do, we’re happy with the work-life balance that we have. We are basically very simple folks with very simple pleasures in life.”\nEven though their business is gaining popularity, Shen feels that their craft is not highly scalable as they’d like to retain full control of what they do.\n“Luxury really is a matter of time. That’s one thing that we try and give every single client. Every tie is made with individual attention to care, whether in terms of cutting or sewing or inspection, quality control – that is what truly makes a luxury product.\n“We prefer to grow organically as we have done in the past and just reach more people globally that we have not been able to. That would already make us happy.”\n“When we started the business in 2011, Singapore was known as a sartorial wasteland to many menswear aficionados.

      What will we wear post-pandemic? A peek into the future by Fendi, Prada 
  </h1>, 'text': ""A year on since the coronavirus outbreak, the pandemic has largely influenced the trends that have emerged at fashion weeks. Stiff silhouettes made way for loose cuts, work wear took a backseat as leisurewear reigned, and neutrals triumphed over bright colours.\nBut at the recently concluded Milan Fashion Week, designers seemed to be looking ahead towards better times. After all, the emergence of vaccines have given a sense of hope that the worst might just be over. Coupled with\xa0the fact that the Fall/Winter 2021\xa0collections might\xa0hit the stores when the world returns\xa0to some sense of normalcy.\xa0\nCollections showcased on the digital runway gave a glimpse into what an emergent wardrobe might look like, when people begin to dress up again. Or perhaps, designers were just tired of lockdown leisurewear.\xa0\nKim Jones kicked off Milan Fashion Week by making his ready-to-wear debut at Fendi. Though the collection featured a restrained colour palette of taupe, camel, off-white and brown, the overall vibe was that of luxurious elegance. There were statement furs, flowing V-neck silk dresses, knit crop tops and pencil skirts, punctuated with bold accessories.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Fendi (@fendi)\n\xa0\nPrada's\xa0runway looks were joyously exuberant. Colourful prints, sequinned coats, faux fur and hypnotic patterns ruled the runway, as dynamic duo Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons reimagined a brighter winter.\n“Optimism is mounting,” Prada said in the brand’s post-show Q&A session. Just a month ago, when Prada showcased its Fall 2021 men’s collection, Simons had said, “We don’t feel it’s right, now, to be too exuberant.”\nSimilarly, Giorgio Armani’s collection was “designed for better times in mind”, he said in an email to Vogue. Rich velvet showcased heavily in the collection, moving from suits to dresses and outerwear to trousers. Ruffles and petals added a vivacious touch to the pieces.\n\xa0\nA post shared by Giorgio Armani (@giorgioarmani)\n\xa0\nMeanwhile, Valentino presented a wardrobe reset with a collection that was stripped down to black and white, with pops of gold. Pierpaolo Piccioli presented a completely new silhouette in the form of super short dresses and skirts, perhaps a hint at what women would wear after ditching their lockdown sweats in a post-coronavirus world.\nNotably, Piccioli chose to stage his show in Milan’s Piccolo Theatre, which has been closed ever since the pandemic brought to a halt cultural shows and theatre performances. The decision is perhaps symbolic of the fact that even in times of crisis, the (fashion)\xa0show\xa0must go on.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     luxury ', '     Luxury Looks ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      What’s the most flattering cut for real women who aren’t built like models?
  </h1>, 'text': 'The fashion looks we see in the glossy pages of magazines (or online) are nothing short of perfect. But here’s an insider tip: That’s only because of what we don’t see. \xa0\nThe clothes are pinned with makeshift clips in the back for a tailor-made finish, any excess body fat removed with some deft clicks of the mouse, limbs are digitally elongated – it’s no wonder then that our reflections in fitting room mirrors look nothing like all those looks we’ve been exposed to.\nLadies, welcome to the real world.\nReal women have body fat – anything from 18 to 30 per cent is\xa0recommended for optimal health. But we all know how, when wearing a dress that highlights one’s curves, even the slightest hint of something that seems out-of-place can make a dent on a fragile ego of someone who’s body-conscious.\nThere are other challenges, too. Even women who are size zeros can suffer from bad days – for example pre-menstrual bloating can increase the waistline by a full dress size, and in extreme case, by as much as two dress sizes.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nSounds all too familiar? Before you slip into a downward spiral of despair, take heart in the fact that more and more fashion designers are becoming conscious about these issues faced by real women.\xa0\nCNA Lifestyle finds out from Singaporean fashion designer Bessie Ye, whose label RYE is known for forgiving albeit stylish silhouettes, how real women should dress to look their best.\nWHAT IS THE MOST FLATTERING CUT FOR WOMEN WHO AREN’T BUILT LIKE MODELS?\nGenerally, a tent and trapeze shape dress is a universally flattering cut across all body shapes. And that is because its\xa0flared, floaty hemline takes away the attention from any imperfections, for example,\xa0a heavy bottom.\xa0\nThe most important thing to consider is the length of the outfit, whether full length or not, the outfit should create the illusion of an elongated silhouette.\xa0\nWHAT ARE THE PLUS POINTS OF A ROOMY SILHOUETTE?\nThe relaxed fit is a lot more forgiving compared to a “body-conscious” piece. A roomy dress can hide a lot of flaws such as excess around the waistline. Just add cute\xa0shoes like Birkenstocks or a pair of sneakers and you’ll look put together.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nDOES A ROOMY CUT WORK FOR PETITE WOMEN?\nThe most important thing to consider is the length of the outfit, whether full length or not, the outfit should create the illusion of an elongated silhouette.\xa0Besides the circular or tent shape, an A-line cut works really well for pint-sized ladies too.\nWHAT’S THE BEST WAY TO UP THE FASHION ANTE? \n\xa0\nA post shared by r y e (@r__y__e)\n\xa0\nAccessorising is key. I like to work minimal yet bold jewellery such as earrings, stacked rings and a bold geometric cuff in the look. As for footwear, thong sandals with simple lines are a good counterbalance for flared looks, to help\xa0the getup look instantly\xa0modern.\xa0\nWHAT’S THE WORST FASHION MISTAKE A WOMAN CAN MAKE?\nWearing strong statements altogether in one look. For example, a maxi tiered dress with a balloon sleeves and a high neck is probably not a good idea since it covers the body from neck to toe, drowning out the wearer altogether.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Milan designers hit reset button during digital fashion week
  </h1>, 'text': ""Fashion is off the hamster wheel, taking a deep breath that is allowing some freshness to seep into the once relentless cycle.\n“It is so weird thinking about fashion, and the kind of hamster wheel of fashion, and how we never had a break and always complained about it,’’ Marc Jacobs said during a Milan Fashion Week video chat with Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons post-digital show. “And then you get a break, and you complain.”\nInstead, he said, he was taking the moment to watch others, and be inspired.\nMilan Fashion Week of mostly womenswear previews for next fall and winter wrapped a nearly all-digital edition on Monday (Mar 1). Only one designer – Daniel Del Core, marking his brand's debut – held a live runway show for a small number of guests.\nWhile the bustle of live shows with the parade of itinerant fashionistas decamping from New York to London, Milan and finally Paris was missed, designers also were stimulated by the slower pace of the pandemic-era fashion cycle.\nAustrian designer Arthur Arbesser shrank his collection to just 25 looks, which he presented in visits to his Milan studio and video calls, opting out of a digital runway show.\nFor the creations, he upcycled textiles from previous collections that had been stashed in a studio cubbyhole. The designer revitalised them either by printing a new design on the other side, in the case of a pretty pleated skirt, or printing over the original with a different pattern, in the case of a black architectural detailing over a striped cotton.\nArbesser said the enforced quiet of the COVID-19-era restrictions, along with the necessity of saving money, pushed other creative forces to the fore. He and his team created a patchwork mini-dress out of cotton, silk and technical nylon, and they experimented with Shibori hand-dying for a wool mini skirt.\nThe collection bears Arbesser’s love of prints, this season’s inspired by an actual painter’s palette that he picked up at a flea market, which he mashes up with geometrical patterns and materials that range from soft silk jersey to wool to knits.\n“I felt it was important to keep writing this story, my little story, keep adding chapters,’’ Arbesser said of his eight-year-old brand. “I am happy that even doing something so reduced, so little, while at the same time producing quality, you can still be seen, you can actually sell your production.”\nGlobal masters Dolce&Gabbana took a technological leap forward with a no-holds-barred, youth-inspired collection featuring technical textiles in bold hues intermingled with hologram finishes, metallic glimmers and even multi-colored Styrofoam beads, for a feast of colourful confections.\nThe 140 looks included some reinterpretations of Domenico Dolce and Stefan Gabbana’s iconic pieces – including Madonna’s bejewelled bodysuit and corsets worn by dancers in Prince’s Cream\xa0video – from the early days when Dolce&Gabbana helped define the bold sexiness of the 1990s.\nThe result was a mix of Dolce&Gabbana’s trademark tailoring, often under strands of layered pearls and gold, alongside more futuristic elements that bely our new protective bearing: Elaborate eye shields, plastic sneaker coverings and transparent slickers. Underlining this leap forward, a humanoid robot developed by the Italian Institute of Technology acted as master of ceremonies for the digital runway show.\n“The collection is a tribute to this generation that asks us about the 1990s,” Dolce said during an in-person presentation of the looks at the designers' showroom.\nThe designers said the younger generation’s idea of sexy is much freer of preconceived notions than in the past, meaning men can wear lace T-shirts without a second thought.\n“It has nothing to do with sexuality,’’ Gabbana said. “It is almost a euphemism; it’s about pleasing themselves.”\nGiorgio Armani staged separate digital men's and women's collections in his own theatre both around a replica of a gorilla statue dubbed Uri that has been part of his personal home decor for decades. This green version of Uri evoked the designer's support of wildlife preservation, but also echoed the collections' ties to the natural world. Prints and designs that can be interpreted as leaves, or water lilies, or simple sea creatures, provided the motif for elegantly relaxed looks.\nThe fashion world also paid tribute to creative colleagues in the theatre, which have been mostly empty in Italy since the start of the pandemic.\nPierpaolo Piccioli staged the Valentino Fall/Winter 2020/21 collection live to empty seats in Milan’s Piccolo Theater, while the singer Cosima hauntingly intoned Sinead O’Conner’s lyrics: “It’s been so lonely without you here.”\nThe Valentino collection was a somber affair, fitting the moment. It featured tailored jackets that have been reconstructed into capes, layered with pointy-collared white shirts, skin-fitting tops with seemingly hand-cut holes. For women, there was a movement in flouncy miniskirts peeking out of jacket hems, while feminine flourishes like ruffles on shirts were employed with discipline. Accessories featured studded bags and boots.\nMilan designer Francesca Liberatore had planned an extravagant show in a Milan theatre with holographic effects, but decided against it in solidarity with theatre creatives who can't occupy that space.\n“I had the moral problem. How could I do a show in a theatre at this moment when artists themselves cannot recite in this place?” Liberatore said by phone.\nInstead, her virtual show featured an actor on an empty stage, and two-dimensional models, like paper dolls, in creations including reinvented trenches in camouflage, representing the state of siege society is living under in the pandemic.\n(Source: AP)\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Milan ']}"

      Why is there a nine-month waitlist for a bespoke suit from this Japanese tailor?
  </h1>, 'text': 'It was an unexpected award in his teenage years that led bespoke tailor Noriyuki Ueki to discover his passion for making clothes.\n“I made my first shirt and was awarded a prize because the school thought it was well-made,” said the soft-spoken, bespectacled Ueki. “I felt I had made a lot of mistakes, but people complimented me, and I thought, well, making clothes is fun.”\nToday, Ueki is part of a new wave of Japanese tailors trained in the Neapolitan style of suit-making, which are entirely handmade and are characterised by soft, light, unstructured forms.\nWhen he was 19, Ueki enrolled in a fashion school in Osaka to further his craft and two years later, he became a tailor at a Japanese ready-to-wear suit factory.\nSo he packed his bags and headed to Naples, the mecca of sartorial expression, to be trained and fully immersed in the world of Neapolitan tailoring.\n\n\nHe said, “I thought how fantastic it would be if the handsomeness of Italian suits and Japanese meticulousness can be combined. I went to study the skills hoping to make that a reality.”\nFor two years, he apprenticed under the master tailor Antonio Pascariello, who is renowned for his skills in the craft. They developed a warm friendship where Pascariello affectionately nicknamed Ueki “Ciccio” as an affirmation of his high-quality workmanship (“Ciccio” is short for “Francesco”, the name of several respected Neapolitan tailors in the past).\nUeki liked the name so much that he used it for his bespoke atelier. Ciccio opened in Minamiaoyama, Tokyo in 2015, seven years after he returned from Italy.\nUsing a combination of fine English and Italian fabrics, Ueki crafts light and comfortable suits with streamlined shoulder silhouettes. His serious yet gentle demeanour reflects his obsessive attention to details and a patience in perfecting the fine handiwork, especially when stitching the suit’s interior.\n“The Neapolitan suit is about softness and lightness, so much so that you feel like you’re not wearing much. For light and soft materials, they tend to move and flutter, so it is hard to get a solid shape. But the Neapolitan suit is made such that you can still see its form. I think that is its speciality,” explained Ueki.\n“If the jacket fits neatly at the shoulder, you can move your arm easily. Even if you wear it for a long period of time, you won’t feel the tension.”\n\n\nDespite a waitlist of six to nine months, sartorially discerning gentlemen still turn up at his door, knowing that he will do an excellent job for them. Ueki would ask customers to stand in front of the mirror and walk around the atelier in order to get their natural measurements.\n“I put a lot of effort into such details to make sure my customers can look sharp and smart from the front,” he explained.\nThis dedication to quality means that Ueki and his team of four tailors can only produce 150 to 160 suits a year. Yet the humble tailor isn’t resting on his laurels but sees himself as continuously working towards perfecting his craft.\nHe said, “If you look at the details of how a suit has been made so meticulously, you can gauge how much heart has gone into its craft. That’s why you would need to be perfect. I aim to make suits such that my customers are satisfied. That is everything to me.”\n“If you look at the details of how a suit has been made so meticulously, you can gauge how much heart has gone into its craft.” – Noriyuki Ueki\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      With K-pop's Aespa and an exciting creative boss, is it a new era for Givenchy?
  </h1>, 'text': 'K-pop girl group Aespa may not be a household name just yet but they’ve already caught the eye of one of the biggest French fashion houses.\nEarlier this month, the rookie quartet from SM Entertainment officially joined the Givenchy family right after Valentine’s Day as brand ambassadors.\nAespa’s new role as brand ambassadors is the latest in what’s been a growing trend of fashion brands tapping into the popularity of K-pop and K-drama – from BIGBANG\'s G-Dragon fronting for Chanel, EXO’s Kai for Gucci, and actress Song Hye-kyo for Chaumet and later Fendi.\n\n\nA post shared by aespa 에스파 (@aespa_official)\nAnd then there\'s Blackpink\'s members associated with different brands, too\xa0– Rose for Saint Laurent, Jennie for Chanel, Jisoo for Dior\xa0and Lisa for Celine.\n\n\nA post shared by Matthew M Williams (@matthewmwilliams)\nWhat’s interesting is that it’s only been a few months since Aespa debuted with the release of their single Black Mamba in November last year. But Givenchy’s creative director Matthew M Williams seems confident that the four ladies are worth banking on.\n\n\n“When I first saw aespa, I was overwhelmed by the energy each member had. As a group, I felt that the firm personality and style of each member of Karina, Giselle, Winter, and Ningning naturally connected with Givenchy\'s sensitivity. The fashion of aespa means their own colour,"" he said in a release.\n\n\nA post shared by GIVENCHY (@givenchyofficial)\nIn a way, it seems apt – new faces for a new era under Williams, who took over from former artistic director Clare Waight Keller in June last year.\nBut while he might be new to Givenchy, he’s been around the block. And trendy K-pop affiliations aside, the bigger coup for the brand is having Williams at the helm.\nAfter all, he runs in the same trendy circles as Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh and Christian Dior’s Kim Jones (Williams famously created the utilitarian buckles for Jones\' menswear debut collection at Dior).\n\n\nA post shared by Lady Gaga (@ladygaga)\nThe 35-year-old American\'s impressive resume also includes working with some of the world’s most famous celebrities. Williams was the creative director of Lady Gaga’s creative team Haus of Gaga – he designed some of her most iconic looks, before moving on to work with Kanye West on the rapper’s first clothing brand Pastelle and West’s creative agency Donda. \xa0\nThe American designer also has a womenswear label under his fashionable belt. An LVMH Prize finalist, his brand Alyx made famous rollercoaster buckles in 2018. The luxury streetwear label went on to include a menswear arm, resulting in a change of name to 1017 Alyx 9SM (a rather mouthful of a name that’s actually a tribute to his birthday, his daughter and his first Saint Marks studio.)\nWilliams’ debut effort for Givenchy in October last year is marked by a surprising anomaly. Three-toe shoes.\xa0While it’s anybody’s guess which toe will fit into which toe box,\xa0the futuristic take undeniably reimagined\xa0the staid stiletto.\nAlso on full display are exposed G-strings peeking out of low-cut backs and Williams’ highly anticipated hardware that is inspired by love locks on Paris’ Pont des Arts and\xa0fused with Givenchy’s 4G emblem. \xa0\nThe imaginative hardware is already spotted on the famous likes of Williams’ inner circle made up of supermodels Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid, as well as rapper Playboi Carti, exuding their individual brand of cool of course.\n\n\nA post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner)\n“To me, fashion expresses a point of view where formality and informality, construction and comfort co-exist,” Williams had said about his debut effort. “My ethos is about the luxury of infusing clothes with your own personality, not being worn by them.”\nBut of course, in the day and age of peak K-pop, it doesn’t hurt having one of its rising stars wearing them too.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     K-pop ', '     celebrity ']}"

      Chanel brings tweed-inspired high jewellery collection to Singapore for the first time
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the fashion world, there are certain icons that have withstood the test of time and trends. Decades after its creation in the 1920s, Chanel’s iconic tweed jackets have undoubtedly remained one of the house’s most elegant and coveted pieces.\nThere’s a romantic tale behind the birth of the Chanel\xa0tweed. Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel met her lover, the dashing Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, in the early 1920s. In that era, tweed, primarily manufactured in Scottish mills, was traditionally worn by men, including the Duke himself for sporting activities such as hunting and fishing.\nGabrielle Chanel reportedly wore her lover’s clothes on occasion, and found them to be more comfortable than traditional womenswear of the time, when ladies often dressed in restrictive, form-fitting clothes.\nThe pioneering designer\xa0then decided to introduce tweed into womenswear, incorporating new colours, materials and textures to the fabric to make it lighter, softer and more appealing. Eventually, the tweed jacket became the most recognisable Chanel garment ever produced.\nIt was the intricate and supple material of tweed that inspired Chanel’s 2020 high jewellery collection, aptly named Tweed de Chanel. The entire collection, featuring 45 exceptional pieces, was conceived to express the distinctive characteristics of tweed – its intricate interwoven structure, depth and richness of the material, and its lightness.\nTweed de Chanel is the first high jewellery collection from the luxury house devoted to the fabric. In the past, Chanel’s collections were mainly focused on figurative icons of personal importance to its founder, such as the lion,\xa0representing her horoscope; the comet,\xa0a tribute to her fascination with the stars; and the camellia,\xa0the floral emblem of the house.\n\n\nTo craft the pieces, Chanel’s artisans delicately layered and intertwined diamonds, tsavorites, pearls, sapphires and more,\xa0creating a resplendent selection of highly-textured necklaces, earrings, cuffs, brooches, rings and more.\n“This collection opens the way to a new theme. For the first time, my starting point was a fabric that Mademoiselle Chanel adored. I wanted to create tweed by using the precious materials of high jewellery, which has never been done before,” said Patrice Leguereau, designer of the collection and director of the Chanel Fine Jewelry Creation Studio.\n""For the first time, my starting point was a fabric that Mademoiselle Chanel adored. I wanted to create tweed by using the precious materials of high jewellery, which has never been done before.""\xa0–\xa0Patrice Leguereau\nNOW IN SINGAPORE\nThe collection has made its way to Singapore for the first time, marking its Southeast Asian debut. At a private event held from Feb 23 to Feb 25 at Raffles Singapore, a group of VIP clients were given a preview of the collection.\nFrom Feb 27 to Mar 17, the collection will be\xa0available for public viewing at the Chanel Watches & Fine Jewellery boutique in Ngee Ann City.\nHighlights of the showcase include the Tweed d’Ete necklace, which combines the characteristics of the fabric in a sautoir (long necklace). At almost S$2.7 million, the Tweed d\'Ete is the most expensive necklace in the exhibition.\nLike a supple weave, white and yellow gold intertwine with white and yellow diamonds of multiple shapes and sizes. The twisted rope chains that feature on the necklace are a nod to Gabrielle Chanel’s love for the seafaring lifestyle.\xa0The designer and the Duke of Westminster were known for embarking on romantic cruises together. The necklace is also set with a 7.1-carat cushion-cut yellow diamond.\nThe Tweed d’Or necklace is reminiscent of Chanel’s haute couture gowns of the 1960s, inspired by the shimmering yellow gold lame fabric used in the creations. The necklace recalls the neckline of the tweed jacket, set with a massive 20.4-carat oval-cut orange topaz. Worth over S$1 million, the necklace is the second most expensive necklace in the showcase.\nTo wear the necklace, one need only unfasten the piece through the centre stone. This is a nod to the way Gabrielle Chanel empowered women through her designs. In the past, women needed the help of others – their partners or their handmaids – to put on jewellery. But Chanel\xa0designed her jewellery in such a way that women could easily put them on themselves.\xa0\n\n\nThe Tweed Couture bracelet is another stand-out piece, fashioned in vibrant, happy hues of pink. Diamonds, pearls and pink sapphires of multiple textures and materials are interlaced together, ending at different lengths to create the effect of frayed tweed edges. Central to the bracelet is a\xa0pinkish-red Tanzanian spinel, weighing 6.72 carats.\nMeanwhile, the Tweed Graphique ring is the most expensive ring on show, priced at over S$1.8 million. Onxy and diamonds are woven in a somewhat random pattern, paying homage to black and white, the house’s signature colour scheme.\xa0\nOther must-see pieces include the Tweed Brode set, which draws inspiration from the chain sewn into the hemline of a Chanel jacket;\xa0the Tweed Frange, a modern-looking set with rhythmic lines of white gold tweed; and the vintage-inspired Tweed Chaine, where forest green tsavorites, pearls, diamonds and yellow gold chains create a scintillating weave. These gold chains are\xa0reminiscent of the chains sewn into the base of tweed\xa0jackets to maintain their silhouette.\nMONTHS IN THE MAKING \nThe Tweed de Chanel collection, naturally, took months to painstakingly create, Leguereau revealed. “From the first sketches to the final pieces, a collection like this one represents more than six months of drawings, researches and reflections. Once the drawings are done, it takes two years of conversations with the High Jewelry Workshop to create the pieces of the collection.”\nNotably, all the pieces in the collection are flexible and soft to the touch, sitting comfortably on the wrist, finger or neckline. To achieve this, the workshop\'s craftsmen paid great attention to the articulation of the various elements.\xa0\nSpecial articulation techniques were developed to imbue vitality of movement into the pieces. The craftsmen also painstakingly pared back the stone settings to the absolute minimum to mimic the litheness of the fabric.\n\n\n“Tweed is a complex and fascinating material to transpose into high jewellery,” Leguereau said. “I have transposed a weft of perpendicular threads, very geometric, onto the jewellery. What’s so amazing is that tweed lends itself to every possible variation. From the same weft, I created fringed, frayed and embroidered textures, effects that are more or less dense or airy, shades of solid coloured or contrasting stones.”\nThe Tweed de Chanel collection has undeniably captured the beauty of the fabric to spectacular effect. “What I was trying to express was the wealth of this material, and also its femininity, just as Gabrielle Chanel wanted to, when she integrated tweed into womenswear from the 1920s and constantly reinvented it ever since,” Leguereau shared.\nThe Tweed de Chanel High Jewellery collection is available for viewing at the Chanel Watches & Fine Jewellery boutique in Ngee Ann City from Feb 27 to Mar 17.

      Why did Moet &amp; Chandon collaborate with Korean-American fashion designer Yoon Ahn?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Moet & Chandon has announced its first-ever global collaboration. Partnering with Korean-American fashion designer, Yoon Ahn, the historic champagne house has unveiled a limited-edition bottle of the Moet Imperial.\nFor the uninitiated, Ahn is the co-founder and creative director of jewellery turned ready-to-wear label, Ambush. Her creations have garnered a celebrity following, often seen on pop icons such as Rihanna, Kanye West, Beyonce and Lady Gaga.\nAs if that isn\'t enough, Ahn is also the jewellery director for Dior Men.\n\n\nA post shared by YOON (@yoon_ambush)\nIt all began in 2008, when Ahn started making jewellery for fun with her husband Verbal, a member of the Japanese rap group Teriyaki Boyz. The pair, who were never formally trained in design,\xa0are known for their genre-defying, innovative\xa0creations.\xa0\nVerbal wore Ambush\'s\xa0creations during his appearances with the Teriyaki Boyz, and it wasn’t long before other rappers – including Kanye West, Pharrell Williams and A$AP Rocky – took interest in the brand.\nIn 2015, Ambush evolved into making apparel. Two years later, Ahn was nominated for the prestigious LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, which attracted major industry players for collaboration, including Nike and Converse.\xa0\nIt was her close friend Kim Jones, creative director of Dior Men, who appointed her as head of jewellery design at the brand.\nThe partnership between Moet & Chandon and Anh is particularly momentous as it’s the first time in 152 years that the iconic bottle of Moet Imperial, the label\'s signature champagne born in 1869, has been designed by an artist.\nThe champagne house\'s choice to work with Anh was driven by her pioneering spirit as a ""rule-breaker"", Moet & Chandon said in a press release.\nWith her signature minimalist aesthetics, Anh has changed the gold neck of the bottle to a deep shade of black, contrasting it with a new embossed label in white. The eye-catching design is meant to represent a blank slate, “like a window onto a future filled with possibilities for those who dare step forward”, Moet & Chandon said.\n“I was thrilled to be given carte blanche to redesign the bottle of Moet Imperial. It was a great challenge given its recognisable and iconic codes, but I also saw it as a great opportunity to bring my own aesthetics to this iconic champagne,” Ahn said.\nWhile the bottle itself has been redesigned, the limited-edition of Moet Imperial is filled with the house’s flagship champagne.\nAs part of the collaboration, a portion of the profits from the sale of the limited-edition Moet & Chandon x Ambush bottles will go to the World Land Trust, a global conservation charity that protects threatened natural habitats.\xa0\nThe mission of the organisation is to support local conservation partners, like the Fundacion Jocotoco in Ecuador, in their efforts to halt the destruction of ecosystems and protect habitats where rare and endangered species still survive.\nAnh selected the cause herself.\xa0\n“The devotion of the people at Moet & Chandon to nature and to their precious terroir...\xa0inspired me to select the World Land Trust to receive the support of the house, so that together we could help preserve other terroirs around the world,” she said.\nThe collaboration will specifically aid the charity’s efforts to preserve the Canande Reserve in the Ecuadorian Choco Forest, a spokesperson from World Land Trust said. It will have a direct impact on stopping the deforestation of the Choco, not only to preserve its fragile ecosystem, but also to combat one of the main causes of climate change.\nThe Moet & Chandon x Ambush\xa0Limited Edition bottles will be available in Singapore from Mar 5. They will retail exclusively at 1855 The Bottle Shop Suntec City and the 1855 e-shop.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     LVMH ', '     Community ']}"

      Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter makes her modelling debut at New York fashion week
  </h1>, 'text': 'They already knew she looked good in a coat. So the designers at Proenza Schouler decided to dress Ella Emhoff – art student, knitwear designer, fledgling model and stepdaughter of US Vice President Kamala Harris – in a couple of coats (plus a pantsuit) for her modelling debut in their new collection, unveiled Thursday (Feb 18) for New York Fashion Week.\nDesigners Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough said the fashion world took quick notice when 21-year-old Emhoff appeared at the inauguration in January, dressed in a quirky Miu Miu coat with bejeweled shoulders along with a starchy white collar. Social media took notice, too.\nSoon after, the designers were planning their February show – actually a digital short, for pandemic reasons – and the casting director mentioned Emhoff. “And we said, ‘We were just talking about Ella.’ Seemed like everyone was kind of talking about her,” McCollough said in an interview.\nAs it turns out, Emhoff, a senior and art major at Parsons School of Design (where Hernandez and McCollough met and began their partnership), had just signed with IMG Models, joining an even bigger breakout star of the inauguration: Poet Amanda Gorman.\nThe outdoor shoot took place recently on a blustery weekend at the Parrish Museum in Water Mill, New York. It was the first time Emhoff had walked a runway.\n“I have to say I was a little nervous,” Emhoff, daughter of Harris\'s husband Doug Emhoff, said later in a streamed talk with the designers, also released Thursday. “I definitely lost a little sleep the night before. I\'m walking for the first time, I\'m in this professional environment for the first time ... the anticipation was really high."" She spoke of her love for knitting and textiles, and her dream of her own knitwear brand.\n“She kind of reminded us of our friends and ourselves in a lot of ways back when we were at Parsons,” McCollough said. He and Hernandez launched their own brand from their senior thesis collection.\nFor Emhoff, the designers chose a long gray wool coat with fluffy embellishments on the shoulders, then a midnight navy leather trench-type coat, and finally a black pantsuit. Also walking in the virtual runway show is Meadow Walker, daughter of the late actor Paul Walker.\nEmhoff also wears some of the label’s typically unique footwear – leather socks topped by a strappy sandal.\n“We very much believe this moment is about the elimination of anything superfluous, the elimination of excess,” Hernandez said, explaining the ethos of the collection at a time when fashion itself can feel, well, superfluous. “Just reducing things to their most essential basic forms. All the buttons are invisible buttons. The pockets are just internal.""\nHernandez said he saw Emhoff representing “this idea of a new beginning, a whole new chapter in American life, in American culture.""\n“She\'s a nice sort of ambassador of the new moment,"" he said, before moving artfully away from any political implications. “You know, via the filter of fashion and art and craft and the world that we all inhabit. She’s sort of the ambassador of that.”\n(Source: AP)\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Kamala Harris ']}"

By doing so, the printed shirt stands out and at the same time, draws attention to similarly coloured accessories you have on.\n\n\nWHICH PRINTS ARE EVERGREEN?\nTrends may come and go but floral and polka dots never seem to go out of style. They have been around for hundreds of years. Geometrics have also endured the test of time – uniform and symmetrical, they are pleasing to the eye and also suitable for most body shapes and types. In fact, prints work for almost everyone.\nWHICH PRINT IS THE EASIEST TO WEAR? \n\n\nA post shared by The Shirt Bar (official) (@tsb_theshirtbar)\nGeometric prints are probably the easiest to wear. Not only are they easy on the eyes, the clean lines they are made up of foster a sense of order and cleanliness, sending the signal of uniformity and consistency to our brain.\n\n\nWHICH PRINT IS BEST LEFT TO THE PROS? \nAnimal prints are best reserved for the pros as they are not easy to pull off.\nARE PRINTED SHIRTS ONLY SUITED FOR CERTAIN BODY SHAPES? \nOn the contrary, prints are suitable for all body types and shapes as they have the ability to conceal our flaws while accentuating our personalities at the same time. \xa0\xa0\n\n\nSHORT-SLEEVED OR LONG-SLEEVED? \n\n\nA post shared by The Shirt Bar (official) (@tsb_theshirtbar)\nAs a rule of thumb, stick to printed long-sleeved shirts for work, date nights and formal events, and short-sleeved printed shirts for the outdoors and weekends.\nCAN YOU SHARE A TIP ON HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH PRINTED SHIRTS?\nOne of the best tips is to match a printed shirt with a solid-coloured pants or jacket. I tend to avoid matching printed tops with printed bottoms. But there are no hard and fast rules to fashion – wear what you will.\nWE WANT SOME STYLE INSPIRATION: WHICH CELEBRITIES WEAR PRINTED SHIRTS BEST?\n\n\nA post shared by John Legend (@johnlegend)\nJohn Legend – How many men can pull off a double print and still look classy?

      What does nature have to do with how jewellers shape their creations? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Some things in life are constant. Nature is one of them. Amid\xa0these unpredictable times, it’s heartening to know that the Earth continues to spin on its axis, the sun will rise at dawn and set at dusk, the stars will twinkle in the night. Trees sway in the breeze, birds chirp, and flowers continue to bloom.\nDuring times of upheaval, humans have found comfort in nature. This holds true in today\'s pandemic-stricken times. When we found ourselves holed up at home for weeks on end, we sought solace by taking walks in parks, or by looking up at the sky.\nMan’s fondness for\xa0nature is something that the jewellery world has long recognised. Nature-inspired jewellery is a design trope that has endured for decades. After all, what could be better than holding a piece of the world in your hands? These six designs surely attest to that.\n\n\n\n\nCHAUMET NUAGES D’OR NECKLACE\nIn life, there are times when we experience stormy days when nothing seems to be going right. But the clouds clearing up after a thundery shower, with sunlight breaking through, bring about a sense of optimism.\xa0\nThis one-of-a-kind Nuages D’Or necklace by Chaumet is set with an array of white and yellow diamonds. With harmonious soft curves and steely ""rays"", the necklace is reminiscent of clouds glowing in the sky after a storm.\xa0\nThe necklace is graced with a 12.88‑carat golden yellow Ceylon sapphire, which represents sunlight streaming through the clouds.\n\n\nCHOPARD GINKO EARRINGS\nWe share the planet with a spectacular array of flora, from dense rainforests to magnificent redwood groves.\xa0\nPaying tribute to the beauty of trees, these statement Gingko earrings from Chopard\xa0drip\xa0with 33.3 carats of pear-shaped emeralds, 16.5 carats of brilliant-cut yellow sapphires and 14.9 carats of tsavorites, reminiscent of lush green foliage.\nCARTIER MAGNITUDE APHELIE\xa0NECKLACE\nThe desert and its seemingly endless stretches of sand have come to symbolise the obstacles and hardships standing in the way of man and his dreams.\nCertain stones are rarely seen in high jewellery, but jewellers such as Cartier aren’t afraid to break the mould.\xa0This pink gold Aphelie necklace from Cartier’s Magnitude collection features a golden brown rutilated quartz pendant as the star of the show, a gem that\'s not as highly prized compared to, say, rubies, emeralds or diamonds, but breathtakingly beautiful nonetheless.\xa0\nDelicately studded pink diamonds, morganite and onyx are arranged in a sunray motif around the cabochon, injecting the necklace with cheery hues of coral and pink.\n\n\nCHAUMET ETOILES ETOILES NECKLACE\nAmid\xa0hardships and uncertainty, there are days we wish we could escape by taking off into the skies.\xa0\nIt is the magical allure of the Milky Way that inspires Chaumet\'s\xa0Les Ciels de Chaumet collection. Recreating the beauty of the sky, the Etoiles Etoiles necklace is a shower of white gold and diamond stars, draping elegantly on the decolletage.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nPIAGET ECSTATIC DANCE EARRINGS \nThe view of a pink horizon, courtesy of the sun retreating at dusk, is one of life’s most beautiful moments to savour.\xa0\nOn Piaget’s Ecstatic Dance earrings, rubellites and pink tourmalines capture the vivid shades of sunset. The earrings are accented with Palace Decor hand-engraved rose gold – a labour-intensive, age-old technique that produces a soft effect etched on the surface of the gleaming metal.\xa0\nLeather, wood, and mother-of-pearl marquetry are carefully cut and meticulously positioned to create an effect akin to rays of light.\nLORENZ BAUMER METEORITE RING\nFor centuries, humans have been fascinated by extraterrestrial objects streaking across the sky. When these objects fall onto Earth, they’re known as meteorites.\xa0\nInspired by these “space rocks”, this Lorenz Baumer\xa0Meteorite Ring in white gold features a 4.34-carat yellow diamond and 4.39 carats of brown diamonds. The entire spectacle is accentuated by 0.31 carats of white diamonds.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      ‘If we sell our products online… We won’t be able to sleep’: Kyoto bag-maker
  </h1>, 'text': ""We don’t know whether to feel worried or impressed by the cavalier attitude of bag-maker\xa0Shinzaburo Ichizawa, who has no qualms making the same old bag designs for the past century.\n“To keep ahead with the times, people focus on productivity and efficiency, or convenience. If we chase after those, we can’t make products that complement, and are useful to, our lives,” he remarked.\n\n\nFounded in 1905 by his great-grandfather Kihee Ichizawa, Shinzaburo has inherited a four-generation patriarchy that began its legacy by making hardy work bags, designed to carry milk, ice blocks, carpenter’s tools, and bottles of sake.\nToday, the Ichizawa Shinzaburo Hanpu brand specialises in highly functional bags for men and women under three main collections, differentiated by the fabric – from cotton canvas to hemp and tough sailcloth used to make tents.\nIn its arsenal of bag styles, you’ll find backpacks, totes, shoulder bags, Boston bags, and other smaller canvas accessories – all with a wide range of fun prints or solid shades. Supposedly, Ichizawa has garnered quite a cult following with known celebrity fans, the likes of Sofia Coppola. Who knew?\n“We’ve been making products with canvas for a long time as it’s a durable fabric. I want to continue\xa0making products that people will\xa0use for many years and won’t tire of,” exclaimed Ichizawa.\n\n\nWhen he took over the business in 2009, Ichizawa quickly grew it from a small workshop of 10 craftsmen to 70 today. For every veteran bag-maker, there is an apprentice assigned to him. Pairing the artisans up in this way assures skills are passed down from master to student – Ichizawa’s idea of a sustainable business model.\n“We don’t have a manual to tell you exactly how you should make the bags. Everyone has their own written notes. It has been like this since we started,” he revealed.\nAll apprentices are expected to train for a minimum of seven years before they graduate as veterans. Typically, they are responsible for simpler processes like threading the sewing machine, attaching buttons, and hammering the hardware.\nOne of the most crucial skills they must master is achieving the 1cm crease, as it’ll be harder to sew if the measurements are off, even by a millimetre. This exacting standard and display of Japanese-level engineering is the reason why people continue to love Ichizawa bags.\nAll the bags are handcrafted and hand-sewn using traditional Singer foot-pedal sewing machines, which every veteran bag-maker is assigned. Many of the machines are old and come with their own characteristics. Swapping them among the artisans is highly unlikely, as they have grown familiar with the settings of their hardware.\n“It is impossible for all sewing machines to be exactly the same. If I’m using a different sewing machine, I’m able to adjust it to about 70 per cent of my preference. But to have it resemble even 95 per cent of a machine I’m used to, will take months of continuous adjustments,” shared veteran craftsman, Yoshitaka Sato.\nSince introducing new bag designs isn't a priority, Ichizawa does not hire dedicated bag designers. But he will take the lead and conduct ad-hoc brainstorming sessions to discuss new product ideas.\n“First, we listen to suggestions from various people. Then we improve on the design numerous times and conduct user trials. Finally, when we have a good product is when we start selling it,” he shared, noting that a new design can take several years before it's finally marketed.\nTo acquire a bag for yourself, you have to travel to Kyoto and visit Ichizawa’s outlet as it doesn’t sell online or anywhere else in the world, nor does it have any desire to expand beyond its place of origin. Ichizawa firmly stands by his philosophy: Made in Kyoto, sold in Kyoto.\n“If we sell our products online there will be enquiries from customers 24 hours a day. We won’t be able to sleep. Instead, we’d want the customer to come to our store, and find a product they like by seeing it, holding it, or even smelling it.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

These flowers will never wilt, just like your endless tenderness.\xa0\nSpeaking the correct language of flowers will infinitely\xa0up your chances.\xa0A single bloom suggests that she is the only one or love at first sight.\xa0Two blooms stand for mutual affection. Three blooms stand for “I love you”. Six blooms stand for “I want to be yours”.

      Why watch enthusiasts should collect independent brands, according to Urwerk
  </h1>, 'text': ""After several years amassing and assembling a watch collection, there comes a point in a collector’s life when he or she begins to look beyond the big name brands. That is when he or she tends to gravitate towards the independents – creators that march to the beat of their own drums, free from corporate pressures.\n\n\nOne such maker is Urwerk, which Geneva-based watchmaker Felix Baumgartner and Zurich-based artist Martin Frei co-founded in 1997. Their firstborn, the UR-101, was a radical feat of micro-engineering straight out of a sci-fi flick. With a design inspired by Star Wars’ Millennium Falcon, it was as far removed from any other mechanical watch at the time, and set the tone for the company for the next two decades.\nThe teaser video for Urwerk's UR-111C was a tribute to Blade Runner, which happens to be one of Frei’s favourite movies, along with Star Wars and the space opera Star Trek. CNA Lifestyle spoke to Frei to find out the value of collecting independent brand timepieces.\nWHY SHOULD A WATCH ENTHUSIAST COLLECT INDEPENDENT BRANDS?\nFor the beauty, the human talent, the creativity, the sincerity injected into each creation. We do not have five-year plans. We do not rely on complex marketing strategies. Our communication tools are our watches. They are our way of expressing ourselves.\xa0\nWHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO A WATCH ENTHUSIAST WHO IS LOOKING TO START COLLECTING INDEPENDENT BRAND TIMEPIECES?\nTo follow his heart. First you spot the watch. The one that makes your hand sweaty and your brain repeat endlessly ‘Mine’. You try to get as much information on it as you can: on websites, social media, magazines... And then the fun starts because you can actually pick up your phone or drop an e-mail to its creator and you know what? He is going to answer you back. You have a direct connection! You cannot contact a Mr. Rolex or a Mr. Omega but for sure you can talk to (independent watchmakers) Philippe Dufour or Kari Voutilainen or Felix Baumgartner or myself.\xa0\nWHAT ASSURANCE CAN YOU GIVE THAT A WATCH FROM A NICHE BRAND LIKE URWERK WILL HOLD ITS VALUE?\nWe cannot give such assurance. Buying independent is not an investment! You buy something rare that you feel related to. You buy it to be your own, to have it on your wrist, to live with it and be the witness of precious time. For investments please refer to your banker :)\nWHAT DO YOU THINK THE NEXT BIG THING IN WATCHMAKING WILL BE?\nWhen it comes to watchmaking trends I try not to follow them too closely. I want to preserve my free spirit. I am not from the watchmaking world, my background is more from the artistic side and I like it that way.\xa0\nMORE WATCH BRANDS AND RETAILERS ARE SELLING ONLINE. DO YOU SEE THIS AS THE WAY FORWARD? \nYes I do. We live in an e-connected world and watchmaking will be no exception. It is an area like any other discipline that has to evolve with its time. But to be frank I think that nothing will ever replace the firsthand experience. You may fall in love with a creation online but in my opinion, the real bond will be created when you have it in contact with your skin, on your wrist.\nURWERK BEGAN MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO WITH THE INTENTION OF CHANGING THE STATUS QUO. WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE ABOUT THE WATCH INDUSTRY TODAY?\nI would not change much. I see diversity, creativity and boldness all around.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      The Japanese denim label with a one-year waiting list for its S$2,600 jeans
  </h1>, 'text': 'A once bustling port city with its history rooted in textile manufacturing, Kojima, in Japan’s Okayama prefecture, has been cultivating cotton as far back as the Edo period. But due to its waning population, businesses started to fail and eventually, all that was left were old, shuttered stalls lining the abandoned streets.\nYears later, Kojima breathed new life again thanks to one Hisao Manabe, CEO of Japan Blue Jeans and a leading figure in various revitalisation projects for the city, including a 600m-long denim-themed street aptly called Kojima Jeans Street.\n“I wanted to make the town more lively. When I was thinking of what would be good for that, I thought, let’s make a street full of jeans. I wanted people in Japan and around the world to come and buy jeans here,” he shared.\nCreated in 2010, the street has well over 40 denim brands, each specialising in either vintage, loungewear, womenswear or custom-made jeans, like Manabe’s own label, Momotaro Jeans.\nAs you walk down the lane looking into the beautifully decked-out concept stores, you will instantly feel an artisanal spirit and passion for denim craftsmanship.\nThere are numerous boutiques, galleries, cafes, and restaurants that make up the hip neighbourhood, with a clothesline display of jeans hanging overhead. The perfect ending to an indigo-filled day would be a stop at the ice-cream parlour for some delicious blue soft-serve ice cream.\n\n\n“I want to promote craftsmanship here in Okayama, in Kojima. I want this place to be known even more as ‘Jeans Town’ so that it appeals more to the rest of the world,” he remarked.\nManabe started producing denim for other jeans manufacturers earlier in his career, but as his passion for denim grew, he too was inspired to create his own label focusing on premium textiles.\n“No matter how much detail we put into our work, if it is invisible, no one will know. We had the know-how of making jeans, and wanted to create our own brand that lasts. Our aim was to make Momotaro with the best Japanese denim there is,” he expressed.\nLaunched in 2006, Momotaro steadily built a cult following in Japan, the US and Europe. Its popular Going to Battle collection features dark indigo denim with signature double white lines on the back pocket. But the creme de la creme is the Gold Label – made-to-measure jeans that have a one-year waiting list and a price tag of 200,000 yen (almost S$2,600) a pair.\n\n\n“I wanted to make something comparable to vintage jeans with meticulous craftsmanship the Japanese are known for and a certain sense of obsessiveness for quality,” said Manabe on the rationale behind the high price tag.\nMomotaro jeans are made from 100 per cent Zimbabwean cotton. The threads used to create the denim are painstakingly hand-dyed with natural indigo. And they need to be dyed over and over again\xa0a total of 30 times.\xa0Five bundles of these threads are needed to make one pair of jeans.\nThe hand-dyed threads are woven by a traditional manual handloom exclusively for Gold Label jeans. It takes about a week to weave material for just one pair of jeans, and the workshops only produce four pairs of Gold Label jeans a month.\n“In textile making, I believe it’s better to weave the denim slowly. You can feel the difference in those that are weaved well. This process requires patience. Sometimes we get told that we’re foolish, but this is what we must be particular about,” he insisted.\nThe meticulous work put into producing a regular pair of Momotaro jeans is just as tedious. One pair of jeans goes through 15 different types of machines and over 30 sewing processes. This slow and systematic approach can churn up to 100 pairs a week.\nLike the story of Momotaro – where a young boy springs forth from a big peach to symbolise good health and longevity – Manabe hopes his label will go far in the world. “Momotaro is not just a fashion brand that offers the latest trends, it creates real clothing to be loved forever.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      Aunty no more: The freshest way to wear gold accessories this Chinese New Year
  </h1>, 'text': ""Unlike precious gemstones, yellow gold plays by an entirely different set of rules. The value of a piece of yellow gold jewellery isn’t necessarily commensurate with how much it costs.\xa0And it is not uncommon for 18-karat designs to sell for much more than 24-karat ones.\nThe cost of the basic model of Cartier’s Love bracelet starts from S$6,050, for example. For the same amount of money, you can probably score quite a few 24-karat bracelets. Yet that has not stopped the Love bracelet from amassing a legion of fans.\n\xa0\nIt’s really all down to street credibility when it comes to yellow gold jewellery. How you wear it is as important as what you wear. Scroll down for tips on how to add clout to your styling choices.\nCHOKER\nThe chain-linked choker is arguably the best everyday jewellery investment. It has the uncanny ability to dress up even the simplest outfit. Pair it with a plain white tee or a boyfriend shirt and the throw-and-go outfit magically turns into a curated look – casual with a hit of bling.\nTo really ride this trend well, pick a chain link size that works best for the length of your neck. Ladies with short necks might want to consider scaling back on the thickness of the chain links as exaggerated links can create the illusion of a shorter neck. Or wear it looser,\xa0move\xa0the choker a little lower – rest on the collar bone – to elongate the neck.\nCHAIN NECKLACES\nYou would have noticed that most necklaces are fashioned like amulets. So a good luck charm like Van Cleef & Arpels’ clover-shaped Alhambra that can be customised with your lucky stone is a good place to start. And since more is more when it comes to luck, layering is the way to go for complete customisation. To get around the problem of necklaces knotting together, you’d want to wear varying necklace lengths.\xa0This way, each charm gets better visibility.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nBANGLES\nBangles are the best way to have fun with fine jewellery. Visually, they are best worn stacked.\xa0Try wearing two of the same kind or a series of different ones – from altogether different styles to even different materials or gold finishes. Whatever works best for your mood since there are no hard and fast rules.\nBRACELETS\nBracelets are somewhat like creepers in the jewellery world. Add them to a watch or a bangle and watch them take on a brand new life form. Gold bracelets are versatile in that they work with almost any other piece of jewellery. For example, a yellow gold watch, a rose gold bangle, a leather bracelet and even a sterling silver playboy chain. Definitely a bang for buck investment.\nEARRINGS\nThe colour gold works exceptionally well with Asian skin tones. The amber in the gold picks up the yellow in the undertone like a perfect match. Gold earrings worn close to the face acts like a natural highlighter that brightens the mien.\nWhile big golden hoops have proven that they are true style staples, other shoulder-dusters are scoring big on creativity and individuality. It's\xa0a game of go big or go home when it comes to earrings.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nRINGS\nPut a ring on it. Whether he does it or you prefer to do it yourself, let a statement ring signal your intention. Depending on the message you intend to send out: Chanel’s Coco Crush says no to conformity, Cartier’s Just Un Clou nails it, Chaumet’s Bee My Love is indicative that love is in the air. Pick one that works for your mindset then let your fingers do the talking.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Bling enthusiasts: You know you want a Cartier icon, but do you know why?
  </h1>, 'text': 'In times of uncertainty, people reach for the certain. After all, truisms can be grounding and comforting: Chicken soup is great for colds. There will always be a market for gold. Someone will want your Rolex Daytona. Everything is going to be alright.\nIt is the things that have stood time’s many, many tests that offer us hope that we can survive along with them. Knowing this reveals a big part of how luxury’s biggest brands are weathering this storm. The reason they have such healthy reserves is because over decades – and even centuries in some cases –\xa0they have mastered the art of timelessness.\nGiven how the past year has been, this is a powerful boon.\nAccording to Deloitte’s Global Powers of Luxury Goods 2020 report, creating legendary and iconic products is just as vital as promoting product scarcity and exclusivity where adaptability is concerned.\nIt stated: “Luxury goods create status that is resistant to the passing of time; and this makes luxury goods, handbags and watches in particular attractive to personal collectors and a secondhand market. In times of uncertainty luxury collectibles are considered a secure longer-term investment.”\n\n\nAmong these collectibles, there is one brand that is successful almost to a point of (well-deserved) smugness: Cartier. Its brand value has been on a non-stop climb in recent years, from US$6.7million (S$8.9 million) in 2017 to US$15 million in 2020. It was also last year that a Cartier Tutti Frutti bracelet sold for US$1.3 million at a Sotheby’s auction, breaking the record for highest price for any jewel sold in an online sale.\nBut it’s not these one-off, high jewellery pieces that the majority have access to, nor surprisingly even want.\nAntonio Achille and Daniel Zipser of McKinsey & Company believe that “after a large-scale crisis with a heavy emotional toll, consumer preferences could shift… toward ‘silent luxury’ – paying more attention to classic elements, such as craftsmanship and heritage, and less to conspicuousness and ‘bling’.”\nNot that Cartier ever needed bling to shine.\nA lot of what makes something iconic is recognisability, and Cartier has achieved this from form alone. If we asked you to picture a rounded square watch with exposed screws on the bezel, chances are high you’ll be thinking of a Santos or a Panthere. “Love” and “bracelet” are generic words until they’re put together, and then an image of a bangle that needs a dedicated screwdriver to unlock might spring to mind.\nWhich brings us to Cartier’s next asset: Comfort.\nThe entire point of the Love Bracelet is that it’s hard to take off, giving its wearers some pretty story about being locked into love, so the bracelet had to be comfortable enough to be worn at all times. With this, Cartier essentially extended the jewellery occasion into an all-day, everyday affair.\nIt’s not just the Love Bracelet that has been engineered to be worn round the clock. The links in watch bracelets, the gentle curvature of a watch face, the rings’ smooth edges – every detail has been devilishly looked after.\nMoreover, not a single line or stroke could be wasted in the drafting of these designs. Because when the overall shapes are so basic to begin with, it’s the minutiae that sets them apart.\nThink about how the Tank watch manages to differentiate itself from every other rectangular dress watch on the market. To the casual observer it just has an angular case that extends straight into the lugs, but in Cartier’s words, it’s all about the “purity of the line” and the “accuracy of the shape”. Basically, Cartier knows how and when to leave things alone.\nThere is a fine line between purity and laziness, but it’s one that Cartier doesn’t tread – it just hunkers down and does the homework. Yes, the Juste un Clou really is “just a nail” as its name audaciously declares, but the precision of the bracelet’s proportions, together with its representation of freedom and rule-breaking, has made it a cult jewellery piece.\nLikewise, the Ballon Bleu is not just another round watch, but an obsessive study in symmetry. The Trinity ring couldn’t have gone on to spawn bangles, earrings, pendants (and in some cases another shape entirely) if Cartier hadn’t added perspective and created depth to give dynamism to a familiar form.\nMinimalism as a design movement only really took off in the 1960s and 1970s, which makes Cartier’s much older icons, like the Trinity ring, Santos and Tank watches, all the more remarkable in their longevity. Keeping things simple also allowed Cartier to introduce a great many variations, through complications, metals, precious stones and jewellery types, ensuring its designs reached as wide a demographic as possible.\nClearly, that strategy worked.\nCartier’s watches and jewellery are worn by men and women young and old, by celebrities and by normal folk. All because the brand was smart enough to see itself as a designer first and watchmaker/jeweller second.\nJust like people, long-lived things have stories to tell. And Cartier has ensured that its story can be told again and again, in different guises, and across the generations. That’s the beauty of icons – they never get old.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     design ', '     history ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ']}"

      Red, yellow or huat? These are the colours you should wear this Chinese New Year
  </h1>, 'text': ""Half the fun of Chinese New Year comes from playing dress up in accordance to customs.\xa0For some, the undeniable sensuality of the cheongsam as worn by Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung in the movie In The Mood For Love is forever engrained in our consciousness.\nLike Cheung, when we don a cheongsam, the neck magically lengthens under the collar; the figure automatically morphs into an hourglass thanks to the ingenious darting at the waistline; the legs are elongated by the high slits at the sides. We (almost)\xa0effortlessly assume an air normally reserved for screen goddesses.\nPlaying the body double for Cheung sounds easy enough, well, in our imaginative minds at least, but what you are hoping to attract into your life will impact the colour of the cheongsam you reach for. If luck, workplace recognition or peace of mind are what you have your eye on, then you’d do well to dress the part.\xa0\nScroll down to find out which colour, according to customs, will help you reach your goal faster.\xa0\nRED\n\xa0\nA post shared by Ready-to-Wear Cheongsam (@mandarinpeony)\n\xa0\nWhy is there always a\xa0sea of bright red all over Chinatown during Chinese New Year?\xa0It’s simply because the colour is considered to be extremely auspicious, representing increased income and wealth.\xa0The propitious hue is said to attract good fortune.\nBesides the superstitious advantages of the colour, red has the ability to enhance a person’s (both man and woman) appearance to be considered more attractive as discovered by multiple studies by researchers.\xa0\nFair maidens will benefit from sticking with cool reds with a blue undertone to draw attention to her alabaster skin, while ladies with an olive tan will do well with coral reds (that is red with a tinge of orange) to achieve a glowy bronze.\nThe scarlet hue is also favoured when it comes to accessories. Feng shui experts will tell you that a red bag holds the key to abundant luck – but it’s also practical, right? They make a perfect fit for that vermillion cheongsam.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nYELLOW\n\xa0\nA post shared by The Missing Piece (@iwantthemissingpiece)\n\n\xa0\nIn accordance with ancient Chinese culture, the colour yellow is strictly reserved for royalty – the Chinese emperor’s robe is a bright yellow. Loosely interpreted, the colour represents recognition, power and rank.\xa0\nThese days, yellow is associated with positive qualities such as happiness, optimism and creativity, making it a great colour for those looking for job place recognition – with limitless creativity comes remarkable work that inevitably leads to job satisfaction and recognition from the bosses.\nYellow wears exceptionally well against those among us with a warm undertone – to be exact, look for canary, butter, medallion, butterscotch, honey and mustard. If you’re planning on putting your best foot forward this Chinese New Year, a pair of yellow shoes could just set you on the right path.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nGOLD \n\xa0\nA post shared by LAICHAN (@laichan_official)\n\xa0\nGold represents wealth\xa0and money, therefore it is regarded as auspicious. A flashy cousin to yellow, gold also wears especially well on olive skintones. But if you’re a tad too shy to go all out ala the cast of Bling Empire (hello, Christine), try flashes of gold in the form of accessories instead. Gold chain link bracelets and stacked rings are on the uptrend.\nGold-hued bags that mimic the look of tiny sacks of gold are a fun way of partaking in the customs of Chinese New Year. Be it 24K gold, champagne gold or rose gold, there's never a better time to sign up as a gold member. Try wearing several shades of gold to create a gradient\xa0twist.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nGREEN\nBesides yellow and gold, green is also considered to be auspicious as it is symbolic of nobility. Chinese aristocrats wore jade to demonstrate their elite privilege and as a public display of their fortune.\xa0They also used jade as a form of protection against evil spirits.\nLike them, you can also make jade your lucky stone or wear the colour of jade to take full advantage of its supposed benefits. But if looking like a Christmas tree doesn't exactly gel with\xa0your idea of chic then try green in small doses. A green belt to pull the look together, a charm bracelet with a green clover charm or an emerald\xa0chain bag to hold your possessions should do nicely.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nBLUE \n\xa0\nA post shared by BATIK SHOP SINGAPORE (@yeomamabatik)\n\xa0\nBlue symbolises flowing water, which is linked to the idea of restoration. It is also believed to have the ability to strengthen friendships and aid in networking. Besides just wearing blue as a solid colour, consider using them in unexpected prints and unusual styles and turn them into icebreakers with acquaintances. After all, networking inevitably begins from a simple conversation.\xa0\nPlanning to accessorise with a nice watch? Pick one with a blue strap to match your Yves Klein blue wardrobe. Instead of standard calf leather, reach for a fancy crocodile or lizard skin version\xa0that will no doubt make a better match with\xa0your Birkin.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Chinese New Year ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Bling Empire: Which were the key luxury items in Netflix's hit series?
  </h1>, 'text': 'By now, you would probably have caught Bling Empire on Netflix, the\xa0reality series\xa0that follows the lives of a bunch of rich Asians living in LA. Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that it’s difficult to take your eyes off the excess\xa0of luxury goods featured in the show, from supercars and\xa0high jewellery\xa0to over-the-top couture outfits and even designer kids’ clothes.\nWhether they’re attending dinner parties, meeting fortune tellers and shamans, getting mouth massages or even just hanging out at home, the cast members of Bling Empire are always decked out in designer goods, in just about every\xa0scene and episode.\nTake, for example, the bejewelled Dolce & Gabbana tiaras that both Cherie and Christine are fond of;\xa0Anna’s Dior slingback heels;\xa0Jaime’s statement Chanel earrings;\xa0and of course, Kane’s insane designer shoe wall featuring Louboutin slides, Louis Vuitton sneakers, Saint Laurent boots and more.\xa0\nThere are\xa0way too many designer goods to list, but\xa0three items\xa0were key plot devices, serving to drive the various storylines forward.\nCHRISTINE’S LOUIS VUITTON NECKLACE\nBling Empire opens with an episode titled Necklacegate. Christine, arguably the series’ ""villain"", dons an eye-catching Louis Vuitton high jewellery necklace to a party hosted by Anna, who also owns the exact same one. This sparks a bit of a rivalry between the two socialites, setting the tone of their relationship\xa0throughout the series.\nThe necklace in question appears to be from Louis Vuitton’s 2010 high jewellery collection, Les Eclatantes. It features Louis Vuitton’s classic monogram flowers interlaced with sparkling diamonds and pink sapphires. As Christine said in the show, you can\'t simply walk into a boutique to purchase a piece of high jewellery. You have to be invited.\xa0\nANNA AND KELLY’S BOUCHERON FRIENDSHIP RINGS\nOver at CNA Luxury, we’re big Anna Shay fans. We\'ll admit to being\xa0blown away by her generous private jet excursions to Paris. In one episode, Anna flies Kelly to the French capital for her birthday and takes her to the Boucheron boutique, which, by the way, is\xa0shut just for the pair to shop. Where can we sign up to be a friend of Anna’s, please?\nAnna then proceeds to buy Kelly a friendship ring from the jeweller’s iconic Quatre collecton. Quatre, meaning four in French, brings together four different kinds of gold bands into one ring. It was first launched in 2004, but since then, several different iterations of the Quatre have been released.\nOf course, it’s this shopping trip that leads to the blowout between Kelly and her boyfriend Andrew. The pair’s toxic and dramatic, on-again, off-again\xa0relationship becomes a\xa0focus of the series.\nKEVIN’S DIOR B23 HIGH TOP SNEAKERS\nAnna sure has a penchant for treating her friends. She’s obviously a top Dior client as well, because she orders a collection to be sent to her home just so she can try it on.\xa0\nAs part of Anna’s shopping spree, the socialite buys model and resident goofball Kevin a couple of gifts, including a pair of Dior B23 High Top Sneakers with a black and white Dior Oblique motif and transparent panelling. The shoes were a part of artistic director Kim Jones’ first sneaker collection for Dior.\nAlso part of Anna’s gifts to Kevin was the Dior Men x Raymond Pettibon’s Reimagined Mona Lisa silk shirt from the\xa0Fall/Winter 2019 collection, which he\xa0wore to Kane’s Singapore-themed party.\nKevin, who is new to high society, then begins to worry that the gifts were all a part of a test. So he tries to return the sneakers to Anna, who tells him to keep them and\xa0then gives him a life lesson.\xa0\n“Don’t let the clothes wear you, don’t let the skateboard skate you, don’t let the car drive you. Don’t be impressed by things,” she said.\nWord, Anna.

      Menswear takes a dramatic turn with Dior’s ceremonial garb, Vuitton’s skyscraper jackets
  </h1>, 'text': ""Fashion houses have become well-accustomed to showcasing their latest collections digitally, now that online presentations have become the norm. Paris Fashion Week was no different either, with several brands presenting their collections through a series of films.\nParis Men's Fashion Week (Jan 19 to Jan 24) took place hot off the heels of Milan Men's Fashion Week. But while brands that showcased at the latter seemed to play it safe, the likes of Dior,\xa0Loewe and Louis Vuitton\xa0went for more innovative ways (and in some cases, dramatic) to capture the attention of the audience at home.\nHere are the highlights of Paris Men's Fashion Week.\nDIOR \nAt a time when most brands are focusing on comfort, Dior went in quite the opposite direction, debuting a collection of lavish ceremonial wear. In keeping with a running tradition of artist collaborations, Kim Jones, the house’s artistic director of menswear, chose to work with Scottish artist Peter Doig.\xa0\nThe painter, who lives and works between Trinidad and London, is known for his enigmatic, moody landscape paintings, which gave Dior’s collection a somewhat dreamlike quality.\nUniforms, including accessories such as boots and berets, were a central theme to the collection. Doig’s landscapes were transposed onto garments throughout the collection. The colour palette was similarly inspired by Doig’s work, featuring shades of blue and brown alongside pops of yellow and orange.\nOur favourite was the show’s opening look featuring a glittering, gilt-embroidered coat which took 1,200 hours of work, worn over a military-inspired star-buttoned shirt.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Dior Official (@dior)\nHERMES\nFor Hermes’ digital presentation, men's artistic director Veronique Nichanian teamed up once again with film producer Cyril Teste. In the film, models sauntered up and down the central staircase of France’s Mobilier National building, pausing for conversation or glancing at their phones.\n\n\nHermes is known for its preference for quiet luxury, and this collection was no different. The clothes were certainly wearable for the times, blurring the lines between private and professional. “Inside-outside, the clothes leave their framework,” read the show notes.\xa0\nZippers ran up and down high-collared shirts, trousers were cut loosely and featured drawstring waists, pockets were applied like patchwork and placed askew, giving the garments a more casual feel. To ground each look, models wore either glossy leather boots or brightly-coloured sneakers.\n\n\nA post shared by Hermès (@hermes)\nLOEWE\nEver since the pandemic hit, Spanish luxury fashion brand Loewe has been changing the game when it comes to presenting new collections. For its Spring/Summer 2021 menswear collection, the brand presented a show-in-a-box concept that included\xa0a pop-up, mini-runway set.\nThis time, creative director Jonathan Anderson opted to dispatch a “show in a book” to the homes of editors and insiders, a cloth-covered compilation of comics, collages and graphics by the late artist Joe Brainard.\n\n\nA post shared by LOEWE (@loewe)\nBrainard’s work served as the primary inspiration for the brand’s collection. Brainard’s popcorn drawings feature on black jeans, pansies are scattered over loose, oversized cardigans and high-top sneakers. A sketch of an underwear features on a tote bag and a T-shirt. The result was a collection that was upbeat and colourful, captivating with its child-like quality.\nLOUIS VUITTON\nVirgil Abloh, artistic director of menswear at Louis Vuitton, debuted his latest collection with a dramatic, multi-disciplinary performance that blended elements of slam poetry, dance, concert, art installation, ice-skating and more. In\xa0this collection, Abloh explored themes of ethnic identity and cultural appropriation.\nThe performance, inspired by Stranger in the Village, a 1953 essay by novelist James Baldwin, is narrated by American rapper and actor Saul Williams. Dressed in a black coat, Williams\xa0is shown meandering\xa0through an abstract city made of green marble and a snowy outdoor landscape, interacting with models dressed in pieces from the collection.\nMuch of the collection was wearable, but what caught our eye were\xa0the conceptual pieces in the form of dramatic cityscape jackets.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Louis Vuitton (@louisvuitton)\nThe Paris Skyline Puffer Jacket presented the architecture of the French city, incorporating elements from the Notre-Dame cathedral, the Louvre, and the Eiffel Tower. Another\xa0jacket, titled the New York City Skyline Puffer Jacket, featured\xa0skyscrapers from a variety of cities, including New York and Chicago.\nWhen we can’t fly to these cities, why not wear them as jackets? We kid, of course.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Men ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Masks aren’t going away, upgrade them with the mask chain
  </h1>, 'text': 'Soon after the face mask became an essential accessory, designers swept in\xa0with their own versions: Masks made of silk, tweed and satin; decorated with fringe, bows and sequins; for daytime and nighttime; for weddings and political rallies.\nWhen it became clear that we’d be wearing masks for a while, some added another element: a chain or lanyard for safekeeping (and extra flair).\n\n\nA post shared by Second Wind (@bysecondwind)\n“It’s a cool accessory piece that falls in with the other necklaces, but it’s also functional,” said Karen Perez, whose company Second Wind\xa0helped catalyze the trend with gold, silver, gunmetal and Lucite chains that hang from its hand-cut linen and silk masks.\nPreviously reserved for librarians and extremely athletic people (we see you, Croakies), such retainers have been gaining purchase with stylish wearers. Jewellery designers and other fashion-adjacent professionals have been making their own. Major retailers like J\xa0Crew, Free People, Fossil, Ann Taylor and Banana Republic sell them, and thousands more can be found on Etsy. Celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Mindy Kaling, Elle Fanning\xa0and Busy Philipps\xa0have been spotted wearing them. (After losing several cloth masks, I’ve become a mask-chain enthusiast too; my favourite is made of plastic rainbow links and was clearly marketed toward children.)\n\n\nLele Sadoughi, who designs jewellry and accessories, began producing masks this spring. After a flash of inspiration, she had her team take new photographs of her line of sunglasses chains\xa0to show that they could be used to carry masks as well.\n“We went from selling a few dozen a week to selling hundreds a week,”\xa0Sadoughi said. “It’s almost a million-dollar category for us now.”\n\n\nA post shared by Second Wind (@bysecondwind)\nPerez started Second Wind in the summer, after months of living off savings; her work as a stylist had dried up early in the pandemic. On July 21, she announced a pre-sale on Instagram, expecting around 100 orders. Within 24 hours, she sold 10,000 products.\n“I didn’t have that stock,”\xa0Perez said. “I didn’t even have that much fabric.” To prepare the orders, she worked 20-hour days for seven weeks, with her family members helping her out in the mornings and evenings.\n\n\nA post shared by Second Wind (@bysecondwind)\nThe buzz really ramped up when big names caught wind of Second Wind. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, visited Perez’s studio in August; this month, she wore a Second Wind mask and chain when she was sworn in for her second term in Congress. JLo\xa0has also been photographed in a Second Wind design.\xa0Perez said that Bloomingdale’s, Amazon and Selfridges are among the major retailers that have asked to carry her products, but she has turned them away. She isn’t ready to scale her business to that level. (As of now, Perez works with 40 artisans, and her sisters handle logistics and marketing.)\n\n\nThe life span of a mask chain may seem limited, like that of a mask itself, but Sadoughi believes the accessory will be useful even as more people are vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that even those who have been vaccinated wear a mask and socially distance for now: Though tests of the coronavirus vaccines show that they’re incredibly effective, individuals can still contract the virus while the vaccines take hold and could possibly still spread it\xa0– especially if they come in close contact with others or stop wearing masks.\nEven as coronavirus infection rates fall, Sadoughi is betting that people will want to wear masks and mask chains on airplanes or on public transport. Perez said that Ocasio-Cortez made a similar point. “She said she would continue to wear a mask when she feels under the weather,” Perez said. “It’s a way to show respect for other people.”\n\n\nWhatever happens next, Sadoughi’s company has already benefited immensely from all the new customers the masks and chains have brought. In 2020, the company saw an 80 per cent increase in sales and five times as many new customers on the website as in 2019. Part of that was from people buying the masks and the chains,\xa0Sadoughi said, but many also purchased headbands or pearl earrings to go with their new protective accessories.\n“Every other category has gone up,” Sadoughi said. “Our direct business has really exploded. We’ve had a record revenue year.”\nBy Valeriya Safronova\xa0©\xa0The New York Times\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Pandemic ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Chinese New Year fashion: Hits and misses from Burberry, Dior, Gucci and more 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Every Chinese New Year, luxury fashion brands come up with limited-edition capsule collections that commemorate the occasion. With 2021 being the Year of the Ox, we initially thought it would be difficult to transform the bovine figure into\xa0a covetable, fashionable motif (unlike, say, a dog or tiger).\xa0\nSo we were\xa0excited to see what leading labels would\xa0come\xa0up with this year, and boy, were we in for a ride.\nBURBERRY\nBurberry’s Chinese New Year campaign aims to “celebrate the natural world”, the brand stated in a press release, highlighting the ox’s association with the Earth. We were pleasantly surprised by the house\'s\xa0limited-edition ox-inspired Thomas Burberry monogram motif.\xa0\nThe entire collection features heritage Burberry trench coats and sports-influenced pieces. Our favourite, however, is the new red-and-yellow colourway for the Olympia bag that will surely add a pop of colour to any CNY outfit.\nBVLGARI\nThere’s nothing particularly special about Bvlgari’s CNY collection, since it’s a curated collection and not a new release. We suppose there\'s no better time than CNY\xa0to bring out the jewels, making Bvlgari icons such as the B.Zero1 Rock and Serpenti line impossible to resist.\nWhat caught our eye, however, was the new\xa0Serpenti Forever bags and accessories capsule collection, centred on two gem-inspired hues: Red Amaranth Garnet and purple Magenta Spinel. We’re loving the Serpenti Forever crossbody bag and bracelets in Magenta Spinel. If you feel that red is\xa0too common and expected for CNY,\xa0purple makes a nice twist.\nDIOR\nDior’s CNY collection is sure to be a favourite among\xa0fans of streetwear. To usher in the Year of the Ox, Kim Jones collaborated with fashion designer and artist Shawn Stussy. A motif celebrating the ox is revisited in shades of navy blue, white or red, bearing the Dior\xa0and Shawn signature in minimalist graffiti.\nWe love how the collection features comfortable sportswear styles that are trending\xa0at the moment,\xa0such as a jersey hoodie enhanced with moire\xa0effects, a two-tone reversible T-shirt, sweaters, an overshirt and a vintage-style bomber.\nThe house’s emblematic bags have also been reinvented. A new, white version of the popular Saddle bag, punctuated with\xa0""Dior"" in red, is a standout piece.\nKENZO\nWe like how Kenzo’s collection puts a spin on everyday garments such as T-shirts, hats and sweatshirts. The calligraphy-like Ox graphics and animations that can be seen across the collection are also cleverly executed.\xa0\nWe also like how the collection breaks away from traditional colour schemes, offering options in monochrome colours like black and white apart from\xa0red.\nGUCCI\nWhile we loved Gucci’s CNY collection last year, we find it hard to take a liking to this year\'s release. In 2020, Gucci tapped on Mickey Mouse for an adorable collection that celebrated the Year of the Rat. This year, the collection features Japanese manga character Doraemon.\nIt’s difficult to fathom what Doraemon has to do with the Year of the Ox, but we’re sure that the collection will delight fans of the popular robot cat.\nUpdate: It seems like the powers-that-be at Gucci have heard our cries. The fashion house has since revealed a new CNY Doraemon collection, this time with the robot cat disguised as an Ox. We can\'t deny that this series has more of a festive feel.\nVERSACE \nThis year, Versace is presenting a capsule collection that boasts “vibrant and uplifting prints”, but we found the designs a bit too ostentatious for our liking. An array of ready-to-wear pieces and accessories have been printed with a\xa0reinterpretation of the Medusa Amplified motif, which features rolling Medusa discs in the shape of records.\nThe reason why records were chosen, Versace stated in a press release, is that music is synonymous with celebration. There are two distinct colourways available. While\xa0the black-and-gold version is a bit much, the second colourway with pastel shades of violet, baby blue, mint green and yellow is a lot, shall\xa0we say, easier on the eyes. \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Chinese New Year ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

It was a gift from Chisholm\'s goddaughter.\n“Because of Shirley Chisholm, I am,” Lee, who is black, posted on Twitter. “Because of Shirley Chisholm, Vice President Harris is.”\nThe pearls Harris wore, by Wilfredo Rosado, were also a symbol of unity with her sisters in Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first African American Greek-letter sorority, said Rachel Torgerson, fashion features director for Cosmopolitan. The sorority\'s founders are referred to as the “Twenty Pearls.” Every new member receives a badge adorned with 20 pearls.\nHarris attended Howard University, one of the nation\'s historically black colleges and universities.\n“There’s no doubt that every part of her look today celebrates who she is, where she came from and where she hopes to lead the country. Every piece was carefully considered and packed with meaning,” Torgerson said.\nLike Harris, Rosado is the child of immigrants.\nVermont Sen\xa0Bernie Sanders drew fashion praise on social media for his cozy, comfortable inauguration wear: His signature beige parka and a pair of knit patterned mittens. The look earned him his own inauguration Bobblehead to mark his viral fashion moment. It\'s now on pre-sale for US$25 at the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum’s online store.\nJill Biden wore an ocean blue wool tweed coat over a dress by American designer Alexandra O’Neill of the Markarian label. The new first lady\'s matching coat and dress included a velvet collar and cuffs on the coat, and a chiffon bodice and scalloped skirt on the dress. The neckline of the dress is embellished with Swarovski pearls and crystals. The same crystals adorn the coat. The outfit was handcrafted in New York City.\nAides said Harris was dressed in Christopher John Rogers and Sergio Hudson. Both are black designers, Rogers from Louisiana and Hudson from South Carolina. Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, wore a Ralph Lauren suit.\nMichelle Obama, a fashion icon, drew praise from fans on social media for her belted pantsuit in plum, also by Hudson.\nJoe Biden wore a navy blue suit and overcoat by Ralph Lauren. It was a change from Brooks Brothers, the oldest US\xa0clothier at 202. The brand has outfitted 41 of the 46 American presidents, including Barack Obama during his inauguration in 2009.\nBrooks Brothers fell on hard financial times last year, when it filed for bankruptcy reorganisation and announced a planned sale. Ralph Lauren has a history of nonpartisan dressing, including moments with Michelle Obama and outgoing first lady Melania Trump. Joe Biden wore Polo shirts, emblazoned with the label’s pony and polo player logo, to take both of his COVID-19 vaccinations on television.\nVéronique Hyland, fashion features director for Elle magazine, noted the wins for young American designers.\n“They chose a diverse group of talents – Christopher John Rogers, Pyer Moss’ Kerby Jean-Raymond, Markarian’s Alexandra O’Neill and Jonathan Cohen – to be a part of this historic moment,"" she said. “It made for a meaningful statement at this particular time, when all small businesses, including fashion businesses, are in need of support and spotlighting.”\nHarris’ choice to wear pieces by black designers “felt particularly significant in light of her triply historic title as the first female, black and Asian American vice president of our country,” Hyland added.\nAs for the colour purple, it was a symbol of unity and bipartisanship. Republican Red and Democratic blue make purple.\n“If there’s a message to be taken from today’s inauguration fashion, it’s that those who attended are signalling faith in unity and bipartisanship, as well as restoring truth and trust,” Torgerson said.\nHillary Clinton confirmed she wore “purple with a purpose,” telling The Associated Press: “I want to just send a bit of a symbolic message that we need to come together.”\nLady Gaga went for red and let her pin do the talking. She sang the national anthem in a lavish custom Schiaparelli gown designed by Daniel Roseberry with a full red skirt and a navy coat adorned with a humongous gold dove holding an olive branch.\xa0\nGarth Brooks went another way: Country. He performed Amazing Grace\xa0holding his black cowboy hat and dressed in blue denim jeans paired with a black suit jacket and shirt.\nAnother inauguration fashion star on Twitter was Nikolas Ajagu, the husband of Harris\' sister, Meena Harris. Sharp-eyed sneakerheads noted his ultra-rare and pricey Air Dior Jordan 1 shoes. The Dior 1s, a collaboration between Dior and Jordan, debuted last year and retail for US$2,000. They\'re reportedly going for up to US$7,000 on some sneaker resell sites.\nHarris\' stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, schooled some of the older folks in her embellished Shetland Miu Miu coat in a pied de poule pattern with a large brown button at the neck and a pointed collar.\n“To put it quite plainly, over the last four years we’ve been starved for fashion choices from the White House that are thoughtful and intentional for the sake of the greater good,"" said Nikki Ogunnaike, digital director for Harper’s Bazaar.\n(Source: AP)\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Joe Biden ', '     Kamala Harris ']}"

      How Netflix’s hit show Bridgerton offers lessons in the art of power dressing
  </h1>, 'text': 'Into the long, colourless stretch of days between Christmas and New Year’s arrived Bridgerton: the bright, baubled, deliciously frothy Netflix period drama about a promising young debutante’s quest to find a suitable husband in her first London social season.\nSet in 1813, the same year Pride And Prejudice was published, Bridgerton has all the trappings of a Jane Austen romance, but with a modern warp. It imagines a Regency-era society presided over by a Queen Charlotte who is a woman of colour (some historians have theorised Queen Charlotte had African ancestry) and where titles of nobility are held by both white and black people.\nAn aesthetic tour de force with a racially diverse cast and a rather liberal number of sex scenes, Chris Van Dusen’s and Shonda Rhimes’ eight-episode show has been a broad crowd pleaser for Netflix. The streaming service recently said that the adaptation of Julia Quinn’s romantic novel series is on track to reach 63m households in its first four weeks, making it one of its most-watched original productions to date.\nAnd though one might not have expected 19th century finery to inspire a shopping frenzy, it is nevertheless occurring: According to fashion search engine Lyst, online searches for corsets (+123 per cent), empire line dresses (+93 per cent), pearl and feather headbands (+49 per cent) and even long gloves (+23 per cent) have soared since the show’s debut. Call it the “Bridgerton effect”.\nMuch of the credit for those figures lies at the hands of Ellen Mirojnick, the Emmy-winning costume designer whose extensive CV includes the wardrobing of Wall Street, Fatal Attraction and Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil.\nIn line with the show, she has taken period trappings and made them more modern, lush, extraordinary: Fabrics and embellishments are of vibrant, man-made colours; empire line dresses are rendered soft and fluid with over-layers of organdy or tulle; wigs are towering and tinged with lilac. The men are dressed in the tightly tailored morning coats, breeches and cravats of Regency dandies, but the fabrics are showier.\n“This wasn’t going to be a bonneted show,” said Mirojnick on a phone call from Los Angeles. “The difference between a Jane Austen (period) piece and ours is that we chose to shift it, to give it a more modern, more aspirational feel, one where a modern audience could look at it and perhaps say: I wish I could have that.”\nOutfitting the cast of Bridgerton was a Herculean task: Mirojnick called it “the biggest show she’s ever done”, likening the workload to “three exceptionally large films”. She presided over a team of 232 people, who together created or hired about 7,500 costumes – an undertaking rivalling The Crown.\nThe spectacle is impressive. But beneath the frippery are lessons in dressing in ways that communicate power, personality and taste, and flatter the wearer.\nEasily the most striking character is Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh), a commanding hostess who sits at the centre of Bridgerton’s social web. We meet her in episode one, when the most eligible bachelor in Britain, the newly elevated Simon, Duke of Hastings (Rege-Jean Page), attempts to offer his regrets for not attending a ball she is hosting later that evening. “Your regrets are denied,” she replies, firmly. His resistance quavers.\nLady Danbury is a calculated power-dresser who exudes gravitas; she is queenly but with none of the excess of the show’s real queen (Golda Rosheuvel). Her colours tend to be dark or icy – scarlet, amethyst, silver – with regal collars and sharp edges (nearly all of her jewellery is “prickly”, Mirojnick pointed out). They also flatter her complexion. In lieu of a bonnet and purse, she wears a man’s top hat, miniaturised, with a dandy’s stately walking stick. She doesn’t shy away from a full set of jewellery, even in daylight.\nEverything about her dress is designed to intimidate. In a later episode, she tells the duke that she was extremely shy as a girl, and to overcome it, “I sharpened my wit, my wardrobe, and my eye, and I made myself the most terrifying creature in any room I entered.”\n“We eliminated all soft elements from Lady Danbury. She had an edge,” says Mirojnick. “If you look at all of the details – her coat, sleeves, the back of her garments, they are all very precise, very sharp, and very specific, just like she is . . . She didn’t go to (the towndressmaker) like everyone else did; she had her own.”\nAt the opposite end of the intimidation spectrum is the show’s principal character, Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor), an innocent, chaste, well-dowried debutante determined to find a love match. Everything about her is exceedingly dainty, from the pale blues and whites of her empire-waist gowns, to the slim necklaces around her throat.\nAnd then there are the three young women of the nouveau riche Featherington family, who in contrast to Bridgerton’s soft tones are dressed in acidic hues that overwhelm their complexions: lemon, orange, tart green. “I think those colours suit them,” Mirojnick argued, describing them as “Versace-esque”. “They aren’t elegant – but they are elegant for the characters... (the whole family) is so lively and high-spirited and audacious.”\nAs for the queen? The real Queen Charlotte wore the same silhouette from the day she married George III until her death, and Mirojnick stuck to it for the series. What did change was her wigs, which took on different heights, widths, even colours. “That was her element,” she said.\nMirojnick has a talent for making actors look their best, and I ask her if she has any advice for the rest of us. “Know who you are from the inside out and see yourself clearly in the mirror. And don’t follow trends. Pick from the trends what suits you.”\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2021 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Netflix ', '     television ', '     fashion ', '     Television & Movies ']}"

      Where is menswear headed? Comfort takes centre stage at Prada, Zegna and others
  </h1>, 'text': ""It’s been a year since the last COVID-free fashion show took place in Milan. With lockdown restrictions still gripping\xa0Italy, and the pandemic across Europe showing no signs of letting down, it will be a while before Milan Fashion Week returns to normalcy.\xa0\nRegardless, the Fall/Winter 2021/2022 menswear show must go on, albeit without the usual fanfare of buyers, influencers, celebrities and media in the audience.\nThis year, the presentations were rolled out from Jan 13 to Jan 19. While some brands\xa0opted for pre-recorded digital presentations, others went ahead with staging physical shows. Some decided to hold a hybrid between the two, also known as a “phygital” format. Dolce and Gabbana, however, pulled out of fashion week completely.\nAs the pandemic continues to change shopping habits, menswear is now retreating back to the casual wardrobe. Tailoring has taken a softer approach, blurring the boundaries between formal and leisurewear.\nMenswear powerhouse Ermenegildo Zegna\xa0opted for a phygital presentation titled The Re(Set). The clothes focused on generous, loose silhouettes, crafted from comfortable jersey fabrics, suede and cashmere. Shawl collars, belted coats, track pants and hand-cut jersey slippers reshaped the idea of formality.\n“Outdoor and indoor come together and a new way of dressing takes hold, where comfort and style blend to create a new aesthetic,” said artistic director Alessandro Sartori in a press statement.\nRaf Simons’ much-anticipated Prada menswear debut echoed similar\xa0sentiments. The collection was dominated by a single garment – cosy long johns. This warming undergarment was worn under every outfit in the collection. They came in different patterns and textures, from art deco to jacquard motifs.\n\n\nA post shared by Prada (@prada)\nOuterwear such as pin-striped blazers, lapel-less peacoats, re-nylon parkas and oversized bombers were layered over the long johns.\n\n\nA post shared by Prada (@prada)\nThe clothes played around with colour juxtaposition, but other than that, there was nothing about the collection that was over-the-top in any way. “We don’t feel it’s right, now, to be too exuberant,” Simons said.\nMeanwhile, Silvia Venturini’s Fendi collection mixed wearable minimalism with pops of colour. The bright colours injected a sense of optimism into a Fall/Winter collection, which typically favours a darker, sombre palette.\xa0Many of the garments were reversible, indicating that functionality is key.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Fendi (@fendi)\nWhile certainly wearable, we found the garments bordering on the\xa0unimaginative. It was the accessories line, where crossbody bags, satchels and totes were offered in luxurious colours and materials, that piqued our attention.\n\n\nA post shared by Fendi (@fendi)\nSince most of us are spending more time at home, leisurewear has become\xa0our go-to style. It's heartening to see then, that designers are taking cues from this.\xa0\nAfter all, fashion should make sense for our daily lives.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Milan ', '     Italy ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ']}"

      How this bespoke lingerie maker from Tokyo wants to empower women
  </h1>, 'text': 'A trip back to her birth country led American-Japanese designer Chiyono Anne Jaeger to start her eponymous bespoke lingerie brand.\nJaeger was born in Japan but grew up living in New York and London. While pursuing a degree in Japanese language and literature, she had the opportunity to study in Tokyo for a year – an experience that opened her eyes to a world that was altogether very different from the one she grew up in.\n“That year, I had a culture shock looking at the position of women in society. There were expectations on physical appearance, down to what hair colour, what nail colour you had to have, to do a certain job.\n“It’s very different from the environment where I grew up in London.”\nShe went on to pursue a postgraduate degree in fashion bodywear in the UK. When she graduated, she returned to Japan to launch Chiyono Anne in 2014, the first bespoke lingerie store in Japan, and one of the few in the world.\n“I discovered that there’s a way to empower women, to make it okay for women to look how they choose to look, not to fit the society. It turned out that it was a lingerie brand that fitted what I wanted to do.”\nIt was probably also a latent calling that was waiting to be unveiled.\nJaeger had always been into painting, drawing and making things. She enjoys expressing her ideas through design and did ballet from the age of three to 20 years old.\n“I was really used to wearing the leotards and costumes that fit you, that are comfortable and easy to move in. They are durable, but also look beautiful and make you feel feminine and strong at the same time. Growing up, that was normal to me.”\nForm-fitting fashion piqued her interest, not so much outerwear, but innerwear, as she found it to be a very intimate form of women clothing. She shared, “You can wear what you like and I think it gives that kind of a boost, like a spark when you are wearing something that you really love.\n“On the other hand, it can bring you down if you are wearing something you don’t really like, or doesn’t really fit you, that you don’t really love.”\n“I think it’s easy for people to forget their feminine side, but I think it’s important to refresh yourself now and again. It could be wearing a lacy lingerie or whatever it is you like, or wearing some silk clothing that makes you feel womanly and comfortable.”\n\n\nJaeger firmly believes that a bespoke designer’s most important value is authenticity. Inspired by a love for dance and art, her collections are constantly imbued with a sense of delicateness and sensuality. Only high-quality silk satin and lace are used as her ethos is to create lingerie that will last and grow with the wearer.\nTogether with two other seamstresses, she personally designs and handcrafts every order, including complicated pieces such as a bespoke bra that consists of 10 to 30 different parts. There would be several rounds of fitting before the custom piece is made.\nAs such, prices are not cheap but they are made to last. This unusual concept of longevity for underwear was Jaeger’s main challenge in attracting customers at first.\n“A lot of people think that sustainable fashion is [about] using organic cotton, or using plastic recycled stuff, but it’s not just about the fabrics. I think it’s the intention of the piece, of the garment, whether you choose to design it to wear for many years or it’s easy to throw away,” she shared.\n“I would like to create pieces that are meant to be investments that fit you, your body and your needs. It’s not something that you throw away, but made to last.”\n“I would like to create pieces that are meant to be investments that fit you, your body and your needs. It’s not something that you throw away, but made to last.” – Chiyono Anne Jaeger\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      Cute bag charms, Birkin straps: Our favourite accessories from Hermes’ new collection
  </h1>, 'text': ""There’s something about the spring and summer months that radiate hope and vivacity – at least in countries that experience the four seasons. And even though Singapore doesn't, we could still very much use an uplifting dose of positivity.\nWhich is why, at a recent press presentation, we were heartened to see vibrant pops of\xa0colour injected into Hermes’ Spring/Summer 2021 Objets collection.\xa0\nJaunty\xa0as they may be, the items remained true to Hermes' heritage of exquisite craftsmanship. The house is\xa0one of few to continue crafting timeless keepsakes, and the Spring/Summer 2021 Objets collection is no different.\nAs is par for the course, several items\xa0feature\xa0subtle nods to the label's equestrian legacy. We loved how discreet those details were, some almost unnoticeable at first glance. \xa0\nAmong our favourite pieces were adorable bag charms, beautifully printed silk scarves that double up as artwork, and refined jewellery inspired by the Birkin bag. Here’s a closer look at the standout pieces.\nLA DANSE DES CHEVAUX DOUBLE-FACE SCARF\nThe La Danse Des Chevaux Double-Face Scarf is Hermes’ first scarf to be printed on both sides, with different colourways on each side. Pictured on the scarf are three horses beating the ground in a rhythmic trot, with the double-face printing adding contrast to the illustration. We love the combination of colours that make this piece a\xa0sure standout\xa0if displayed as art\xa0in the home.\nKELLYDOLE BAG CHARM\nWe couldn’t help but squeal with delight at this adorable miniature Kellydole bag charm, crafted in Tadelakt calfskin and Mysore goatskin. It’s also a true feat of master craftsmanship – the saddler construction, gusset and strap assembly, as well as the miniature swivel clasp, are all incredibly detailed. More than just a hanging bag accessory, the Kellydole charm can also be used to store small objects, such as loose change, mints, or your new AirPods Pro.\nHARNESS IN SWIFT CALFSKIN\nHere’s a new way to carry your Birkin. Inspired by equestrian bridles, Hermes has created a leather harness for the iconic bag. Slot your Birkin in, and the harness will cradle the bag. And with the leather strap, you'll be able to sling the Birkin over\xa0your shoulder. \xa0\nPRECIEUX BIRKIN LONG NECKLACE\nThe Birkin bag has also found its way onto Hermes’ fine jewellery. Here, the Birkin is suspended on a long necklace, sitting delicately on the decolletage. Fashioned with a chainmail that crosses at the centre, we love this\xa0radical design. The Precieux Birkin Long Necklace is available in new combinations of materials – silver and rose gold, rose gold and diamonds, or white gold and diamonds.\nHERMES DELLA CAVALLERIA BAG\nOK technically the Della Cavalleria Bag made its debut in the Autumn/Winter 2020 collection, but it has just arrived in Singapore. The bag’s jewel clasp, shaped like a horse’s bridle bit, and its deep red colour, left a deep impression on us. Not to mention the gently curved base, which we're told is a technical feat of leatherwork in itself. This\xa0crossbody bag comes with\xa0an adjustable strap.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Now in Singapore: Gucci's much-anticipated collaboration with The North Face
  </h1>, 'text': 'In what was an unexpected announcement, fashion house Gucci unveiled back in September 2020 that a collaboration with outdoor clothing company The North Face was in the works.\nStarting from today (Jan 11), the highly-anticipated collection is now available in Singapore at the Gucci Paragon boutique. Before you head down, here’s what you need to know about\xa0the collaboration.\nThe collaboration between Gucci and The North Face was born out of the desire to celebrate “the spirit of exploration”. While The North Face famously outfits those who seek adventure, Gucci has always catered to the curious, designing its clothes as tools for ""those keen to embark on literal explorations of places and culture"", or metaphorical adventures encouraged by creative director Alessandro Michele.\nIt’s an extensive collection, comprising everything from ready-to-wear, accessories and\xa0luggage, to shoes, tents and sleeping bags.\nWhile the padded coats, bombers and vests from the ready-to-wear collection may not be suited to Singapore’s weather, they can always be kept for overseas adventures when travel resumes. What’s more practical for now, however, are the T-shirts. For the ladies, there are skirts and chemise dresses.\nSome pieces in the ready-to-wear collection come in bright colours and feature floral prints, while others feature The North Face x Gucci logo incorporated into the design.\nLike the coats and jackets, the luggage is best kept for when travel resumes (unless you\'re a heavy staycation packer). There are eight new graphic patterns designed in collaboration with The North Face. All feature bright colours and a variety of either Gucci House motifs or different versions of the new The North Face logo x Gucci print.\nThere\'s also\xa0a gender-neutral hiking boot with a chunky and sturdy Goodyear-welted sole. The boot comes in three leather colours (brown, black and cream), and features eyelets and rope-like\xa0striped laces, as well as The North Face x Gucci logo prominently displayed on the side.\nFor your weekend nature walks, there are two backpacks and two belt bags dressed up in exclusive prints. A dome-shaped medium backpack (available in five different prints) has contrast leather patches, rope zip pullers and web straps, while a larger size (available in six different prints) recalls hiking backpacks with its multiple pockets and top flap with snaps, and also features the same detailing as its smaller cousin.\nA small belt bag comes in seven different prints, while a maxi size one with three front flap pockets is offered in two different prints.\nThe collection is in line with the two brands\' commitments towards sustainability. Luggage contain ECONYL®,\xa0a nylon fabric sourced from regenerated materials (from fish nets, carpets and other scraps) that can be recycled and recreated.\xa0\nAdditionally, the colour palette of the collection was inspired by the 70s and curated from The North Face\'s materials library. Archival fabrics have been partially incorporated to give them a new life.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      In full bloom: Why this nature-inspired jewellery collection is apt for a new year
  </h1>, 'text': ""From season to season, there’s always a new fashion trend to keep up with. But where jewellery is concerned, it tends to be\xa0classic designs that withstand the test of time.\nFor centuries, jewellery designers have been inspired by Earth’s flora and fauna. It’s a design trope that never gets old – after all, humans have long held a fascination for Mother Nature.\n\n\nNature-inspired jewellery also holds poetic meaning. It often symbolises the dawn of new beginnings, making Van Cleef & Arpels' Frivole collection one that’s particular apt for a new year, especially after the one we've just had.\nSince its founding in 1906, the Parisian jeweller has been enthralled by nature, reinterpreting the beauty of the plant kingdom through changing eras and artistic movements. In necklaces, bracelets, earrings and clips, it has depicted flora in meticulously crafted gold and a palette of precious stones.\nThe Frivole collection brings delicate florals to life with three-dimensional, heart-shaped petals\xa0surrounding a diamond core.\nThe entire collection, which encompasses\xa0bracelets, rings, earrings, necklaces, watches and others, is a work of true craftsmanship. To illuminate certain creations, Van Cleef & Arpels uses mirror-polishing techniques to reflect light.\xa0On each petal, this hand-polishing highlights the gleam of gold, creating intense reflections.\nThe brilliance of the pieces is also accentuated by openwork, where the jeweller pierces the gold structure to enable light to pass through the stones.\nTo highlight the beauty of the collection, Van Cleef collaborated with French artist Charlotte Gastaut. Gastaut’s style, characterised by a spectrum of colours, furnished patterns and elegant characters, transcribes the Frivole universe into poetic drawings.\nThe latest additions to the Frivole family include a transformable clip pendant which can be worn on a chain, as a clip on clothing, or even on the hair. Three sparkling petals bloom around a heart composed of three diamonds.\nThe most opulent creation, however, is the Frivole Secrete bangle-watch. Beneath a delicately-pivoting, luminous bouquet of florals hides a watch dial paved with diamonds. The jewellers’ intricate art is notably expressed in superimposed petals of polished gold, creating a three-dimensional composition.\nMore suited for everyday wear is the Frivole five-flower bracelet, which features floral motifs in varying sizes, harmoniously embellishing the wrist.\xa0The Frivole earrings, which feature diamond-set petals, can be worn as a matching set together with the bracelet.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     new year ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Creative Capital: The Singaporean designer who bucks fast fashion trends
  </h1>, 'text': 'Shirt Number White (SNW) was launched in November 2019 at Boutique Fairs. For Singaporean designer Shannon Lee, now 34 years old, this was a big gamble. It was the third time he tried\xa0to launch his own label\xa0and after eight years working for a local menswear brand, he finally\xa0had a winning formula.\nThat formula was also very different from the other brands. Instead of a crowded collection, Shannon showcased a small range of expertly tailored white shirts for women that\xa0are modern, conceptual, sensual and definitely memorable.\xa0He launched his second collection late last year, and judging by the buzz on social media, his formula appears to be working.\nHOW IS SHIRT NUMBER WHITE (SNW)\xa0DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER WOMEN\xa0 LABELS ON THE MARKET? HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS\xa0IDEA THAT HAS, IN MANY WAYS, BECOME ONE OF THE DEFINING FEATURES OF YOUR BRAND?\nEach SNW collection is inspired by something white, and I intentionally release\xa0a new capsule of\xa0five to eight shirts each year, giving time for customers to become familiar with the pieces.\nThe label\xa0came about as a result of several frustrations. For one, things move at a much faster pace in fast fashion and\xa0don’t allow\xa0designers the luxury to slowly develop ideas and concepts. I wanted to design clothes with thought and meaning, not just push out new designs because there was a demand.\xa0\nI also wanted to\xa0push the boundaries of creative pieces through research and concept building, very much like what I did in fashion school\xa0but never got to do when I started working.\xa0\nOne night, I was lamenting to my then-girlfriend – now wife – about these frustrations. She encouraged me to start a passion project on the side.\xa0Jokingly, I said I would like to make only white shirts, just like a white canvas.\xa0Almost immediately, the Pantone system came to my mind with its numbering and naming system to represent colours and shades. This was\xa0how\xa0the “Number” in Shirt Number White came\xa0about.\nIS THIS MODEL A SUSTAINABLE, LONG-TERM ONE?\nI think it can be\xa0with the shift in retail and how brands operate. It gives smaller brands a fighting chance to find their niche in such a saturated retail landscape.\xa0\n\n\nI believe this model works not just because it’s novel, but because there are currently a lot of brands focusing on basics – elevated basics. That gives SNW the opportunity to create a range of distinctively different products.\xa0\nThe focus is to balance between creating great statement pieces and\xa0making sure they\xa0have\xa0a viable market. This space allows me to specialise and focus on what I lean towards rather than spreading myself thin trying to develop full collections at the risk of overproducing.\n\n\nA post shared by S№W (@shirtnumberwhite)\nTHIS YEAR, YOU HAVE ADDED COLOURS TO THE PRODUCT RANGE.\xa0IS THIS SOMETHING YOU\'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO CREATIVELY OR SOMETHING YOU FELT YOU HAD TO DO?\nColours have always been part of the plan\xa0since Day One, but I deliberately\xa0introduced white shirts first to get our customers familiar with the designs.\xa0\nPersonally, I am a fan of wearing colours\xa0and I use them\xa0to expand the collection’s story. For instance, my research on the Chrysalis collection brought me to a butterfly species that transforms into beautiful metallic cocoons. Chrysalis Chromamorph became an extension of this story featuring the colours Ingot and Aegis.\nWHAT IS YOUR DESIGN PROCESS LIKE?\nThe time between each collection launch\xa0affords me the luxury of letting my ideas fester,\xa0ferment\xa0and brew\xa0over a\xa0year. I start with research that helps me focus visually and informatively, so that the concept is translated into the shirts’ cutting, form, and details.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by S№W (@shirtnumberwhite)\nThere are\xa0experimenting and developing mechanisms\xa0in the shirts, and more often than not, the details are an evolution\xa0from the previous collection. It continues with copious amounts of sketching and sampling prototypes\xa0until I am able to present shirts that embody the inspiration.\nTELL US\xa0ABOUT THE PIECES FROM YOUR OTHER PROJECT, SMALL PRODUCTION RUN.\nSmall Production Run (SPR) was started as a test during the circuit breaker period. With the pandemic affecting supply chains globally, production delays were inevitable and I was getting itchy not producing anything.\xa0\n\n\nI had the\xa0idea to put the fabrics that I\'d collected from my travels on social media to see if there was any interest.\xa0And I’m glad it garnered a pretty good response from the start.\xa0\nI couldn’t do any shoots, so I digitally Photoshopped the prints onto existing designs.\xa0Then, I\xa0tried to feature the fabrics as much as possible on Instagram, so that customers could get a better idea of the fabrication.\xa0I decided I could produce SPR myself with a better grasp of the lead times.\nWhat I love about SPR is the freedom to go crazy with the prints and get more fancy with the details. It’s like SNW on steroids. If you haven’t realised, SPR-SNW is pronounced as\xa0""super snow"".\xa0\nI also started Made-to-Order for SNW at the same time as there was an increased demand for styles that have run out from new customers who just found out about us.\xa0\nYOU’VE WORKED ON BOTH WOMENSWEAR AND MENSWEAR. WHY THE FOCUS ON WOMEN’S SHIRTS? WHAT IS THE APPEAL TO YOU?\nI’ve always been a very technical designer, so I see garment construction in my mind before anything else. I’ve designed wedding dresses and stage costumes, made leather bags and pouches, but those didn’t allow me to explore new ways of making clothes.\xa0\nWhat left an indelible impression on me was a mood-board picture of a female musician on a stool playing a bass guitar, her crisp, oversized shirt falling just below the nape of her back. The image conveyed how effortlessly chic the shirt was worn, and it became the most romantic visual for me.\xa0\nPersonally, I feel the shirt is the most versatile piece of garment for a woman to wear because of the various ways it could be styled – even more so than for men.\nTruth be told, I’ve worked in menswear for most of my career. During that tenure, I acquired shirt-making and tailoring techniques, and a love for cotton shirting. It has come full circle, allowing me to implement\xa0what I’ve learnt with what I love.\nWHO INSPIRES YOUR DESIGNS? DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC WOMEN IN MIND?\nThe everyday heroine who\xa0is the multi-tasking, multi-hyphenate woman! I feel that a woman’s role has never been more powerful yet underrated. I saw how my late mother balanced that role quietly and consistently, while struggling to make space for herself.\xa0\n\n\nIt’s not always showcased to the world\xa0or captured in social media, but she did it anyway – as a mum, colleague, wife, friend, sister, daughter – and I wanted to celebrate her and other women.\nThis reality and narrative inspired me to create pieces that work seamlessly with their lifestyles, and add a touch of imagination and fun. And I think that comes through in the versatility and function of the clothes.\n\n\nA post shared by S№W (@shirtnumberwhite)\nYOU SPENT EIGHT\xa0YEARS AT A\xa0LOCAL LABEL. WHAT\xa0DID YOU LEARN THERE THAT YOU WANT\xa0TO EMULATE IN YOUR OWN BUSINESS?\nPutting myself in the shoes of the customer. I think as a designer, it is very easy to put the brand and its goals first.\xa0\nBut through my journey working in menswear, I’ve learnt\xa0from colleagues to empathise with the needs of the customers. This helps me as a brand owner to see what is missing; it could be customer service, recovery protocol, or simple touch points that help improve the customer experience and engagement.\xa0\n\n\nOf course, I can’t always accede to every request, but whatever I can improve, I’ll try to do. This also helps me design better for the customer as well.\nWHAT DID YOU SEE\xa0AND EXPERIENCE\xa0THAT YOU WANT TO AVOID?\nMoving too fast is something I want to avoid. In many settings, moving quick and fast is a value-add, but I do feel it has its cons. For example, not having a concept exposed long enough for customers to gain familiarity and gain traction before moving on is something I personally feel does not gel with the philosophy of slow fashion.\xa0\nEspecially for a brand like mine, it is more important to let the designs breathe and customers to make their judgement. Currently, I have the luxury of moving slow\xa0–\xa0to brine, marinate, fester, brew ideas in research and development. And I hope to continue doing that even as we grow.\nWAS IT A HARD DECISION TO LAUNCH YOUR OWN BRAND?\nPersonally, it was\xa0when I decided to launch SNW. I am naturally quite risk averse but I felt strongly that I had to start it.\xa0Moreover, I made two previous attempts that didn’t take off, and that inevitably made me all the more cautious about starting again.\xa0\nThankfully, these experiences were good learning lessons. I learnt\xa0things to avoid and things we could start better with. Also, the amazing support from my wife and business partner to take that leap\xa0of faith and dream big made the decision less daunting.\n\n\nA post shared by S№W (@shirtnumberwhite)\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST PART OF RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS SO FAR?\nDoing everything on my own! I admit I’m still lacking, but I do enjoy each process of running the business. I still very much handle sampling, production, business development, social media, order fulfillment and every other thing in between. I do wish I had more time in a day to finish all these things.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE BEST PART OF BEING A BUSINESS OWNER?\nOne of the best things for me is the interaction with customers, often over social media, and hearing from them their love for the shirts, and also learning how I can improve on the customer experience.\nRecently, a customer told me that after receiving some of my pieces, she didn’t really think much of them. The following day, she took the time to examine the shirts and through IG Stories, found out how the shirts worked and how they could be styled differently.\xa0That completely changed her mind about them.\xa0\nIt is great to hear directly from customers how the shirts have that quality about them.\xa0At the same time, that gives me feedback about how I can better present my clothes online, especially since SNW is mainly available online for now.\nIt is quite fulfilling as a designer and business owner to know that what you are doing\xa0– even though it is not tried and tested\xa0–\xa0is working and gaining a footing.\nWHO ARE YOUR OWN DESIGN HEROES, LOCAL OR FOREIGN?\nAlexander McQueen will always be my No 1, for his dramatic poetry and sublime garment construction and cutting. It was his show that first drew me to study fashion. And there is Thom Browne for his cropped suiting, and Cecilia Bahnsen for her floaty, romantic quilted dresses. They each have a very strong individual aesthetic that I feel connected to.\n\n\nLocally, it would be Sven Tan of In Good Company. I worked under him for a very short time as a fresh graduate.\xa0I learnt\xa0so much about design and fashion branding, which I felt had the biggest impact on me. He is a big-picture designer who\xa0isn’t so narrowly focused on just the clothes, but the brand as a whole.\nHOW WAS 2020 FOR YOU?\nI can safely say, like everyone else, 2020 definitely didn’t go as planned. It definitely affected the business with terrible production delays. And there were also plans that didn’t come to pass.\n\n\nBut on the flip side, the things that I didn’t plan for happened in a good way. SNW was featured in The Front Row virtual fashion festival helmed by Daniel Boey, and I also got to start SPR-SNW. I would say that’s a win for SNW.\nWHAT ARE YOUR\xa0SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM VISIONS?\xa0\nFor the short term, there are already collaborations and pop-ups that I am very excited about. Face-to-face customer engagement is the best way to experience the clothes and the brand, so I’m glad for Phase 3 to start. For now, I’m hoping these projects will carve a bigger niche in the market, and more women\xa0will engage with what SNW is designing and building.\nAs for the long term, I would like to see SNW expanding out of Singapore and gaining more presence regionally, which will allow us more freedom to design more creatively and build a more comprehensive SNW brand experience.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      What to put your money on in 2021, fashion-wise? Casual comfort and iconic designs
  </h1>, 'text': 'Back in early March, when parts of Europe went into lockdown, and designers began to panic as collections got stuck in warehouses or were refused by the department stores that had ordered them, analysts warned of an “unprecedented crisis” for the £2.2 trillion (S$3.95 trillion) fashion and luxury industries.\nEight months later, that “unprecedented crisis” looks more like a blip – especially at the higher end of the price spectrum. While luxury goods sales shrunk by about a fifth last year, according to Citi and Bain estimates, a strong third quarter and the rapid deployment of a vaccine has led some analysts and executives to predict a near-full return to 2019 revenues in 2021.\n\n\nSuch optimism is shared by investors: For the fifth consecutive year, the luxury sector has outperformed the wider equity market\xa0– this year by about 10 per cent –\xa0notes Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods equity research at Citi.\nIt helped that Japan and China, the second- and third-largest luxury markets by sales, recovered quickly from the virus, and the rise of “revenge buying” (shopping sprees driven by pent-up demand during lockdown) and “reunion dressing” in China buoyed purchases in the spring. Where stores were closed, many shoppers turned to e-commerce for the first time – and brands say they’ll keep shopping there.\nThe US luxury consumer also proved surprisingly resilient. With stock indices reaching record highs and fewer opportunities to spend on international travel, restaurants and spas, the wealthy snapped up luxury handbags, fine jewellery and cashmere tracksuits.\nLuxury executives also responded quickly and ably during the first wave of infections, said Chauvet: Slashing marketing and events budgets, renegotiating rents and, among the publicly listed companies, reducing the dividends they had planned to pay to investors.\nBut while sales might return to 2019 levels, in other ways, the industry will look rather different in 2021.\nThat will be evident on your next trip to a department store. Prior to the pandemic, tailoring was enjoying a comeback, steadily replacing hoodies, track bottoms and other streetwear-inflected designs on catwalks and on garment rails. A year of mostly working from home has changed all of that.\n“We won’t go back to the way we were – clothes will remain more casual for the best part, because our lives have become more of a blend,” said Natalie Kingham, chief fashion officer of luxury e-tailer MatchesFashion.com. In lieu of a full suit, she thinks customers will pair a blazer with a T-shirt and jeans when they return to the office; they’ll also be seeking out more “versatile” pieces for that transition.\n“We won’t go back to the way we were – clothes will remain more casual for the best part, because our lives have become more of a blend.” – Natalie Kingham\nLydia King, fashion buying director at Harrods, said she saw “a seismic shift away from workwear and party-wear” in 2020. While she expects a “big bounce back” in events and wedding attire in 2021, “it’s hard to imagine emerging from the house in a power suit”.\nInstead, King has been stocking up on “soft tailoring” such as cardigans and drawstring trousers, which can be worn on Zoom and at the office; timeless staples, such as cashmere camel coats and “investment bags that will hold their resale value”; and “joyful, exuberant” party clothes for all of those reunions we plan to have in 2021. Comfort, which was “never the top factor when we looked at our buy” in past seasons, is now paramount for customers, she said.\nOne thing that won’t go away this year? Logos. “In previous crises, logos were a no-no, it was inappropriate,” observed Erwan Rambourg, a luxury analyst and author of Future Luxe: What’s Ahead for the Business of Luxury. “Right now, even with high unemployment, it is the iconic, recognisable products that are outperforming versus pre-COVID-19. There is no guilt factor – it’s more of a ‘I’ve survived this, it’s ok to reward myself, I’m worth it’.”\nFashion weeks will also look a little different next year. While some brands, including Fendi and Dolce & Gabbana, plan to go ahead with live catwalk shows at men’s fashion week in Milan in January, many others will continue to focus on digital and audience-less presentations – at least in the first half of the year.\nOthers will move their shows to China. Already luxury’s fastest-growing market prior to the pandemic, mainland China will become even more important in 2021 as Chinese luxury shoppers take fewer trips abroad and buy more goods at home. The migration for brands is already happening: Cartier released its latest Pasha watch in China in July, two months before the rest of the world, and Moncler plans to move its Genius show from Milan Fashion Week to Shanghai in 2021.\nAnalysts say brands have already begun to discuss the expansion of their main flagships in China and the opening of additional locations in less populous cities.\n“Right now, even with high unemployment, it is the iconic, recognisable products that are outperforming versus pre-COVID-19.” – Erwan Rambourg\nOther pre-pandemic trends are also set to accelerate this year. The major, conglomerate-backed luxury brands, which were already gobbling up market share from smaller players, are poised to capture yet more market share in 2021, analysts say. That will make things tougher for independent, family-owned houses – some of which are likely to be put up for sale.\n“The big brands are going to outperform when rebounding from this crisis, and probably the small independent guys will realise they need to sell or merge,” Rambourg predicted. M&A activity is already picking up: In the past two months, VF Corp agreed to acquire streetwear brand Supreme for US$2 billion (S$2.64 billion) and puffer jacket maker Moncler took a majority stake in rival Stone Island.\nCollections will also continue to be smaller, and more designers will opt for certified-sustainable fabrics in response to climate concerns. Even before COVID-19, collections were shrinking as brands moved away from trendy, seasonal products towards more dependable “evergreen” items.\nIn the world of venture capital, profitability has become a much bigger priority for start-ups, said Nicole Quinn, a general partner at Lightspeed Ventures, whose investments include Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and Lady Gaga’s Haus Laboratories, both of which became profitable this year.\nShe is keeping an eye out for opportunities in beauty, skincare, fitness and live-video shopping next year, all of which were given a boost by the pandemic, she said.\nNot everyone is confident of a recovery in 2021: Researchers at Bain believe luxury goods sales will not fully rebound until mid-2022 or 2023, given the state of the global economy.\nIn some ways, luxury brands will emerge stronger from the trials of 2020. During the pandemic, stores in Europe and other tourist-driven markets began reconnecting with their local customers, gathering a wealth of data and connections – advantages that will continue even as international travel resumes.\n“Before, these brands didn’t know who they were selling to, they were relying on tourism,” said Rambourg. “That’s one of the silver linings to this crisis.”\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     luxury ', '     business ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Kawaii! Loewe's new Totoro collaboration is one for fans of the classic anime
  </h1>, 'text': 'Collaborations between fashion houses and nostalgic cartoon characters have been all the rage recently. Gucci dropped a Mickey Mouse collection for Chinese New Year in 2020, and just last week unveiled a Doraemon collaboration. Longchamp also recently launched a Pokemon collection, while Balenciaga collaborated with Hello Kitty.\nSpanish luxury house Loewe is now jumping on the bandwagon with a collaboration with Japanese animation house\xa0Studio Ghibli. The Loewe x My Neighbor Totoro capsule collection takes inspiration from the much-loved 1988 tale, creating a cute and chic collection of leather accessories and ready-to-wear items.\nThe collection was a result of Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson’s “longing for heartwarming feelings”, the brand said in a press note.\xa0\n“When I think of a movie that affords me that kind of solace, speaking just as directly to a child as it does to an adult, that movie is My Neighbor Totoro. Anyone who has seen Hayao Miyazaki’s 1988 masterpiece cannot possibly forget it,” Anderson said.\nIndeed, nothing brings out feelings of nostalgia much like the animations\xa0we grew up with.\xa0\nThe collection features the iconic characters and the fantasy world they inhabit. The mischievous fuzzy dust bunnies and the adorable round Totoro are interpreted as prints, allover prints, jacquard intarsia and leather marquetry.\nThese characters also feature on the surface of iconic Loewe bags such as the Puzzle, the Balloon and the Hammock, as well as on small leather accessories such as pouches, cases and wallets.\nThe whimsical motifs are also crafted onto T-shirts and sweatshirts, which take on a youthful colour palette. \xa0\nIf you’d like to get your hands on the items, the Loewe x My Neighbor Totoro capsule collection will be available in-store and online from Jan 8.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Japan ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Commentary: Not quite winter in Singapore, but no shame in bringing out the sweaters and jackets
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: I discovered, somewhere at the start of December, that my three year-old didn’t own a jacket.\nHe had one when he was younger since we had travelled to Japan in the winter, but given how 2020 produced the less-than-stellar prospects of near-future travel and our island nation’s generally hotter temperature range, it wasn’t till we hit a spate of rainy days that we realised our little one needed warmer clothing.\nEvery year, at least in recent memory, right around Christmas and New Year’s Day, Singapore’s usually balmy and humid weather, gives way to torrential rain and a slight cooling.\nWhen the dawn of this new decade brought with it days of incessant, relentless rain, my eight year old-son opined that it wasn’t just raining cats and dogs, it felt more like raining “mammoths and dinosaurs”.\nIS WINTER HERE?\nI’d bet the weather apps must have seen a huge uptake with every other person checking in on the temperature.\nIt even became a competition among some to see who could record the coldest temperature or whose home was in the coolest spot in Singapore.\xa0\nInstagram stories carried screenshots of the weather like a warped game of social one-upmanship before a friend won the raffle and posted one that read “22 degrees out, but feels like 20 degrees”.\nIn some parts of Singapore \xa0like Woodlands, Bukit Panjang, Newton and Upper Bukit Timah, mercury levels fell to as low as 21 degrees Celsius, while across the island it hovered around 23-24 degrees Celsius as torrential rains hit us in the few days of the new year.\nExperts have said that these rains and low temperatures may continue for a few more days yet, even right through till mid-January or later. On Dec 31, the Meteorological Service Singapore said “the rainfall for first half of January 2021 is expected to be above average over most parts of the island”.\nDr Matthias Roth, Professor of Urban Climatology at the National University of Singapore, suggested the “prolonged rain spells should disappear once the dry phase arrives in February”. \xa0\nFar from a conversation starter platitude, yet the weather was all anyone could talk about over the New Year period.\nUnsurprisingly, Singaporeans have responded to the cold weather by pulling out their warmer clothing from the wardrobes. Sweater weather has arrived.\xa0\nWinter is here. Or some version of it anyway.\nRAINING ON THE PARADE\nTik Tok Singapore released a little tongue-in-cheek post of a guy dressed in a singlet with the caption: Rest of the world when its 22 degrees.\xa0\nIt cuts immediately to a bundled up version of the man in all his winter beanie and scarf glory, sipping a hot beverage with the descriptor: Singapore when its 22 degrees.\nLocal media site SGAG said what was on everyone’s mind: Time to bring out all the winter clothes we didn’t get to wear in 2020! Accompanying it was a photo of a hoodied-out fella next to a faux TV fireplace. A small Christmas stocking hung in the corner.\nEven Her World Singapore capitalised on what must be a slow season for Winterwear in the country: “Now’s the best time to don knitwear and live out your winter style dreams,” they posted on Facebook, followed by a post on 10 pretty knitwear for sweater weather in Singapore.\xa0\nOn my Facebook feed, everyone became a Winter Collection fashion consultant wondering out loud on who’s broken out their winterwear yet.\xa0\nA friend of mine bravely admits, “Am I the only one breaking out the winterwear? Who has Heat Tech on?” Heat Tech, in case you didn’t know, is an innovative new material developed for warmth and comfort by UNIQLO and textile manufacturer Toray.\xa0\nDRESSING APPROPRIATELY FOR THE SEASON\nI met up with some friends on New Year’s Day and saw adults happily bundled up in jackets, kids in hoodies and galoshes, old folks with scarfs to keep the wind chill at bay.\xa0\nThe day after, at another gathering, I myopically opted to wear sleeveless and was grateful my husband thought to bring a cardigan to rescue me from my vanity.\nI joke with overseas friends that contrary to popular belief, Singapore does have four seasons: Wet-and-cold (La Nina), hot-and-wet, hot- and-dry (El Nino) and cold-and-dry.\xa0\nOtherwise known as the seasons of ponding season, steamed pau season, mosquito season and being-inside-a-shopping-centre season.\nAnd with each season, we dress appropriately.\xa0\nRaingear and jackets when La Nina rears her ugly head and brings monsoon - and sometimes hail - to our shores. Beach gear with a side of umbrella when we head into more mainstream weather forecast, hoping for the best weather but also prepared for the worst.\nIn the middle of the year, we all collectively smell like a blend of citronella and lemongrass with the kids sporting little mozzie patches at the back of their shirts.\xa0\nAnd ask any mother of young children and she’d be able to tell you which shopping centre’s air-conditioners run cooler than most and where a cardigan-in-hand may be useful.\nThe point is, we suit up for occasion. We wear and do what works for each of us. And really, kudos to those who are willing to do so at the expense of some small ridicule. They are more comfortable for it. If it floats your boat, power to you.\xa0\nVANITY OR PRAGMATISM?\nWe are a society that applauds those that resist and hold out, instead of complimenting those who opt for pragmatism – cover up when it is cold. Isn’t it time the boring, predictable and sensible wins the day? This, in a time where we preach self-care and share coping mechanisms.\xa0\nFurthermore, the truth is, for many of us feeling boxed up this season, being able to play dress up for a faux Winter Holiday can go a long way to satiate our wanderlust souls.\xa0\nWe, the current wearers of sensible, courtly shoes, can do well with a healthy dose of whimsy and fun in a time of erstwhile drudgery. A modicum of slightly cheeky reprieve if you would\xa0\nBesides an added style element that cannot be understated – don’t you just love those chic jackets, cardigans and scarves - our collective mental well-being might just thank us for this winter-esque interlude. As would our freezing bottoms.\xa0\nAfter all, who would want to catch a cold during the pandemic and risk having to undergo more uncomfortable COVID-19 tests?\nThis brings to mind early COVID-19 days where people tended to overprotect and were often subjected to social media ridicule. But really, if we think deeper, we downplay what must be deep fear for themselves or maybe vulnerable family members at home.\xa0\nThey harmed no one in their choice of ski mask goggles on top of their masks so why make a fuss about it?\nThey did what they felt they needed to do. To cope, to stay safe, and to feel safe.\xa0\nNO SHAME IN PADDING UP\nIf we must, let’s fuss about things that matter.\nThe torrential dinosaur-esque rain that helped us welcome this New Year triggered landslips and flooding round the island. It caused statuesque trees to fall, like the massive 22m\xa0one at Fort Canning Hill.\xa0\nPhotos in news coverage show slope erosion at ongoing construction sites, barrier fences along major canals felled. In videos that circulated on WhatsApp, golf courses were submerged, while manhole covers sprouted small water fountains.\nIf ever there was a time on a global stage where small sensibilities like wearing a cardigan when you are cold, opting out of a large social gathering if you are even remotely ill, or wearing a mask out in public should be lauded, it’s now.\xa0\nIf 2020 taught us anything, it is to roll with the punches and make the best of a given situation.\nWhen life gives you lemons, you make lemon meringue pie. When there’s a virulent virus out and about, you safe distance and wear a mask.\xa0\nAnd when El Nina brings torrential rain and sweater weather, run an ugly sweater contest with your colleagues on Zoom.\nCherie Tseng is Chief Operations Officer at a local fintech company, a mother of three and editor with The Birthday Collective.\n', 'related_topics': ['     weather ', '     climate ', '     fashion ']}"

      Miuccia Prada: ‘Me and my husband, we never woke up thinking about making money’
  </h1>, 'text': 'Miuccia Prada is speaking over Zoom from Milan about the presentation of her final collection as Prada’s sole creative director. Titled The Show That Never Happened, the collection – utilitarian, elegant, rigidly minimalist, with overt references to her first womenswear show in 1988 – was, because of COVID-19, unveiled in a sequence of short films directed by artists including Martine Syms and Juergen Teller.\n“At some point what you do isn’t yours any more but in the hands of others,” she said.\nBut in speaking of ownership, Prada could have been referring to what is now happening at her family’s leather-goods business, which she took over in the mid-1970s and transformed, alongside husband and Prada chief executive Patrizio Bertelli, into a cultural force and fashion group with €3.2 billion (S$5.2 billion) in sales last year.\nIn February 2020, on the weekend before Milan went into its first lockdown, Prada and Belgian designer Raf Simons settled into a pair of plush swivel chairs at the company’s via Bergamo headquarters and announced what many in the room already knew: That after more than four decades as Prada’s creative architect, she would now share that responsibility with Simons, the former creative director of Calvin Klein and Dior.\nSuch a move was unprecedented: Never before had two such well-known and well-regarded figures shared the creative responsibilities of a major fashion label. It was proof, once again, of Prada’s prodigious capacity for change.\n\n\n“It was about a moment of opening up. I was always very. . . I don’t want to say independent but . . . I almost always said no [to collaborations],” she told me. “We joked in a [2016 joint] interview that it would be nice for designers who love each other to work together, and maybe to create a place for people who are serious, that respect each other, to celebrate creativity against marketing.”\nFor most designers there is a point – usually five, sometimes 10 years in – where new ideas fail to bubble to the surface, where their work becomes self-referential, static, dated. That this has never happened to Prada has given her an almost mythical status. It is what makes her shows, season after season, so suspenseful: One never knows what will emerge from behind the curtain when the music starts.\nShe has made bad taste chic, spearheaded the appropriation of vintage designs in high fashion and, in her revolutionary use of nylon, PVC or even bits of garbage such as crushed bottle tops and broken mirrors, exorcised preciousness out of luxury. In designing and dressing to please herself, she has taught others to do the same.\n“I go on thinking, go on changing, go on facing the problem and the reality,” she said, when asked why she thinks her work has kept pace with – and often steered – the zeitgeist. “I have a personal need to know what is going on… I always have this sense of not knowing enough.”\nRESISTING CLICHES\nPrada’s clothes are never straightforward. To wear them correctly is to wear them tongue-in-cheek, though many don’t. She is a firm believer that too much good taste can ruin a collection, and so she’ll often begin by exploring something she loathes, such as golf or crochet, trying to twist it into something she likes. Cliches of femininity – bows, florals, baby-doll dresses – are frequent targets.\n“Miuccia’s irreverence was the quality that first caught fashion’s attention,” said US Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. “She dared to ask the questions: What is beauty? What’s good taste? All these years later she continues to fascinate because she’s still challenging convention, still resisting cliches.”\nIt is deliciously ironic that one of the world’s most influential fashion designers doesn’t sketch or sew. Instead, she surrounds herself with talented designers who translate her ideas into clothes, bags, shoes, jewellery.\xa0\nFabio Zambernardi, who joined Prada in 1989 and became design director in 2002, has been by her side the longest. Some have gone on to lead their own brands, including Francesco Risso at Marni and Walter Chiapponi at Tod’s. “Every time she said something, it opened your mind,” Chiapponi gushed earlier this year.\nAmong her first tasks with Simons is defining what he calls the “ness” of “Prada-ness”: A\xa0tallying-up of the things she likes. That is tricky for a designer who relies on instinct and tires of new ideas quickly. It’s why she only gets dressed 10 minutes before she leaves the house and gives herself just 10 days to design a collection.\n“The pressure gives me more excitement, more fear, so my brain is more quick,” she explained. “If I think too long, I get bored.”\n“Miuccia’s irreverence was the quality that first caught fashion’s attention. She dared to ask the questions: What is beauty? What’s good taste?” – Anna Wintour\nAN ACCIDENTAL VOCATION\nMiuccia Bianchi Prada never intended to have a career in fashion. A women’s rights campaigner with a doctorate in political science, she once imagined a life in the \xadtheatre (she performed mime for five years). It was not until the mid-1970s that she reluctantly entered the leather goods business started by her grandfather, Mario, in 1913.\n“Being, let’s say, a leftist feminist, to work in fashion was a nightmare,” she said, peering into the camera. I can glimpse a red-and-white gingham shirt under a V-neck navy jumper and a pair of antique drop earrings – her “uniform” of the moment – against a room wallpapered in mossy green velvet.\n“I\xa0hated the idea. I felt so insecure, so guilty, because I was doing a job that was in my mind, back then, against my ideas.”\nAt a trade fair in 1977, Prada met a young leather factory owner who would become her future husband. Described as brash and perhaps a touch overconfident, the young Bertelli had big ideas for her business and snapped up the exclusive licence to manufacture and distribute Prada’s leather goods.\n“Without him, probably I would not have gotten into this job at all,” Prada said. “I saw with him a new world of possibilities; we were working together and also staying together.” They still live in the same Milan apartment she grew up in, where they have raised two sons.\nThe early years of their relationship have been described as “volcanic”. Does she like it when he offers opinions of her work? “I’m used to it,” she laughed. “I think that working together helps marriages. If\xa0you build something in life, it’s a way of staying together.”\nIn 1984, Prada introduced her breakthrough design: A black, lightweight, minimally branded backpack in military-grade nylon. Such a material – plain, industrial, but in fact more expensive than leather – defied the long-held belief that luxury must be precious and timeless, something that would become a life-long theme in her work. Already, she was attuned to the minimalism that would sweep the design world in the ensuing decade.\nIt was not until February 1988, at the age of 39, that Prada presented her first womenswear collection, irreverently dubbing her discreetly luxurious clothes as “uniforms for the slightly disenfranchised”. Their clean lines and mostly muted palette (black, brown, grey) were a tonic to the loud, lavish, frou-frou clothes then toasted on the catwalks in Paris and Milan.\nPrada began to push the edges of the austere, mannishly tailored garments of her early collections, introducing colours and designs that led critics to question her taste: Cowhide dresses and hot pants, bra tops and miniskirts stitched with seashells, dresses and tunics garlanded with large, floppy roses.\nCertain designs became signatures. Whereas most women dress to draw the eye up – with jewellery, collars or lipstick – Prada tends to focus on the neglected lower half. Her speciality has been the skirt – prim and pencil-shaped, or cut longer into knife or car-wash pleats. Specific vintage silhouettes appear again and again, a way for Prada to reference period attitudes towards women.\n“If I have done anything, it is to make ugly appealing,” Prada once told the curator Andrew Bolton, adding that her work was “concerned with destroying – or at least\xa0deconstructing – conventional ideas of beauty, of the generic appeal of the beautiful, glamorous, bourgeois women”.\n“If I have done anything, it is to make ugly appealing.” – Miuccia Prada\nBOOM AND BUST… AND BOOM AGAIN\nPrada’s contributions weren’t merely stylistic; she was also building a business. The 1990s and early 2000s marked a period of vigorous expansion for Prada: It introduced a menswear line and a secondary womenswear label, Miu Miu, in 1993, then began snapping up other labels, such as Helmut Lang, shoemakers Church’s and Car Shoe, and Jil Sander (which Simons was hired to design). Eyewear and fragrance were added to the shelves. Sales grew from about US$400,000 in the late 1970s, according to Forbes, to €2.6 billion in 2011, when Prada held a buzzy initial public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nBut by 2014, fissures were starting to show. For the first time since its public listing, Prada’s profits fell. Analysts say the company had opened too many stores and had missed the shift to digital and the boom in designer trainers. Its shares lost about three-quarters of their value between September 2013 and January 2016 as the company pursued a turnaround. Sales returned to positive territory in 2018, and even with the bottom-line damage brought about by COVID-19, shares are up a quarter from the start of 2020.\n“Me and my husband, we never woke up in the morning thinking about making money,” said Prada. “That is probably not appreciated by the financial community. But that is the truth. We always did things because we liked it, we thought it was interesting, and it worked.\n“Luxury at some point became about the one who sold more,” she continued. “A lot of journalism doesn’t care about the content, or the issue, or the effort, or all the thoughts you put in your job. You are mainly judged by how much money you make.”\nShe paused. “Even if you want to stay small, you can’t because you disappear. It’s a machine that should be broken.”\nIn 2017, Prada’s elder son Lorenzo joined the business after spending most of his twenties in the driver’s seat of rally cars and is now tapped to become the group’s next chief executive. Analysts speak warmly of the digital transformation he has ushered in at Prada, and his environmentally driven push to phase virgin nylon out of the company’s supply chain in favour of recycled by 2021.\nAt 72, Prada is now five years past Italy’s official retirement age. But although many have seen Simons’ appointment as the first step to an eventual succession, she has no plans to stop soon: “I like working. I’m here to work even more.”\n“Me and my husband, we never woke up in the morning thinking about making money. That is probably not appreciated by the financial community. But that is the truth. We always did things because we liked it, we thought it was interesting, and it worked.” – Miuccia Prada\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Milan ', '     Italy ', '     luxury ', '     business ', ""     Women's Voices "", '     Profiles ']}"

      Would you buy a US$13,000 designer gown from Amazon?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Considering the impact of the global pandemic on our ability to leave the house, it is somewhat unsurprising that a large chunk of the retail industry experienced an unprecedented collapse earlier this year. Despite that, however, not all retail businesses suffered – sales at online grocery stores such as Redmart soared, and global e-commerce giant Amazon posted its biggest profit ever. It was in this buoyant climate that it launched its latest risky retail gambit – Amazon Luxury Stores.\n\n\nLuxury Stores is Amazon’s foray into selling luxury fashion and beauty and exists as a separate department from its existing Amazon Fashion offering. Launched in mid-September 2020, the US-exclusive service is made available only by invitation, and only to members of its paid Amazon Prime subscription programme.\n“We are always listening to and learning from our customers, and we are inspired by feedback from Prime members who want the ability to shop their favourite luxury brands in Amazon’s store,” said Christine Beauchamp, the president of Amazon Fashion.\nIt is not clear if Amazon sent out special invitations to certain VIP Prime members at launch, but existing Prime users can register for the waitlist to receive an invitation at amazon.com/LuxuryStores. While there is no guarantee how long it takes to receive an invitation, a recent trial of the service saw access granted within three weeks.\nBecause the service is still nascent, shopping Luxury Stores is currently only available via the existing Amazon mobile app, which significantly diminished the initial luxury feel of the experience. Access to the service is buried in the menu bar, sandwiched between Luggage & Travel Gear and Magazine Subscriptions and before getting there, you are confronted by the regular Amazon landing page, which – depending on your Amazon purchase history – could include everything from standing lamps to winter socks.\nOnce you do arrive at the Luxury Stores landing page, however, the experience markedly changes. The interface and visuals – which included photos of models in polished editorials – differed significantly from Amazon’s usual product-focused layout and delivered a much sleeker browsing experience.\nIn fact, it bore a remarkable resemblance to many of the existing luxury e-tailers on the market such as Net-A-Porter and Farfetch. Where Amazon differed, however, was in its landing pages for each individual brand, which included multi-media videos and personalised copy. This tactic is in line with Amazon’s intention of creating a “store within a store” for each brand on its platform, which it explicitly stated in its press statement at launch.\nSpeaking of brands, when Luxury Stores launched in September, there was only one brand available – luxury American fashion label Oscar de la Renta. At the time of writing in mid-December, there are now nine, plus one multi-label partner retailer.\nThe brands include premium beauty label Cle de Peau Beaute and luxury lingerie marque La Perla, as well as American fashion and accessory brands Altuzarra and Mark Cross.\nWhile Amazon has not yet managed to onboard the most diverse range of luxury labels, it cannot be denied that the ones they have brought onboard have a definite cachet.\nThe product mix was also definitely indicative of Luxury Stores’ position within the retail category. The most expensive item available on the platform was a feather embroidered hooded coat from Oscar de la Renta, which retails for a cool US$12,990 (S$17,238), while the most inexpensive fashion item is a US$72 (S$96) lace thong from La Perla. The most inexpensive item overall, however, was a US$10 (S$13) pressed powder puff from Cle de Peau Beaute.\nOn a personal note as a luxury shopper, I found the overall experience of navigating Amazon Luxury Stores to be a mixed bag. I was pleasantly surprised to receive my invitation in fairly good time and was eager to explore the Amazon Luxury experience. Given the limited product selection, however, I was hard pressed to add anything to my cart. And therein lies the rub.\nIn its current form, it is unlikely that Amazon’s Luxury Stores would appeal to existing luxury consumers who are used to shopping on the likes of Net-A-Porter, Farfetch, MatchesFashion, or even 24Sevres and SaksFifthAvenue.\nThe main reason is that there simply is no reason to switch – Amazon’s usual tack of offering lower prices for items on its platforms is unlikely to work for the luxury products that it is offering, there are no brands that are not available elsewhere, and there are no existing features that offer a significantly differentiated experience for the shopper.\nFor instance, while Amazon is known for its speedy shipping, its competitors also offer similarly fast or even faster shipping times, with Net-A-Porter and Farfetch both offering\xa0same-day delivery options.\nIn its initial press statement, Amazon did mention that the Luxury Stores would be able to make use of its technologies like View in 360, which allows customers to view products from all angles. However, there is currently no product on the platform taking advantage of this feature. Should it be introduced, however, it might help to move the needle in driving customers to the platform.\nThe other possibility is that Amazon can take advantage of the vast pool of consumers that are already loyal users, since some of them must surely be luxury shoppers. The difficulty lies in that consumers’ perception of Amazon, at least within the US, is that it is a platform that retails cheap everyday items like hand sanitiser and toilet paper, not luxury ostrich-feather coats. While that perception is not as prevalent in Singapore, it would likely still be a source of dissonance for Singaporean shoppers should Luxury Stores launch here.\nThat perception is and will also be the main stumbling block for Amazon when trying to convince luxury brands to come on board. Luxury brands are notoriously sensitive about the adjacent placement of their brands, whether it is in the physical or digital space, and convincing Cartier – whose parent company Richemont also owns Net-A-Porter – that its Love bracelets belong on the same platform as Kleenex will be a tough sell.\nThat is not to say that it is impossible, but Amazon first needs a large critical mass of luxury brands willing to onboard alongside it far beyond the 10 partners currently on the platform. But if any company can overcome this chicken-and-egg issue, it is probably Amazon.\nGiven Amazon’s relentless quest for growth into different product segments – as evidenced by its acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 – it seems likely that its new luxury venture is part of Amazon’s bid to truly become “the everything store”, the go-to player for any product at any time, anywhere. The question is – can they make Luxury Stores work? Only time will tell.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Amazon ', '     e-commerce ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      What was Melania Trump’s fashion legacy after four years?
  </h1>, 'text': 'President Donald Trump will leave a lasting style legacy. From the giant red ties and billowing Brioni suits to his signature blond comb-over and Make America Great Again baseball cap, Potus has been consistent – sartorially speaking at least.\xa0\nThe same cannot be said for his wife Melania. Despite her background as a fashion model, during the past four years as Flotus, the third Mrs Trump’s wardrobe is notable for its inconsistency. It stands out as much for what it didn’t do, as what it did.\n“Unlike many of the first ladies before her, there won’t be a signature style with Melania,” said Lauren Rothman, a Washington-based stylist, pointing to Nancy’s “Reagan Red”, Jackie Kennedy’s pillbox hats and Michelle Obama’s cardigans (covering those famously toned arms). Trump’s image is anchored in her poise, added Rothman: “The storms don’t sway her. She always looks perfectly put together.”\nPerhaps more than any other first lady before her, we are destined to interpret Trump’s enigmatic outfit choices through our own political lens. For the president’s diehard supporters, she’s an elegant model of uxorial loyalty, immaculate in Dior suits, glossy caramel blow dry and Christian Louboutin stilettos.\n“The president’s critics will say she’s a fembot, a quiet trophy wife,” says Kate Bennett, a CNN reporter in the White House and author of Free, Melania: The Unauthorized Biography. Some in the anti-Trump movement even cast her as a captive princess who uses clothes to support Democrat causes, showing streaks of rebellion from her gilded Trump Tower in the only way available to her.\nHistorically first ladies have taken an “America First” attitude towards their wardrobes and nurtured a close association with US designers: Kennedy and Oleg Cassini; Reagan with Adolfo and James Galanos; and every first lady since Kennedy has worn Oscar de la Renta.\nObama, Trump’s immediate predecessor, gained acclaim for mixing high-end (Vera Wang) with high street (J Crew and Target), and promoting lesser-known American designers such as Jason Wu and Christian Siriano. She tied her fashion choices to the country, cause or prevailing political wind, and used clothes as a tool to illustrate her values: diversity, creativity, entrepreneurship.\nA 2010 academic paper, The Michelle Markup: The First Lady’s Impact On Stock Prices Of Fashion Companies, highlighted Obama’s halo effect on the industry. Its author David Yermack, professor of finance at the New York University Stern School of Business, calculated that during 2009 Obama’s public appearances led to immediate gains of more than US$5 billion (S$6.64 billion) in shareholder value for various brands, in a pattern that closely tracks her daily schedule.\nNo such “Melania markup” has emerged. The way that Trump dresses is “a missed opportunity” to spotlight something, be it a brand, a business or a cause, said Yermack. “She has a background in the fashion industry but never seemed to want to put herself out there as a role model in the way that Michelle Obama did.”\nObama knew that she was an extension of her husband’s political brand, and her fashion choices reflected this. Early indications suggest that we may see a similar strategy with Jill Biden, the wife of president-elect Joe Biden. In the run-up to the November US elections, she sported a limited-edition pair of Stuart Weitzman boots, which read “Vote” on the side.\nThe political messaging vis-a-vis Melania Trump is more complex. At first her fashion choices seemed to encompass her husband’s pledge to Make America Great Again. At the January 2017 inauguration she wore a sky-blue cashmere dress by quintessentially American designer Ralph Lauren. For her long white inauguration gown, she collaborated with Herve Pierre, a French-born American immigrant, after her then senior adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff dissuaded her from picking Karl Lagerfeld.\nIn her book Melania And Me: The Rise And Fall Of My Friendship With The First Lady, Winston Wolkoff recalled her view that by choosing American immigrant designers for the inauguration, Trump – herself “one of America’s most famous immigrants” – “could send a unifying message to balance out her husband’s anti-immigration rhetoric”.\nWinston Wolkoff wrote: “Melania loved the idea of getting to play designer for a day, but highlighting to the press that she and Herve were both immigrants was out of the question. Her take was to let the clothing speak for itself and not to bother with the backstory.”\nThat approach was cemented in the days ahead. Arriving in Palm Beach, Trump stepped off Air Force One in a red Givenchy cape dress, followed by a hot-pink gown by Dior at the Red Cross Ball in Mar-a-Lago.\nThere were other sartorial choices that seemed at times to indicate that her husband’s politics hadn’t made their way wholeheartedly to her wardrobe.\nAs the president promised to revive US industry and urged the country to “Buy American”, his wife posed for her official first lady portrait in April 2017 in a chic black tuxedo suit by Italian designer Dolce & Gabbana.\n“Melania dresses how she thought she ought to dress as a first lady. That was her interpretation of it,” said Isabel Spearman, a style expert and former special adviser to Samantha Cameron. “Sometimes it was not particularly well read for the situation she was dressing for.”\nAt worst this made Trump appear out of touch with reality. She wore vertiginous Manolo Blahnik stilettos with aviator sunglasses and an army green jacket boarding a plane to visit the damage wreaked by Hurricane Harvey. On a rare solo trip in October 2018, she donned an Out of Africa-esque outfit during a visit to Kenya, complete with pith helmet – a colonialist anachronism.\nAnd, most infamously of all, Trump wore a US$39 Zara jacket emblazoned with “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” to visit a migrant child detention centre on the US-Mexico border in June 2018. Her communications chief gave it the hashtag #itsjustajacket, but Trump backtracked in an interview with ABC News a few months later. She said she wore the jacket as a riposte to the leftwing press, adding that, “I would prefer [the media] focus on what I do and on my initiatives than what I wear.”\nBut by remaining largely silent and making few solo public appearances, Trump has left us with no other choice than to focus on what she wears, to look for clues on what she’s thinking and feeling.\nBennett said: “I don’t believe in Melania Trump coincidences” when it comes to her wardrobe. “She knows what she’s doing.”\n“I have a theory that she wears menswear when they’re fighting,” she added. “We know that Donald Trump likes very feminine women: eighties-throwback feminine – body-con dresses and short hemlines. When Melania wears a suit it’s a moment of independence.”\nBennett believes that there’s a “playful ambiguity” to how Trump dresses. She pointed to Donald Trump’s famous “pussy grabbing” video, which surfaced in October 2016 and records him making extremely lewd remarks about women a decade earlier. Days after the video emerged, Melania Trump wore a fuchsia pussy-bow blouse by Gucci to watch her husband take part in a presidential debate. Solidarity with the sisterhood or subliminal support of her husband? Who knows. Coincidence? Bennett doesn’t think so.\nAnd then in January 2018, Trump appeared in public alongside her husband for the first time since allegations of his affair with porn star Stormy Daniels became public. She picked a white Christian Dior pantsuit for the occasion.\nWinston Wolkoff was adamant that this was a disastrous choice: “The white suit was practically Hillary Clinton’s trademark, the uniform of anti-Trumpers, a symbol of female empowerment and the #MeToo movement,” she wrote in her book. “The more I begged, the more she laughed it off, saying ‘Oh Stephanie! Come on. I mean, really. Get over it!’” She wore the Dior.\nWe will probably never know what Trump was really trying to say with her ambiguously political fashion choices. What we do know is that the one thing that has remained consistent throughout her time as Flotus is her composure. Perhaps when historians, aspiring politicians and future first ladies contemplate her legacy, it will be her ability to appear publicly unflappable. Maintaining this – regardless of what the perma-tanned man in the giant red tie and billowing Brioni suit is doing next to her – is no mean feat.\nBy Harriet Agnew © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      From bankruptcies to a ‘hunger for luxury’: Insider predictions for 2021
  </h1>, 'text': 'The coronavirus pandemic dealt an “almost unprecedented” blow to GDP in advanced economies and China in the first half of the year – that’s according to Gavyn Davies, co-founder and chairman of Fulcrum Asset Management, speaking about the global economic outlook at the Financial Times’ annual Business of Luxury Summit, held online in November.\nNouriel Roubini, professor of economics at NYU Stern, told the FT’s Martin Wolf that we’d be lucky if the coronavirus vaccine was as effective as the flu vaccine, which is about 40 to 60 per cent effective.\n“Many people are going to take the vaccine. . . they’re going to start travelling, doing indoor activities and mass gatherings, and we’ll have another spike [late next year],” he said. “This is not going to be a V-shaped recovery, at best, this is going to be a U-shaped.” In Europe, Helene Rey, professor of economics at the London Business School, forecast a surge in job losses and bankruptcies still to come.\nHowever, executives at Bulgari, Burberry, Cartier, Ferragamo and the Estee Lauder Companies spoke bullishly about the resilience of their customers – particularly in China, which is forecast to account for nearly half of all luxury goods purchases by 2025, according to analysts Bain & Co.\n“Despite everything – we’re in full second wave right now in Europe, and it’s still very tough in the US – the client is resilient and hungry for luxury,” said Jean-Christophe Babin, chief executive of LVMH-owned Bulgari. While he acknowledged that “many people have lost their jobs . . . The vast majority of people on the planet did not”.\n\n\nTHE PANDEMIC IS ACCELERATING EXISTING TRENDS\nFashion was already becoming more casual pre-pandemic, and 2020 has reinforced that trend. Kay Hong, chief executive of Proenza Schouler, said its more casual, lower-priced PSWL line had thrived. Sandra Choi, creative director at Jimmy Choo, said she had traded heels for trainers: “Functionality is playing a huge part at the moment.”\nSeveral mid-market American fashion giants collapsed in 2020. Brooks Brothers and J Crew both filed for bankruptcy, while “accessible luxury” brands have suffered a sharper dive in sales than more upmarket players.\nWhat happened? These brands were on the brink already, argued Gary Wassner, CEO of fashion-focused financial services firm Hilldun. “COVID-19 just accelerated existing problems and made them impossible to surmount. We haven’t yet seen any surprises.”\nIt was a sentiment echoed by Thomas Chauvet, managing director of luxury goods equity research at Citi, in a session centred on the future of M&A and venture capital.\n“The luxury industry doesn’t go through radical transformation,” he told viewers. “A lot of these changes were happening before: The shift to e-commerce, the slow decline of department stores and multi-brand retail stores, greater focus on sustainability and supply chains, materials, and acceptance of the circular business model.”\nSo investors looking to mop up distressed brands should tread carefully. “People must look at investing in the right direction rather than taking a big company that’s not ticking boxes and try and turn it around,” said Massimiliano Caraffa, managing director at Carlyle Group.\nAdded Chauvet: “The big luxury conglomerates have the means to acquire smaller assets to try and transform businesses, but the appetite is not there anymore. It’s very complicated and costly. They already have their own brands to turn around and to help grow. That’s the case for Kering and for Richemont.”\n“The luxury industry doesn’t go through radical transformation. A lot of these changes were happening before [the pandemic]: The shift to e-commerce, the slow decline of department stores and multi-brand retail stores, greater focus on sustainability and supply chains, materials, and acceptance of the circular business model.” – Thomas Chauvet\nBRANDS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SUSTAINABILITY CLAIMS \nSustainability is a problematic word. There has been much talk of pushing for more ethical and environmentally friendly practices in fashion – but are companies making good on their promises or simply paying lip-service to a pressing issue?\nThat fashion houses are still coming to terms with the concept was clear from the many interpretations offered by speakers.\nMarco Gobbetti, CEO of Burberry, told viewers that the company’s sustainability strategy was centred on three areas: Carbon and energy, materials, and people. The British brand has pledged to become carbon-neutral in its own operations and to obtain 100 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2022.\nAlex Weller doesn’t think there is a single clothes-making business in the world that is truly sustainable – even Patagonia, where he is marketing director for Europe. Maxine Bedat, founder of the research and advocacy group New Standard Institute, agreed: “We’re seeing just about anything being marketed as sustainable,” she said, urging brands to move past “vague and meaningless language” and towards actually reducing emissions, as well as water and chemical use.\nVirtual fashion may offer an alternative to this material waste, with digital fashion companies such as The Fabricant pioneering a medium that affords customers self-expression with a far smaller carbon footprint. “There are already enough physical clothing brands in the world,” said founder Kerry Murphy. “Now it’s time for the digital fashion houses to come forward.”\nGenuine sustainability involves changes to materials and supply chains but also to company culture. “We have to be more active as a brand and promote more values,” said Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s head of marketing and corporate social responsibility. “[Customers] expect that good brands promote good behaviour.” Ultimately, though, sustainable practices that don’t make financial sense are not sustainable for businesses, said Bertelli.\nE-COMMERCE IS GROWING RAPIDLY, BUT WILL NOT SUPPLANT STORES\nE-commerce has taken off during the pandemic, and Kering has seen its e-commerce revenue more than double year-on-year. Yet chief client and digital officer Gregory Boutte doesn’t believe this justifies calling time on physical locations just yet.\n\n\n“We’re still incredibly committed to our store experience,” he said, adding that the online experience should be about augmenting rather than replacing stores, a view echoed by Estee Lauder chairman William Lauder.\nCompanies might seek inspiration in this regard from Louis Vuitton, whose partnership with video games developer Riot Games, launched in late 2019, has produced a capsule collection inspired by the online multiplayer game League Of Legends, which takes advantage of young audiences’ growing desire to cultivate unique virtual personas.\n“It gave audiences of both brands something to engage with,” said Naz Aletaha, Riot Games’ head of global e-sports partnerships. Others are now following suit: Nike is sponsoring the game’s Chinese league, Gucci is partnering with a professional League team in Europe and Puma with another in North America. Fashion houses may need to look beyond their comfort zones if they want to thrive with next-generation luxury consumers.\nBy Baya Simons, Chris Allnutt and Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     business ', '     fashion ']}"

      French fashion designer Pierre Cardin dies aged 98: Family
  </h1>, 'text': 'French fashion designer Pierre Cardin, hailed for his visionary creations but also for bringing stylish clothes to the masses, died on Tuesday (Dec 29) aged 98, his family told AFP.\nCardin, who was born to a low-income family in northern Italy but became a France-based fashion superstar, died in a hospital in Neuilly in the west of Paris, his family said.\n""It is a day of great sadness for all our family. Pierre Cardin is no more,"" the statement said.\nIt said that after a lifetime spanning a century, he had left France and the world a ""great unique artistic heritage"" and not only in fashion.\nBorn into poverty in 1922 near Venice in northern Italy, his family emigrated to France when he was a small child.\n""Italian by birth, Pierre Cardin never forgot his origins while bringing unconditional love to France,"" said his family.\nFROM APPRENTICE TO GLOBAL EMPIRE\nHe grew up in the French industrial town of Saint-Etienne and was apprenticed to a tailor in Vichy at the age of 17, already specialising in women\'s suits.\nMoving to Paris, he designed the mesmerising sets and costumes for the film Beauty and the Beast\xa0with poet, artist and director Jean Cocteau in 1946.\nAfter a stint with Christian Dior, he had already set up his own fashion label in 1950.\nHe quickly established a name as an innovator, creating the now legendary bubble dress in 1954.\nHe also broke new ground commercially, ruffling feathers in the fashion establishment for producing a ready-to-wear collection for the Paris department store Printemps.\nHis 1964 Space Age\xa0collection remains a landmark in fashion history with its cut-out dresses, knitted catsuits, tight leather pants, close-fitting helmets and batwing jumpers.\nHis global empire had a strong presence in Japan and also signed production deals with the Cold War-era Soviet Union in 1978.

      From Crash Landing On You to The Crown: 2020’s top TV fashion moments
  </h1>, 'text': ""It might have been that we had more time on our hands, or we might just have had nothing else to do at home.\xa0But this year,\xa0we probably binged on more content on the small screen than ever before. And with a calendar\xa0devoid of fashion shows and red carpet events, it was certainly welcome that our favourite Netflix series had plenty of lust-worthy\xa0fashion moments. These were our favourites.\xa0\nCRASH LANDING ON YOU\n\n\nA post shared by tvN 드라마 공식 계정 (@tvndrama.official)\nEven if you weren’t a K-drama fan before, chances are, you couldn’t resist binge-watching this rom-com. Aside from its gripping storyline (South Korean heiress falls in love with North Korean soldier), Crash Landing On You also featured stunning fashion ensembles. From power suits to floral dresses, fashion mogul Yoon Se-ri\xa0(played by Son Ye-jin) blessed us with many outfits to swoon over.\nIT’S OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY\n\n\nA post shared by 'It's Okay To Not Be Okay' tvN (@itsokaytonotbeokay_tvn)\nStill in the K-drama realm, we found ourselves glued to It’s Okay Not To Be Okay, one of this year’s biggest hits. For one, the series had a unique storyline and cinematography that explored important issues such as mental health. But we couldn’t take our eyes off the female lead Ko Mun-yeong’s (played by Seo Ye-ji) outfits as well.\nEMILY IN PARIS\nFashion is certainly subjective, but no other TV series sparked such a polarising debate than Emily In Paris. From a bright red beret, white go-go booties to an Eiffel-Tower themed shirt, Emily (played by Lily Collins)\xa0undeniably made some cringe-worthy fashion choices. But with her understated, cool-girl outfits, her Parisian friend Camille (played by Camille Razat)\xa0proved to be the real style star.\nTHE QUEEN’S GAMBIT\nWho would have expected that a TV series based on chess would become such a hit? While we loved the show for its intriguing coming-of-age story of teenage chess prodigy\xa0Beth Harmon (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), we also fell in love with the show’s period costumes. Beth’s sartorial style, which blossomed over the season, made us wish we could time-travel back to\xa0the 1950s and 1960s.\nTHE CROWN\nThe latest season of The Crown drew in more viewers than ever before, even those who tuned in just to catch a glimpse of style icon Princess Diana (like this writer here). We’re happy to report that the series nailed some of Princess Diana’s most iconic outfits, including the glittering red dress she wore in Australia, the outfit she wore at the engagement announcement, and even her off-duty looks.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     television ', '     TV ', '     Netflix ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Amazon and Alibaba are fighting it out on the luxury e-commerce front. Who wins?
  </h1>, 'text': 'In 2015, the chairman and controlling shareholder of the luxury goods group Richemont, Johann Rupert, took to the stage at an industry conference in Monte Carlo and issued a rallying cry to some of his biggest rivals.\n“I invited the other big groups to create a singular, dominant neutral platform for the luxury goods industry in which we were shareholders,” Rupert, a blustery South African, recalled. “I was talking to Mr Arnault of LVMH and Mr Pinault of Kering,” he said, referring to the heads of two major luxury conglomerates, Bernard Arnault and Francois-Henri Pinault. “I told them the future of luxury retail lay online as well as offline, and that it was too big a game for any company to try to dominate.”\nRupert then added with a sigh, “As usual, everyone wanted to do it themselves.”\nFive years on and the coronavirus pandemic has revealed just how important e-commerce is to the future of luxury goods. Unlike the music industry, which has Spotify, or the hotel business, which has Booking.com, the luxury fashion industry is still without a single dominant online player.\nBut in November, Richemont, which owns Cartier, Van Cleef and Patek Philippe, and the Chinese technology titan Alibaba announced that they were making a US$1.1 billion\xa0 (S$1.46 billion) investment in the online fashion retailer Farfetch. The Pinault family, whose company, Kering, owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, also increased its stake in Farfetch by US$50 million through its investment vehicle Artemis.\nThe move united two of the biggest groups in luxury in common cause and potentially formed a bridge between two of the dominant luxury e-commerce platforms: Farfetch and Yoox Net-a-Porter, also owned by Richemont. It also set the stage for a potential realignment of the online retail landscape, currently suspended between the poles of Amazon and Alibaba, as luxury gravitates toward the ever-increasing might of the Chinese consumer market.\n“The pandemic has shone the spotlight on online fashion in a big way as an area for growth, and a category leader will definitely emerge in the next five years,” said Chris Morton, the founder of Lyst, the fashion search platform, whose sales have grown “in the triple digits” since the start of the year. “This is the fight to the top we are running.”\nScott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business, agreed. “A supreme luxury e-commerce group is a compelling idea, but no one so far has been able to pull it off,” he said.\nCould that be about to change?\n“The pandemic has shone the spotlight on online fashion in a big way as an area for growth, and a category leader will definitely emerge in the next five years.” – Chris Morton\nTHE AMAZON INCURSION\nFor the last decade, the Western luxury e-commerce landscape has largely been dominated by Farfetch – an inventory-free marketplace platform founded by Jose Neves in 2007 – and Yoox Net-a-Porter, the largest of the wholesalers, which was created in 2015 after a merger between Yoox and Net-a-Porter.\nLuxury brands were late to embrace e-commerce. When they did, many depended on either Farfetch or Yoox, rejecting the overtures of giants like Amazon. Partly, this was because of Amazon’s reputation as “the everything store,” which clashed with the luxury industry’s emphasis on exclusivity.\nCases of third-party sellers offering counterfeit goods on Amazon also were a contributing factor. A spokeswoman for the company said that “Amazon strictly prohibits the sale of counterfeit products” and “invests heavily in both funds and company energy to ensure our policy is followed.” She pointed out that the company has pursued cases against counterfeiters in partnership with Valentino, among other brands.\nWhen the pandemic forced many stores to close, however, brands had no choice but to focus on digital sales – and the more-established platforms for digital customers. According to data released in November by the management consulting firm Bain & Co., online luxury purchases were worth US$58 billion in 2020, compared with US$39 billion in 2019, nearly doubling the sector’s share of the market for global luxury sales to 23 per cent from 12 per cent.\n“Luxury e-commerce is now in an environment of rapid mutation,” said Claudia D’Arpizio, a luxury consultant at Bain. Few contenders have become profitable, she said, despite being pumped full of investment.\nMoving to take advantage of the moment, Amazon embarked on two initiatives. First, it unveiled special storefronts in both the United States and Europe between May and October. Created in conjunction with Vogue and local fashion councils, both storefronts showcased the work of independent designers who had been left without an outlet when department stores cancelled orders. Second, it introduced a new Luxury Stores app geared toward Amazon’s 150 million Prime subscribers.\n“I would guess that somewhere near 100 per cent of our existing customers are on Amazon and a huge percentage of those are Prime members,” Alex Bolen, chief executive of Oscar de la Renta, Amazon’s Luxury Stores first partner and guinea pig, said to Vogue in September. “For me to get more mind share with existing customers in addition to getting new customers – that’s the name of the game. We want to be able to talk to her wherever she’s comfortable shopping.”\nOther brands, such as Roland Mouret and Altuzarra, have joined, and Amazon said more brands were expected to come on board in the first quarter of next year. As with Farfetch and Luxury Pavilion, an invitation-only luxury platform on Alibaba’s Tmall site, participating brands control how their goods are presented on the app, allaying fears about Amazon’s utilitarian interface and lack of selectivity. Amazon also bolstered its fashion credentials by hiring Sally Singer, Vogue’s former digital creative director and an editor with deep ties to the designer community, as its new head of fashion direction.\nJonathan Cohen, a New York designer who joined the Amazon independent designers initiative in May, said it helped get his business through the initial lockdown, but he nevertheless opted not to continue once the special storefront was dissolved in early October (as planned) and the designers who chose to continue became part of the main Amazon platform.\nAccording to Cohen, the brand had received “messages from customers asking why such expensive pieces were selling on Amazon.”\n“Luxury e-commerce is now in an environment of rapid mutation.” – Claudia D’Arpizio\nYet going it alone is also increasingly untenable. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the largest luxury group in the world, has publicly rejected the idea of working with Amazon, but even its proprietary solution – the wholesale platform 24 Sevres, created in 2017, with an exclusive arrangement with Dior and Celine – has not gotten meaningful traction with consumers, and it continues to lose money. (The group also made a multimillion-dollar investment in Lyst in 2018.)\n“The term ‘platform’ is intoxicating at first blush, but at second, it’s a license to spend tens of billions of dollars before you see any return,” Galloway, the New York University professor, said.\nEnter the Farfetch alliance.\nTHE NEW ALLIANCE\n\n\nA post shared by FARFETCH (@farfetch)\nFarfetch, which went public in 2018, has a business model that includes an e-commerce marketplace for brick-and-mortar boutiques, and it works directly with brands on their back-end technology and logistics. It also has direct brand ownership thanks to a US$675 million acquisition of New Guards Group, which manufactures and distributes brands like Off-White and Palm Angels.\nIn November, the company also reported a record quarter. The value of goods sold reached US$798 million in the three months ending Sep 30, a 62 per cent increase from the same period a year earlier. Gross profit was up 82 per cent, edging the 13-year-old company toward profitability in 2021.\nNeves of Farfetch acknowledges that Amazon is his leading competitor in the race for luxury e-commerce supremacy, so it makes sense that he would team up with its greatest international rival, Alibaba.\nThe new Richemont-Alibaba investment in Farfetch underscores how Alibaba has been able to circumvent some of the issues that luxury brands have with Amazon. Its Tmall Luxury Pavilion has successfully lured almost 200 high-end names onto its site by promising a highly burnished and controlled customer experience and a clampdown on counterfeit products.\nIt also comes after new restrictions on international travel, which means that Chinese consumers – the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. predicts they will account for US$178 billion in luxury spending by 2025 – who used to splurge on luxury purchases abroad are now buying them at home. Alibaba and Richemont will put US$300 million each into Farfetch itself and another US$250 million each into a new joint venture called Farfetch China. They will own 25 per cent of the Chinese entity and have an option to buy another 24 per cent in about three years.\n“I think this deal transcends competitors’ offerings: You are either a disrupter or you are a disrupted, and I hate being the latter,” Rupert said. “Being an owner of brands, this could have all dragged on, but we see this deal as an acceptance of a new way of retail. Even the whole of the luxury goods industry combined would still have difficulty fighting a giant like Amazon.”\n“You are either a disrupter or you are a disrupted, and I hate being the latter.” – Johann Rupert\nRichemont is in a somewhat unorthodox position in that it also owns Yoox Net-a-Porter, once deemed Farfetch’s biggest rival. Its online business continues to operate at a loss, and Yoox, which has lost most of its white-label clients, has proved an expensive asset. Three years ago, before the Yoox merger, Net-a-Porter’s founders passed on merging with Farfetch. Now that Richemont (alongside Kering) appears to be hedging its bets, speculation has grown around the possible creation of a luxury e-commerce group with critical mass and ties to both the conglomerates and Asia.\n“I want to offer a reminder that we are open to every single group or brand,” Neves, who was sitting in the audience for Rupert’s speech in 2015, said in an interview. “Brands and retailers are not our competitors, they are our partners. We are witnessing a paradigm shift in the way people buy luxury as more and more consumers gravitate online. We help clients become a part of that.”\nThere are still hurdles. A joint venture with Alibaba could potentially cannibalise Farfetch’s existing operations. A previous, much-hyped Farfetch venture in China with JD.com failed to generate any momentum with consumers. Additionally, many luxury brands still yearn to consolidate and control the digital channels that connect them to consumers wherever they are in the world – with no third party involved.\n“I”m not sure it will be a winner-take-all situation,” said Antonio Achille, global head of luxury for McKinsey. “But there is no doubt Amazon will enter the game, or that there will be further consolidation.”\nGalloway says that for the players the calculation is simple.\n“Luxury is struggling with the fact e-commerce is basically becoming Amazon in the West and Alibaba in the East,” he said, before making an analogy to World War II. “None of them can fight the Germans on their own, so they need to ally with the Russians, which in this case is Alibaba. This is like the Russians and the British and the Americans getting together. They are competitors. The real enemy, however, is in Seattle.”\nBy Elizabeth Paton and Vanessa Friedman © The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Amazon ', '     Alibaba ', '     LVMH ', '     luxury ', '     e-commerce ', '     retail ', '     business ', '     fashion ']}"

      Plus-size fashion for ladies: Style tips for a flattering figure at year-end parties
  </h1>, 'text': ""Finding a party-appropriate getup can be quite a conundrum for any woman. Sparkles and reflective material that dominate festive dressing have a tendency to pack on the pounds even for\xa0pint-sized individuals. So where does that leave curvy, full-figured ladies?\nEven though the odds are unevenly stacked against the well-endowed\xa0at the onset, it isn't impossible to sift out a figure-flattering look or two – if\xa0you know what to look out for and, even more important,\xa0what to stay away from.\nHere are some pointers that will help you nail down that confidence-boosting festive ensemble this year.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nTHE RIGHT CUT FOR YOUR SHAPE\n\xa0\nA post shared by Gap (@gap)\n\xa0\nYou might have learnt by now that certain dress and skirt cuts tend to suit certain people better. For example, fit-and-flare dresses and skirts with a subtle A-line style will suit most plus-sized women.\xa0\nYou may even want to try a pencil\xa0skirt that is well-fitted but not body-hugging – pick one that is not so severely tapered towards the hem as the linear silhouette will flatter curvy figures better. Stay away from pencil skirts, however, if you are pear-shaped and bottom-heavy, as they will draw attention to your problem areas.\nAs for jeans, straight-cut or boot-cut styles have a slimming effect, while pants in a tailored fit and structured material are your best option. High-rise bottoms may be very popular, but they’re likely to suit only those with an hourglass figure and a small waist. Everyone else will fare better with a mid-rise style.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nFABRIC IS KEY\nA post shared by 渡辺直美 (@watanabenaomi703)\n\xa0\nKnow that clingy, flimsy fabric will hug curves in all the wrong places. The fabrics that will flatter your shapeliness don’t necessarily have to be thick, but you will want to stick to structured material to conceal bulges you don’t want others to notice.\nWant to wear a print? Make sure that your item of clothing isn’t too tight-fitting, because this will cause the print to appear warped and emphasise the\xa0curvaceous parts of your body.\xa0\nBe careful with stripes, too as they can also stretch and have the same effect. The placement of the prints can determine whether they look good or bad on you too – for instance, an exaggerated bloom over E-cups will draw attention to the expanse of the bust area. And if horizontal stripes aren’t kind to your expanding waistline, try diagonal stripes that elongate the silhouette. \xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nUSE COLOURS STRATEGICALLY\n\xa0\nA post shared by TheAmberLoft (@theamberloft)\n\xa0\nColours are a powerful tool that can dramatically enhance your figure, but can also produce a disastrous effect when\xa0used wrongly. Light or bright colours have a visually enlarging effect, while dark colours do the opposite – employ their differences to your best advantage.\nIf you are pear-shaped, pair light-coloured tops with dark-coloured bottoms; and if you have a larger bust as compared to your hips, do the reverse.\xa0\nIf you’re relatively straight from top to bottom or have an hourglass figure, a monochromatic outfit can have a slimming effect on your frame – and it doesn’t necessarily have to be in black. Plum and maroon are alluring alternatives.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nGO FOR THE V\n\xa0\nA post shared by Joyce Cheng (@princejoyce)\n\xa0\nThis is one of the oldest tricks in the style book – a V-neck top creates the illusion of a longer neck and thus will have a visually slimming effect. Take care not to go too low with your V-neck, especially if you have a substantial chest – revealing too much up top can easily have an unflattering effect on curvaceous frames.\nThat’s not to say that the round neckline won’t work for you – it just may not be quite as slimming as the V-neck. If you have wide shoulders, avoid high-necked and boat-necked tops and dresses, as they will clearly “delineate” your neck from your torso and tend to highlight the breadth of your frame.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nOVERSIZED ISN’T ALWAYS BETTER\n\xa0\nA post shared by 김지양 Vivian Geeyang Kim (@plusmodel)\n\xa0\nBlousy tops and kaftan-like dresses may seem like comfy, forgiving outfits that will hide the immediate effects of a very filling festive meal, but they can add heft to curvy figures, particularly if you are on the busty end.\nSkin-tight is obviously not a great way to go either, unless you don’t mind “sucking in” your belly the whole time you’re wearing that spandex dress. The ideal fit for you should be one that skims your frame and defines your figure without constricting it in any way.\nA belt can come in very handy if you’re having difficulty finding something that fits you perfectly. You can significantly change how an outfit looks on your body simply by cinching it in at the waist.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Commentary: Secondhand clothing sales are booming – and could be the answer to fashion’s sustainability crisis
  </h1>, 'text': 'STILLWATER, Oklahoma: A massive force is reshaping the fashion industry: Secondhand clothing.\nAccording to a new report, the US secondhand clothing market is projected to more than triple in value in the next 10 years – from US$28 billion in 2019 to US$80 billion in 2029 – in a market currently worth US$379 billion.\nIn 2019, secondhand clothing expanded 21 times faster than conventional apparel retail did.\nEven more transformative is secondhand clothing’s potential to dramatically alter the prominence of fast fashion – a business model characterised by cheap and disposable clothing that emerged in the early 2000s, epitomised by brands like H&M and Zara.\nFast fashion grew exponentially over the next two decades, significantly altering the fashion landscape by producing more clothing, distributing it faster and encouraging consumers to buy in excess with low prices.\nWhile fast fashion is expected to continue to grow 20 per cent in the next 10 years, secondhand fashion is poised to grow 185 per cent.\nAs researchers who study clothing consumption and sustainability, we think the secondhand clothing trend has the potential to reshape the fashion industry and mitigate the industry’s detrimental impact on the planet.\nTHE NEXT BIG THING\nThe secondhand clothing market is composed of two major categories, thrift stores and resale platforms. But it’s the latter that has largely fuelled the recent boom.\nSecondhand clothing has long been perceived as worn out and tainted, mainly sought by bargain or treasure hunters.\nHowever, this perception has changed, and now many consumers consider secondhand clothing to be of identical or even superior quality to unworn clothing. A trend of “fashion flipping” – or buying secondhand clothes and reselling them – has also emerged, particularly among young consumers.\nThanks to growing consumer demand and new digital platforms like Tradesy and Poshmark that facilitate peer-to-peer exchange of everyday clothing, the digital resale market is quickly becoming the next big thing in the fashion industry.\nThe market for secondhand luxury goods is also substantial. Retailers like The RealReal or the Vestiaire Collective provide a digital marketplace for authenticated luxury consignment, where people buy and sell designer labels such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Hermes.\nThe market value of this sector reached US$2 billion in 2019.\nThe secondhand clothing trend also appears to be driven by affordability, especially now, during the COVID-19 economic crisis. Consumers have not only reduced their consumption of nonessential items like clothing, but are buying more quality garments over cheap, disposable attire.\nFor clothing resellers, the ongoing economic contraction combined with the increased interest in sustainability has proven to be a winning combination.\nMORE MINDFUL CONSUMERS?\nThe fashion industry has long been associated with social and environmental problems, ranging from poor treatment of garment workers to pollution and waste generated by clothing production.\nLess than 1 per cent of materials used to make clothing are currently recycled to make new clothing, a US$500 billion annual loss for the fashion industry.\nThe textile industry produces more carbon emissions than the airline and maritime industries combined. And approximately 20 per cent of water pollution across the globe is the result of wastewater from the production and finishing of textiles.\nConsumers have become more aware of the ecological impact of apparel production and are more frequently demanding apparel businesses expand their commitment to sustainability.\nBuying secondhand clothing could provide consumers a way to push back against the fast-fashion system. It also increases the number of owners an item will have, extending its life – something that has been dramatically shortened in the age of fast fashion.\nWorldwide, in the past 15 years, the average number of times a garment is worn before it’s trashed has decreased by 36 per cent.\nHigh-quality clothing traded in the secondhand marketplace also retains its value over time, unlike cheaper fast-fashion products. Thus, buying a high-quality secondhand garment instead of a new one is theoretically an environmental win.\nBut some critics argue the secondhand marketplace actually encourages excess consumption by expanding access to cheap clothing.\nOur latest research supports this possibility. We interviewed young American women who regularly use digital platforms like Poshmark.\nThey saw secondhand clothing as a way to access both cheap goods and ones they ordinarily could not afford. They did not see it as an alternative model of consumption or a way to decrease dependence on new clothing production.\nWhatever the consumer motive, increasing the reuse of clothing is a big step toward a new normal in the fashion industry, though its potential to address sustainability woes remains to be seen.\nHyejune Park is Assistant Professor of Fashion Merchandising at Oklahoma State University.

      Think the clothes you’re buying are sustainable? Think again
  </h1>, 'text': 'The breathless email was all too familiar. It was from Levi’s, the company I buy most of my denim from, telling me about a new product: Its “most sustainable jeans ever”. Made of “high quality recycled denim” and hemp, these jeans were “positive impact” and “negative waste”, the copywriters pledged.\nThere are some phrases so well-worn, we become numb to their meaning. For me, “sustainable fashion” is one of those phrases. It is a term now so ubiquitous in PR and marketing, so liberally applied to any brand that uses organic cotton or manufactures its goods locally, that its fundamental definition has become obscured.\nI am not alone.\n“I barely even know what the word ‘sustainable’ means any more,” said the designer Stella McCartney, who has been speaking out against the industry’s record on the environment and human rights since the 1990s, as she unveiled her spring/summer 2021 collection last month.\n“The majority of people who say they’re doing a sustainable thing, if you ask one question, it will pretty much fall down at the first hurdle . . . It’s a bit tiring to see people’s overuse of these terms and really not have any substance to back it up.”\n\n\nDuring the past four years, the number of clothes and accessories described as “sustainable” has quadrupled among online retailers in the US and UK, according to Edited, a London-based retail analytics company. Corresponding terms such as “vegan”, “conscious” and “eco” have also seen their usage multiply, the company said.\xa0\nWhere there is progress, brands are quick to shout about it. Organic and recycled fibres, once a rarity, can now be found in designer collections and in H&M. Yarn spun from recycled ocean plastic has become a major ingredient in everything from Adidas track pants to Prada nylon backpacks. High-end labels such as Balenciaga and Burberry now tout not only the luxuriousness of their materials, but also whether they meet certain environmental certifications. More importantly, companies over the past decade have begun to quantify the impact across their full supply chain and take strides to reduce it.\nBut there’s a problem. Not only is fashion not sustainable, it is becoming less so every moment. A report published by the Global Fashion Agenda in Copenhagen and the Boston Consulting Group last year revealed that the apparel and footwear industries’ progress on everything from carbon reduction to ensuring living wages for workers was 30 per cent slower in 2019 than the year before. The sector is also growing so rapidly that its impact on the planet is actually worsening. The volume of apparel and footwear being produced is forecast to increase by 81 per cent to 102 million tons by 2030, according to the report.\xa0\nIt isn’t just fast fashion at fault. Even Gucci parent Kering, which has one of the most advanced and transparent environmental policies in the luxury sector, has struggled to reduce its footprint because its brands are growing so quickly.\nAnd yet the good news keeps coming: In a deluge of emails promising products that are “carbon neutral”, “negative waste” or even “positive impact” – as if the making of a new garment could actually be a good thing for the planet. No wonder many of us are confused.\n“There is this vast array of icons and language and terminology, all of which feed a dynamic where customers don’t question a purchase, it reinforces a purchase,” said Alex Weller, European marketing director at Patagonia, a US outdoor clothing company whose public mission is “to save our home planet”. The company donates one per cent of gross sales to environmental projects and doesn’t use the word “sustainable” to describe itself or any of its products.\xa0\n“It’s a bunch of coded language so that we think, yeah I’m comfortable with that, I can buy that,” Weller continued. “Versus trying to help the customer make a smart decision.”\n“We’ve gotten to a place where citizens know sustainability is something they should care about, but they are not informed enough to know what it means to be sustainable.” – Maxine Bedat\n\n\nTURNING OF THE TIDE\nAs recently as a decade ago, few fashion brands wanted to be described as “sustainable”.\nWhen Yael Aflalo launched Reformation, a Los Angeles-based label known for its flirty, floral-print dresses, in 2009, she didn’t talk about how many of her garments were made from upcycled vintage or deadstock fabrics because her publicist told her it was “not going to resonate with fashion consumers”, she told me in a 2016 interview.\n“But we had seen the change in the automotive industry, seen the change in the food industry,” the founder and former chief executive said. “And [we knew] fashion was going to be next.”\nToday, many of us are starting to feel pretty guilty about the environmental and social costs of our wardrobes. Surveys of US and UK shoppers repeatedly show that we would prefer to buy more “sustainable products”, and would even pay slightly more for them. But most of us have no idea what that entails. We don’t know our own carbon footprints, much less that of a creamy Mongolian cashmere jumper or pair of calf-leather ankle boots we might be lusting after.\xa0\nThose who make an effort to be informed will inevitably encounter masses of false and contradictory data, as I did while reporting this story. Twenty-plus-page reports from world-leading consultancies are full of dubious statistics about fashion’s share of carbon emissions and water pollution. And whether materials such as organic cotton or recycled nylon are truly better for the environment than their non-organic and non-recycled counterparts is still hotly debated within the scientific community.\n“We’ve gotten to a place where citizens know sustainability is something they should care about, but they are not informed enough to know what it means to be sustainable,” said Maxine Bedat, founder of New York-based New Standard Institute, a research and advocacy group focused on the relationship between fashion and climate change.\xa0\nShe would know; she used to apply the label to her own apparel brand, Zady. Founded in 2014 as an e-commerce site that championed small batch, organic, and transparently made clothing and lifestyle goods, it soon launched its own label, which was celebrated for being among the first to trace the organic cotton of its T-shirts or the wool of its jumpers from farm to finish – and then make that information available to consumers. Such transparency remains rare.\nIt wasn’t easy.\n“I remember thinking, huh, how do you Google search this?” Bedat recalls of building the supply chain for Zady. “I thought, if we could find a ranch that is doing things the right way, and see who they send their product to, that would be a start. But even once we found our rancher in Oregon, at the beginning she didn’t want to connect us with the people she worked with.\n“It very much became this investigation of what all the steps were, who was doing the steps in the supply chain in the right way, and what did it mean to do things in the right way.”\nTHE EFFECTS OF GLOBALISATION\nIt wasn’t always so complicated. Apparel and footwear brands used to manufacture their own goods; they owned their factories, and some spun their own yarns. But decades of globalisation and trade policy have encouraged brands to outsource production, and with it they have lost oversight and ownership of their supply chains.\nMapping today’s supply chains is an arduous journey that can take years. Companies such as H&M employ more than a thousand factories across the world, many of which subcontract that work out to other factories brands have no knowledge of. Often factory owners are unwilling to reveal who their textile suppliers are, who in turn do not want to reveal the secrets of their fibre supply, for fear of being undercut.\xa0\nPersuading third-party suppliers to become greener – to power their machines with solar power, say, or to begin sourcing and working with lower-impact materials that could require new sources and equipment – requires persistence, patience and investment.\xa0\n“Part of the challenge is that ‘sustainability’ means 10 different things to 10 different people – microplastics, air quality, recyclability, biodiversity.” – Tim Brown\n“What the media have got wrong, is that they want [sustainability] now, even though there’s no realistic way of getting it now,” Jonathan Anderson, creative director of LVMH-owned Loewe and JW Anderson, and a longtime collaborator with Uniqlo, tells me.\nHe began implementing “massive product changes” across the labels four-and-a-half years ago – making clothing out of recycled plastic bottles, finding less toxic ways of galvanising hardware, working on denims with Uniqlo that require 80 per cent less water – but has kept relatively quiet about them.\n“There’s a lot of people who love to use a moment like this, a PR moment, to say we’re doing this [sustainable] collection,” he said. “That’s not sustainable. That’s just going with the public zeitgeist.\n“It’s a 10-year strategy to do right,” he added. “And your whole team has to want to do it.”\nIn 2018, Bedat shut down Zady. Last year she founded the New Standard Institute as a resource centre for brands, journalists and citizens to educate themselves about fashion’s environmental and social costs, and what it will take for the industry “to exist within planetary boundaries in which people and the planet can thrive”, she said.\nBrands have been leading the discussion on sustainability, creating a glut of misinformation, she explains. Until journalists and citizens are better educated and demand greater transparency and regulation, brands will be able to say whatever they want, and legislators will prioritise other issues.\n“Clothing will always have an impact. What we need is for brands to speak about what they’re doing to reduce impact and be honest and transparent about how far they are going and where they need to go.\n“No company can be perfect,” she continued. “But don’t call something sustainable if it isn’t.”\n“I barely even know what the word ‘sustainable’ means any more… It’s a bit tiring to see people’s overuse of these terms and really not have any substance to back it up.” – Stella McCartney\nTHE PANDEMIC ERA\nIn some ways, the pandemic has been good for the sustainability movement. Global clothing and footwear sales are expected to fall 27 to 30 per cent this year, according to McKinsey analysts, and brands have cut back on production.\nAt fashion weeks, concepts and methods that were once the exclusive domain of young, fringe designers – using deadstock fabric, for example, or cutting up and refashioning last season’s unsold garments into something new – are now being adopted by large mainstream brands such as Louis Vuitton and Maison Margiela.\n“Carbon-neutral” shows, in which brands offset the carbon emissions they can’t eliminate by donating to forest restoration projects, for example, are becoming standard. Executives are better informed about their company’s sustainability policies than they used to be. Many, such as Timberland owner VF Corp and Chanel, have set aggressive targets to reduce and offset their carbon output. In September the latter committed US$35 million (S$46.7 million) to install solar panels on the roofs of low-income families in California – which will generate enough renewable electricity to power the company’s entire operations in North America.\n“When I started at the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, the number of sustainable apparel fashion professionals could fit in one room,” said its former chief executive Jason Kibbey, who now leads Higg Co, which helps brands and retailers evaluate the environmental impact of the materials they use. “Now there are thousands.”\nBut it has also put more price pressure on mass-market brands that are thinking harder about the bottom line.\n“When I’ve spoken with brands that are positioned with lower-priced products, I haven’t heard them push back and say that they don’t want to be more sustainable,” said Brian Ehrig, a retail and sustainability specialist at US consulting firm Kearney.\n“I’ve heard them push back and say it’s going to make my product more expensive. Right now, with the global recession we’re in, trying to get consumers to pay more for a garment or a pair of shoes seems very unlikely.”\n“There’s a lot of people who love to use a moment like this, a PR moment, to say we’re doing this [sustainable] collection. That’s not sustainable. That’s just going with the public zeitgeist.” – JW Anderson\nCARBON AS A UNIFYING METRIC\nIn April, Allbirds, the unicorn footwear start-up whose merino-wool, sugarcane-soled trainers have become ubiquitous in Silicon Valley, began labelling every one of its items with its carbon footprint. The company’s average product emits 7.6kg CO2e, which is roughly the equivalent of driving 30km in a car, or running five loads of laundry in the dryer.\n“Our hope is that carbon becomes a unifying metric and north star for the fashion industry, and all other entities and organisations,” said Tim Brown, Allbirds’ co-founder and a former captain of New Zealand’s football team.\nCarbon isn’t the be-all end-all metric for measuring a product’s environmental impact, in the same way that calories don’t fully capture a food’s nutritional benefits. “But it can help you make healthier choices,” argued Brown.\n“Part of the challenge is that ‘sustainability’ means 10 different things to 10 different people – microplastics, air quality, recyclability, biodiversity,” he continued. “Some of those factors have competing incentives, so it can be confusing in terms of what is the right thing to do. What we’re doing is coming to the conclusion that all things matter, but all line up to carbon.”\nRetailers are also beginning to earmark products that meet certain environmental criteria – and stop carrying those that don’t. “[German e-tailer] Zalando is a good example. They’re basically going to get rid of companies not engaged in sustainability,” said Higg Co’s Kibbey. “We’re going to see more and more platforms do the same, using high-quality data to decide what products are going to be sold to most consumers. That will shape the industry quickly.”\nIn August, luxury department store group Selfridges expanded a labelling system as part of its Project Earth initiative that highlights products that are organic, forest-friendly or vegan. Under the hood, these products are rigorously vetted for certifications and accreditations, Daniella Vega, group sustainability director of Selfridges, said. The retailer has also given brands targets to ensure that the nine most environmentally impactful materials used in their products come from “certified, sustainable sources” by 2025, she added. Luxury e-tailers Net-a-Porter and MatchesFashion have introduced similar labels.\nAs a shopper, I’m aware that I am part of the problem. I’ve stopped buying virgin leather, and I try to find whatever jumper or jacket I’m in pursuit of on a second-hand site before I buy it new. And yet I place at least one order on a luxury e-commerce site every month. I reason that I’m buying well-made products that I can eventually pass on or re-sell. But still, I buy more than I need.\nHow do we break out of these habits of consumption? Patagonia’s Weller likens it to “reprogramming”.\n“I grew up in the 90s, which is probably the period of time when a lot of us were groomed to consume,” he said. “There was for my peers a moment of reckoning, of realisation that this boundless consumption was ridiculous. Of course everybody instinctively knows that. You just have to block cognitive dissonance for a second to know that this is completely excessive.”\nWhen I fess up about my own shopping habits, Weller’s reply is measured: “It is an iterative journey for everybody. You need to truly engage and invest in everything you own and take responsibility for it. Not just as a transaction and item, but as a useful, meaningful possession that you’re going to take care of. That’s a mindset shift. That requires people to think differently about stuff.”\nWords to live, and shop, by.\xa0\nHOW TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF YOUR WARDROBE\n1. Buy less and wear your clothes for longer. This is the simplest and most impactful thing you can do.\n2. Buy second-hand. Local charity shops are your best option. Consignment platforms such as The RealReal, Vestiaire Collective and eBay are good destinations for pre-owned luxury products, although they require packaging and transport.\n3. Research before you buy new. Websites such as GoodOnYou.eco rate brands based on environmental impact, labour conditions and animal welfare. Read up on brands’ sustainability policies on their websites, and check for certifications such as B Corp and Bluesign. Avoid synthetic fabrics derived from fossil fuels, such as acrylic and polyester, which cannot be recycled at scale.\n4. Wash your clothes in cold water, and less often.\n5. Think about what will happen to a product at the end of its life cycle. Is it valuable enough that someone would purchase it second-hand? Is the fabric recyclable? Repair broken zippers or missing buttons on items before donation – damaged items will automatically head to a landfill.\n“You need to truly engage and invest in everything you own and take responsibility for it. Not just as a transaction and item, but as a useful, meaningful possession that you’re going to take care of. That’s a mindset shift. That requires people to think differently about stuff.” – Alex Weller\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     fashion ', '     luxury ', '     consumer ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Armani, Gucci, Prada: Are your favourite luxury brands as inclusive as they should be?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Prada recently appointed its first chief diversity officer, as big-name luxury businesses continue to respond to tight scrutiny of their progress on diversity. The move followed an investigation by the New York Commission on Human Rights into Prada’s diversity and inclusion practices that in February led to its Milan-based executives – including head designer Miuccia Prada and her husband and chief executive Patrizio Bertelli – agreeing to undergo “racial equity training”.\nThe Italian luxury fashion house had come under fire in December 2018 after Chinyere Ezie, a civil rights attorney, spotted a pair of black, Sambo-esque monkey figurines in Prada’s SoHo store in New York. Prada swiftly issued an apology and removed the offending merchandise.\n\n\nThe brouhaha could perhaps have been avoided if Prada’s workforce had been more racially diverse. At the time of the incident, there were no black employees at Prada’s Milan headquarters, Ezie wrote in an email to the FT, citing a conversation she had with Prada chairman Carlo Mazzi\xa0in March 2019. Prada declined to comment.\nIn 2019 Prada established a Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council, co-chaired by the artist Theaster Gates and film-maker Ava DuVernay. And in October Malika Savell became the company’s first chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer for North America.\nDozens of luxury companies posted messages of support on social media for the Black Lives Matter movement following the police killing of African-American George Floyd in May.\nYet many of these brands lack diversity in their own ranks and, therefore, are open to risk of severe reputational damage – as Prada, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana have each learned from their own recent high-profile missteps.\n\n\nLess diverse businesses are also likely to be less innovative, which can drag on the top line.\nA Boston Consulting Group study in 2018 found that companies with above-average diversity within their management reported innovation revenue that was significantly higher than that of companies with below-average diversity – at 45 per cent of total revenue versus 26 per cent.\nGucci hired its own diversity chief last year following a backlash for retailing an US$890 (S$1,190) jumper also said to resemble blackface. Burberry and Chanel have also hired diversity leads in the past two years.\nThese are all positive signals that the US$318 billion industry is making progress – not only on racial diversity, but also in the greater representation of women, as well as employees who are disabled or above the median age.\nThe Financial Times’ second annual Diversity Leaders list, compiled with research partner Statista, shows the extent to which companies in 16 European countries have achieved a diverse and inclusive workforce, based on the perceptions of their employees and recruitment experts.\nRespondents were asked to rate the efforts of employers in their respective sectors in promoting diversity. They were also asked to share their opinions on a range of statements around age, gender, equability, ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. The evaluations of more than 100,000 employees informed the final ranking.\nLuxury is well represented in the top 850 companies featured this year. Ranking fifth overall, Hermes is the second-best improver on last year’s list, where the French fashion house ranked 535 out of 700 companies.\nIt performed strongly on ethnicity and diversity in general last year – and this year it was one of only eight companies to score above 3.8 out of 5 on ethnicity. Yet its biggest improvement is on gender and disability.\nGiorgio Armani comes in at number six, while Prada (57) and Hugo Boss (97) make it into the top 100.\nPrada scored well on LGBT+ and diversity in general, and lowest on ethnicity and age. LVMH does not show in the top 850 – though several of the group’s brands do, including cosmetics company Sephora (49) and Louis Vuitton (161) – the luxury fashion industry’s largest brand by revenues, which analyst Bernstein estimates at US$12.9 billion last year.\nCartier-owner Richemont narrowly missed out on the final list. However, the Swiss group hired a director of diversity and inclusion in early 2019, and is creating similar positions across its brands and geographies, says an individual familiar with the group’s plans.\nGucci’s French parent Kering, which in recent years has been commended for the high representation of women on its board – eight of its 13 board seats are held by women – ranked 715th. It performed less well on age and ethnicity than the likes of Hermes or Giorgio Armani.\nObservers say the luxury sector still has a long way to go in terms of ethnic diversity, and that it lags behind its counterparts in the broader fashion space.\nThe luxury industry has made “meaningful attempts at progress”, said Hannah Stoudemire, chief executive of the Fashion for All Foundation, a New York-based non-profit that promotes equality and diversity in the fashion industry. “[But] a lot of companies are not doing the bare minimum,” she added.\n“Specifically in luxury, there are [very few racially diverse] employees that hold senior creative positions. I could say the same about senior decision-making roles.”\nStoudemire advises companies to address diversity issues at all levels of the organisation and create “space and a budget” for a chief cultural officer.\n“This role should be mandatory and had at every company in fashion, beauty and media,” she said.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     business ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      These sneaker titans are putting Singapore on the global map – not by being resellers
  </h1>, 'text': 'With plastic flower garlands slung around their necks and a cheeky brandishing of plastic martini glasses, Mark Ong and Mandeep Chopra are having fun hamming it up. They raise a “toast” to their latest – and biggest – collaboration to date, the New Balance Urban Islander Collection by sneaker artist Ong’s brand SBTG and Limited Edt, the chain of cult sneaker boutiques founded by Chopra.\nThe capsule collection, which comprises New Balance’s classic 327 sneakers, the utilitarian chic 900 strappy sandals, short sleeved Hawaiian-inspired shirts, a tote bag and towels, are a tropical take on streetwear. With bright colours and summery designs tinged with urban motifs such as a pineapple shaped grenade and camo prints, the designs are very much a hallmark of Ong’s signature style.\nAnd to complement this collaboration, the team also set up an immersive pop-up at Chamber, Limited Edt’s swanky new ready-to-wear and lifestyle concept store at Wisma Atria, featuring colourful wall-to-wall prints, park benches and even a tiki shack.\xa0 \xa0\n“This is our most ambitious project thus far, in terms of the scope and collection of products,” said Chopra, whose boutiques in the pre-COVID-19 days were a popular shopping destination for sneakerheads – what sneaker enthusiasts are known as – on vacation in Singapore because of the range of coveted sneakers available.\nThese days, much of the shopping action takes place on Limited Edt’s e-commerce store, with sneaker lovers snapping up the hottest sneaker drops practically as soon as they are released. The 327s, he said, were especially popular with the overseas market and have mostly sold out, save for limited amounts of the smallest sizes.\nThe success of the Urban Islander shoe does not surprise Ong. The veteran designer, who is legendary in the sneaker world, has made shoes for celebrities including rapper Travis Scott and Samuel L. Jackson as well as basketball stars Steph Curry and Kobe Bryant.\n“In Singapore, we take it a bit for granted that we have tropical weather all year round but a lot of people live in places where there are four seasons and they yearn to go to the beach,” said Ong, who has also been tapped by brands beyond the sneaker world including Hermes and Johnnie Walker for various projects.\nUrban Islander’s global popularity also underscores the impact that these two streetwear authorities have made on the sneaker world beyond the little red dot.\n“Mark and I go back a long way – we’ve charted our individual paths, but are intrinsically linked in our goals, which are to always do what we love, and shine some light on our tiny island to the rest of the world,” said Chopra.\nLike so many of the best friendships in Singapore, it all began in Zouk. Almost two decades ago, in the early noughties, these two cool cats used to party together at Phuture in Zouk when it was located at its original premises on Jiak Kim Street.\nBut back then, before the two made their names in the sneaker scene, what sealed the bromance was their common love for retro sneakers like Air Jordans, which was then just a niche hobby enjoyed by a select few.\n“It was a subculture to be interested in such sneakers and they were actually not widely available then. There were no shops where you could buy such shoes easily,” said Ong, who at that time was mostly doodling on sneakers as a hobby.\nThen in 2003, Chopra, who is the third generation member of football merchandise and sporting goods company Weston Corporation, launched Limited Edt, Singapore’s first dedicated sneaker boutique in Queensway Shopping Centre. At last, local sneakerheads had a place to hang out and purchase old-school, pumped up kicks like Nike Air Force 1s and Adidas Superstars.\nConcurrently, Ong was slowly but surely building his cachet – he was an active member on online message board Niketalk and had won a sneaker customisation competition they had organised. His win garnered him more attention and he began to score orders from top boutiques such as Atmos and Chapter in Tokyo.\nIn 2006, Ong and Chopra embarked on their first collaboration – a release of Nike Dunk Low SB sneakers. They were blown out of the water by the enthusiasm for the shoes.\n“There were 500 people queueing up overnight and sleeping in the Queensway Shopping Centre Carpark to get the shoes. If you think sneakers are a new thing and wasn’t hyped previously, that is not true. We even had people paying domestic helpers and foreign workers to queue up for them,” said Ong.\nThe collection even made headlines in the global press, including New Zealand and Bangkok and not surprisingly, it sold out in minutes.\n“We have collectively done about 30 collaborations with the top shoe brands around the world… But… we have to fight harder and punch above our weight to create something enduring that will appeal to global audiences.” – Mandeep Chopra\nThe rest, as they say, was history and the duo have been teaming up for various partnerships since then. Besides shoes, Ong also worked with Chopra to design some of Limited Edt’s stores, including the back alley concept with a brick skateboarding wall for the Queensway store and a basketball locker room design for a store at 313@Somerset.\nAnother one of their more recent shoe collaborations was the Asics Monsoon Patrol Gel Lyte III shoe which was launched to acclaim at Singapore-based street culture festival Culture Cartel in 2018.\nThis year, Culture Cartel – of which Chopra is a partner – will return on Dec 5 as a free virtual event, as well as another launch in the duo’s Monsoon Patrol series, which sneakerheads are anticipating will match the success of the previous iteration.\nThere is more to come, they say. They believe that there is potential to turn Monsoon Patrol and Urban Islander, their two most promising collaborations, into standalone brands that can even be stocked in boutiques around the world.\n“We’ve learnt from the Urban Islander experience that the storytelling element such as building a microsite and having the pop-up makes a collaboration bigger than just one collection. It could live on as a separate brand – and that is good because this is something that is different from any other store in the world and we own it,” said Chopra.\nIt will also be something that they can proudly declare to be a Singaporean brand.\n“We have collectively done about 30 collaborations with the top shoe brands around the world and I honestly think that is a lot, especially because Singapore is so small. But that is exactly why we have to fight harder and punch above our weight to create something enduring that will appeal to global audiences,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     fashion ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Could this design store at Orchard Road become Singapore’s answer to Muji?
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s heartening to know that it’s not all gloom and doom for homegrown retailers during the pandemic.\nOne silver lining has been design store Beyond The Vines, which recently unveiled a sprawling 2,216 sq ft flagship boutique in the heart of Orchard Road following a rebranding exercise.\n“We felt that with the rebrand, it was the perfect time for us to create the Beyond The Vines Design Store – a place where our customers would literally be able to step into our new vision for the brand and be completely immersed in our world,” shared 34-year-old Daniel Chew, who co-founded it with wife Rebecca Ting.\nThe rebranding had been a year in the making, Chew explained, adding that they were offered a space at Takashimaya in early 2020 – right before the pandemic.\nThe design store not only houses the brand’s staple line of womenswear, it also features a newly added menswear line, as well as lifestyle products ranging from AirPod cases to stationery and home furnishings.\xa0\nBut it’s the novel Bag Bar at the front of the store that’s the real crowd-pleaser. The mirror-lined bar serves up fashionable Dumpling bags in 12 assorted colours (of which many are sold out) and sizes.\nSaid 33-year-old co-founder Ting, “This store opens a new chapter, as we rebrand and progress from a ready-to-wear label for women and into a design studio"".\nIn an email interview, the couple shared their plans for the new space – and whether they think Beyond The Vines could very well be our homegrown answer to Muji.\nTHE BRAND IS BELOVED FOR ITS WOMENSWEAR. WHY PIVOT TO A DESIGN STORE?\nFrom the beginning, it was always our goal to make good design accessible to all. We started with womenswear but over the years, as both the brand and the team grew, focusing only on womenswear started to feel restrictive. There are so many elements to design and we wanted to have the freedom to express our perspective across a breadth of product categories.\n\n\nBEYOND THE VINES BEGAN AS A DIGITAL BRAND, WHY GO PHYSICAL WHEN EVERYONE’S GOING ONLINE? \nWhen Beyond The Vines first started in 2015, we launched the brand on an e-commerce platform. Through several online interactions with customers, we soon realised that in order for the label to grow, we have to expand into a physical retail store.\nWe had to develop different strategies for both the online and offline platforms, while integrating them for a seamless customer shopping experience. For example, while customers enjoy free shipment when shopping online, they also have the option to do a self-pickup at the physical store. We were then able to create more engaging interactions and facilitate\xa0meaningful conversations between our retail staff and customers.\nIt has also always been our dream to create a retail space that transcends age. We had a multi-generational family – a daughter, mother and grandmother – trying different apparel at our retail space, and this is something an online retail store can never achieve.\nCAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE IDEA OF THIS NEW DESIGN STORE?\nOur concept store is the actualisation of our design philosophy – create boldly, design simply. This store opens a new chapter, as we rebrand and progress from a ready-to-wear label for women and into a design studio. The core of the renewed vision and inspiration comes from keeping with the pulse of contemporary culture and the natural atmosphere – to find strength where differences exist.\n\n\nWHAT CAN SHOPPERS EXPECT THERE? \nApart from a full range of women’s ready-to-wear, we have also introduced a permanent men’s ready-to-wear line. The design store also showcases a plethora of design-led products, including bags, hats and lifestyle products like glassware, homeware, AirPod cases, phone cases and even outdoor living products.\nWith our rebrand, we have expanded our focus to create and design a range of products that reflect the brand’s aesthetic in a more holistic manner. There is also a dedicated Bag Bar for shoppers to interact with our full range of different bags, including our bestseller – the Dumpling bag.\nTHE MENSWEAR LINE IS NEW. WHAT KIND OF MAN ARE YOU DESIGNING FOR? \nOur take on menswear is utilitarian with a focus on form and function. The pieces are inspired by the guiding principles of product design. Every element is designed with intent.\nIn form, you will see angled lines, panelling and subtle detailing on structured silhouettes across shirts, outerwear and bottoms. In function, we introduce toggle detailing, double pockets and also consider the optimum weight of the material used for comfort. Minute details such as the label detail is fashioned from grosgrain, a material often used but seldom noticed.\n\n\nMANY SINGAPOREAN DESIGNERS BEFORE YOU HAVE COME AND GONE, WHAT IS YOUR LONGTERM GAMEPLAN? \nWe believe in building on the legacy that was left behind by some of these designers. They have charted the paths and paved the way to put Singapore on the map for design. We stand by our beliefs that well designed products should be accessible to everyone and we hope that our guiding principle will allow our products to be a way of life rather than just another fashion label.\nIt has always been important to us that the wearer wears the clothes and not vice versa. We think of our designs as building blocks in a wardrobe – they may not be that stand-out piece that you would go to for a special occasion, but we are that label that you reach for on a daily basis – that becomes a part of the wearer’s way of life.\n\n\nCAN YOU SHARE YOUR FUTURE PLANS?\nCurrently, we have eight stores in Jakarta, one in Bangkok, one in Manila and one in Sydney. The pandemic put a pause on our expansion plans this year, however, we are definitely optimistic to grow our footprint across the region in 2021.\nDesign is a universal language. Having received positive responses for the rebrand and our new Design Store, we hope to proudly represent Singapore in the region.\nAND FINALLY, DO YOU THINK THIS IS SINGAPORE’S ANSWER TO MUJI?\xa0 \nWe are not at the level of where Muji is! However, by staying true to our design philosophy, we hope that one day, we can inspire people around the world to pay more attention to Singapore designs.\nBeyond The Vines Design Store is located at #B1-42/46 Ngee Ann City.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Singapore ', '     design ']}"

      Boxers or briefs, gentlemen? How to choose the right underwear for your body type
  </h1>, 'text': ""Most men don’t give a hoot about their underwear, as long as they cover what they're supposed to.\nIf you’re one of those men, consider this – the underwear is the most utilised item\xa0of clothing in your wardrobe and can significantly impact how you physically feel throughout your day. Just imagine having skin-tight fabric or elastic bands in places where you don’t want them.\nThat aside, what you put under your clothing can also affect your appearance. Think no one can see your underwear anyway? Wrong – put on the wrong pair and its lines can show clearly through your pants.\nIf this is news to you, it’s high time you put some thought into your underpants. A sure way to getting the look and fit right is to look at your body type. Your build and height will determine what style is best for you –\xa0and there are options beyond boxers and briefs, with multiple variations in fabric, rise and cut, to boot.\n\n\nDon’t worry if this sounds complicated. CNA Lifestyle will start you off on the four basic types of underwear, from which you’ll easily identify one to suit you.\nBRIEFS\nBest for: Short men or\xa0men who have thick thighs\nThe underwear style you were first introduced to in life, briefs, unfortunately, do bring back memories of the tighty-whities mum used to stock up your drawer with.\nBut briefs in your adulthood can be a lot less awkward-looking and much sleeker (think the Calvin Klein aesthetic), provided you know where to shop and that they suit your physique.\nIn reality though, few men have the body of underwear models to work with. Even so, briefs can still be forgiving in the right fabric and cut, and may actually be great for those with specific figure traits.\nFirst of all, if you are on the short side and tend to find that styles like boxers tend to overwhelm your frame, briefs will work better for you. They are also good for those who are thickset and muscular, who may find other underwear styles like trunks or boxers a little restrictive around their thighs, which tend to be big.\nFinally, if you happen to be quite “well-endowed”, your underpinnings must provide adequate support to handle the, erm, weight. You will find this amply supplied in a well-fitting pair of briefs, which will perform better in this respect, than any other underwear style can.\n\n\nBOXERS\nBest for: Round-shaped, very tall or large-framed men\nClearly, boxers are favoured for its ventilative properties, but while they are comfortable to wear, they might be best reserved for sleep time since they do not offer much in the way of support. Still, they are a good choice for very tall or large-sized men, who are likely to find other underwear styles too tight, small or lacking in coverage.\nYou’ll appreciate them most if you are “round” or “apple-shaped” – in other words, your waist measurement is considerably larger than that of your shoulders, chest and hips. Boxers offer a thicker waistband that won’t dig uncomfortably into your girth.\nBonus: They are also best for disguising the beginnings of a paunch, and, if you already have a fully developed one, they won’t create an unflattering “muffin-top” silhouette that might show under your clothes.\nWhile boxers are good for the larger, taller guy, they won’t be comfortable for those with thick thighs since the extensive fabric can get in the way and chafe as you walk about and go about your day. The fabric can also bunch up in the limited space between your thighs and your pants.\n\n\nBOXER BRIEFS\nBest for: Pear-shaped men\nThis two-in-one hybrid between boxers and briefs blends the best of both worlds, which means it combines the coverage of the former with the support of the latter.\nBoxer briefs will suit the average Joe in terms of the masculine frame and build – neither short nor super tall, neither very muscular\xa0nor skinny, and not round either. Also, if you’ve had minor issues with wearing either boxers or briefs, you might find your ideal match in boxer briefs instead.\nWhile boxer briefs are pretty much an all-round crowd-pleaser, there’s one specific body type they benefit the most – the pear shape.\nMen who carry more weight on the posterior are likely unable to find adequate coverage from briefs. Boxers may solve this problem, but do not provide the lift in the back end they may sometimes need, or can visually add even more bulk to the lower half of the body. Enter the perfect solution: Boxer briefs.\n\n\nTRUNKS\nBest for: Slim men or those with skinny legs\nFirst of all, let’s address the biggest question about trunks –\xa0what exactly are they? Simply put, they are the shorter cousin of boxer briefs. They fit like boxer briefs but have a shorter leg length. But, seriously, are they necessary if boxer briefs already exist?\nWell, yes, if you have short legs, for example, and would like to have an option that will flatter your proportions better –\xa0trunks would have an elongating effect on the lower half of the body.\nAt the same time, because they visually form a broad strip across your hips, they also have a widening effect on them. That is, if you actually care about how you look in just your underpants.\nThis means that trunks tend to suit the slimmer or leaner guy with narrow hips and thinner legs, as they will visually even out their proportions. Stay away from them, especially if you are thickset as they’ll further widen your frame and fit uncomfortably around your thighs.\nFunctionality-wise, they might be a good alternative for you if you find that the “hems” on boxer briefs are constantly riding up your thighs.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      A love for craft: Why Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson isn’t your typical designer
  </h1>, 'text': 'At the age of 36, Jonathan William Anderson is one of fashion’s most eagerly-watched designers. At his own eponymous label, JW Anderson, he’s known for his gender-bending styles, sending male models\xa0down the runway in tube tops and ruffled shorts.\nAt the same time, he’s the widely acclaimed creative director of historic LVMH-owned Spanish luxury house, Loewe. Straddling two fashion houses, both of which are as talked about as the other, is a feat not many other designers can claim.\nIn 2015, Anderson was awarded the\xa0British Fashion Awards\xa0for both womenswear and menswear designer of the year, marking the first time in history that a designer received both awards at once.\nAnderson, who hails from Northern Ireland, first joined Loewe in 2013. At the time, the Spanish luxury house, which has roots going as far back as the 1840s, was much in need of a\xa0revival.\nWhile Loewe had made a name for itself as a Spanish luxury leather goods maker, its image was one that was dated, tired and a little too conservative to achieve global recognition. When he first came on board, Anderson spent a year totally revamping the brand, from its logo right down to the style of its press releases. Only then did he begin working on his ready-to-wear debut.\nUnder Anderson’s direction, Loewe has evolved into a brand that is rooted in tradition, yet simultaneously modern. Today, Loewe isn’t merely just a fashion house that produces leather goods, accessories and apparel, but one that focuses on craftsmanship at its core.\nCRAFTS AND CREATIVITY\nThe idea of craft – using one’s hands to create – is central to Anderson’s vision of Loewe. Behind the design of every Loewe product is an emphasis on its workmanship, and the artisans behind it.\nTake for instance one of the house’s best-selling products – the Puzzle bag. Composed of 41 different pieces of leather pieced together in geometric “puzzle pieces”, every cut, seam and pleat has to be executed with precision by its makers.\nA collector of art and objects himself, Anderson has always had a penchant for the handmade. “I think the art that always inspires me is art that is based within the craft world such as ceramics, textiles and more,” Anderson told CNA Luxury. “I am obsessed with what people make with their hands.”\nGranted, big name luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Hermes have long touted the “savoir-faire” (or know-how) of their leather goods, spotlighting the technical skills and prowess of their master artisans.\nBut for Loewe, imperfections are part of the appeal. “Imperfections in our fabric and canvas products are part of their nature too and should be celebrated,” reads the Loewe care guide.\nAt the heart of it all, Anderson believes that fashion should support makers, not the other way around. Thus, he’s made a real, lasting effort to champion them.\nIn 2016, Anderson launched the Loewe Craft Prize, a contest that celebrates the best examples of art and design craftsmanship from around the world. Behind the establishment of the prize is the notion that if a fashion brand doesn’t support creativity, then who will?\n“I have been working at Loewe for a while now, and from the beginning I was convinced that I wanted to launch a craft prize. I felt there was no international award that approached how we will introduce crafts to the next generation, and that involves different demographic groups,” Anderson said.\n“It is a personal project. I feel an obligation to help craft practitioners, enable them to continue doing things that will outlive them and last for generations, without constant commercial pressure to sell what they have made. Craft is the essence of Loewe. As a house, we are about craft in the purest sense of the word.”\n“I think the art that always inspires me is art that is based within the craft world such as ceramics, textiles and more. I am obsessed with what people make with their hands.”\xa0– Jonathan Anderson\n\n\nREDEFINING THE FASHION BOUTIQUE\nAnderson’s vision for Loewe has translated into the house’s retail boutiques. Since joining Loewe, Anderson has reconfigured the brand’s luxury stores, turning them into public art galleries, rather than just mere shopping destinations.\nNamed Casa Loewe (“casa” means “home” in Spanish), Loewe’s flagship stores are designed to mimic the home of a sophisticated art collector. Each Casa Loewe space is resplendent with art, paintings, sculptures and craft objects, curated by Anderson himself. The merchandise – such as handbags and women’s and men’s apparel – are just a bonus.\n“Since I joined Loewe, I have always wanted to create a cultural space where art, fashion, craft and experience can meet, and this is Casa Loewe. I want people to be able to come in and understand me and my creative vision. The shop should feel warm and domestic, because fashion exists in the domestic environment. It is the idea of “casa” and at the same time, because it is a public place, it should educate as well,” said Anderson.\nCasa Loewe has opened in major cities around the world, namely Madrid, London, Tokyo and Beijing. On Oct 30, the house’s first Casa Loewe boutique in Southeast Asia will open in Singapore, located on level one of ION Orchard.\nSharing his thoughts on why Singapore was\xa0chosen as the home of the brand’s Southeast Asian flagship store, Anderson said, “Loewe has been in Southeast Asia for over 25 years, and Singapore has been key for the development of the brand in the region.\xa0\n""Singapore has a unique positioning in the region offering a wide range of services and attractions that makes the country extremely attractive for both the local and the surrounding countries from Southeast Asia. Therefore, we felt it was a great opportunity to open a Casa Loewe in Singapore to showcase the full universe of the brand.”\n‘ENTERING SOMEONE’S HOME’\nStepping into the new 340 sqm boutique, Anderson wants guests to feel like “they’re entering someone’s home”. Carefully curated furniture and light sculptures inhabit the space, including a chandelier from Antique Associates, Utrecht armchairs designed by Dutch artist Gerrit Thomas Rietveld and Conoid Cushion chairs by George Nakashima.\nBenches commissioned by Loewe Craft Prize 2019 finalists Jim Partridge and Liz Walmsley, carpets by John Allen, and a coffee table by curator and designer Axel Vervoordt complete the collection.\nCasa Loewe Singapore will also feature the artworks of nine international artists, specially chosen by Anderson himself. His favourite art piece in the store? It’s a hand-dyed tapestry, named A Positive Light, by American artist Josh\xa0Faught. Faught’s work was exhibited at Casa Loewe London in 2019.\nThe store will also feature a series of eight ceramics by Betty Blandino, a potter known for her asymmetric, sculptural forms. “Betty Blandino is a very interesting ceramicist, a very unknown ceramicist. It’s a group of her ceramics that we put together. It’s really nice to see a large body of her work in one place and I think she is a ceramist who really broke down a lot of different boundaries in terms of surfaces and shape.”\nAside from the artworks, what sets Casa Loewe Singapore apart from its other flagships is a more vibrant colour palette. While other flagship stores are decked out in a neutral colour tone, Casa Loewe Singapore features eye-catching pink walls.\n“I really like the pink walls in Casa Loewe Singapore. This is one of the first stores where we have started using a new colour palette. We are now using more colours in the stores. I think we are in a more optimistic phase,” Anderson shared.\nAn open area in the entrance will serve as a pop-up space where Loewe will exhibit capsule collections and art projects. The boutique will also showcase the full range of women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, bags, small leather goods, soft accessories, eyewear, jewellery and shoes.\nAs for Anderson’s thoughts on where fashion is headed in a post-pandemic world, the designer shared, “Throughout this period, I believe that craftsmanship, the idea of making, has never been more decisive because it relates to people, it shows responsibility, it shows protection from the things that people are forgetting are important in this industry. It employs people and ultimately it is a legacy, passing from generation to generation.”\n""Throughout this period, I believe that craftsmanship, the idea of making, has never been more decisive because it relates to people, it shows responsibility, it shows protection from the things that people are forgetting are important in this industry."" – Jonathan Anderson\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Singapore ', '     Profiles ']}"

      A Prada charity auction raises almost €440,000, benefitting women's education
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Prada said in July that it was collaborating with Sotheby’s to auction garments and props used to stage the 2020 Fall/Winter men’s and women’s fashion shows, held in January and February this year.\nThe unprecedented auction has now raked in a total of €439,352 (S$701,928), over the initial estimate of between €248,600 to €337,200.\nThe Fall/Winter 2020 shows were Miuccia Prada’s final individual showing before Raf Simons came on board as co-creative director.\xa0\nThe auction, titled Tools of Memory, consisted of one-of-a-kind fashion garments worn by models, accessories and even set components from the shows. A total of 72 lots were up for bidding.\nThe most expensive lot ended up being Atlas, a statue shaped from wood and coated in a glossy crimson finish by Dutch architect and artist Rem Koolhaas.

      Women often wear the wrong bra size: How to buy the right one for comfort
  </h1>, 'text': ""Finding a bra that fits is one of those things that women find frustratingly hard to get right. Ill-fitting bras is a widespread problem and it appears that\xa0many\xa0women don't\xa0even realise\xa0that they have the wrong size and shape\xa0bra for their body.\nA well-fitting bra shouldn’t be uncomfortable to wear, no matter what your chest size is. It all boils down to finding the right one for your size and shape.\nYes, we know that’s easier said than done, so here’s a detailed guide to shopping for bras and the right way of putting them to the test.\nGET A PROFESSIONAL FITTING\n\xa0\nA post shared by Triumph Lingerie (@triumphlingerie) on Sep 10, 2020 at 9:35am PDT\n\xa0\nThis doesn’t just apply to young girls getting their first bra – every woman can benefit from the advice of a salesperson who is trained to help customers find their right fit.\nYou may think you know your body best, but these ladies have a lot more experience. Since they help to fit women of all shapes and sizes on an everyday basis, they might have good advice for you (how much of it you’d like to take is entirely your call).\nDon’t forget that they are the ones who’d know the products they’re selling best and will therefore also know which among these will work to your shape and demands.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nTRY AS MANY AS YOU CAN\n\xa0\nA post shared by UNIQLO ユニクロ (@uniqlo) on Jul 27, 2020 at 6:37pm PDT\n\xa0\nThe best and only way to figure out what types of bras will work for you is to try on as wide a variety of bra designs as you can possibly manage.\xa0\nDon’t restrict your choices to styles or brands that you like or simply have gotten accustomed to wearing. You may prefer the look of a demi-cup bra, but may find that a full-cup style provides better support instead. Venture out and try different cuts, designs and fabrics, as well as from brands that you have never bought from before.\nAlways try the bra on, even if you’re simply replacing a style and size that you already own. The slightest weight fluctuations can impact your bra size in a significant way – so take note, especially if you are on a weight-loss plan or going through weight changes due to pregnancy.\nWEAR THE BRA CORRECTLY\n\xa0\nA post shared by La Perla (@laperlalingerie) on Sep 13, 2020 at 7:33am PDT\n\xa0\nWhen putting on a bra, bend over towards the front so that your breasts fall entirely into the cups, then stand upright and buckle up, and then make strap adjustments if necessary. Doing so ensures an accurate fit, so that you can tell if it works for your body type or not.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nCHECK THE FIT THOROUGHLY\n\xa0\nA post shared by Sorella Lingerie Singapore (@sorellasingapore) on Apr 27, 2020 at 9:10pm PDT\n\xa0\nIf the cups are gaping at the top when you put the bra on, you’ll likely need a smaller cup size. Obviously, you also shouldn’t be spilling out too much from the cups; if the edges of the cups are pressing down on your breasts as well, you’ll definitely need to go up a size or two, or perhaps go for a style that provides more coverage for you.\nAlso check that the bottom rims of the bra cups are sitting comfortably on your rib cage – they should not be lifted up or digging into your skin. If either is happening, you’ll need to change either the cup or band size.\nFor convenience, we’d suggest you bring a range of sizes into the fitting room – the size that you usually wear, as well as the cup and band sizes right below and above that particular size, so that you can easily compare which has a better fit.\nADJUST THE STRAPS AND BAND\n\xa0\nA post shared by Victoria's Secret (@victoriassecret) on Sep 13, 2020 at 11:08am PDT\n\xa0\nWhen trying on a bra, always adjust the straps and band to customise the fit to your body. Straps should always sit right above the point where they are attached to the bra – if you should have sloping shoulders and find that straps are always slipping off them, look out for bras with straps that are attached further in towards the centre, as opposed to those that are attached nearer the sides.\nWith the bra on, check that the band is level with the front. It should never sit higher or lower than that –\xa0if that is the case, you may need to tighten the band, go for a smaller band size, or simply lengthen the straps.\nAt the same time, the band shouldn’t be so tight that it’s digging into your back. There may be some leeway for adjustment but don’t buy a bra that you have to fasten on the innermost hook – because fabric stretches out over time, you’ll find that bra will be too loose on you pretty soon.\nMany women make the mistake of thinking that the bra straps are what is mainly providing support for the breasts. The band is actually more crucial as it’ll hold your breasts inwards against your chest, reducing weight stress caused by motion. That’s not to say that the straps are useless, of course – they provide additional support by lifting up your chest.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nGO SHOPPING IN A T-SHIRT\n\xa0\nA post shared by Armani Exchange (@armaniexchange) on Jun 9, 2020 at 7:14am PDT\n\xa0\nDo you hate it when seams and lace on bras show through your clothes? The next time you go shopping for bras, wear a fitted T-shirt – if there are such fit issues, they’ll show up especially if the tee is stretchy or in a jersey material, that will help you determine how much lace to go with or if said lace is not well placed.\nDON’T GET FIXATED ON YOUR USUAL SIZE\nA post shared by Calvin Klein (@calvinklein) on Jul 3, 2020 at 12:30pm PDT\n\xa0\nWhile bra sizes are standardised across the world, it’s not unusual to find slight differences in production measurements from brand to brand. In fact, they frequently vary even across different styles produced by a single brand. So, don’t buy bras without trying them on and assume that the fit will be fine as long as you take your usual size.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     women ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Louis Vuitton’s lovable Vivienne mascot now has her own jewellery collection

Inspired by Gaston Louis Vuitton’s love for collecting toys, Vivienne, the house mascot, has captured hearts in the fashion world.\nVivienne is named after Louis Vuitton’s signature VVN leather, a light-coloured beige leather that gains a dark patina over time, often used in the making of the house’s bag straps. Vivienne takes on the role as an intrepid traveller, a nod to Louis Vuitton’s history as a trunk maker.\nSince her world debut in 2017 as a collectible figurine, Vivienne has been making signature hallmarks within the house’s coveted line of accessories, from seasonal doll designs inspired by her globetrotting adventures, to twirling in musical boxes.\nVivienne’s ""travels"" around the world, from Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai, the Alps and more, is often pictured in a series of colourful illustrations on the house’s holiday collection of zip wallets, coin pouches and passport covers.\n\n\nA post shared by Louis Vuitton (@louisvuitton) on Dec 10, 2019 at 7:00am PST\nShe even has her very own home with the Malle Maison Vivienne – a charming collector’s dollhouse housed within Louis Vuitton’s iconic monogram canvas trunk.\nMarking her entry into the world of jewellery, Vivienne now has her own dedicated fine jewellery collection that embodies her cheeky, playful and fun persona.

      How this Singapore designer turned her quarantine into a productive ‘workcation’
  </h1>, 'text': 'When serving a stay home notice at a hotel upon one’s return to Singapore, what do people do to stay occupied and keep boredom at bay? Some post images of their meals and cocktail deliveries, while others use the time to catch up on lost sleep or to get fit.\nFor Priscilla Shunmugam, founder of womenswear label Ong Shunmugam, her two weeks of isolation in a hotel room became what was effectively a round-the-clock “workcation”.\n“I’ve been so productive during this period that I would highly recommend this to anyone who feels they can’t work from home anymore or need a break from dealing with their spouse or kids. You will be so focused,” said Shunmugam via a Zoom call during her stay home period.\nHer loyal clientele will be pleased to know she has been occupied with design work – her hotel room is filled with paraphernalia such as Pantone colour chips, measuring tapes and clothing samples which she fits on herself.\n\n\nIn the midst of this flurry of activity, she also remotely managed the unveiling of her new rattan furniture range under her brand’s Suvarnabumi homeware line.\nShunmugam, 39, returned to Singapore in mid-September from London, where she has been partly based out of since 2018. Although she was unable to complete her stay home notice ahead of the launch date, she remained in constant WhatsApp contact with her staff and maintained an active presence on social media to drum up interest in the range.\nAfter all, it is not like she has not orchestrated a virtual launch before.\nIn June and July, the designer released her second collection for her workwear-centric diffusion line, Om, via a series of Instagram Live sessions, with many pieces designed to be Zoom-friendly. The drops, which she filmed while in London, featured guest appearances by various Singaporean personalities who are fans of her clothing, including actresses Tan Kheng Hua and Janice Koh.\nWhile she is still best known as the designer who reinvented the cheongsam with her unique flair for mixing traditional Asian textiles with modernised silhouettes, Shunmugam has in the last year expanded her design repertoire beyond clothing.\nFollowing last year’s successful Suvarnabumi tableware launch, which features tropical flora and fauna motifs, the brand is back this year with rattan furniture that are made-to-order in Malaysia.\nLike her womenswear designs, the 12-piece furniture collection bears her now-distinctive design hallmarks including intricate patterns and the incorporation of batik and jacquard fabrics.\n“From my design perspective, I wanted something that was cohesive as a collection, in that when you look at it in its entirety, you can see threads of uniformity,” she said. Included in the range are baskets, standing planters, dining chairs, a dining table and a screen.\nThe idea of designing a feminine collection of furniture also appealed. She mused, “How many female furniture designers are there? I don’t know but I thought it would be nice for a woman to be designing for another woman. In terms of the choice of fabrics and colour palette, this collection is quite unapologetic about being feminine.”\nThe rattan furnishings can also be considered a product of the coronavirus pandemic. When extensive lockdowns were implemented earlier this year, Shunmugam, who was in London then, found her team spread out in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore.\nShe tasked them to conduct research on the various artisanal makers accessible to them and through the process of elimination, landed on rattan weavers. This was because her production manager, who was stranded in Kuala Lumpur, had access to a rattan furniture maker who was willing to custom-build pieces for them.\n“We tried our best to take a different path by ignoring the common references of rattan furniture. Most of our pieces had no template to build upon, meaning we had to draw them from scratch and the craftsmen had to build from our drawings,” she said.\nThe artisans, she said, took her unconventional requests in their stride and were even “excited” to try something new.\n“We challenged the craftsmen with technically demanding requests to merge materials and structures together in ways that hadn’t been attempted before,"" she added.\nFor example, she wanted colourful binding that would wrap around the planters – it turned out to be an extremely labour intensive and intricate process which they executed to perfection. “I am amazed that across all these distances, we were able to make this connection,” she said.\nStill, this year has not been without its heartbreaks.\nAt the beginning of 2020, she jubilantly made an announcement that she would be launching her first overseas Ong Shunmugam boutique in London’s Notting Hill. But when the UK imposed lockdowns in April to bring the virus under control, she made the heartbreaking decision to shutter her boutique even before it had opened to the public. Today, all that is left of this dream is a photograph of the renovated premises on the brand’s Instagram.\n“It was quite brutal because I didn\'t have a lot of time to think about it. I just had two phone calls with my lawyer and financial advisor and that was it. I had promised myself that the London store would have to stand on its own two feet and never be a burden to our operations in Singapore,” she recalled.\n“I went through such a rollercoaster of emotions and experienced utter loss. I was involved in everything, from packing inventory with my team in Singapore, unpacking it in London and then finally sending the stock back to Singapore,” she said.\nLuckily, the business “wasn’t very badly hit” despite the store closure, which she attributes to her customer base who have always understood the importance of what she terms “meaningful purchasing”.\nFor now though, she says has no plans to reopen her London boutique and does not intend to return to the British capital until the situation has stabilised or a vaccine is developed.\n“You need to be living in London to realise how badly COVID-19 has shaken it,” she said with a tinge of sadness. “I remember going to this huge Waitrose supermarket and I took a video where every rack was emptied out. They were overwhelmed.”\nTo overcome her disappointment at having to close her dream boutique, she has channelled her feelings into a bout of “creative madness”. Besides the Om and rattan collections, she will soon launch a ceramics range and her next cheongsam collection. “I found an outlet to send the sadness away and the work you are going to see, these all came from turning my feelings into something positive,” she said.\nThere is still much to anticipate, including the brand’s 10th anniversary this December. It is a significant milestone, she acknowledges, but how she will commemorate it remains up in the air.\n“I feel it in my heart and that’s all that matters. I am my harshest critic and I feel that over the years, we have managed to change things, even just a little bit,” she said. “I feel like COVID-19 has made me realise how resilient I am as a person and also how resilient the business is.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     fashion ', '     COVID-19 ', '     Pandemic ', '     business ', ""     Women's Life "", '     Profiles ']}"

      Creative Capital: This Singapore duo makes swimwear you can wear every day
  </h1>, 'text': 'Belinda Lee may\xa0be 20\xa0years older than her business partner Ng Su May, but their friendship\xa0– forged while studying at\xa0Textile and Fashion Industry Training Centre (TaF.tc), the training arm of\xa0Textile & Fashion Federation Singapore\xa0–\xa0turned into a business partnership.\nTogether, the duo\xa0launched PINKSALT, a local swimwear line that offers a\xa0comfortable and modest silhouette\xa0without sacrificing style. The label has earned many loyal fans, some of whom\xa0admitted that PINKSALT swimsuits\xa0were the first that made them feel confident and comfortable\xa0– exactly what the pair had set out to achieve when they launched the line.\nWHAT WERE EACH OF YOU STUDYING AT TAF.TC?\nBelinda: I was pursuing a diploma in apparel design and product development. Su was doing her\xa0diploma in merchandising and marketing. There were some modules that crossed over in these diplomas and we got to interact during those classes.WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE OR WHILE ATTENDING TAF.TC?\nSu May: I\'d just graduated with a business degree before attending TaF.tc. I’ve always had a passion for fashion and wanted to explore it further. Starting PINKSALT was my first real job, so it has been a really steep learning curve for me.\n\n\nBelinda: I paused my career when my family\xa0moved to London with young kids. We spent 10 years there and I had the important role of being a full-time homemaker. Before that, I had attained my graphic design degree and had spent over a decade working in the advertising industry, as well as having my own graphic design business.\nWhen we moved to Singapore, I wanted to\xa0resuscitate my career. Enrolling in\xa0the diploma course was my ticket back into the workplace. I wanted to pursue something that was still in the design arena but that was very different from my\xa0background.\nAGE-WISE, YOU ARE TWO DECADES APART. DID YOU GET ALONG RIGHT AWAY?\xa0\nSu May: We were in the same group in class and Belinda was\xa0the cool mum because she’s very westernised and hip. I was very surprised when I discovered her age and found out that she has two teenage boys. She’s very young at heart and could easily click with the rest of us.Belinda: Although I was one of the oldest students in class, I hung out with the young and hip ones. Some of the students were my kids’ age but it didn’t\xa0faze me as I wanted to immerse myself in\xa0the local crowd.\xa0\n\n\nI left Singapore when I was eight\xa0and it was important for me to spend as much time as I could to assimilate and understand Singaporeans, no matter the age. Su\xa0was definitely one of the hip kids, with her bleached grey hair and cool attitude to match.\xa0\nShe was one of those students who understood the topics quickly and knew how to\xa0easily pass the exams. She was also the most chilled-out student in the class.\xa0I knew that if I were to find a business partner, it had to be someone who was the opposite of me and that was Su!WHICH\xa0CAME FIRST:\xa0THE IDEA OF WORKING TOGETHER OR THE IDEA OF LAUNCHING A SWIMWEAR LINE?\nSu May: Shortly after we finished our diploma courses, Belinda came to me with the idea of starting a swimwear line. I thought that we would make\xa0a good team as we had worked well together before at TaF.tc.\nWHY DO SWIMWEAR AND WHY THE NAME\xa0“PINKSALT”?\nBelinda:\xa0We wanted a catchy name that was feminine and would also be associated with premium quality. We felt that ""PINKSALT"" encapsulated these qualities.\nSu May: I thought it would be a good business opportunity as I felt that the market only offered string bikinis with very little coverage or sporty Speedo swimsuits. There weren’t any stylish options at that time.Belinda: Swimwear and resort wear in the United Kingdom are\xa0seasonal;\xa0I was really surprised by the limited swimwear offerings when I came back to Singapore, a tropical island with sunshine all year round.\xa0As\xa0a mum, I wanted swimwear that allowed me to feel modest, yet feminine and modern, and that was not easy to find in Singapore.\n\n\nBETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU, WHO DOES WHAT?\nSu May: Belinda does all of the design work, from creating the prints for our swimwear and resort-wear to creating collaterals for press and social media. I am in charge of marketing, customer service, finance and managing the website. We both handle inventory and deal with manufacturers as well.\nWHAT MAKES PINKSALT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SWIMWEAR BRANDS?\nBelinda: We focus a lot on the versatility of our products, which is why we took a very long time to source for a thicker material.\xa0Our swimsuits\xa0can be worn as bodysuits, and our\xa0swimwear tops can double as\xa0cropped tops or sports bras for light activities.\xa0We are mindful\xa0that they fit better on Asian bodies and provide more coverage.\n\n\nA post shared by PINKSALT (@pinksaltswim.co) on Aug 6, 2020 at 1:46am PDT\nThe designs of our in-house prints are also quite different. They are not repeated patterns but placement prints, and they give a fresher feel to our swimwear and resort-wear. The prints are created specifically to sit on the silhouette we\'ve created\xa0to enhance the overall design, making each collection\xa0unique and original.\nSu May:\xa0We took around eight\xa0months to conceptualise the brand, design the prints and silhouettes, look for manufacturers, set up our website, visit the production factories and create our first lookbook.DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE A HERO PRODUCT?\nSu May: We don’t have a particular hero product but we do have some best-sellers. The Leia Two Piece and Harper One Piece are our most popular swimwear styles.Belinda: Our hero product … our partnership! Haha!\n\n\nWHAT WAS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE SO FAR IN YOUR ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY?\nBelinda: Dealing with\xa0manufacturers will always be our most harrowing experience! They still surprise us in many ways and it’s a constant learning curve when it comes to that part of the business. Managing expectations and having to communicate effectively with our manufacturers are still ongoing.We had\xa0planned to open a retail store as many of our customers wanted to try on our swimwear. We’ve had to put a pause on that because of the pandemic and\xa0will review it next year. In many ways, we are lucky that we did not commit to a retail space in the beginning of this year.\nSPEAKING OF THE PANDEMIC, HOW ELSE HAS IT AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS?\nBelinda: It’s been tough. We could not have any pop-up events and we usually launch our new collections at Boutique Fair. We had to launch our collections online instead and\xa0had to settle for less traction.The lockdown had a direct impact on our sales figures\xa0since people couldn’t even touch the swimming pool. Having said that, sales have picked up since staycations became the new holiday norm\xa0in Singapore.\n\n\nWHAT’S THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU SINCE LAUNCHING PINKSALT?\nSu May: For me, it\xa0was when a customer emailed us to thank us for creating a swimwear that she finally feels comfortable and confident in. That really spurs us on to continue doing what we do.Belinda: Yes, I love meeting our customers who support us when we do pop-ups, and they come in and talk to us. It is still a thrill for me when I see someone\xa0wearing our dresses or, even better, our swimwear with a pair of shorts or skirt. It means that our message as a versatile swimwear brand is making a small mark.\nDO YOU THINK LOCAL CUSTOMERS LIKE SUPPORTING LOCAL BUSINESSES THESE DAYS?\nSu May: Local customers are definitely more receptive to supporting local brands nowadays,\xa0 compared to 10\xa0years ago when local brands were perceived as expensive or not desirable. Some of our local customers actually thought that we were an Australian brand instead. I like to think people are buying our stuff because they like our designs.WHAT’S IN STORE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR OR 2021?\nSu May: During the ""circuit breaker"" period, Belinda and I spent a lot of time working out, so we decided to start an activewear line as well. Also, we recently collaborated with another local label, The Missing Piece, and launched a capsule collection of swimwear and resort jackets.Belinda: We are still keen to find a suitable retail space, where customers can find us and try on our resort wear and swimwear. We are also trying to move our business into a more sustainable space. So, we are\xa0looking for fabrics that are\xa0more eco-friendly, such as recycled polyester.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style "", ""     Women's Life "", ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      The modern woman’s handy checklist when shopping for fine jewellery
  </h1>, 'text': 'What do women today want from their fine jewellery? To look good, of course, and to channel their unique personality. The mindset doesn’t change whether it is 2020 or 1950 – but the big difference lies in how it is worn.\nIn the past, fine jewellery was reserved for special occasions and paired with the finest Sunday dresses. And while fine jewellery is still precious now, it is more likely to be worn on a daily basis, with a favourite tee and distressed denims.\nWith the arrival of this new attitude to accessorising, the rules to acquiring these precious baubles have also changed. Here’s what to look out for when shopping for new jewellery.\n\n\nWEARABILITY\nJewellery shopping may often be subject to moments of impulse, but savvy women will tell you that considering the cost-per-wear is a practical tactic, especially when purchasing an item of luxury. This is why versatility is a big quality to look out for when they are shopping for fine jewellery.\nA contemporary edge\xa0should never be confused with overly elaborate designs that shout look-at-me for the wrong reasons. Sleek lines, on the other hand, can endure the test of time and will likely go with most of the looks you have in the wardrobe.\nA good example of jewellery that will stand the test of time is Tiffany & Co’s T1 collection. Its bold, graphic lines are clean and sophisticated in a manner that\xa0fits the moment and importantly, you can comfortably reach for it 10 years later, without blushing.\n\n\nICONIC STATUS\nWhile everyday jewellery tends to be subtle and chic, the modern woman still wants it to make a statement that will help her stand head and shoulders above others. What she needs are stylish pieces that signal her taste and appreciation for fine quality. \xa0\nWorld-famous icons that are instantly recognisable signatures of jewellery institutions are particularly favoured. Such as an animal, a symbol or something as simple and impactful as a\xa0letter that has been chosen as an emblem of the house that made it.\n\n\nFINE QUALITY\nSure, the style-savvy woman enjoys her trendy costume pieces, but she also has a solid collection of fine jewellery that will go beyond transient fashion seasons. The very fact that gold is still in vogue makes a strong case for going for the real thing.\nAfter all, there’s no better way to elevate an outfit than with an 18K piece, set with diamonds if sparkle is your thing. If you don’t care for the yellow-hued precious metal, there’s always white and rose gold for the picking.\nTake a cue from stylish famous folks like Victoria Beckham or Rose from hit South Korean girl band Blackpink – layer up stacks of bracelets and rings in various shades of gold and wear them with your casual-chic OOTD.\nCurate your mix with varying designs from the same line of jewellery, or throw in pieces by different brands or even some of your costume jewellery. Don’t be afraid to be irreverent and carefree with your fine jewellery – that’s how modern, confident and fashion-forward women are wearing it.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     jewellery ', '     Accessories ', ""     Women's Style "", '     fashion ']}"

      Creative Capital: The Singapore denim label with fans across the world
  </h1>, 'text': 'A year back, a buddy gifted me with a very cool denim overshirt. It was made from a beautiful Japanese denim and proportioned nicely for my very Asian and slightly rotund figure.\nI mistakenly assumed it was from a Japanese brand, partly because said friend is married to a Japanese woman and has lived in Tokyo. I then guessed American. “No,” he corrected me, ""this is local.”\n\n\nHe then started telling me how much he loved the clothes and accessories produced by Fahmy Ismail, a local designer, through his label Kerbside&Co.\nKerbside&Co has a very singular focus. Fahmy, a longtime lover of American denim, produces beautiful denimwear and well-crafted work clothes.\nThese pieces are not for flashy fashionistas, but rather for men and women of distinction, who appreciate quality, craft and the simplicity of seemingly utilitarian wares.\n\n\nWERE YOU ALWAYS A DENIM FAN? WHAT DO YOU THINK SPARKED THIS LOVE?\nI think all those adolescent years of perusing Smash Hits and NME sparked a curiosity for popular culture that has followed me through the years. The ripped Levi’s 501s, classic Harrington jackets and Dr Marten’s shoes – it was all so enthralling for an adolescent Fahmy. I think the first time that I really saved up money to purchase my first ever Levi’s 501s from Far East Plaza for S$65 was the day, back in 1990, that I realised I had fallen hook, line and sinker for blue jeans.\nI UNDERSTAND YOU HAD A REALLY LARGE COLLECTION. HOW LARGE?\nWell I cannot really say that it was large compared to other serious collectors – probably only around 300 pieces at its peak. It was such a joy to procure those vintage pieces one by one, from 1994 onwards, if I recall correctly. Later on, eBay auctions were a constant companion and back then I didn’t have much competition chasing those coveted pieces, save for the odd Japanese or European with much deeper pockets.\nIt somehow got to the point where space was beginning to be a constraint. I started giving away the less precious pieces. Then I stopped doing that because I think I lost a few grand just by being way too flippant. In the mid-2000s, I sold off a good chunk of the collection. I keep only around 20 of my favourite pieces now, mostly Levi’s. All the vintage tops, outerwear and vintage denim pieces were cleared out, for better or worse.\nWHAT IS COLLECTIBLE DENIM, ANYWAY? WHAT DO COLLECTORS LOOK FOR?\nThis is probably subjective as most collectors have differing opinions on what is collectible. Generally, those that are deadstock and in unworn condition, replete with details like original price tags and jeans flashers (the branded cardboard that is tagged to the back pocket) will garner the most interest and top dollar among the purists. You will be surprised at how often those turn up at selected auction houses for the discerning collectors.\nAs for me, I was just a sucker for denim from the 1940s onwards, so I was keeping an eye out for those, especially the 1955 Levi’s 501s, just because I agree with those cuts the most.\nI UNDERSTAND YOU WERE IN THE MEDIA SECTOR BEFORE STARTING KERBSIDE.\nYes, I was working in television broadcasting for almost two decades, from production work in the MTV Asia studios to my last stint at Sony Pictures Television. It was something I truly enjoyed doing until I felt burnt out from the long hours. I left the industry in 2014.\n\n\nWHAT PROMPTED YOU TO START KERBSIDE THEN?\nWell, I have always thought that I could contribute value to brands with heritage here, elevating their cache further. But with no background or connections in the fashion industry, it proved to be a daunting task to get a foot in the door of the right people.\nSo, I figured, let’s just push the envelope a bit and see what pans out if I venture into starting my own label.\nWhile I had a base understanding of denim and vintage workwear, I did not have the slightest inkling of what goes into the whole structure of garment making and the production technicalities. So I went to study at the Textile and Federation Textile Training Centre to gain insights into the industry and to prepare me for the long haul. That paid off in spades.\nHOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR LABEL?\nA touch of vintage Americana with nods to the detailing of heritage garments. Whenever possible, I try to stick to the original cuts but I am not a purist in that sense. If I think a modern silhouette can work better, I have no qualms about modifying a design to make it more contemporary.\nHOW DIFFICULT WAS IT TO GET STARTED? TELL ME ABOUT DESIGNING AND GETTING THOSE FIRST PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED?\nAs with anything that I do, nothing ever comes easy. The designing part was fairly straightforward as I had the details all planned out while I was still taking the garment production course. However, for that first ever pair of jeans for Kerbside&Co, I was adamant about using Cone Denim from the Greensboro Mill in the USA. It was my homage to vintage Levi’s, which utilised the same mill a century ago.\nAnd that was where the learning curve got steep. I picked up a few rolls of deadstock American-made denim, paid a pretty penny for them, got them shipped to Singapore and re-sent them to a Japanese workshop. Such a roundabout way of doing things.\nOn hindsight, I do not regret the process because my future customers understood what I was doing and appreciated that I was not taking the easy route of procuring cheap fabrics or trims and doing things the cookie-cutter way. My first 50 customers were mostly from the US, by the way. For some reason, most of them thought I was California-based.\nWHAT SETS YOUR PRODUCTS APART FROM OTHERS?\nI do not think of it in this way, honestly. Well, not for the most part, anyway. I just design stuff and make samples and go back to the drawing board to refine things again and again. Not everything I make moves off the shelves quickly – some move much more slowly than others. I am not in a hurry to churn clothes out. I do not release my collection seasonally. I do things at my own pace. It is scary to see the rate of consumption of new clothes. Some days I just loathe to be lumped in together with the fashion industry’s hoi polloi. I do not look the part and never will, most likely.\nIS THERE A HERO PRODUCT WITHIN THE COLLECTION?\nInteresting question. It used to be The Kennedy, the first pair of jeans in the collection. These two years however, it has shifted to The Pollock, my modern take on utilitarian painter pants. A lot of thought and work went into the fit and drape as I used a thicker 12oz duck canvas. I guess it paid off as The Pollock has been moving quite decently.\nWHAT DO REAL DENIM EXPERTS LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING A PAIR OF JEANS?\nI guess you mean the denimheads. Based on my observations of my own customers, it is usually the fabric itself, then the cut – which is, of course, subjective at this juncture – followed by the hardware on it: Buttons, rivets, patch design, etc. The next step would be to turn the garment inside out and look at the stitches. This is where you might lose the purists. Some like them made with a vintage set-up and can immediately identify any modern construction. They might hand you back the jeans and walk away.\nDO YOU OFFER CUSTOM SERVICES?\nNo, I do not. I can be a control freak with my designs, so no messing about with what I have in mind versus how a customised piece might end up looking under my label.\nWHAT IS THE KUMI J LABEL? I SEE THIS LINE ON YOUR WEBSITE.\nIt is an independent label by Kumi J herself. She has a good handle on heritage workwear styling, which is a perfect match when it comes to designing her own apparel: A great mix of 1940s style with strong emphasis on detailing. And she has got a ridiculous amount of denim too, so we are even in that sense.\nWe share the same production facilities and it’s great when it comes to buying trims or fabrics in bulk as we tend to gravitate towards similar items when we run through swatches, so, economies of scale, you know. We are in the initial stages of running through some designs for a proper collaboration. Hopefully it will bear fruit in the coming year.\nHAS KERBSIDE GROWN THE WAY YOU ENVISIONED IT WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED IT BACK IN 2015?\nApparel and assortment wise, it certainly has seen some increase in depth stylistically, especially in the last two years as I’ve grown more confident in offering slightly different options for my regular customers. Honestly, there have been challenges throughout the journey. For what it’s worth though, hand to heart: For an independent brand, I am grateful for what has come my way.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST CHALLENGE IN RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS?\nMessed up production schedules! I have lost plenty of wholesale business due to the inability to turn bulk orders around quickly. That’s something I need to attend to in the upcoming year – perhaps an expansion of workshop options.\nAND WHAT HAS BEEN THE BEST SURPRISE ABOUT IT?\nCustomers actually telling me that they appreciate what I do and eagerly anticipating what I come up with. It still brings a grin to my face to know that I am making stuff that people actually like. It’s sort of a validation of my constant struggle to do things right, I guess. It quantifies all the work I put in as a one-man brand.\nWHO IS YOUR TYPICAL CUSTOMER?\nIt is typically American or European consumers who are heritage wear fans – the folks who appreciate vintage. They form a large chunk of my base. However, for the past year and a half, I seem to be gaining a bit more traction locally, which is always heartwarming. Thankfully, my garments are not faddish in design, so they cut a large swathe through age groups as well as gender.\nHAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED BUSINESS?\nIt is the supply chain that causes the most grief for me. Everything came to a halt and when the workshops were up and running again, huge bulk orders got prioritised over my stuff. While that is understandable, it is also grating on my nerves to know that my garments are six months behind schedule now.\nWHAT’S IN STORE FOR YOU IN THE REST OF 2020 AND IN 2021? ANY NEWS TO SHARE?\nKerbside&Co. is working with a local facility that specialises in custom tailoring work. So, I am fine-tuning the brand’s repertoire by making finer garments with slightly different workmanship. It is all about further refining my finesse, so to speak. I have also touched base with new workshops in Japan to see how we can work together for 2021, further expanding the choices of production partners. While denim is my calling, I have been quietly amassing some really good fabrics to be used for future collections. I can’t wait.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ']}"

      Sartorial similarity: Is it OK for couples to dress the same, or is it tacky?
  </h1>, 'text': 'As we stood by the front door, preparing to leave the house, I announced to my husband, “I’m sorry, we can’t go on like this. One of us has to change.” No need to call the divorce lawyer just yet, though; this isn’t a judgment on our marriage. In fact, it’s a far more serious problem.\nWe were dressed the same.\nThe shared “lewk”, if that isn’t overselling our functional ensembles, was an oversized navy cashmere jumper, faded Levi’s, retro Nike trainers and a utilitarian mac. It’s standard weekend normcore, or in our case, couplecore. A short, sharp bout of bickering – sorry, constructive conversation – ensued over who had to go upstairs and find something else to wear.\nI have a penchant for androgynous, “boyfriend”-style clothing that means our wardrobes have overlapped in the past, but lockdown has made this situation critical. Working from home means that I can now rarely be bothered with the smarter touches that differentiated my look from my husband’s: A chain necklace, low-heeled boots, a midi dress.\nI’d love to say that this confluence of our clothes was down to being perfectly attuned as a couple, as we navigate nigh on 86,400 seconds a day under the same roof (not that I’m counting). But in truth, when your wardrobe is distilled down to a few key items, there’s just not much room for differentiation.\xa0\n“My husband and I have always looked like we’re in the same band,” says one self-employed friend in her 40s. “Now that I’m skint because of COVID-19 and am not buying any new clothes, I steal his instead. In particular his very nice Uniqlo shirts.” Another reports buying his and hers pyjamas from Desmond & Dempsey (monkey pattern for him, jaguars for her) and an FT colleague has found that her boyfriend is copying her tracksuit uniform.\n“My husband and I have always looked like we’re in the same band.”\n\n\nBut without being able to track and trace the exact moment “couplecore” sets in, it’s hard to be sure whether two people are really twinning more, or just noticing it more as they spend extended amounts of time together.\n“We are slowly morphing into one,” said a friend who works for an NGO. She and her partner have an enviable shared parenting uniform of colourful canvas trainers, skinny jeans and a quirky jumper, sometimes topped off with some slightly rave-style rainwear. It doesn’t scream matchy-matchy, but on closer inspection has a certain . . . continuity.\xa0\nShared aesthetics are a reflection of the growing trend for gender-fluid brands and collections.\nIn July, Gucci launched MX, a range of clothes and accessories that features leopard-print coats, handbags, fluffy pastel jumpers and doll-like tea dresses aimed at all genders, and at underlining “the performative nature of what we wear, presenting masculinity and femininity as relative concepts”. On the high street, Uniqlo has started to show its men’s sweatshirts modelled by women too.\nSo far, so freeing, but let’s not forget the fashion car crash that was Posh and Becks wearing his and hers leather jackets and trousers in 1999, or Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears in their matching patchwork denim. And Instagram is awash with saccharine influencer duos in curated shades of beige, matched to their oatmilk flat whites.\nFor Simon Doonan, author of How to Be Yourself: Life-Changing Advice from a Reckless Contrarian, the idea of twinning with his husband Jonathan Adler, an interior and product designer, meets with a “quelle horreur!”\nHe explained: “We have very different styles and have always made a point of staying in our respective lanes. I am a bit more tacky and flashy and Jonathan is more graphic and preppy. Never the twain shall meet.”\nHowever, sometimes he is a sucker for a more co-ordinated approach in others: “I enjoy it when couples dress similarly, most especially when they take it to extremes, like Gilbert & George, or [Berlin artists] Eva & Adele.”\xa0\nThere are other refreshing role models for the look. One couple who recently went viral for their double-dressing were the Taiwanese octogenarians behind the Instagram account @wantshowasyoung.\n\n\nA post shared by 萬秀的洗衣店｜WANT SHOW as young (@wantshowasyoung) on Oct 7, 2020 at 6:33am PDT\nThe pair, who own a laundrette, were persuaded by their grandson to pose in garments left behind by customers and the result is a cute, kitsch array of vintage-looking ensembles that complement rather than clone each other: Coloured shirts worn over white tees, and biker jackets in different hues.\xa0\nMargherita Cardelli and husband Gerardo Cavaliere of Giuliva Heritage have mastered the complementary approach, and their new women’s range for H&M is full of tailoring influenced by classic menswear silhouettes.\n“I am very inspired by Gerardo’s way of dressing . . . and sometimes I actually borrow his clothes,” said Cardelli. “It may happen we both wear a white flannel suit that is in the men’s and women’s collections.”\nIs she not worried about looking a bit, well, naff? “It is normal for a couple to share time, passions, ideas and thoughts, so they are likely to be similar in terms of clothing.” OK, great – but that navy jumper is mine.\nBy Carola Long © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      In a pandemic, what does a COVID-19 edition of Paris Fashion Week look like?
  </h1>, 'text': 'There is no way that I belong in the front row. But that is where the meticulous planners behind Dior’s spring/summer 2021 show have placed me, just seats away from the billionaire founder of LVMH Bernard Arnault and his family.Welcome to Paris Fashion Week\xa0– COVID-19 edition. Travel restrictions mean that many celebrities and fashion editors who would usually sit front and centre are not here.\xa0In their place are locals like me, the FT’s Paris correspondent, promoted to the big league.\xa0\nThe vibe in the French capital matches the rainy and foreboding weather. New coronavirus infections in France are rising again to about 12,000 per day now, prompting the government to impose new restrictions. The bars must close by 10pm and masks are required pretty much everywhere.\xa0\nYet the show must go on. The four major fashion weeks that punctuate Paris life annually bring in €1.2 billion (S$1.9 billion)\xa0in economic activity to the city.\xa0\nThe masked guests filtering into the Dior show have to walk over muddied sand to enter the white cube structure erected in the Tuileries garden. I chat to another journalist who has been attending for more than a decade. “Oh, this is all very weird,” he said. “It is too quiet. There are so few in-person shows that I have time for long lunches.”\nCoperni,\xa0a buzzy Parisian ready-to-wear brand known for its tailored minimalism, chose the rooftop of the ugly 1970s Tour Montparnasse for its Tuesday show. Despite the fog, the view from 59 storeys up was breathtaking, overlooking diagonal avenues and the Eiffel Tower. A light drizzle fell as the models walked. I particularly like a mint green dress with a train like a mermaid’s tail, and white narrow jacket paired with leggings, both perforated with tiny holes.\n\n\nA post shared by coperni (@coperni) on Sep 29, 2020 at 8:27am PDT\nCoperni design duo Sebastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant tell me afterwards that the collection is inspired by three watchwords: Protection, optimism and comfort. Several pieces are made of a new jersey fabric that offers sun protection and is anti-bacterial. The pair are relieved that it all came off. “A certain magic occurs when the music, the place, the casting and the collection all come together,” said\xa0Meyer. “We wanted to feel that. We are in Paris. We are still standing.”\nJust under half of the 84 fashion houses showing womenswear this week opted for live events, while the rest produced online videos. Kering brands that usually show in Paris, such as Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, are not participating and will host digital events later.In contrast, rival LVMH is out in force, not only with the elaborately staged Dior show for 350 people, but also with a beekeeping-themed Kenzo show in a rose garden. It’s a bet that in-person shows, even smaller ones, will generate more publicity than virtual ones.\n\n\nA post shared by KENZO (@kenzo) on Oct 1, 2020 at 12:07pm PDT\n\n\n“We really wanted to be here in person. Paris is the city of fashion. It gave birth to runway shows. It is a tradition, and nourishes many studios and people behind the scenes.” –\xa0Sidney Toledano\nArnault’s group is saving the glitziest for last on Oct 6, when it will stage its Louis Vuitton show in the art nouveau department store La Samaritaine. LVMH spent years and €750 million\xa0renovating the store, only to have the opening delayed by COVID-19. It should make quite the backdrop for the collection of Nicolas Ghesquiere.\nHolding Fashion Week during a pandemic is not easy. The organisers of Koche’s show thought Buttes-Chaumont park would be a safe venue. But they nearly had to move at the last minute when the city banned gatherings in public places of more than 10 people. A workaround was negotiated with local officials: Putting up a black velvet rope around the area meant that it counted as a private space, not subject to the cap.\nSpare a thought too for the paparazzi. Stars are thin on the ground, and with all the masks it is hard to figure out who is famous enough to merit a snap. I have seen the Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams three times so far, always gamely posing for photos.Sidney Toledano, chief executive of LVMH Fashion Group, tells me it was important to soldier on. “We really wanted to be here in person. Paris is the city of fashion. It gave birth to runway shows. It is a tradition, and nourishes many studios and people behind the scenes.”\xa0\nI finally start to understand why so many in the industry are wedded to live shows when I head to the Jardin des Plantes on the Left Bank for the Balmain show. The brand led by creative director Olivier Rousteing is beloved by stars such as Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and has a young loyal following dubbed the Balmain Army.\xa0\nThey have turned up en masse, dressed to impress. Studded minidresses with plunging necklines. Thigh-high boots. Night has fallen. A crowd of onlookers and paparazzi has gathered outside the garden gates. An electric sense of anticipation is in the air.\xa0\nAs the show kicks off, Depeche Mode’s People Are People\xa0blares. Suddenly, screens flanking one side of the runway beam in pre-taped video of the A-listers who could not travel to Paris: Jennifer Lopez, Anna Wintour, Kris Jenner, Cindy Crawford, Britney Spears, Usher. All wearing Balmain, bien sur. It is Fashion Week’s version of a Zoom conference call. It is weird and kitsch, but also kind of great.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by BALMAIN (@balmain) on Oct 2, 2020 at 9:49am PDT\nThe 20-minute runway show is a glamour parade. There are so many models, so many outfits, that during the finale they walk the runway in rows of six across. Fluorescent yellow suits with dramatic shoulder pads. A trench coat and baggy trousers that reprise a black-and-white patterned 1970s print from Balmain’s archives. Sparkly ball gowns.\xa0\nA guy next to me jumps to his feet and cheers at the end.\xa0Finally, a bit of joy.\nBy Leila Abboud in Paris © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Paris ', '     economy ', '     business ']}"

      Kenzo Takada, first Japanese designer to conquer Paris fashion, dies from COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS:\xa0Japan\'s most famous fashion designer Kenzo Takada, founder of the global Kenzo brand, died in the French capital on Sunday aged 81 after contracting the coronavirus.\nTakada died of complications linked to COVID-19 at the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a residential suburb on the western outskirts of the capital, his spokesman told French media.\nTributes have poured in for Takada, the first Japanese designer to decamp to Paris and known especially for his signature floral prints.\n""Today, his optimism, zest for life and generosity continue to be pillars of our Maison (House). He will be greatly missed and always remembered,"" the Kenzo fashion house he founded wrote on Twitter.\nHe ""helped to write a new page in fashion, at the confluence of the East and the West"", said Ralph Toledano of the Haute Couture Federation.\nHis death comes 50 years after he launched his first collection in Paris, which he adopted as his home. ""Every wall, every sky and every passer-by helps me build my collections,"" he once said of the city.\nHe retired from fashion in 1999, six years after selling his brand to luxury conglomerate LVMH, and dedicated his time to one-off projects including a design collection at the start of this year.\nDREAMT OF PARIS\nBorn in 1939 into a family of hoteliers, he chose to study art not catering, becoming a star pupil at Toyko\'s Bunka Gakuen college, where he carried off the top prize. He went on to work for Sanai, a major chain of fashion shops, but dreamt of Paris.\nThe 1964 Olympic Games finally gave him his opportunity to come to Europe. The block of flats in which he was renting an apartment was to be demolished to make way for a stadium.\nLike all the tenants, he was paid compensation and decided to blow the money on a one-way ticket on a cargo boat to Marseille.\nArriving in Paris in the winter of 1965, hardly speaking any French, the only job he could get was in a poodle parlour.\nIn 1970, however, he took the lease of premises in the Galerie Vivienne, then a rather down-at-heel shopping arcade. ""With a few friends for three months we painted the walls with jungle scenes like Le Douanier Rousseau\'s Snake Charmer and baptised it Jungle Jap,"" he recalled later.\nHis first show using amateur models to save money was held there. One of only 20 people invited included the editor-in-chief of Elle magazine, who liked the collection so much she ran it on the front cover.\nHe became a name almost overnight, and went on to revitalise the knitwear industry with his contemporary interpretations.\nBy the early 1980s, when other Japanese designers were making their way in Paris, Takada was already well established on the French fashion scene.\nHis first men\'s collection was presented in 1983 and his first perfume, Kenzo Kenzo, in 1988.\nFrom the early 1980s boutiques opened all over the world in New York, London, Milan, Toyko and Rome, followed later by Hong Kong, Munich, Venice, Bangkok and Singapore.\nPARIS MOURNS A SON\nKenzo\'s romantic style, with its eclectic mix of colour, touches of exoticism, ethnic prints and folksy embroidery, suited the mood of the 1970s but adapted well to the sharper-looking 1980s and 1990s.\nHe drew inspiration from his travels as well as Japanese work clothes, such as his favourite military tunics and coats. Peruvian striped blanket throws, colourful shawls, oriental blouses, peasant smocks, printed velvet, were all part of his signature.\nIt was a measure of his success that he was notoriously prey to copyists. British designer Jasper Conran, interviewed on the problem, said he knew of a company in South Africa specialising in ripping off Kenzo, seam for seam. ""They make a fortune –\xa0more than Kenzo I reckon –\xa0but there\'s nothing he can do about it.""\nHe guarded his privacy by building himself a house in the country in the very heart of Paris, only a few yards from the Bastille opera house, complete with authentic tea pavilion and a pool of carp.\n""A designer with immense talent, he gave colour and light their rightful place in fashion,"" said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo on Twitter. ""Paris is today mourning one of its sons.""\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     fashion ']}"

      Low-cost fashion chain H&amp;M sees sales drop 16% due to COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'STOCKHOLM: Swedish low-cost fashion brand Hennes & Mauritz said on Thursday (Oct 1) its third quarter sales fell 16 per cent to 51 million kronor (US$ 5.7 million), largely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt the beginning of the quarter, approximately 900 of the group’s more than 5,000 stores were temporarily closed. At the end of the quarter just over 200 stores were temporarily closed.\nThe Stockholm-based retailing group said its profit after tax for the period between Jun 1 and Aug 31\xa0amounted to 1.8 billion kronor (US$200 million).

      Southeast Asia is emerging as a hub of the global sneaker trade, with Singapore at its centre 
  </h1>, 'text': ""Earlier this year, sneakerheads around the world gasped at the audacious S$3,500 price tag of Dior’s hugely anticipated Air Dior sneakers, a collaboration with Nike’s Air Jordan brand. Eye-watering as that may have been (in comparison, the “Pradidas” sneaker collaboration between Prada and Adidas cost about S$700 a pair), it was only just the beginning.\nSoon after they were released – all 8,500 Air Diors were snapped up during the global launch – the sneakers began showing up on various resale sites for at least triple their retail price. On Singapore-based premium sneaker marketplace Ox Street, a pair of Air Dior high tops currently hold the honour of being the most expensive shoes sold on the site at a whopping S$12,500.\nThose who still wish to score these designer sneakers have plenty of options, as long as they are willing to splurge. At the time of publication, Ox Street has listings for Air Diors in almost every size available, with prices starting from about S$7,300.\nEven in a year when the pandemic has confined most people indoors and has resulted in many cutting back on discretionary spending, sneakerheads are still splashing out on shoes. In fact, the demand for limited edition and collectible sneakers has never been higher.\nIn June, Sotheby’s auctioned a pair of Michael Jordan’s autographed Nike Air Jordan 1's from 1985 for a record breaking US$560,000 (S$765,880). Two months later in August, another pair of the basketballer’s autographed Nike Air Jordan 1’s, also from 1985, shattered that record with a final price of US$615,000 at a Christie’s auction.\n\n\nThe sneaker juggernaut shows no signs of slowing down. Sotheby’s most recent Cult Canvas auction featured eight ultra-rare artist-created Nike sneakers that were made either in collaboration or incorporates an artist’s work. These include designs by French Expressionist Bernard Buffet, New York street artist Futura 2000 and Michael Lau, the pioneer of designer toy figures. Buffet’s “Paris” Dunks, the show’s most expensive, is valued between US$70,000 and US$80,000.\nWith an estimated value of US$100 billion globally (according to analysts from Cowen Equity Research), there is no doubt that the sneaker market is booming. According to a study released by Ox Street, Southeast Asia is emerging as a key centre of the sneaker trade, with 40 per cent of global growth in the athletic footwear market expected to come from this region.\n“There is a global trend toward sneakers and athletic wear, primarily driven by comfort and loosening dress codes, like ‘Zoom casual’. In Singapore and wider Asia, this trend is even more pronounced than in the West due to the year-round hot weather,” said Gijs Verheijke, founder and CEO of Ox Street.\n\n\n May the paths you take in life, bring you to new heights of royalty in your chosen arena. @julien.sean captures the majestic nature of the Nike Air Jordan 'Court Purple'. \u2060⠀ \u2060⠀ #oxstreetfavorites\nA post shared by  Ox Street (@oxstreet) on Sep 23, 2020 at 9:01pm PDT\n\n\n“There is a global trend toward sneakers and athletic wear, primarily driven by comfort and loosening dress codes, like ‘Zoom casual’. In Singapore… this trend is even more pronounced… due to the year-round hot weather.” – Gijs Verheijke\nIn recent years, Singapore has become a hub of sneaker activity in the region, with a number of influential retailers – including Limited Edt, Dover Street Market and Surrender – who have sufficient clout to stock hard-to-find sneakers which are rarely sold elsewhere.\nThe little red dot also hosts a number of popular street culture events, including Culture Cartel and Sole Superior, which are a hotbed of sneaker buying, selling and trading activity. This year, the inaugural Singapore edition of Sneaker Con, the world’s premier event for sneaker enthusiasts, was slated to happen in June but had to be postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nJeremy Tan, co-founder of Culture Cartel, said there are a few reasons why sneakers have captivated the attention of savvy resellers. “Sneakers happen to have an affordable retail price, so if anyone manages to purchase a pair of cool kicks at retail price, it would mean instant profit if they were to re-sell. Plus, limited collaborations with artists, celebrities or other brands often have potential to escalate in value due to their rarity.”\nAccording to Verheijke, popular models, such as Adidas’ Yeezy sneakers or Nike’s Air Jordans, can fetch resale values of double to triple their retail prices. The current in-demand shoes are the Nike SB Dunks which retail at S$139 but command a resale value of at least triple that.\nThe coronavirus-induced period of isolation has also played a part in fuelling this sneaker obsession, especially with release of the hugely popular Netflix documentary The Last Dance, which chronicles Michael Jordan’s path to success.\n“Many viewers were glued to the Netflix show The Last Dance and the demand for Jordans have just skyrocketed. It is at an all-time high,” said Mandeep Chopra, founder of Limited Edt.\nWith many physical stores closed to comply with various lockdown restrictions this year, shoppers have turned to e-commerce sites to get their fix of kicks.\n“Viewership on our social media in terms of views and engagement was at its peak during the circuit breaker period,” Chopra added. Announcements of sneaker drops were made via Limited Edt’s Instagram account, often with stocks selling out moments after they were posted online.\nOver at Ox Street, sneaker sales doubled during the circuit breaker months, with Verheijke expecting sales on his site to continue performing well for the foreseeable future.\nCollectors who may wish to start dabbling in sneakers as an alternative investment class may want o take note of the experts’ predictions on shoes that may continue to appreciate in value.\nVerheijke says recent releases like the Travis Scott or Ben & Jerry’s Nike Dunks are currently commanding high prices. “Footwear that are convenient for those who are spending a lot of time at home, such as Yeezy Slides, have also gained popularity.”\n\n\n The Yeezy slide features injected EVA foam to provide lightweight durability, the soft top layer in the footbed offers immediate step in comfort, the outsole utilises strategic groove placement for optimal comfort and traction. .

      Raf Simons's Prada debut questions the link between humans and technology 
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Prada announced the appointment of Raf Simons as co-creative director in February this year, granting him “equal responsibilities for creative input and decision-making” alongside Miuccia Prada, little could anyone have imagined the circumstances of their debut.\xa0\nIt took place not before a live audience in the bowels of the Fondazione Prada in Milan, where Ms\xa0Prada has shown her collections since early 2018, but via a pre-recorded video that was streamed online on Thursday (Sep 25) afternoon and followed, unusually, by a live audience Q&A.\xa0\nViewers were invited to submit questions ahead of time in a democratic departure from the cloistered interviews that typically occur between fashion critics and designers backstage post-show.\xa0\nIn the show notes, the designers called it “a dialogue”, “the first example of myriad possibilities” and “a fundamental examination of the meaning of Prada”, a €2.6 billion (S$4.1 billion) revenue brand whose creative influence has long outpaced its financial might.Models, none of whom had ever walked a show before, paced through a room carpeted and curtained in tints of yellow and overhung with camera rigs and screens displaying each model’s name. They were a nod to the relationship between humans and technology, something Ms Prada said they wanted to explore to reflect the current period, when technology had become indispensable to daily life.\xa0\nThe looks were pared-back and referential, drawing more in mood and palette from Ms Prada’s early, minimalist years in the late 80s and 90s than the more retro-feminine, colourful styles she has favoured in the new millennium.Archival prints, including the kitchen-tile Formica\xa0prints from Spring/Summer 1996, reappeared on tops and skirts; roomy coats, cut from recycled nylon and duchesse satin, were clutched in the style of Ms Prada’s debut show for the label, in 1987. Tried-and-true Prada silhouettes\xa0–\xa0the full pleated skirt belted over a slim jumper, the sleeveless shift dress, the boxy tunic over slim trousers –\xa0returned.\xa0\nThese were combined with pieces that drew from Simons’s own body of work, and were hitherto excluded from the Prada lexicon, including floral-stencilled hoodies designed by artist and longtime Simons collaborator Peter De Potter, and T-shirts and jersey turtlenecks picked with holes and stamped not-so-discreetly with the Prada name.\xa0\nIndeed, the Prada logo was played up to a degree hitherto unseen before in its runway collections, taking centre stage on T-shirt fronts and nylon backpacks slung from models’ shoulders.Together, it was an impressive synthesis of both designers’ work. But in its emphasis on logos and streetwear silhouettes –\xa0two things that are, yes, selling at the moment –\xa0it also stripped Prada of its singular aesthetic. In other words, it made Prada look a lot more like other brands.\xa0\nThat could be a good thing for the top line, which in recent years has lagged that of larger rivals such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci, two brands that have embraced streetwear and logomania. But it may not be a good thing for fashion.\nBy Lauren Indvik\xa0© 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      Audemars Piguet partners with Meghan Markle’s dress designer Ralph &amp; Russo
  </h1>, 'text': ""Bringing the world of haute couture and haute horlogerie together, Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet has announced a collaboration with London\xa0fashion house Ralph & Russo.\xa0\nIf Ralph & Russo\xa0vaguely rings a bell, that's because they’re the designers of the dress worn by Meghan Markle during the royal's engagement photoshoot with Prince Harry. The couture\xa0gown featured a sheer, beaded and embroidered top and full skirt.\xa0\nAt the time, the dress caused some controversy. The see-through top was considered a bold move by the Duchess,\xa0a break from\xa0royal tradition.\xa0\nRalph & Russo is known for its glamorous, elegent silhouettes.\xa0As part of the house’s Spring/Summer 2021 ready-to-wear show at Paris Fashion Week, models will strut down the runway wearing Audemars Piguet’s latest Royal Oak Self-Winding and Royal Oak Concept models.\nHowever, the timepieces, measuring 34mm, are smaller than what Audemars Piguet enthusiasts may be used to, as they’ve been resized for slimmer\xa0wrists.\nThe 34mm Royal Oak Self-Winding timepiece that will appear in the show is available in four models. The 18K\xa0pink gold version features a diamond-set bezel and a silver-toned guilloche “Grande Tapisserie” dial.\nThe two steel models are enhanced by either a silver-toned or blue-grey “Grande Tapisserie” dial. The blue-grey watch is embellished with a diamond-set bezel. There’s also a two-tone model that combines a stainless steel case and bracelet with an 18K\xa0pink gold bezel and bracelet links. This model comes with a silver-toned “Grande Tapisserie” dial.\nAll four models are powered by the brand’s new self-winding Calibre 5800 movement.\nThe runway show will also feature the Royal Oak Concept Flying Tourbillon, the first ladies’ timepiece in Audemars Piguet’s Concept collection.\nFor the first time, the Royal Oak Concept’s case is adorned with Frosted Gold – an ancient Florentine jewellery technique revisited by jewellery designer Carolina Bucci. Tiny indentations are created on the gold surface with a diamond-tipped tool, giving a sparkle effect similar to that of precious stones, like diamond dust.\nAvailable in 18K\xa0pink or white gold, the new Royal Oak Concept Flying Tourbillon combines the case’s shimmering Frosted Gold finish with a contemporary dial composed of multiple layers. The timepiece is powered by the watchmaker’s hand-wound Calibre 2964 movement.\nSpeaking on the collaboration between the two brands, Francois-Henry Bennahmias, CEO of Audemars Piguet said, “Our partnership with Ralph & Russo came together naturally. I was struck by Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo’s warm welcome when we first met; they represent talent at the highest level mixed with simplicity and authenticity.\n“The fun part was when we actually realised that our watches had already been paired with their exceptional designs many times by clients in real life who didn’t need to wait for this partnership to match our two brands.”\nThe founders of Ralph &\xa0Russo, Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo, expressed their admiration for Audemars Piguet. “Beyond our personal affinity for the brand, we felt a strong connection and alignment through our mutual dedication to both uncompromising craftsmanship and the creation of wonderfully unique styles that withstand the test of time,” they said.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      How to dress right for an online job interview to make the best impression
  </h1>, 'text': 'The pandemic has inevitably changed how we worked. Now that videoconferencing from home has replaced much of face-to-face contact, the way we communicate is impacted – from holding meetings to, if you’re planning to enter the workforce, how we conduct job interviews.\nAs much as technology has brought us conveniences, it also poses some real challenges – and there’s no professional situation where this is more evident than when you’re looking for a job.\nDuring a meeting in which you will be assessed for your personality and how you present yourself, it’s become more crucial that everything goes as flawlessly as can be managed.\nNow that it has to be held online from home, the potential of things going awry is higher simply because of the propensity for candidates to overlook certain formalities that are actually still very important.\nFormal business wear is still the preferred choice as online interviews are just like any other interviews you attend in person.\nIs it acceptable to dress more casually for an online job interview than you would for an interview you are attending in person?\nAre you doing enough about your videoconferencing environment to ensure that you are projecting a professional image?\xa0\nCNA Lifestyle gets the low-down from a recruiting professional on how to look your best. Good luck!\nTIP #1: DRESS UP AS IF IT’S A NORMAL INTERVIEW\n\xa0\nA post shared by The Shirt Bar (official) (@tsb_theshirtbar) on Jan 17, 2018 at 6:19pm PST\n\xa0\nMiya Toh, a principal consultant from recruitment firm Robert Walters, advised candidates to simply dress up exactly as if they were attending a regular, face-to-face interview as this will “help get them into the right interviewing mode”.\n“Formal business wear is still the preferred choice as online interviews are just like any other interviews you attend in person – it is the first impression that counts. Your outfit demonstrates how serious you are about the job,” she said.\nWhile you should assume that casual wear is never acceptable, it makes sense to find out what formal means to the company or industry you’re interviewing for since it can vary across various work cultures.\n“The dress code tends to be toned down a little with start-ups or technology companies. I would always suggest to candidates to do some research on the company and the culture before choosing their outfit for the interview they are attending,” noted Toh.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nTIP #2: GUYS, DON’T FORGET TO WEAR PANTS\n\xa0\nA post shared by ARKET (@arketofficial) on May 17, 2020 at 4:47am PDT\n\xa0\nFor men, a work shirt, tie and pants will typically suffice. Yes, proper work pants are a must, in case you think you can get away with keeping your sweatpants or shorts on since the camera will only reveal what’s above the waist.\nWhile it’s true that you will be sitting down for the interview, Toh pointed out that there’s always a possibility, however remote, that you might suddenly be required to get up. Getting fully dressed up will also help you get in the right frame of mind to tackle the interview.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n“A jacket, however, is not absolutely necessary, since the interviewers themselves may not be wearing one during the online session. You do not want to look overly dressed up too. If you feel more comfortable being fully prepared, you can always have it on standby by your side during the interview,” Toh advised.\nTIP #3: LADIES, HIDE THAT SLEEVELESS TOP\n\xa0\nA post shared by UNIQLO ユニクロ (@uniqlo) on Aug 30, 2020 at 8:32pm PDT\n\xa0\nA work-appropriate blouse with skirt or pants will work well for women, or a smart, professional-looking dress. Toh cautioned to stay away from sleeveless tops or dresses though – if you must wear one, pair it with a jacket so that you’ll look more pulled-together.\nKeep in mind that you’ll likely be feeling hot wearing a jacket at home though, so switch on the air-conditioner to help you stay comfortable and focused on the interview. The electric fan might not be a good idea since it is likely to mess up your hair or blow strands of it into your face.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nKeep things simple and neutral where colours are concerned, and fancy accents or prints to a minimum. If you’re unsure, just stay completely away from them. Unless you are looking for a job in the creative field, your potential employers are not likely to appreciate loud colours and splashy patterns.\nJewellery, if you must wear it, should not be so large that they are noticeable – it would be good if you can remove everything, save for a small pair of studs in your earlobes and your wedding ring, if any.\nTIP #4: DON’T FORGET TO STYLE YOUR HAIR\n\xa0\nA post shared by Ralph Lauren (@ralphlauren) on Feb 28, 2020 at 6:02am PST\n\xa0\nThere’s really no difference when it comes to the grooming standards that a candidate is expected to keep up to, whether the interview is conducted online or in person.\nHair should be styled neatly and shouldn’t be obscuring part of your face or cause you to incessantly touch it throughout the interview. A little hair-grooming product will help the men keep their hair looking polished, while women with a long fringe will do well to keep it tucked behind the ears or pinned up.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nTIP #5: LADIES, KEEP YOUR MAKEUP LIGHT\n\xa0\nA post shared by HERA Singapore (@hera.singapore) on Feb 2, 2020 at 5:38am PST\n\xa0\nToh suggested simple and light makeup for women. Don’t feel that you’ll need to put on a smoky eye or dark lip colour, thinking it’ll translate lighter on screen, because more often than not, it will translate exactly as it is, which is inappropriate for an interview.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nDon’t forget also that you’re likely to be making hand gestures as you talk during the session, so either keep your nails free of nail polish, or opt for a neutral-toned varnish. Super-dark colours like black or super-bright colours like neons are not recommended.\nTIP #6: DON’T BE SLOPPY\nToh also pointed out some common dressing and grooming mistakes that candidates are making during online interviews: Wearing outfits that are overly casual or ill-fitting; neglecting to properly iron their clothes; and attending the interview (presumably fresh from a shower) with damp hair.\nTIP #7: FIX THAT CAMERA ANGLE (AND THE BACKGROUND)\nIn order to present the best possible image of themselves to interviewers, smart candidates know that it’s also crucial to properly set up the camera angle, background view and sound levels for an interview.\nAfter all, there’s no point in getting your appearance shipshape, only for the session to be ruined by an unflattering angle, or a view of a messy home, which will signal a careless attitude on the part of the candidate. While the reliability of your Internet connection and noise disturbances may at times be impossible to control, you should always aim to get the interview environment at home as close to ideal as possible.\n\xa0\nA post shared by MUJI Singapore (@mujisg) on Jul 24, 2020 at 3:43am PDT\n\xa0\nSome advice from Toh: “Pick a well-lit spot that is free from clutter so that you can be the focal point on the screen for the interviewer. Make sure you are in a quiet and conducive environment – if you are having the interview in your room, do consider locking the door to make sure you won’t be interrupted or distracted by others in your home.”\nDo a test run to ascertain that everything about the set-up is good to go, and it goes without saying that you should log on to the platform you are using in advance, and get yourself ready 10 to 15 minutes before the scheduled time of the interview.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nTIP #8: SIT UP STRAIGHT AND DON’T FIDGET\nYour posture and movements are all cues of your personality and attitude too. “Sit straight, with feet on the ground and arms on your lap or the desk.

      Time to replace your skinny jeans and jeggings –  here are the latest denim trends
  </h1>, 'text': 'Back in the 80s, nothing came between Brooke Shields and her skin-tight Calvin Klein jeans. Fast forward to now and Shields is singing a completely different tune, citing that she has no desire to fit into those controversial denims.\nLike her, designers would rather you steer clear of denims that are a blast from the past. But why? While denim never really left us, the shape and form of what’s considered functional and chic have\xa0been drastically redefined.\xa0\nTo get you updated, CNA Lifestyle takes a quick look at the latest denim trends.\n\n\nCLASSIC COLOURS\n\n\nA post shared by ZARA Official (@zara) on Mar 7, 2020 at 9:23am PST\nYou can’t go far wrong with classic shades of denim – dark blue, light blue, white and black. What you want to avoid is over-done denim that wants in on every decade – from tie dye\xa0denim from the 1970s and rainbow-coloured denim from\xa0the 1980s to distressed denim from the 1990s and sandblasted denim from the noughties. Be decisive and be firmly in the now. \xa0\xa0\nHIGH-WAISTED\n\n\nA post shared by Topshop Singapore (@topshop_sg) on Jun 8, 2020 at 4:43am PDT\nForget low-slung jeans that show off more than you bargained for. If you haven’t noticed, the tide has risen. Jeans have gone high-waisted, reaching up to, well, your waist. This 1980s-inspired style adds curves to\xa0those who need it and holds in that extra bulge for naturally curvy ladies. To slim down the waist, try a dark-coloured belt.\xa0Bonus: It completes the circa 1980s vibe. \xa0\n\n\nWIDE-LEGGED\n\n\nA post shared by G-Star RAW (@gstarraw) on Mar 14, 2020 at 10:50am PDT\nSay no to drainpipes that threaten to give you deep vein thrombosis. Wear your denims like you would trousers: Wide and palazzo-like. There’s no need for stretch denim here because all the volume should come\xa0from the wide-legged cut. Invest in selvedge denim to get a definitive (Read: More expensive) silhouette. \xa0\xa0\nDOUBLE DENIM\n\n\nA post shared by Acne Studios (@acnestudios) on May 15, 2020 at 8:52am PDT\nDon’t think Britney Spears circa the Justin\xa0Timberlake years but\xa0Bella Hadid on a coffee run. No longer a faux pas, designers such as Miuccia Prada, Marc Jacobs and Olivier Rousteing of Balmain have given their unanimous stamps of approval for head-to-toe denim. Riff off different shades of blue to create texture and depth, or simply stick to the same hue for an effortless turnout.\n\n\nGET NOT-SO-CREATIVE\n\n\nA post shared by RE/DONE (@shopredone) on Aug 23, 2020 at 9:00am PDT\nWhether it is an innovative wash, reconstructed or split hems, these tricks of the trade can all help you score brownie points for style.

Access is by invitation only, available to select Amazon Prime members in the US. Those who wish to gain entry can request an invitation, but there’s already a waitlist.\n“We’re excited about creating an elevated and inspiring customer experience, while also infusing innovative technology to make shopping easier and more delightful,” Amazon Fashion President Christine Beauchamp\xa0told Vogue.\nAlex Bolen, CEO of Oscar de la Renta, said it makes sense for a luxury label to work with the world’s largest online retailer in order to reach out to customers where they were.\n“I would guess that somewhere near 100 per cent of our existing customers are on Amazon and a huge percentage of them are Prime members,” he said. “This idea that you don’t want to speak to a customer where she’s spending a lot of her time is a mistake.”\nAmazon’s Luxury Stores touts a 360-degree view to\xa0allow customers to see every detail of the garments and better visualise fit. Oscar de la Renta’s store on the platform currently features its Pre-Fall and Fall/Winter 2020 collections, inclusive of ready-to-wear, handbags, jewellery, accessories and a new perfume.\n“More brands will launch within Luxury Stores in the coming weeks and months,” Amazon said in a press release.

      How Malaysia’s first lady of luxury fashion is taking the lead in rallying local retail
  </h1>, 'text': 'Name-checked in Business of Fashion’s elite 500 list in 2015, Farah Khan is the founder and president of Malaysia’s leading luxury retailer, The Melium Group, and creative director of her eponymous label, Farah Khan.\nSince founding Melium in 1989, Khan has been responsible for distributing more than 100 international luxury fashion brands including Givenchy, Max Mara and Tod’s. As much a savvy fashionista as an astute businesswoman, she also introduced multi-label stores like Aseana and M Store stocking edgier labels such as Balmain, Victoria Beckham and Mary Katrantzou.\nThe Singaporean’s first foray into fashion was the highly successful The Link boutique in Mandarin Hotel, which was established in 1974. In 1982, she sold the business to fashion retailer Tina Tan-Leo and moved to Kuala Lumpur to marry KL-based Singaporean businessman Akbar Khan.\nFive years later, Khan opened multi-label fashion boutique Le Salon, which retailed brands like Versace and Alberta Ferretti. Le Salon was eventually rebranded as the Melium Group, with Aigner and Hugo Boss coming on board as partners.\nKhan’s impeccable taste and effortless style found expression in her namesake label, launched in 2007. The label’s aesthetic marries intricate Southeast Asian beadwork with easy silhouettes, and regularly graces the red carpet thanks to fans like Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid.\nThirty-one years on, Khan now presides over an empire of over 40 fashion boutiques, as well as the franchise of Dome cafes in Malaysia. She has created a unique company culture built on teamwork and trust, to which she attributes the Group’s success and longevity.\n“We are almost like a family and have had staff that have been with us for decades. We have also been serving customers and their children and grandchildren so our client base is in some ways generational,” she told CNA Luxury.\nKhan’s philanthropic streak is evident in the way she chose to mark Melium’s 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries: By organising charity auctions to raise funds for deserving institutions.\nThe 30th anniversary raised RM4.5 million (S$1.48 million) for 20 charity organisations, which Khan said was made possible only from years of forging strong relationships.\n“The entire Melium family was involved in the project for over six months leading up to it. I worked with a committee of some of Kuala Lumpur’s most intelligent, stylish, dedicated women to raise these funds. Relationships are the most fundamental thing in life; it’s two-way and it’s about communication. Everything of value in life, comes down to the relationships you’ve built over time.”\nThose relationships were tested during the COVID-19 pandemic when the retail and F&B industries were hit hard.\n\n\nKhan believes that Melium has navigated these unprecedented times well, and continues to face challenges with renewed investment in people and technology.\n“We launched FarahKhan.com which focuses on the ‘New World Fashion’ essentials like masks, message sweaters and bomber jackets. That’s what women and men are looking for these days. The days of formalwear will return but for now it’s back to basics,” she said.\nKhan also revealed that Melium will be launching its own e-commerce platform in the last quarter of 2020, a curated space for shoppers to browse from the comfort of their homes.\nMoving forward in this new retail climate, Khan’s sales strategy has been to focus primarily on the local market. What better way to do this then by reminding shoppers that beauty and glamour still exist in a light-hearted campaign with an important message – #SupportTheEconomy.\nWorking with friends of Melium like hip-hop artiste and entrepreneur Joe Flizzow, fashion icons Ezurin Khyra and Magie Abang Saufi, stylish couple-about-town Kavita Sidhu and Roberto Guiati, Indonesian model Whulandary and the inimitable Chef Wan, Melium produced a series of videos to support the fashion, arts, food, music, and local travel industry.\n“It’s our hope that other local businesses will use the hashtag and that it’ll gain momentum to showcase what everyone is doing,” she enthused.\n“I need to be here for Melium and in a way that’s a fantastic thing. We are still here and fighting the good fight when so many other brands have sadly fallen to this pandemic.” – Farah Khan\nAs to how the pandemic has impacted her, Khan is stoic in her resolve. “From a personal perspective, I know that while I have wanted to take some time off for a while now – having been in the business of fashion for over 30 years – I simply cannot,” she stated. “I need to be here for Melium and in a way that’s a fantastic thing. We are still here and fighting the good fight when so many other brands have sadly fallen to this pandemic.""\nEven as the pandemic shows signs of easing, her\xa0heart is firmly in her adopted home. “While I’m looking forward to travelling again, I really miss being in Greece and Bali, my other homes that I take the time to spend with family and friends in the summer. Realistically, that will be a while coming,” she opined.\n“The truth is we are all just rolling up our sleeves and getting on with things. My focus is firmly on… my business, strategising for the next two years, strengthening our bricks-and-mortar outlets while building the e-commerce platforms.”\nIn the absence of travelling, which Khan cited as her constant source of inspiration,\xa0 she now looks to people instead: “The people who inspire me are my incredible friends, who have shown me their unshakeable love and support. And, it goes without saying, the frontliners who’ve sacrificed so much to help keep the virus under control here in Malaysia and all over the world. We wouldn\'t be here without them.”\nAs the world adapts to the new normal, Khan’s unfaltering vision for Melium continues to transcend the vagaries of time: “Whether design, architecture, art or antiques, the narrative behind beautiful objects has always fascinated me. The concept for Melium has evolved from when I started it in KL almost three decades ago.\n“It took years to build the right teams, the buyers, the retail operations, the right principal partnerships but what started it all off was my appreciation of beautiful, well-made things. It’s never been about trends, it’s about style and I like to think that that’s the essence of Melium.”\n“Relationships are the most fundamental thing in life; it’s two-way and it’s about communication. Everything of value in life, comes down to the relationships you’ve built over time.” – Farah Khan\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     retail ', '     Malaysia ', '     luxury ', '     shopping ', '     Profiles ', ""     Women's Style "", ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

Over the years, jewellery design has evolved to include little hidden, interactive elements that delight the owner.\xa0\nSparking off this trend in the 1990s was Piaget's Possession collection, first unveiled with the launch of the signature rotating yellow gold ring. The ring featured a central turning band that could be swivelled and twirled on the finger.

      Fake? Or not? This playful Gucci collection pokes fun at counterfeit culture
  </h1>, 'text': 'Imitation products are a real issue in the luxury industry, but fashion house Gucci has found a cheeky way to beat counterfeiters at their own game. Creative director Alessandro Michele is known for his maximalist creations, but the Fake Not collection is perhaps Gucci’s boldest one yet.\nEmblazoned on either side of shoes, outerwear, scarves and other accessories are the words “Fake” and “Not” in yellow, along with a bicolour stripe in green and red.\nThe “Gucci Fake Not” motif was first seen on the runway at the Gucci Autumn/Winter 2020-21 men’s fashion show. It draws inspiration from the appropriation of logos that began in the 80s and has since become part of the language of streetwear.\nThe fake Gucci logo with bicolour stripe was first seen in the 80s, and this latest collection from Gucci is a playful, tongue-in-cheek commentary on the idea of imitation.\nIt’s not the first time that Gucci has done this either. In 2017, models at Gucci’s Spring/Summer show walked the runway with clutches, bags and other accessories printed proudly with the word “Guccy”, reflecting a trend where imitation goods feature misspelled names. Since then, the logo has featured in several collections.\n\n\nA post shared by Gucci Official (@gucci) on Mar 25, 2018 at 6:00am PDT\nThe two-sided use of the Fake Not lettering has also been applied to luggage in the collection, where beige-ebony GG supreme material has been used as a base with brown leather trim. An East/West top-handle tote, backpack, belt bag, medium-sized duffle, small, hard suitcase and hard beauty case all come in this material and all feature the vertical red-green bicolor stripe, with the word “Fake” on one side and “Not” on the other.\nThe same design adorns small leather goods including wallets, a pouch and a cosmetics case.\nGucci has become a victim of counterfeit culture, and the Fake Not collection is indeed a clever mockery of the issue.

      The fashion industry overproduces, but what happens to all the unsold clothes?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Shops were shuttered for months amid the worst health crisis in modern times – clothing sales have fallen 66 per cent in the US since March – and retailers globally have cancelled orders to protect themselves financially from the fallout. Brands that had already paid their factories are left footing the bill.\n“It’s pretty financially devastating,” said Amy Smilovic, creative director of the New York-based label Tibi, whose company, founded in 1997, is privately owned. “We have millions of dollars’ worth of merchandise and it’s just sat here [in the company’s New Jersey warehouse]. And now we’ve got to try and get rid of it. At what point do you panic?”\nSmilovic is rare in her candour. The more than 15 brands and retailers I reached out to for this story, including Zara owner Inditex and H&M, declined to comment. The fashion industry, it transpires, has a problem with admitting that it overproduces.\nBut it does, and at a vast scale. Retailers tend to over-order on seasonal buys, expecting to sell only about half at full price; the rest is then discounted in end-of-season sales to attract a lower-price customer.\nBrands over-order because it is cheaper to double volumes with a factory and deal with the excess later – a habit true of both luxury and mass-market brands. This has resulted in considerable build-up: Swedish fast-fashion purveyor H&M is sitting on £3.4 billion (S$6.2 billion) in unsold merchandise as of late April.\nSome of that stock would ordinarily be burnt or destined for landfill to protect a brand’s image and price integrity. But increased scrutiny led France, home to luxury’s two biggest conglomerates LVMH and Kering, to announce last year that it would ban such bonfires on all consumer goods (worth €800 million; S$1.3 billion annually) by 2023. Designers need to find new ways of getting rid.\n\n\nBurberry is so far the only major luxury label to announce a strategy for its SS20 overstock, which will be discounted at outlets and in staff sales, or else donated to charities or recycled.\nThe British brand came under fire for disclosing in its 2018 annual report that it burnt £28.6 million of unsold merchandise; a few months later, after a flurry of negative press, it announced it would ban the practice altogether.\nBurberry has outlets in Bicester Village and Cheshire Oaks in the UK; other outlet hotspots such as Woodstock, New York, will benefit from this glut.\nBut while bigger brands can shift stock to their cut-price shops, small designers need to take matters into their own hands. The first line of attack was an early flash sale. London-based Rejina Pyo offered discounts in April – 20 per cent off a pair of strappy sandals, 30 off a tiger-print skirt and 40 off a woven bucket bag – for 24 hours each time.\nPetar Petrov, meanwhile, held a private shopping night in his Vienna studio when lockdown lifted in June; Petrov was left with €1 million of merchandise from cancelled orders and – without his own e-commerce platform or shop – no means to sell it. “We offered 20 per cent off and sold 150 pieces,” he said.\nHe later did another event in Munich, but with 40 per cent discounts. Today, he’s got 400 items left in a warehouse to shift, but is worried about hosting more immediate events. “We need to not look desperate.”\nRetailers, however, are offering drastic discounts; at Saks, a flowery Rosie Assoulin blouse is a snip at US$334 (S$454). Its original retail price was an eye-watering US$1,395.\nNet-a-Porter is selling tops by Ganni and denim bombers by Stella McCartney for 70 per cent off. Matches Fashion has slashed prices by up to 80 per cent. (For anyone in the market to spend, now is a pretty good time; I bagged a much longed-for marigold-yellow puffed-sleeve dress from Rejina Pyo’s sale edit for Vestiaire Collective for less than half price. With any luck, someone will invite me to a fancy party next year at which I can wear it.)\nStockholm-based sneaker brand CQP established a separate sale site titled CQP Archive in June, with more than 30 styles from current and previous seasons. “It’s a way to sell overstock without cannibalising on our [full-price] business,” said founder Adam Lewenhaupt.\nThe collections still sitting around by the end of summer will wind up in a sample sale, according to Katie Holland, founder of off-price events company Showcase. During lockdown, its new online arm held sales for brands such as Shrimps and Erdem. “The end-of-year sample sales will be bigger than they’ve ever been – there’ll be more designers needing to do them and more units to sell,” she said.\nYet online sales are “logistically complicated”, said Nikole DeSantis, commercial director at Shrimps, since brands have to accept returns from online sample sales. “But collaborating with a third party with its own large database is a useful way to reach customers that might not usually shop with us.”\nBusiness is booming, too, for MadaLuxe Group, the stealthy New York-based middleman company that buys out-of-season inventory from brands and discreetly filters them through to discount stores such as TJ Maxx globally.\n“Our business has planned up 25 per cent from what our original projection was for this year,” chief executive Adam Freede tells me on the phone from San Francisco. The company buys “packages” from brands that – at full retail value – can span anywhere from US$1 million to US$400 million.\nSupply is outstripping demand. “You can get major price breaks for helping brands out that need cash and need to turn inventory,” said Freede. MadaLuxe offers each brand a proposal to shift stock across territories, holding it within its own warehouses until it is sold on to discount stores.\nIt sounds like an appealing deal. But Smilovic said that one company offered to buy US$170,000 of wholesale inventory for a sum that was “pence” over breaking even – leaving her a US$17,000 profit. She told me it wouldn’t even have paid her electricity bills. Yet for many young brands with spiralling costs, that monetary injection will prove a lifeline. “We’re sitting in the wings with cash,” said Freede.\nFor brands that aren’t hard-up, donating overstock makes for good PR. Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli, the publicly traded king of cashmere with a market value of €1.7 billion, said he will gift clothing worth €30 million to “various charities globally”. Petrov said he might give some to local students to play around with. And Smilovic donated more than 900 dresses to frontline workers in April.\n“Every organisation has a duty to have a corporate and social responsibility,” said Fionnuala Shannon, executive director of the Dress for Success charity, which gives office-appropriate clothing – and interview skills – to vulnerable women worldwide to help them get back into the workplace. Net-a-Porter is one of its biggest partners – last season, it donated 800 garments and 2,500 cosmetic items.\nShannon is hoping some of the current surplus will wing its way to her. “There’s enough fashion in the world to clothe six generations of the world’s population; it’s a disgrace,” she said. “There’s a mountain of clothes. No matter how they try to sell it, they’re not going to be able to claw back all profits.”\nBy Grace Cook © 2020 The Financial Times\n“There’s enough fashion in the world to clothe six generations of the world’s population; it’s a disgrace.” – Fionnuala Shannon\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     fashion ', '     sustainability ', '     Pandemic ', '     COVID-19 ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Buy vintage: How to own the trendiest designer bags without breaking the bank
  </h1>, 'text': 'For many\xa0of us, it isn’t exactly a good time to be making big splurges on luxury fashion accessories – what more on those with price tags that have noticeably increased.\nStill, that doesn’t mean that you can’t reward yourself with a more prudent purchase that\xa0can upgrade your style quotient.\nOn-trend designer bags are aplenty beyond the new arrivals in the boutiques.\nVintage doesn’t necessarily mean outdated and decrepit.\nNow that so many archival designer bag styles are making a comeback, it’s the perfect time to dive into vintage shopping, where treasures from the past are waiting for the eagle-eyed shopper who can identify those bang-for-buck finds.\nDon’t be put off by designer bags that have been used – vintage doesn’t necessarily mean outdated and decrepit. Hone in on those that have been well-maintained – some are almost in mint condition, and on top of that, have collector’s item value\xa0or have made it to current times as trendy-again reissues. Here’s how you can do it too.\n\n\nWHERE TO SHOP VINTAGE \n\n\nA post shared by Vestiaire Collective (@vestiaireco) on Dec 22, 2019 at 7:06pm PST\nRule number one in buying vintage designer bags: Always go to a reputable seller. Even if these pre-owned bags typically won’t cost more than their brand-new designer counterparts, these aren’t exactly cheap.\nThey can cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on the brand, their condition, as well as how in demand they currently are. Which is why you want to buy only from a trusted retailer, who can provide the assurance of authenticity and has a good refund policy.\nAlways go to a reputable seller.\nShops that sell vintage bags are few and far between these days. Madam Milan and StyleTribute are two of the better-known local names that have a physical retail space where you can browse the goods before making a purchase.\xa0\nIt is, understandably, the best and safest way to buy a vintage bag, since you can then examine the condition of the item before deciding if you should walk away with it.\n\n\nA post shared by StyleTribute (@styletribute) on Jul 1, 2019 at 7:20pm PDT\nBut don’t limit your choices – there is a huge variety of options available on the Web, which means it’s likelier for you to score the bag you had in mind at a better price by shopping in the online marketplace.\xa0\nLocal luxury consignment sites like Reebonz and StyleTribute offer a wide selection of designer brands and bag styles, a no-fuss and quick returns policy with a free pick-up service on top of that.\nIf you’re open to shopping internationally, head to well-known consignment sites like Vestiare Collective or The RealReal. Do expect a longer wait for items to ship and a slightly more complicated process in terms of returns – the upside, on the other hand, is the wider selection of goods.\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU COMMIT\n\n\nA post shared by REEBONZ OFFICIAL (@reebonzofficial) on Aug 12, 2020 at 9:06pm PDT\nBuying your vintage bag at a physical store is straightforward. Check the bag’s condition thoroughly (exterior, interior lining, handles, straps, corners, pockets, zips, buckles and fastenings) and if you’re completely satisfied with it, you hand over the plastic.\nIt’s harder to commit to a vintage piece online since you won’t be able to see it in person. A good consignment site will feature a number of pictures of each bag in order to adequately showcase its condition.\xa0They are there for the buyer’s benefit and you should always make it a point to carefully peruse them.\xa0\nBe aware of the return and shipping procedures and fees, so that you won’t be surprised by additional or possible hidden costs.\nSome consignment sites will even allow potential buyers to post questions about the product, so don’t hesitate to do so if you should have queries that are not answered in the listing.\nIt’s also a good idea to do some research about the bag you’re interested in so that you can identify the basic authentication marks. Before purchasing it, compare prices from different sellers, so you know if you are getting a good or reasonable deal.\n\n\nA post shared by PurseBlog (@purseblog) on May 14, 2020 at 5:15pm PDT\nNot sure where to go for more information? Check out designer bag forums like PurseForum and Purse Blog, which are heaving with troves of advice and feedback from those who have long been feeding their addiction to bags.\nFinally, and most importantly, always read the fine print – in other words, the entire description of the bag in the listing, as well as details about the platform’s policies. Be aware of the return and shipping procedures and fees, so that you won’t be surprised by additional or possible hidden costs.\n\n\nNow that you are ready to jump into the vintage bag market, which designs should you be looking out for? It is a given that pretty much anything by Hermes and Chanel is a good choice. Here are some other great vintage picks that have been recently reissued and are enjoying their moment in fashion now.\nGUCCI JACKIE\nThis hobo bag design was first launched by Gucci in 1961 and earned its name from Jackie O, who was frequently seen carrying it. It made a big splash when it was brought back in 1999 by the brand’s then creative director Tom Ford, and is now set to reclaim its popularity when it was sent out on the runway earlier this year.\nPRADA TESSUTO MINI BAG\nWe’d never have imagined spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on a nylon bag, but that was what many women and men did in Prada boutiques back at the turn of the millennium and the same is happening yet again.\nAnything Tessuto is back in a big way, and if you have any doubts about that, just turn to folks like Kylie Jenner and Bella Hadid, who are seen everywhere with a Prada nylon piece around their arm or slung over their chests.\n\n\nLOUIS VUITTON BLEECKER VANITY CASE\nThe vanity case trend has been going on for a couple of years now and it won’t be going away anytime soon. Admittedly, the size is meant only for minimalists, but will be enough for days when all you need are your keys, cards and mobile phone.\nThe new reissues come with D-rings that allow you to hook on a shoulder strap while the vintage pieces from the late 1990s do not have them – a minor thing you’d overlook if you consider the price difference between them.\nFENDI BAGUETTE\xa0\nYet another hot bag born in the late 1990s, the Baguette was reissued last year. The new Baguette exists in a bewildering variety of interpretations now, as it did when it was first introduced over two decades ago.\nYou’ll see this from the wide-ranging selection of vintage designs available on the market that demonstrate the creative potential of this iconic bag. Now, the problem is which one should you pick?\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Everyone gets a (virtual) front row seat at Singapore’s first digital fashion festival
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the wake of a global pandemic, what could fashion shows look like? In Singapore at least, everyone has a chance to get that coveted “front row” seat on the runway when an all-new virtual fashion event kicks off on Thursday (Aug 20).\nThe Front Row (TFR), which will run for 10 days, will be showcasing 31 local brands and 10 other labels from the region, which online viewers can get a chance to see without even dressing up. The event will also include interviews,\xa0short films and podcasts, and guests can participate in interactive workshops and join post-show chats with the designers.\n\xa0\nA post shared by The Front Row (@thefrontrow.style) on Aug 11, 2020 at 3:30am PDT\n\xa0\nThe curated podcast panel line-up includes South Korean designer Minju Kim, the winner of the first season of Netflix’s Next In Fashion, who will speak about how Asian labels can stand out in this current COVID-19 world; as well as Stephanie Dickson, founder of website Green Is The New Black; Malaysian couturier Carven Ong; and Melbourne-based Singapore designer Jude Ng, who will discuss sustainability in fashion, fashion education in the age of COVID-19 and digitalisation of fashion.\xa0\nOn the interactive workshop front, local accessories artist The Kang will be conducting a sustainability workshop where participants can learn how to create his signature accessories by upcycling everyday materials like plastic bags.\nThe festival also allows consumers to\xa0immediately shop\xa0at the click of their mouse right after the show.\n\xa0\nA post shared by The Front Row (@thefrontrow.style) on Jul 30, 2020 at 12:01am PDT\n\xa0\nThe Front Row event was the brainchild of Singapore fashion personality and festival creative director Daniel Boey and homegrown photographer Rui Liang.

Through TFR, we have challenged ourselves and to discover and push out new ways to showcase a new collection to its best extent,” said Nick Tan, managing director of AP Media.\n“It is undeniable that the seamless use of the vast possibilities of technology is the pragmatic way forward for designers and brands to stay connected and relevant, and in the process, invigorate the industry of fashion and technology.""\n\xa0\nA post shared by The Front Row (@thefrontrow.style) on Jul 26, 2020 at 3:01am PDT\n\xa0\nInstead of picking the usual big name suspects in the fashion industy, the organisers felt this was an opportunity to showcase ""fabulous under-the-radar designers"".\nFor instance, Boey relied on word-of-mouth recommendations\xa0when selecting the likes of Reckless Ericka, Binary Style, Ginlee, Graye, Oliveankara, Elohim by Sabrina Goh, and State Property fine jewellery.\n""The brands we selected need to be relevant to today’s conditions and have embraced or pivoted to adapt to the changing world of retail,"" he told CNA Lifestyle. ""They have to be the future of fashion. It is also important that they are eco-friendly, sustainable, responsible and inclusive, traits which I think will represent the future of what fashion will stand for.""\nWith the inclusion of ethically-minded labels such as the above-mentioned\xa0Oliveankara and Maisha Concept, it\'s clear that TFR\'s focus is\xa0on sustainability for this year’s event.\n\xa0\nA post shared by The Front Row (@thefrontrow.style) on Jul 25, 2020 at 6:01am PDT\n\xa0\n""A digital festival is a very environmentally-friendly way of presenting fashion shows,"" said Boey.\xa0""Running everything online greatly reduces the wastage from having to build extravagant sets, only to tear them down.

      Are cosmetic brands from celebrity makeup artists worth the splurge?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Makeup brands by makeup artists aren’t a novel concept – Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, Nars and By Terry are a few well-known examples. What’s different today, though, is the rising of a new breed, fronted by makeup experts who have built a booming business based on their reputation. Albeit in more exclusive, less mainstream ways compared to the big department store beauty brands.\nThese days, celebrity makeup artists are just as much superstars in their own right as the famous faces they paint. Some of them are known for their influence in the fashion circuit, while others are behind the enviably glowing miens of the Hollywood set. But no matter which it is, all of them have laid claim to acquiring an impressively large fan base, as well as creating products that have achieved cult status.\nThere’s good reason why so many beauty junkies are wild about their products and would go out of their way to get their hands on them. It’s already evident that these pros truly know their stuff, plus it doesn’t hurt that they have the credibility and social media influence to match.\nIt’s not enough to have the endorsement of celebrity clients and beauty editors these days – these brands have also to face the hurdle that is the opinion of the army of beauty vloggers and influencers out there. In all these respects, they have passed with flair.\n\n\nCHARLOTTE TILBURY\nAsk any beauty fanatic about Charlotte Tilbury, and the mention of its famed Magic Cream is bound to come up. The brand may mostly be about cosmetics – naturally, since Tilbury is a well-known makeup artist in the UK –\xa0but it also carries a selection of skincare items, among which this glow-giving facial moisturiser is a best-selling product.\nTouted as the backstage secret weapon that Tilbury whipped up to transform the skin of her supermodel and celebrity clients in an instant, the cream quickly became a cult product and won its status as the brand’s most iconic creation.\nOf course, the makeup range is equally worthy of attention. Don’t expect a super-edgy, loud colour palette – what Charlotte Tilbury excels at are elegant, wearable colours that give women the option to dial up the glamour with a well-placed smattering of shine, shimmer or glitter when it’s required.\nAvailable at Sephora and on charlottetilbury.com\xa0\nPAT MCGRATH LABS\nAll hail the queen of the beauty industry – Pat McGrath has been called the fashion world’s most important, influential and in-demand makeup artist, and is the woman behind countless iconic looks seen on the major runways of every fashion capital. She is known for being one of the rare few makeup artists who actually create art out of makeup with bold, fashion-forward looks that feature unexpected accents such as diamante gems and feathers.\nLegions of the British makeup artist’s fans eagerly awaited the makeup line when she launched it in 2015, and – thanks to Sephora – we lucky folks in Singapore are now able to shop Pat McGrath Labs in person.\nEverything about the line lives up to its founder’s reputation as a trendsetting makeup maestro: From the flashy, fun packaging that comes stuffed with tons of gold sequins, to sublime product textures and intense pigments that pack a punch of colour. You’ll find something to love about the entire range, although it is the lipsticks and eyeshadows that are most raved about and win the wholehearted approval of other makeup artists in the industry, as well as beauty influencers.\nAvailable at Sephora and on patmcgrath.com\xa0\nPATRICK TA\nWith a client list that includes the likes of the Hadid, Kardashian and Jenner sisters, there’s really no wonder that the 29-year-old Vietnamese-American makeup artist is a favourite with the young set among Los Angeles’ rich and famous.\nTa made a name out of the glowing, sun-kissed, bronzed makeup looks he created for many a celebrity and supermodel, and his brand reflects this signature style and his penchant for monochromatic looks and use of neutral colours.\nThe line launched in April 2019 with a modest selection of shimmery body oils, lip shines and highlighting mists collectively named Major Glow, which sold out in a blink and continued to do so after repeated restocking sessions.\nSince then, the range has expanded to include a brow wax and brush, blush and colours for lips. We are pretty sure that more are on their way to satisfy the beauty community’s seemingly insatiable need for products that allow one to look lit.\nAvailable on cultbeauty.co.uk\nWESTMAN ATELIER\nAmerican makeup artist Gucci Westman is laser-focused about the direction in which she wants to take her own line of cosmetics – and that is to make luxury, high-performance makeup with only clean and natural ingredients.\nIt’s no easy task – formulating cosmetics without ingredients such as mineral oil, phthalates and polyethylene glycols (PEGs) could compromise on their texture and lasting power, which is why it can be a difficult, lengthy and often expensive process.\nWhile most brand owners would leave the task to the chemists, Westman worked side-by-side with her team in order to ensure that her standards are met. And these standards are among the highest in the industry – she is the makeup artist behind countless magazine covers and international advertising campaigns, and is the former global artistic director of Lancome and Revlon.\nThe result is a simple and skin-friendly makeup line that eschews fanciful colours and packaging for versatility and solid performance.\nAvailable on net-a-porter.com.\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     Beauty ', '     Skincare ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ', '     Beauty ']}"

      A decline in sales and global job cuts: Will Burberry keep calm and carry on?
  </h1>, 'text': 'At the end of 2017, Burberry’s new chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, outlined a far-reaching plan to ensconce the British trenchcoat purveyor “firmly in luxury” – a plan, deve\xadloped with creative director Riccardo Tisci, in which it would overhaul its branding, up the volume and pace of its product drops and attempt to make it a serious contender in leather goods.\nBut as Gobbetti learnt earlier this year, even the best-laid five-year turnaround plans often go awry.\nThis year was supposed to be an inflection point: The moment when two years of investments in rebranding and new products would yield high-single-digit sales growth and higher profits.\nInstead, Burberry shares have slid 40 per cent since the start of January as the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp sales downturn and the temporary closure of more than half its stores. In July Burberry announced it was proposing to lay off up to 500 staff globally, or about five per cent of its workforce, including 150 head office jobs in the UK.\n\n\n“It hasn’t changed our plan,” Gobbetti, a former chief executive of LVMH-owned Celine and Givenchy, said in a rare interview, speaking by videoconference from his home in Italy. But, he conceded, “it has certainly delayed it”.\nWearing a white Oxford shirt and seated against a bare, putty-coloured wall, Gobbetti also denied rumours that Tisci, who joined the house in 2018, would be leaving. “It’s not true,” he said.\nGobbetti said he doesn’t know when Burberry, and the sector as a whole, will emerge from this crisis. That will depend on factors mostly outside his control: From governments’ management of second viral waves, to how quickly a vaccine is developed and the effectiveness of global economic stimuli.\nWhat is essential, he said, is staying “as connected with your customer as possible”. To that end, the company has unveiled a futuristic new retail concept in Shenzhen, China’s fourth-most populous city. It’s a joint partnership with WeChat owner Tencent, billed as “luxury’s first social retail store”, and builds on some of the interactive elements originally installed in Burberry’s London flagship store on Regent Street.\nThe store has been inspired by gaming. Visitors can download and create a profile on a WeChat mini-programme (what Burberry describes as a “bespoke digital companion” – essentially an app within an app), through which they can gather “social currency” to evolve their animal character and unlock experiences in the store. Social currency is also awarded for scanning the QR code on product tags to pull up further item information, or giving the brand a “like” that will allow users to “unlock” new content in the app as well as hidden menu items at the store’s in-house cafe.\nThe store has also been embedded with interactive elements that don’t require an app, including what Burberry describes as a “living sculpture” – an interactive screen that reflects visitors’ body shapes and responds to their movements. To widen its reach, the mini-programme also includes content and challenges users can complete without stepping foot in the store. Such digital components are rare in luxury retail environments, which tend to emphasise more traditional values.\n\n\n Second nature . Thomas Burberry set us on a path of exploration and discovery forged in the great outdoors. Now we are returning to the city to mark the next chapter in our history, with the arrival of Burberry Open Spaces in Shenzhen, China – a store of tomorrow, for today . Powered by Tencent, our first social retail destination adds a layer of digital discovery to a physical space, connecting and rewarding our #Burberry community with exclusive and personalised experiences as they explore, shop and share . Discover #BurberryOpenSpaces \u202afrom 31 July\u202c\nA post shared by  Burberry (@burberry) on Jul 30, 2020 at 4:11am PDT\nThe hope is that users will share these experiences on WeChat, thus generating social media impressions and valuable data for the brand, and positioning Burberry as an innovator among Chinese shoppers, who account for around 40 per cent of its sales and whose spending has proven more resilient during the COVID-19 crisis. Gobbetti said it will also enable Burberry to be “truly omnichannel”, “closing the loop” between the point of inspiration (WeChat) and the point of sale (the store). If successful, Burberry will roll out elements to other stores in China.\n“Social media has been a big revolution in our industry,” he said. “For years we were not having direct communication with the consumer; we were giving [stores and press] content and they would then communicate it to the customer. Now it’s one-on-one.\n“I don’t think any designer can really be successful if they are disconnected,” he added – an interesting observation from a former chief executive of Celine, which did not have a single social media account under Gobbetti.\nThe Tencent partnership also aligns with Burberry’s recent focus on localisation. In lieu of a “one size fits all” approach to product and marketing, the company has “started to inject capabilities and people so we can originate ideas more locally”, Gobbetti said, mirroring actions taken at Kering-owned rival Gucci. “You have to get closer culturally to your local customer,” he said – a pre-COVID-19 trend that has accelerated now that luxury customers are travelling less and shopping more at home.\nGobbetti believes the crisis will be good for luxury in the long term, and reaffirms his mission to bring Burberry, a brand once spread across multiple price points and diffusion lines, more upmarket. Tisci has managed to cater to older and younger customers’ tastes through a deft mix of tailoring and luxury sportswear, and splashed colourful, Peter Saville-designed TB monograms (the initials of Burberry founder Thomas Burberry) on capsule collections and bags.\n\n\n #SoraChoi steps out in Seoul wearing our #TBSummerMonogram dark beige oversized shirt and high-top sneakers, carrying the #LolaBag . #InBurberry\nA post shared by  Burberry (@burberry) on Jul 28, 2020 at 2:03am PDT\nBuilding out the latter has been a key focus for Burberry, which has phased out all pre-Tisci designs and introduced multiple bag designs in the £1,000–£2,000 (S$1,790–S$3,580) range, making them more affordable than similar styles from Louis Vuitton or Dior.\n“As in any crisis we’ve seen in the past, the customer is even more gravitating towards real luxury versus the middle space.” – Marco Gobbetti\n“As in any crisis we’ve seen in the past, the customer is even more gravitating towards real luxury versus the middle space,” Gobbetti said. Other trends – the growing importance of digital channels, cultivating more of a direct relationship with customers, sustainability – will also be expedited by the pandemic, he said. People will “want to live in a world that is more secure, more human, more sustainable”.\nDespite calls for an industry “reset”, Gobbetti believes customers “will continue to want to see novelty frequently and not just two times a year”. The brand is planning to unveil its next collection on September 17 in a live physical show in “the British outdoors” that will also be shown digitally.\nAs part of its appeal to younger consumers, Burberry aims to recast itself as a sustainable brand, and has introduced capsule collections made from recycled ocean plastic. It has pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2022 by reducing carbon use in its supply chain and offsetting what it can’t eliminate.\n\n\nAs of late March, it was sitting on £68.3 million in unsold inventory due to store closures. Instead of destroying the merchandise – a common way of preserving brand prestige until a public backlash led Burberry to ban the practice in 2018 – the brand said it would be discounted, recycled or donated.\nGobbetti said he is pleased with the company’s pre-COVID-19 progress, noting that the first phase of his plan – “where we needed to replatform the company in terms of branding, product offer, organisation and distribution” – is mostly complete, and that the second phase, “acceleration”, should be on a good footing once the COVID-19 crisis has passed. Despite the challenges facing Hong Kong and US department stores, Gobbetti said he has no plans to close stores in Hong Kong or to reduce its wholesale network.\nAnalysts have been more mixed on Gobbetti’s performance. Thomas Chauvet, managing director and head of luxury goods equity research at Citigroup, said the company’s turnaround has lagged behind that of recent success stories such as Gucci and Bottega Veneta, but has shown promising double-digit like-for-like sales growth on the new Tisci collection over the past 12 months. “It is a clear change in brand momentum. Now what investors will judge is sustainability of that.”\nAnd while it has made inroads in China, he adds that reception of the brand has been less enthusiastic at home and in the US. “European luxury brands need to be successful among local clientele,” he said. And, Gobbetti concedes, “we have more work to do” in the US, adding that brand perception among younger consumers has recently started to improve there.\nGobbetti and Tisci have worked together for the better part of a decade – first for four years at Givenchy, before Gobbetti left for Celine, and now at Burberry. He said their “mutual respect” helps them balance the brand’s creative and commercial needs.\n“Today, a designer needs to be very creative but at the same time, they need to be very consumer-minded and very customer-oriented,” he said. “It’s creativity with a function and purpose. I am very supported by him [Tisci] looking into markets and consumer, and he is as supported by me in how we approach product and communication.”\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     luxury ', '     style ', '     Pandemic ', '     business ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Accessories ']}"

      What Singapore’s society ladies are wearing right now: Timeless, sustainable fashion
  </h1>, 'text': ""When countries started locking down in March, sales of loungewear and tracksuits hit the roof. Even when restrictions started to ease in May, shorts, jumpsuits, intimates and slippers were among the most frequently sold out items, according to retail data platform StyleSage, which tracks inventory levels at fashion stores worldwide.\n\n\nJudging from social media posts these past months, it’s a similar story for Singapore’s social set, who have been mostly donning athleisure staples or casual, relaxed pieces.\nBut it’s not game over for skin-tight, form-fitting occasion dresses yet. With dining in restaurants allowed in Phase 2, society ladies have been seen in town with their besties, some togged out in bodycon dresses and/or fitted tops. Evidently, while comfort and versatility are still key, personal style has not gone to the baggy pits. CNA Luxury speaks to five fashionistas to find out how the pandemic has influenced their sartorial choices.\n\n\nCHLOE NG, LAW STUDENT\n“I’ve adopted a more practical and relaxed dress style in the past few months so I bought a lot of sweaters and comfy pants online. That’s been my go-to look. [It’s either that] or tees with denim jeans. Sweaters and hoodies are so easy to mix and match. For instance, I can wear a workout outfit and once I’m done with the exercise, I’ll just wear my sweater over it and it’s a whole new look.\nOne thing I’ve been shopping for a lot lately is pyjamas, especially the silk kind, and revamping my sleeping outfits. For accessories I’ve been getting more chokers and basic tennis bracelets.\nI love mixing and matching different clothing and I don’t like sticking to one type of silhouette. How I dress really depends on my mood that day and what the occasion is. I’ve been leaning more to relaxed silhouettes but it’s nice to change it up once in a while. Dressing up makes a person feel good, especially if you’ve been working out – it’s nice to flaunt your form after hours of hard work in the gym. Sometimes I go for a tight-fitting top and a loose bottom or vice versa.\nLouis Vuitton is still my favourite brand; it was the first shop I went to after the circuit breaker ended. I love the iconic monogram, the timeless bags, and how classic and amazingly creative their menswear and womenswear are. Their style constantly evolves to what people want at the moment.”\n“Dressing up makes a person feel good, especially if you’ve been working out – it’s nice to flaunt your form after hours of hard work in the gym.”\nDANA CHEONG, GYROTONIC AND GYROKINESIS TRAINER\n“My preference for casual chic fashion remains broadly unchanged, with the exception of a slight change in fabric choice. Hand-washable pieces are my top picks now as soap and water are the most effective against the coronavirus.\nMy favourite combinations are cropped tops paired with long trousers, cargo pants, skinny jeans or short or long flowy skirts. I’ll add accessories such as an Apple watch or a cap or bucket hat.\nI would still wear bodycon dresses. Fashion is a form of self-expression, so to the extent my personality, identity, and mood remain unchanged, my fashion sense has naturally remained unaffected.\xa0\nThe fashion brands that are close to my heart include Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Missoni. The joy of wearing creations from these brands is more than just fashion. Over the years, I have built special relationships with these fashion houses. I’m happy to do my part to support them in a difficult time like this.”\n“Hand-washable pieces are my top picks now as soap and water are the most effective against the coronavirus.”\nJESSICACINDY HARTONO, FOUNDER AND CREATIVE DIRECTOR, JESSICACINDY\n“I’m buying more comfortable and timeless pieces that transcend trends now, and am also more conscious about the sustainability of each item. I should be able to maximise its usage with a different styling.\nMy current favourite apparel combination is shirt and pants, as I can switch up looks effortlessly with simple tweaks like pushing up my sleeves, buttoning up or tucking in. Accessory-wise, I like pieces in gold tones, and will vary the size depending on my mood or the occasion.\nI generally favour a more relaxed silhouette but I do enjoy a form-fitted look occasionally. I like to play with layering, such as overlaying something slack over a form-fitted piece for some definition. Regardless of what I wear, it is important that it feels comfortable and reflects my mood and personality, while allowing me to work efficiently and get through the day.\nI love brands like Hermes, Loewe and Bottega Veneta for their quality leather pieces in timeless, understated designs. For clothing in general, I don’t focus too much on the brand but more on the quality and sustainability of the product. At the same time, I also like pieces from Max Mara for their sleek looks.

      Maternity clothes can be fashionable: Shopping and style tips for pregnant women
  </h1>, 'text': ""When it comes to maternity wear, gone are the sailor collars, frumpy styles, drab colours and tent-like dresses of the past.\nToday’s pregnant women have a wider variety of options to dress their changing silhouette with. From local boutiques to international labels, the collections that are available now feature smart cuts, playful designs and bursts of colour for every occasion.\nAfter all, the journey to motherhood is challenging enough – so it definitely helps if you can look and feel good in any way.\nFounder of local boutique Stillen Maternity, Lisa Chong, explained that one of the reasons she started her business was to support mothers-to-be.\n“Stillen is also my platform to reach out to more mums to raise awareness on the importance of self-care for mental health and hopefully flatten the steep learning curve that comes with motherhood as we share tips and information within the community,” she said.\nMy maternity phase was challenging and it felt frumpy going back to work wearing clothes that were obviously nursing wear.\nDedicated to working pregnant women, her boutique is inspired by the fashion struggles she faced while pregnant. “My personal experience in finding professional looking workwear during my maternity phase was challenging,” Chong shared.\n“It felt frumpy going back to work wearing clothes that were obviously nursing wear as they had a band under the bust line so I have conceptualised Stillen pieces to bridge this gap by designing them with concealed nursing access.”\nSimilarly, another local boutique, Dear Collective, was born out of co-founder Eunyce Yap’s pregnancy experience as she also found it hard to find well-designed clothes that could fit her bump.\nShe and co-founder Beatrice Yap have designed a collection of practical styles that can last beyond the pregnancy.\xa0\n“Dear Collective sets to create a collection of transitional, functional, and stylish clothes from pregnancy to nursing. Even post-partum, our pieces can be effortlessly retained in the wardrobe. Truth be told, it's hard to even tell it's maternity wear,” she said.\n\n\nSHOPPING TIPS FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS\nFrom the lack of comfort and versatility to size limitations, the unique fashion challenges that a pregnant woman faces are varied. To make things easier, here are a few tips to keep in mind when shopping for maternity wear and a list of stores to visit.\nEven post-partum, our pieces can be effortlessly retained in the wardrobe. Truth be told, it's hard to even tell it's maternity wear.\nINVEST IN BASICS \nBe sure to have some essential basics that can take you through daily life and even some special occasions. Loose tees, stretchy tank tops, comfy leggings, these all go a long way in keeping you relaxed yet stylish.\nChong advised: “Have a look at your wardrobe and see if you can put a capsule “pregnancy closet” out of everything in your wardrobe especially with some of your favourite pieces. “Invest in a few basic nursing tanks and not forgetting leggings in stretchable and cooling fabrics like cotton/modal/bamboo and pair them with your existing wardrobe pieces like jackets, cardigans, buttoned down shirts. This way, you can maintain your personal style and show off that baby bump.”\nLOOK FOR VERSATILITY\nChoose pieces that can go the extra mile. “I’m all for value for money when shopping but apart from looking at just the price tag, I would definitely shop for something you can be versatile with, say if a nursing outfit came with an inner lining piece that’s nursing friendly and easy to pair with another outerwear. For example, a cardigan or bomber jacket to create another look would be a winner for me,” said Chong.\nShe added that it’s prudent to shop for quality dual-function pieces at the end of the first trimester, that are classic in style, colour and design so that you can feel comfortable as your belly grows.\nMeanwhile, Yap added, “for non-stretchy pieces, go for those with\xa0nursing functions and with a sash attached to accentuate your waistline.”\nSTRETCH IT\nWith an expanding girth, you’ll need as much stretch as you can get, so whether it is tops, bottoms or dresses, opt for pieces that hug your figure comfortably. Said Yap: “Stretchy pieces are a better bet if you're looking for something to last throughout your pregnancy, but they typically come in less varied materials and prints.”\n\n\nCOMFORT IS KEY \nWith all the aches and pains that come with pregnancy, you definitely don’t want to be fussing with your clothes so choose comfortable, easy-to-wear pieces in good quality fabrics. Look for looser fits that can accommodate the expanding belly.\xa0\n“It should fit slightly looser if you're in your first trimester, and fit well if you're in your second. These pieces will be good for the first and second trimester and for nursing post-partum,” said Yap.\nDON’T FORGET YOUR PERSONALITY\nDon’t drastically change your style just for the duration of the pregnancy. Pick designs that are still true to your personality but are also kind to your changing silhouette. “Stick with your pre-pregnancy style, and choose pieces that you're comfortable in. So long as you feel beautiful and empowered, you’ll look beautiful and empowered,” said Yap.\n\n\nReady to shop now? Scroll down for shopping options that span from local labels to international brands.\nSTILLEN MATERNITY \nDedicated to working new mums, Stillen Maternity features corporate pieces that are both modern and comfortable. “Our client base is made up of working professionals in many different industries, banking, healthcare and also entrepreneurs but also mums who appreciate timeless fashion,” said Chong.\nThe boutique keeps in mind the practical needs of a mother who doesn’t want to splurge on maternity wear so the clothes are made to be cost-efficient and with longer lifespans.\nShop here.\xa0\nDEAR COLLECTIVE \nThis local boutique features a collection of transitional, functional, and stylish clothes from pregnancy to nursing. According to Yap, the boutique’s customers are mostly pregnant women in their second and third trimesters, as well as nursing mothers.\nThey opened their retail store earlier this year for customers who wanted to really feel and try the pieces. She highlighted: “In terms of style, V-neck pieces, like wrap dresses, are a hit with our customers as they elongate the silhouette.”\xa0\nShop here.\n\n\nJUMP EAT CRY \nWith classic, comfortable and feminine pieces, this boutique offers a collection of styles that can last throughout pregnancy and beyond. They even have a Mum and Baby collection that features twinning outfits for both mum and child.\nShop here.\nSPRING MATERNITY \nA wide variety of colours and designs are available here, even intimates, outerwear and activewear. There are also breastfeeding essentials and baby products.\nShop here.\nEMMA AND KEI \nA selection of clean, casual and even dressy styles to clothe the modern pregnant woman, along with nursing essentials at this store.\nShop here.\n\n\nUNIQLO \nKnown for its everyday basics, the Japanese retailer’s LifeWear collection has a variety of bottoms that can fit comfortably around the expanding girth.\nShop here.\nH&M\nComfy dresses, cute knits and tops in basics, new season colours and prints, there’s something for every occasion, along with nursing intimates.\nShop here.\nASOS\nA wide variety of modern trends and styles to keep the pregnant woman’s wardrobe comfortable yet updated.\nShop here.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n"", 'related_topics': [""     Women's Style "", '     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Hermes sales plunge 42 per cent amid global coronavirus store closures
  </h1>, 'text': 'The iconic Birkin bag may be the world’s most resilient luxury product in times of crisis, but even its maker is feeling the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic. French luxury goods company Hermes has announced that sales fell 42 per cent in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shutter stores across the globe and pause production.\n“This unprecedented crisis, which began at the start of the year and is still ongoing, allows us to test our business model’s strength,” Axel Dumas, Executive Chairman of Hermes, said in a statement.\nIn Asia (excluding Japan), sales plummeted by 9 per cent but is gradually recovering, buoyed by the reopening of stores in mainland China.

Sales was especially strong on the new\xa0hermes.com/jp/ja\xa0platform.\nSales in the US were\xa0the most hit, down by 42 per cent, while\xa0Europe has been greatly affected by the reduction in tourist flows.

      Creative Capital: How three former colleagues got together to start a quirky Singapore sock company
  </h1>, 'text': 'Take three super creative and senior advertising people. Put them in a room and ask them to create a business. The first thought would probably run in the direction of a digital product or solution, one that they will tell you is going to disrupt a chosen sector and change your life. After all, we expect hyperbole from agency folk. The last thing one expects to hear pitched is a sock business.\nBut that is exactly what Vincent Teo, currently Business & Strategy Director at Tribal Worldwide, Ling Ang, Brand Communications Director at Adidas in China, and Karl Ng, a freelance Creative Director, came up with. The trio launched Freshly Pressed Socks in 2015.\nWe catch up with Vincent Teo to find out how Freshly Pressed and their quirky designs are doing, as well as learn more about the business.\nVINCENT, HOW DID YOU, LING AND KARL FIRST MEET?\nWe met at Publicis 10 years ago. Karl was an art director, Ling was a strategic planner and I was a digital strategist. We bonded over late nights working in the office.\nYOU AND LING WERE PARTNERS IN ANOTHER VENTURE, LENSY. \nBack in 2014, Ling and I decided to leave our agency roles and start our own thing. We had an idea that the agency of the future would be one that does both consulting work for clients and creates its own products and services.\n\n\nWe Are Clique was born as a result. It is meant to be both an agency as well as a sort of business incubator. We split our time fifty-fifty doing client work, building our own products and trying to scale them to become independent and self-sustaining businesses. The name We Are Clique came about because some of our colleagues at Publicis dubbed a bunch of us a ""clique"" for spending so much time together at work and we decided to just embrace it.\nLensy was the first product we built and our first start-up. Having worked a lot with stock photography in our agency roles, we felt that most stock libraries did not have an accurate depiction of Asia and Asians. So Lensy was launched a way to ""Unstereotype Asia"" through a marketplace platform that connected everyday photographers in Asia with brands that needed authentic Asian stock photography. At the same time, we introduced Lensy Tasks as a way for brands to create photo challenges and requests for the Lensy community to crowdsource the images they need.\nWe bootstrapped Lensy and supported it with revenue from the client work that we were doing. We didn’t take any outside investment because it meant we would have to focus on just Lensy alone and we wanted the freedom to be able to do multiple projects.\nHowever, the challenge with trying to scale what was essentially a tech company and a marketplace with limited funds, where you would need to both acquire buyers (the brands) and sellers (the photographers), was challenging. We ultimately closed it after three and a half years because it got to the point where we felt we couldn’t scale it enough for it to be sustainable.\nLensy taught us a lot about the economies of running a start-up as well as building a product from scratch. Ultimately I think in order to have succeeded we would really have had to take on a sizeable investment and perhaps move to a bigger market like the U.S to scale.\nHOW DID YOU GUYS DECIDE TO START FRESHLY PRESSED?\nFreshly Pressed Socks was our second start-up. As Lensy was a digital platform, we wanted to do something that was completely physical. Having been in advertising for a while, there’s always been talk of wanting to create a brand that we could own and grow. Doing socks was my idea. I’m a big fan of colourful and well-designed socks but also felt what was available then in 2014, was limited and not very unique.\n\n\nKarl, Ling and I were actually working on a client project together and as with all client work, the appeal of making something for yourself starts to linger after a while. The idea was conceptualized during this period and a big part of the appeal for us, as with all our projects, was doing something that we were completely unfamiliar with and just figuring our way through it.\nWHAT ROLES DO EACH OF YOU PLAY IN FRESHLY PRESSED?\nI manage the overall business and handle product development and copywriting. Ling handles marketing, distribution and operations. Karl is our creative and design lead.\nHOW HARD IS IT TO JUGGLE FULL-TIME WORK YET ALSO RUN A CREATIVE FASHION BUSINESS?\nIt’s definitely been challenging. When we first started, there was a bit more control as we were running our own agency and handling client work. We simply treated Freshly Pressed as another client we had to work with.\n\n\nEverything was hubbed out of the same office so it was easier to manage altogether. However in the past year, we’ve decided to each take on full time roles with other companies, including Ling who is currently based overseas while still running Freshly Pressed Socks on the side. We’ve set up the necessary infrastructure – office, warehouse fulfilment – and hired good people to help us while we manage a lot of things remotely through regular check-ins and meetings.\nOne thing we learnt very quickly was that we had to be very selective on what we would each spend our time on. We had to determine what were the important things we had to do that would contribute to business growth and revenue and what were the non-essentials that we had to say no to.\nFRESHLY PRESSED IS 5 AND A HALF YEARS OLD NOW. WHAT HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU?\nThe last five years has had some great highlights including getting featured in Monocle Magazine; a shout out about our Ernie socks by Peter Linz, who performs Ernie on Sesame Street; having our Singapore series socks worn by a group of ministers at NDP2018; and the chance to partner and collaborate with some amazing brands like Grab, UOB, Gamestart Asia, Sole Superior, and Mothercare. Most of all though, there’s a deep sense of satisfaction you get when someone willingly pays good money to buy something that you have made.\nWe’ve also been thankful to be able to be a part of World Down Syndrome Day with SG MINDS since 2016. An annual event happening on Mar 21 March each year, it is a day of global awareness that encourages people from all the world to come together to wear colourful socks to help raise public awareness of what Down syndrome is and how people with Down syndrome continue to play a vital role in our lives and communities.\nWHAT’S BEEN THE BEST-SELLING DESIGN?\nThe best-selling sock is Taro. We’ve had it since we’ve launched in 2015 and it has consistently been very popular. A close second would be our MRT sock, as well as our Buzz and Woody socks.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK SETS YOUR BRAND APART?\nWe would like to think it is our brand point of view as well as our approach to design.\nWe believe that socks are like your secret identity – that small detail on your outfit that reveals your hidden self to the world. As such, all of our socks are designed with details that reflect a character and story behind them. This is communicated on our website and on a character card that comes with every pair of socks.\nEach pair of socks is designed with a specific character or personality in mind which inspired by our love for art, nostalgia and popular culture. From a design standpoint, we also look at the different elements, like a specific icon or pattern at the ankle area that shows when you sit down and your pants lift up. We pay attention to the front of the socks that reveals when you take off your shoe, etc. And even if you don’t get the design hints and character references, it’s still a nicely designed pair of socks.\n\n\nHOW DIFFICULT WAS IT TO GET FRESHLY PRESSED ESTABLISHED? WHAT WERE SOME OF THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGES YOU GUYS FACED?\nI would say it wasn’t difficult to start the business. We live in an age now where technology is a great equalizer. You can find information on how to do just about anything online, get access to cost efficient software services to run your business – hosting, eCommerce, fulfilment, accounting, ERP – and use platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Google to promote your business and reach customers globally.\n\n\nHowever running your business does bring about other challenges like cash-flow and resource management. Making sure you are profitable and able to sustain and pay staff and suppliers is key and not always easy. Retail was something we weren’t familiar with and we had to learn a lot of things from the ground up. I would say a lot of the initial challenges and frustrations were a combination of our inexperience with retail and trying to figure out how to make this a sustainable business over time.\nDO YOU SEE FRESHLY PRESSED PERPETUALLY AS A SIDE BUSINESS OR DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO RUN IT FULL TIME?\nWe’ve discussed this. We’ve tried very briefly to run it as a full time business but I think the economies didn’t really make sense for the three of us in the current stages of our lives.\nAnd going back to why we started this, it was meant to be something we could experiment with and the financial pressure of making it work was taking that away. We’ve tried multiple modes of working and I think this current way where Freshly Pressed is an independent business that can run the day to day by itself whilst allowing us to work on parts of the business on the side remotely, while still having a creative outlet to do what we want and maintain our day jobs, seems to check the most boxes.\nHOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED THE BUSINESS?\nIt’s definitely been challenging. For one, we had to close during circuit breaker so that was almost two plus months where we could not sell because we were unable to access our office and warehouse premises as it was considered non-essential.\n\n\nAt the same time, a large part of our sales comes from overseas markets and the current situation with air travel has made the cost of international shipping prohibitively expensive and also problematic due to added delays and lost packages.\nThis meant that we had to cut back on a lot of our global marketing efforts as we cannot ship efficiently. This has affected our overall sales.\nWHAT’S THE FUTURE FOR FRESHLY PRESSED?\nAt the moment, Freshly Pressed is still a side business and creative platform that gives us a sandbox in which to learn, experiment and make different things.\nWe hope to be able to grow it slowly and sustainably over time so that it is able to run as an independent business. Ideally, this would then give us the flexibility to be able to do multiple things that feed our curiosity whilst generating a good passive income.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ']}"

      An ex-photographer’s surprising journey to create resort wear for James Bond
  </h1>, 'text': ""By the age of 40, many would expect themselves to have reached a comfortable place in life. This usually involves finally enjoying a career they’ve invested two decades in as they achieve a position of delegation and a paycheque with more zeroes.\nNot Adam Brown.\nAt 40 years old, he had already made one radical job change – from charity fundraiser to portrait photographer – and was about to make another. He was going to dive into fashion retail and give the men the swim shorts they deserved.\nBrown had been toying with the idea to start Orlebar Brown for about two years but it was after attending a friend’s birthday party in Rajasthan, where he had to change out of his swimming shorts to be allowed into a restaurant for lunch, that he decided it was time to actually do it.\n“Men’s swim shorts at the time were all baggy, voluminous, shapeless boxer shorts,” he told CNA Luxury via Zoom. “It was not celebrated as a standalone piece. It was just something you brought to go swimming, not something you packed to go somewhere fantastic.”\n\n\nA post shared by Orlebar Brown (@orlebarbrown) on Feb 17, 2020 at 2:03pm PST\nWith that conviction in mind, Brown went about capturing that mood of the suave, sartorial holiday-goer in his tailored swim shorts, and launched his brand online in 2007. Just two years in, the brand caught the attention of Selfridges, and the British department store cleaned out his stock.\n“That was the first time I knew we were going to be okay,” he recalled. “People were seeing the product, liking it and buying it.”\nOrlebar Brown is now doing much more than just “okay”, having expanded – logically – into resort wear, and setting up more than 20 physical stores across Europe, North America, West Asia and Australia. In 2018, Orlebar Brown was acquired by no less than Chanel to serve as a complement to the latter’s women’s swimwear line, Eres.\nThe secret to his success? Having an attitude as breezy as his ad campaigns.\nWhen asked what he’s had to give up in service of his business, he shrugged: “I didn’t go out last Thursday? Honestly nothing comes to mind. If you start something it’s because you enjoy it. I was 40 years old when I decided to do this. My career wasn’t going anywhere, I didn’t have any money, so I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Now I’m not doing anything that makes me sad so I don’t see any of this as a sacrifice.”\nYou’ve probably inferred from his past jobs that he’s had no prior fashion or retail experience going into Orlebar Brown. People, understandably, laughed at his idea in the beginning, but none of it fazed him one bit.\n“You just get on with it,” he said simply.\n“I was 40 years old when I decided to do this. My career wasn’t going anywhere, I didn’t have any money, so I had nothing to lose and everything to gain.” – Adam Brown\nAnd on with it he got: He enrolled himself in a week-long drawing course at London’s renowned Central Saint Martins, followed by a three-day business course at Portobello Business Centre, found a factory and a fabrics supplier and started the company out of a spare room in his flat.\n“It’s not rocket science. You make a product, get it in a store, give your brand a personality with a well-crafted story and hope that you can engage the customer in those two seconds they see your product.”\nThere are entrepreneurs who don’t shy away from talking about their journey’s biggest pitfalls, whether it’s working out of their cars, fending off lawsuits or nearly bankrupting their businesses – because the glory is in the comeback, in the overcoming.\nBut it’s a slightly different story for Brown, not just because he grew up travelling the world and going on enough yachting holidays with his family to inspire several collections. It’s also because Brown stubbornly refuses to see his missteps as mistakes. “There have been no low points. Only learning,” he declared.\nYet he’s not blind to his previous lapses in judgments. “When you’re starting a business it’s like you’ve got a blank sheet of paper and you find yourself wanting to say yes to everything, but you have to say no,” he said. “For three- to four years I got very distracted doing things I shouldn’t have.”\n“When you’re starting a business it’s like you’ve got a blank sheet of paper and you find yourself wanting to say yes to everything, but you have to say no.” – Adam Brown\nHe refers to the time Orlebar Brown dabbled in women’s swimwear, long before Chanel entered the picture with Eres.\n“It cost us a lot of time and money but am I pleased we did it? Of course. We learned how to prioritise, met with factories we wouldn’t have met before, and thought about how to include women in our brand’s journey. [One quarter] of our customers today are women who buy for men. So these are all things we wouldn’t have thought about otherwise,” he explained.\n“I’ve also signed leases that were wrong, put up pictures that were wrong and made products that were wrong,” continued Brown. “But I don’t focus on the things that went wrong. Ultimately the goal is to always move forwards.”\nThat clarity of vision is what led him to far-reaching partnerships. After Daniel Craig’s 007 was seen wearing a pair of Orlebar Brown swim shorts in Skyfall, an opportunity for further collaboration blossomed, resulting in two limited-edition series of Bond film-themed shorts and resort wear.\n\n\n The name's Brown... Orlebar Brown. The wait is finally over! Our limited-edition @007 Heritage Collection is now available to discover & shop. In collaboration with EON Productions, the collection takes inspiration from James Bond's most iconic outfits, modernised with a few sleek tweaks of our own. Shop via our link in bio ��⤴️ #007 #JamesBond #OrlebarBrown #OBsAroundTheWorld\nA post shared by  Orlebar Brown (@orlebarbrown) on Jun 10, 2020 at 7:41am PDT\nThe third instalment, now available on the Orlebar Brown website, was inspired by past James Bond movies that had notable resort, pool or beach scenes like On Her Majesty’s Secret Service and Thunderball.\nOrlebar Brown has even reached as far as the world of haute horlogerie, after IWC got in touch with Brown for a collaboration. Launching together with the IWC Portugieser Yacht Club Chronograph Edition “Orlebar Brown” is a nine-piece capsule collection of resort wear.\nThis is the first time Brown has worked with a watchmaker, after turning down requests from two other watchmakers before because of a difference in values. With IWC, the synergy was evident.\n“You can’t just have one party do all the talking. Christian (Knoop, IWC’s creative director) was very involved with the clothing, from the texture, colour tones, trim and even the weight of the fabrics. They were also very respectful of our feedback on the watch, where we discussed colour options for the straps, the placement of the red detailing, the colour of the case and so on.”\nIWC has also partnered with Solaris Yachts at the beginning of the year to build a custom sailing yacht named the Double Moon, and Orlebar Brown will be taking care of the textiles in the interior cabins.\n“We’re starting to make our way into the Far East and South America, as well as considering other product categories like accessories, luggage and even skincare. Because why not? Why couldn’t Orlebar Brown do a line of sun care products or expand the types of footwear we offer to accommodate different kinds of holidays?

      Expert view: How luxury brands should engage customers in the post-pandemic era
  </h1>, 'text': ""To adapt to the new normal of working from home, some people buy ergonomic chairs, while others set up extra computer screens. Gianfranco Casati, chief executive office of Accenture in growth markets, “made an investment” in a large backdrop depicting Singapore’s stunning Marina Bay skyline which he sits in front of during video calls.\n“This gives my colleagues the perception that I am sitting on my terrace overlooking Marina Bay, which is not actually the case,” he said with a chuckle. This glitzy backdrop, which separates his desk from the rest of his home, is not just a conversation starter for online meetings; it has allowed Casati to keep his business running efficiently during these challenging times.\n“I did this to ensure I have work and personal space to keep the balance because we’re doing this for months,” said the Singapore-based Casati, who has management oversight for all industries and services of Accenture’s business in the Asia-Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, which accounted for US$8.5 billion (S$11.8 billion) in revenues for the fiscal year 2019.\nSimilarly, smart pivots – whether on a small scale like what he has done or on larger industry-wide scales – across all fields will be essential for businesses hoping to stay afloat in these times. This is especially important for luxury companies that pride themselves on offering customers an experience that is a cut above the norm, he added.\nCasati shared his insights on how the luxury industry should be transforming their businesses.\nHOW HAVE LUXURY SPENDING PATTERNS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC?\nWe did a specific deep-dive in Singapore as we see Singapore as quite a proxy of consumer behaviours when it comes to the way consumers regard luxury goods in this situation. We have seen an increase of luxury goods purchases online in a way which has been actually quite material but these haven't been able to offset the loss of sales in the traditional channels.\nAlso traditionally, there used to be a direct correlation between luxury goods and travel because a substantial part of sales is associated with tourists who spend when they have leisure time. That is a big driver of sales in big malls in Hong Kong, China, Japan and Singapore. This has completely decoupled. It is something that luxury brands have to reflect on going forward.\n\n\nSHOULD THE INDUSTRY BE PLACING HOPE ON THE CONCEPT OF “REVENGE SPENDING”?\nWhen living in a difficult situation, some people may wish to pamper themselves such as by ordering food from premium restaurants or by gifting somebody something they would normally not consider. It is a way of reacting to the “misery” of the [circumstances].\nSo yes, there may be some revenge spending. But in my opinion, we should not overplay that because it is not going to be an enduring element and companies need to think of something else to sustain spending.\n“There may be some revenge spending. But… we should not overplay that because it is not going to be an enduring element and companies need to think of something else to sustain spending.”\n\n\nAS SAFE DISTANCING RULES GRADUALLY RELAX, WILL THIS BE A DRAW FOR PEOPLE TO HEAD OUT MORE OFTEN?\nForty per cent of consumers we surveyed after the easing of circuit breaker rules say they are still uncomfortable to go back to the traditional retail experience.\nWe believe it will take time to return to normal, so omni-channel experiences will be vital to luxury brands, because they will have to complement the physical and digital in order to continue to fulfil their customers’ expectations.\nHOW CAN LUXURY INDUSTRIES BETTER CATER TO CUSTOMERS IN THE DIGITAL SPACE?\nCustomer engagement is going to be crucial to many sectors in the luxury space and combining the offline and online customer experience will be of fundamental importance.\nFor example, the wellness industry could have face-to-face sessions followed by virtual sessions to continue their level of engagement with customers in an extended fashion. Through this evolution of dialogue and relationship, companies can provide the luxury experience that customers are looking for.\n“Customer engagement is going to be crucial to many sectors in the luxury space and combining the offline and online customer experience will be of fundamental importance.”\nARE THERE ANY FORMS OF CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY THAT CONSUMERS CAN LOOK FORWARD TO?\nVirtual reality is something that will become part of the broader set of tools that companies will have to invest in to build relationships with their clients.\nFor example, in the sector of furniture and furniture design, augmented or virtual reality could give you an idea of what your room or apartment would look like with a new item.\nOr you might be able to “try” on apparel in different styles and colours without leaving your room and in the space of minutes instead of hours. These developments would drive incremental sales, so it is likely that this technology may\xa0 evolve more rapidly.\n“Virtual reality is something that will become part of the broader set of tools that companies will have to invest in to build relationships with their clients.”\nWHAT ELSE WILL LUXURY BRANDS WANT TO FOCUS ON TO STAY RELEVANT?\nIt is not necessarily just digital investments but also investments that create a sense of purpose and identity to establish themselves as responsible businesses.\nConsumers are becoming more sensitive to values such as being environmentally friendly and socially responsible, especially after the pandemic. So how brands will evolve in this space and how fast they can do it would determine how much success they will enjoy in the near future.\nAnother aspect that luxury brands may want to do is to increase the visibility of their iconic products. For example a Chanel or Hermes handbag are iconic products but they are iconic typically to only a limited number of consumers. So telling the story of these products and making these stories available to a wider range of people can help to create a better awareness of the brands.\n“Consumers are becoming more sensitive to values such as being environmentally friendly and socially responsible, especially after the pandemic.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Wellness ', '     Beauty ', '     Skincare ', '     F&B ', '     business ', '     Profiles ', '     Opinions ']}"

      Why are fashion brands still staging physical shows, despite the risk of COVID-19?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Milan’s first allegedly “digital” fashion week ended last Friday. I say allegedly, because despite hurrah-ing the online future of the catwalk, Etro and Dolce & Gabbana both hosted physical shows, attended by a smattering of press, influencers and local celebrities.\nThen, for some of those same attendees, it was a drive of several hours to a region north-west of Paris to watch a bucolic out-of-season show by the young French designer Simon Porte Jacquemus, staged in a field of wheat – a loaded symbol of prosperity and renewal.\n\n\nA post shared by JACQUEMUS (@jacquemus) on Jul 17, 2020 at 1:04pm PDT\nWith fashion heading back to not-so-basic shows of several hundred people watching several dozen models, it all felt like business as usual.\nExcept, of course, it isn’t. Economies are tanking, luxury takings are down and fashion brands are closing stores and cutting staff, and as of Friday face coverings while shopping in the UK will be mandatory. Which is why there was something not only incongruous but downright disconcerting about seeing designers attempting to keep calm and catwalk on.\nWhile the fashion business should continue – as a US$2.5 trillion (S$3.46 trillion) global industry employing some 890,000 people in the UK alone, it must – it feels wrong for shows to carry on as if nothing were happening. Many hastened to add that social distancing was in place for the audience, but looking at the waving ears of wheat backdropping Jacquemus’s wandering figures, I kept thinking of the cramped spaces traditionally allotted to models, hair and make-up artists and dressers labouring to assemble looks. Not to mention the cars ferrying those people, and the audience, back and forth.\nThe show Etro staged in Milan was even more disconcerting: It was in the interior courtyard of the Four Seasons Hotel, a space I know and one that, though lovely (and open-air), is undeniably contained. It felt, if not unsafe, then unnecessary.\n\n\nA post shared by ETRO (@etro) on Jul 15, 2020 at 10:40am PDT\nDomenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana\xa0took inspiration\xa0for their menswear show\xa0from\xa0the Parco dei Principi hotel in Sorrento, designed in 1960 by Gio Ponti, and there was a kind of mid-century, mid-tempo, “Jackie Kennedy having an affair with an Italian poorboy” vibe to their mostly Mediterranean blue, predominantly printed and highly saleable offerings.\nAs opposed to Etro or Jacquemus, this show, at least, had a stated point other than hawking clobber: Since February, Dolce and Gabbana have been financing a study at Milan’s Humanitas University on COVID-19. This time, they stated they would donate a part of the income from e-commerce sales of a handbag, and double donations made via a crowdfunding platform. The workers on the show also donated their time for free,\xa0and the university was the venue.\nThat, at least, has an element of altruism. But, given the prospect of second spikes and the continuing need for citizens to maintain distance and sport masks, clustering people together – even outdoors – to watch a bunch of unmasked models swaggering about feels foolhardy. It simply doesn’t feel like the moment for these images.\nBut besides all that, it feels reductive for designers to immediately stumble back into the same old means of showing fashion – especially when none of us knows what the future will bring. And, indeed, when we do know that we can’t all socially distance outside at shows in Europe in January without succumbing to frostbite. Shouldn’t that give an impetus to designer brands to investigate and invest in new and sustainable means of communicating their message?\nMiuccia Prada did just that. She surrendered her clothes – comprising her final collections before those created in partnership with Raf Simons, which will be unveiled, in some way, in Milan in September – to other creatives. A quintet of artists and photographers – Willy Vanderperre, Juergen Teller, Joana Piotrowska, Martine Syms and Terence Nance – created individual films, entirely divorced from one another in style.\n\n\n @WillyVanderperre on creating Chapter 1 of #PradaMultipleViews, the show that never happened: ""Prada evolves and changes every season, this season, the part we were shooting and filming felt like an honest collection. Stripped from fashion ideas, which turns that idea into fashion again. It also felt introspective and slightly schizophrenic. A look into the past with the future ahead. I hope that the audience feels that in the movie, a distilled pure and honest presentation of the collection."" Watch the full show on IGTV or prada.com. #PradaSS21\nA post shared by  Prada (@prada) on Jul 14, 2020 at 6:06am PDT\nIt actually reminded me of those good old-fashioned fashion shows, where afterwards you talk to the person who was seated alongside and marvel at their entirely different point of view. Although here, with each artist showcasing different cinematography, music, models and ultimately intention – it was like five fashion shows in one.\nThe clothes, however, remained constant, and were great – a reminder of 1990s Prada: Skinny silhouettes in tech fabrics, unadorned and streamlined, minimally coloured, “an antidote to useless complication”, Prada said – not complication as a whole, just the pointless stuff. It felt as if she was really drilling down into the essence of what Prada means, both for her and for the history books.\nAnd she’s about to rip it apart with an outside pair of eyes. So, regardless of pandemics, lockdowns and alternative ways of showing, this was a fascinating moment to examine Prada.\nThe collection was also commercially savvy. It was a bunch of great tailoring, slick black coats, party dresses that managed to avoid being brainless or off-brand, and a single, simple handbag. The message was direct and pure, which – in times of “useless complication” – is exactly what you want.\nThere was also something simple and pure to what Alessandro Sartori did at Ermenegildo Zegna: It was the best collection he has shown for the brand, integrating his interest in twisting and evolving tailoring with the often diametrical opposite aim of dressing real men. There was something modern to his ideas of soft, gently coloured tailoring, mostly worn over collarless shirts or silky T-shirts, more often than not with trousers and jacket mismatched.\nSartori’s accompanying film for Zegna was great: It showed men (they were models, but didn’t look like it) striding through the Italian countryside, kicking up dust, on their way to Zegna’s manufacturing base in Trivero, Piedmont. It had an appealing directness – making you want to buy the clothes and go running up that Piedmontese hill. The Italian tourism office should be paying Sartori a royalty.\nHe dubbed the show “phygital”, a fairly obvious portmanteau word, because part of the footage was pre-filmed and some recorded live. In a preview, I asked Sartori if an audience would be present for the live portion, and he blanched. There were 30 models and a whittled-down crew of 40 – the maximum the space would permit. He had worked within those limits to create something special for the moment.\nAlessandro Michele’s Gucci presentation had a similar feel. His clothes were shot as a lookbook, worn by his design team – and if people sometimes sneer at the designers proposing strange and archaic costumes as fashion when they themselves sport black sweaters and trainers, the Gucci crew were the perfect riposte. Of course, they were dolled up for a means to an end, but it did feel natural.\nMichele showed his collection not in a 15-minute video but over a 12-hour livestream on Friday, during which the advertising campaign was shot. About halfway through, the photographs of the collection – of checked and geometric printed coats, of florid 70s-style floral dresses and shirts, and plenty of Gucci-logo canvas on hats, bags and shoes – flashed up on screen in retro-seeming Windows 95-ish frames “like a Peeping Tom”, said Michele.\nIt sounds like one of Miuccia Prada’s useless complications but it actually felt easy, engaging and relevant. I wound up watching the livestream of people flitting around the garden of a grand Roman palazzo for an hour or so – and in these strange times, being able to hold someone’s attention for any period feels like a major achievement.\nBy Alexander Fury © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Men ', '     COVID-19 ', '     coronavirus ', '     Pandemic ', '     Milan ', '     Italy ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Was digital couture week worth the fuss, straining already-tight fashion budgets?
  </h1>, 'text': 'On the Friday before the first all-digital haute couture week, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri dialled into a Zoom conference call from Dior’s Paris headquarters and took questions from members of the British press.\nIt was a happy, if strange, reunion: Fashion weeks are a trade event, yes; but they are also fun, glamorous and exciting, a time when a large cross-section of the industry gets to dress up, exchange gossip, and marvel at clients’ matching Birkins and fresh botox injections. Wonderful as it was to tune in to this week’s shows from home in sweatpants, that fizz of excitement was missing.\nChiuri, for her part, was at ease, perched on a stool in a casual white T-shirt and trousers. On her left was a preview of her new couture collection, which would make its official debut via a 15-minute online video on Monday.\nThe clothes – delicate Fortuny dresses and ball gowns in champagne silk and lilac feathers, a molded woolen Bar jacket and skirt – were typical of Chiuri’s oeuvre for Dior. What was not typical was their size: These were doll clothes, fitted to mannequins measuring only about two feet tall. They were a reference to the 1945 Theatre de la Mode, a travelling fashion exhibition involving 60 French designers and more than 200 dolls so exquisitely dressed they were credited with reestablishing Paris as the world’s fashion capital after the second world war.\nWar, pandemic – the parallels are obvious. But beyond providing a thematic link, Dior’s dolls were also presented as a practical solution: They can easily traverse borders at a time when clients can’t. “We can travel with this around the world,” said Chiuri, referring to a set of three painted trunks, beautifully modelled after the brand’s Avenue Montaigne headquarters. They will soon make their way to Shanghai and New York, accompanied by fabric swatches and toiles so that clients can be fitted for their one-of-a-kind, hand-sewn garments without flying to Paris.\n\n\nWelcome to fashion week’s new normal: Where live shows have been replaced by pre-recorded videos, and £50,000 (S$88,000) dresses are sold to customers via travelling dolls.\nIf that sounds a little outlandish, well, it is. Since the arrival of coronavirus, the £1.2 trillion fashion and luxury industries have had to grapple with a crisis of unprecedented global scale: Supply chains splintered, orders cancelled, stores boarded-up, the evaporation of the feel-good factor that leads shoppers to splash out on luxury.\nYet fashion weeks have gone on – albeit sometimes postponed, and presented entirely online. Thirty-four brands participated in the first London Digital Fashion Week in June, despite a lack of actual new clothes to show; the organisers of Paris couture week were able to round up enough designers to deliver three days’ worth of videos, delivered hourly. Some showed new, smaller collections; others released sketches, or earnest short-length documentaries extolling the value of hand-embroidery.\nWas digital couture week worth the fuss, the strain on already-tightened budgets? The videos, for the most part, were dull or confusing, resembling film trailers or perfume adverts, and lacking in narrative. The clothes themselves were difficult to see, obscured by studio lights, heavy splicing and poor video quality. Without the live element, there was none of that heady anticipation. There was also no need to release the videos once per hour – in the future, fashion week organisers might take a cue from Netflix and release all that pre-recorded content on-demand.\nUltimately, the recordings did little to bolster brand equity – the real point of haute couture week.\nStill, there were worthy attempts. Four designers not often seen on camera – Guo Pei, the Chinese designer behind the extravagant yellow dress Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2015; Rahul Mishra, the only Indian designer on-schedule; former Sonia Rykiel artistic director Julie de Libran; and British designer Tamara Ralph of Ralph & Russo – took a cue from designers at Shanghai Fashion Week and used the opportunity to speak directly to the public about their process.\nThere tends to be a seriousness, a reverent hush around couture, which is why Dutch designers Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren of Viktor & Rolf’s show was such a welcome change of pace. They injected humour both into their designs, which featured emoticons and dressing gowns, and in their presentation – a simple but effective parody of the salon-style couture shows of the 1950s.\nBig brands with big budgets certainly had the advantage of the week. Dior released a 15-minute, feature-quality film on Monday afternoon that was magical to behold. Directed by the decorated Italian filmmaker Matteo Garrone and inspired by Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the film followed a pair of liveried porters as they carried a trunk of dolls, dressed in Dior couture, through an enchanted glade inhabited by nymphs, dryads and satyrs. Mesmerised by the dresses, nymphs crawled forward to touch them; stone statues became mobile; a dryad untangled herself from her lover.\nBut however gorgeous the production, it ultimately did a disservice to the Dior brand by featuring only white models. As the scenes were inspired by the Italian painter Sandro Boticelli, to cast diverse models would have been “forced”, Garrone said. There was also an uncomfortable scene where a nymph looked to her satyr-partner for permission to order a dress. For a brand that has positioned itself as a champion of feminism, it was a bewildering misstep.\nOne brand that could have gone all-out on a video – but didn’t – was Chanel. Creative director Virginie Viard shot her new collection on a handful of punkish-looking models against a simple studio backdrop. As a performance it underwhelmed, but the clothes were fun and spirited, inspired by Karl Lagerfeld’s salad days partying at the Le Palace night club in the Eighties. All ruffled taffeta and metallic tweed, they seemed just the thing to dress up in after months of austerity.\n\n\nBut the show that deserved the most praise wasn’t part of the haute couture schedule at all. On Sunday afternoon, designer Veronique Nichanian and director Cyril Teste debuted Hermes’s new men’s collection: A meticulously choreographed performance that gave viewers a glimpse of what fashion shows typically look like backstage. The film was shot and streamed live, lending a dramatic tension that was missing elsewhere. With its long shots and careful lighting, it also showed the clothes to great advantage.\nIt was perhaps the first fashion show as interesting to watch online as in person, setting a bar for other brands to measure against.\n\n\nBalmain, too, showed live and off-schedule, streaming on TikTok a performance from French singer Yseult and a gaggle of models dancing on a boat floating down the Seine. While plagued by somewhat unglamorous connectivity issues, designer Olivier Rousteing’s willingness to risk a live performance to connect with his many social media fans was applaudable.\nOne hopes to see more of it. While brands are eager to return to regular fashion weeks in September, the pandemic has presented a rare opportunity to finally crack digital video.\nIt’s about time. Fashion shows are no longer private events but public-facing ones; digital, not live, audiences should be the priority.\nIt is a challenge with inherent risks; few are the brands willing to gamble their brand equity on a marketing experiment. But as Hermes showed, when it’s done right, the results can be fantastic.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Paris ', '     Luxury Looks ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Know your fashion: The unofficial love story behind Chanel’s famous logo
  </h1>, 'text': 'Chanel’s logo is undeniably one of the most successful stories in the history of fashion branding.\xa0\nWomen, from adolescents to the sophisticated, long to wear anything with those interlocking Cs while men of all ages try to impress with gifts bearing that instantly recognisable symbol.\nAnd while many think those two Cs stand for the initials of the brand’s founder Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel (Coco being the pet name given by her father), that’s not quite the whole truth.\nSo just how did these Cs come about? Believe it or not, it may have to do with either a sacred place or a love story.\n\n\nAccording to the French marque, Chanel designed the interlocking Cs in 1925 as a homage to a monastery in Aubazine, France, where she spent most of her childhood. The French designer was said to have been inspired by the geometric patterns of stained glass windows in the chapel at the monastery. \xa0\nThere is, however, an unofficial version of the origins of those interlocking Cs that tugs at Chanel’s heartstring. The\xa0exceedingly romantic tale\xa0has to do with a completely different phase in Chanel’s long and colourful life – specifically, her romance with English aristocrat Arthur “Boy” Capel.\nChanel’s love affair with Capel lasted a total of nine years. He shared her equine passion and is believed to be Chanel’s one true love. Her handsome and wealthy lover funded her first millinery on Rue Cambon in Paris (the store opened in 1910) and a ready-to-wear boutique in Deauville three years later.\xa0\nHaving found her footing in the glamorous world of fashion, she then went on to register a Couture house in Rue Cambon, before opening a “pour le sport” (for sports) boutique in Biarritz.\nCapel died tragically in a traffic accident in 1919. His sudden departure devastated his fashionable French lover. Chanel later confided in her friend Paul Morand, “His death was a terrible blow to me. In losing Capel, I lost everything.”\xa0\nThis admission led some to believe that the interlocking Cs developed six years after his death was a nod to their heart-wrenching love affair.\nChanel was certainly not the only influential woman then to use the emblem of interlocking Cs as her symbol. French royals including Queen Claude of France and Catherine de Medici’s royal insignias were made up of double Cs. But it was Chanel who would go on to become a worldwide sensation.\n\n\nHer logo of interlocking Cs became symbolic of the changing times. On the style front, she famously freed women from wearing corsets – in the 1920s, she introduced the Little Black Dress to the fashion world, solidifying her status as one of the foremost French fashion designer.\nChanel continued to push boundaries with her iconic brand of avant garde garcon style. Blurring gender lines, she turned the rules of womenswear on its head by incorporating elements of menswear.\xa0\nThrough her deft designs, she offered women a taste of wearing pants, stiff white collar and starched cuffs. She appropriated tweed that was once considered a very masculine fabric, and turned it into a chic and accessible women’s jacket. She moved hemlines up to flaunt skin.\xa0\nWhat’s noteworthy is that, as experimental as each of her moves were back then, she rewrote the rules without compromising the dignity of women. There was an undeniable air of elegance that accompanied every ballsy step she took.\n\n\nRebels with a cause identified with her refreshingly different aesthetics. The design revolution she championed had nothing to do with shock value – instead it was aimed at freeing women from traditional sartorial shackles. Chanel was the catalyst for changing the way women dressed, championing the concept of getting dressed for comfort and practicality.\nYears after her death – she died in 1971, at age 88, in her bed at the very swanky Hotel Ritz – those mesmerising interlocking Cs continue\xa0to stand for the very same fundamentals\xa0Chanel held dear –\xa0confident and current. And you wonder why women and the men continue to be spellbound by this hypnotic logo?\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      The phantom handbag: Are they still relevant – or even appropriate – now?  
  </h1>, 'text': 'I feel it sometimes, like a phantom limb, banging against my side as I move around the house. I sense it nestled in the crook of my arm as I wander from room to room. It was the onetime receptacle of all I held immediately important: Purse, receipts, identification, charger, books, tissues (fresh and used), flask, tampons, a card for that delicious but inexpensive Italian restaurant from that one time a few months back.\nWhat was it? My surprisingly roomy yet somehow streamlined handbag, of course.\nMy bag of choice was black leather with gold hardware, made by Balenciaga, bought on sale. Once upon a time I didn’t leave the house without it. Now, of course, because of COVID-19, I no longer really leave the house. I haven’t carried my bag for months.\nMasks are the accessory of the moment, if one is looking to define such a thing. The tote (or clutch or saddle bag) seems a relic of ages past, gathering dust in bedroom corners and closet shelves. But is this a permanent change in our wardrobe? Or will the bag live again?\nAna Kinsella, a freelance copywriter in London, has relied on her pockets for most of her daily lockdown walks, or the occasional canvas tote for gathering supplies.\n“In my pre-coronavirus life, my handbag wasn’t so much a way to carry things around as a way to keep things together,” she said. Lockdown has brought about the inverse; that constantly accumulated junk is scattered with abandon around the home, rather than stuffed in one place. “I now have no idea where anything is,” she added.\nKinsella recalled being drunk after a late-night Zoom bachelorette party, for which she had dressed up, and walking to the end of her road for a cigarette. On the way out she picked up her fanciest bag, a small, bright orange leather satchel, despite not actually needing it.\n“I thought, ‘I owe it to the outfit to have a handbag with me, even if no one is there to see it,’” she said.\nKatie Hillier knows leather goods better than most, having worked as the creative director of Marc by Marc Jacobs and consulted for an array of luxury brands. Her work at the former British brand Luella, beginning in 1999, was part of what helped kick off the “It” bag movement of the early 2000s.\n“It always used to be about the work tote,” Hillier said. “What is that now? The work-from-home tote is your backpack, or the bag that fits on your bike, or the bag that you take to the market or the grocery store or on the march.”\nShe observed that, throughout lockdown, people have been finessing the minutiae of their routines – the preferred shopping route, the ideal outdoor workout – and will most likely now shop with these in mind. “Functionally is going to be even more important than it ever was before,” she said.\nShe predicts a market for inventive canvas shoppers, lined in something waterproof, or cross body bags with adjustable straps for hiking or cycling – “geeky stuff like that.”\nAlready, the luxury retailer MatchesFashion.com has seen a boost in sales of “functional lifestyle styles such as canvas totes” such as Rue De Verneuil, whose structured canvas bags cost over US$200 (S$278), said Cassie Smart, head of womenswear buying for MatchesFashion.\nHillier said she thought future bag purchases would be “less about bags as a status thing.”\n“Some people may have realised that they actually enjoy being at home,” she continued, “and that there are other things that they can spend their money on.”\nWith stores closed, fashion and accessories sales have plunged by 35 to 39 per cent, according to a recent report from McKinsey, and some of the money that might normally have gone on bags has, over the last few months, been allocated to bikes. (In March, nationwide US sales of bicycles and related services nearly doubled compared with the same period last year, according to the NPD Group.) Large leather bags are impractical for cycling: Anything too long swings forward and lodges between the legs, making peddling difficult, while shoulder styles risk slipping down.\nHandbags are also unhelpful at protests, which have swelled globally. For most attendees at the recent demonstrations, backpacks or fanny bags were omnipresent.\nIn various cities, as protesters marched past luxury stores, there were also few handbags to be seen. Nervous of the unrest, Gucci, Chloe, Louis Vuitton and others had removed stock, their usually bombastic window displays stripped bare. When, in late May, despite the spreading unrest, Vuitton opted to unleash a widespread influencer campaign for their new bag, the LV Pont 9, the move was criticised on social media as tone-deaf.\nThe question of appropriateness is paramount. Typically, bags have been a financial crutch for fashion brands, propping up ready-to-wear sales, and, thanks to their logos, serving as a form of advertising. Whether this will remain true given the recession and the related shift in attitudes toward big business and wealth inequality is debatable.\n“I think people are becoming quite confused about what they should buy and what they shouldn’t buy,” said Hillier. “They are thinking about where materials came from, whether they are eco.” She predicts people will be keen to “shop to support,” saving their money for brands that share their values.\nCase in point: Tree Fairfax, a small independent label based in Virginia, whose handmade leather goods, designed, the website says, for “moving around lightly,” received numerous shout-outs on social media in the recent drive to promote Black-owned businesses.\nBut when contacted to discuss the effect of the current moment on handbag trends, the brand’s owner, Tricia Hash, replied that she was too exhausted by racism, and too worried about her son who was still working as a delivery driver without personal protective equipment, to talk about leather goods. Which seemed exactly the point.\nLater, keen to remember what had once felt so important, I took my former favourite bag for a walk around the house. We meandered from living room to bedroom and back again. After weeks of living bagless, hands-free, my swag weighing down my bicycle basket rather than my shoulders, I was transported back to a time of commutes, rushing, air travel, post-work drinks, and a laptop ensconced in leather beneath the table. Suddenly, it all felt so heavy.\nBy Lou Stoppard © 2020 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Trending ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'Ifeoma Ubby, Ify to her friends, is an unlikely fashion entrepreneur. Not because she isn’t incredibly stylish or striking – she is both of these things. But because the young founder of OliveAnkara is a molecular biologist with a doctorate in genetics.\nOliveAnkara was launched here in Singapore in 2017, while Ify was completing post-doctoral strudies with the National Cancer Centre. Since last year, she has been focused full-time on this exciting clothing and accessories marque that is introducing African fabrics and designs into the local and regional fashion scene.\n\n\nOliveAnkara was also one of the first local brands to produce face masks, something that, Ify has said, has helped keep the company afloat during the pandemic.\nHI, IFY. I UNDERSTAND YOU FIRST MOVED TO SINGAPORE BECAUSE YOU WERE INVOLVED IN CANCER RESEARCH.\nYes, I have a degree in Molecular Biotechnology, and after graduation I decided to embark on a journey in scientific research. I was awarded a PhD grant to join Scuola Normale di Pisa, one of the most prestigious universities in the scientific world, where I studied Human Molecular Genetics for four years. At the end of my PhD I wanted to continue with academia and research, and wanted to try an experience overseas. I applied for a few positions all around the world but the most interesting project was here in Singapore. I was offered a postdoc at NCCS (National Cancer Centre) in Molecular Carcinogenesis with Professor Kanaga Sabapathy to study the mutations of P-53 gene, and I decided to go for it. It was April 2013 when I moved to Singapore, and I finished my postdoc at NCCS in January 2019. It was an amazing experience! Along the way, I started OliveAnakara as a side project in 2017, and now it’s my life and passion. I’m fully focused on OliveAnakara these days.\nYOU GREW UP MOSTLY IN ITALY? WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?\nI have to say that growing up as a black girl in a small village near Venice, where 99.9 per cent of the people were white, has been nothing but good for me, and also for my sister. That may be surprising. But we never faced a single case of racism that I can recall. My family and I were fully accepted in the community as if we were 100 per cent Italian. Probably the fact that dad was a renowned architect and mum was a cultural mediator, and both were involved in local activities, helped a lot. Also, in the early 80s, the Nigerian community didn’t have all the negative connotations it has nowadays.\nDO YOU ACTUALLY FEEL MORE ITALIAN OR NIGERIAN? OR ARE YOU CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN?\nAccording to my husband, I got the worst traits of both cultures! Jokes aside, I really feel 50/50.\nAs a kid, I probably felt more Italian because I was constantly surrounded by that people and that culture. As I grew older, I kind of reconnected with my roots and now I feel the importance of both equally.\n\n\nWHAT WERE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF SINGAPORE WHEN YOU MOVED HERE?\nI decided to move here focusing mostly on my scientific career, so, to be honest, expectations were not really a thing. I had a friend who had moved here the year before me and he was enthusiastic about Singapore. My husband and I didn’t really know Asia so we came with open mind and a lot of curiosity. Our initial plan was to spend a couple of years here and then maybe go somewhere else. After seven years, we are still here and we are not planning to go anywhere else! We found a place to call home and we really love Singapore.\xa0\nTELL ME ABOUT THE CREATIVE SPARK THAT CATALYSED THE BIRTH OF OLIVEANKARA.\nAs often happens, the idea of OliveAnkara was born because I found a gap that needed to be filled. It was 2016 and I was looking for African fabrics to make a traditional Nigerian wedding gown for myself. I looked around and couldn’t find any in Singapore. So I decided to get some fabrics from Africa. I ended up designing and sewing my gown myself. After that, I made some other garments for myself, and received a lot of compliments. So I made a few for some friends. The response was so good and I realised that I was very passionate about it, so I decided to create a small capsule collection and started OliveAnkara. That was back in July 2017.\xa0 From what I could tell, we were the first cool African-inspired brand in town. And while I started the brand as an “experiment”, I finally decided to fully commit to it after realising it’s my true passion.\nHOW DID YOU LAUNCH OLIVEANKARA?\nI wasn’t an expert in marketing or brand launches so I simply created an Instagram page. I asked some friends to help with pictures and photoshoots and sent emails to a list of media and bloggers given us by a friend. Then I rented a gallery space in Bussorah Street and did a week-long pop-up. After the pop-up, based on the very positive outcome, my husband and I decided to create a website and started to do more pop-ups and take part in markets.\nHOW WERE YOUR PRODUCTS INITIALLY RECEIVED?\nThere was a lot of interest and curiosity. People were very curious to know the stories and histories behind the fabrics. Consumer education became really crucial. Many people here don’t know anything about the origins and significance of the African fabrics we use. Also, the type of cotton and the dye methods are very different from everything else you see around. There are some similarities with Indonesian batik. Being able to use batik as a familiar reference helped us to explain better what we do and how it’s done.\nI LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU DO CHEONGSAMS. IS MIXING CULTURES SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU AND THE BRAND?\nYes, absolutely. Mixing cultures is a crucial part. We do it with cheongsams but also with what we call Afromonos — kimonos made with African fabrics. And we plan to do it more as we move forward. My history itself is a mix: I was born in Italy, my blood is Nigerian and I made Asia my home. I want to translate my story in my creations and I am grateful for the rich inspiration that Asia is giving me.\nWHAT ARE YOUR BESTSELLING ITEMS?\nAt the moment, in these crazy times, our face masks are trending and surely our bestsellers. COVID-19 aside though, there is no real bestseller because we keep changing designs and prints, but two categories that sell very well are our infinity dresses — also called convertible dresses — and our jumpsuits.\nI LOVE THAT YOU PIVOTED AND WERE ONE OF THE FIRST LOCAL FASHION BRANDS TO COME OUT WITH FACE MASKS.\nActually I made some face masks for some friends a while back, way before COVID-19 was seen as a threat in late January. But back then I had very mixed feelings. Part of me felt that it was inappropriate to create a fashion accessory out of a tool used in crisis or when unwell. When the pandemic got worse, I decided to start producing a few masks for sale. I started making them at home using off-cuts of our fabrics. They began to sell so fast that I asked our tailors, who by then had to close their shops, to help us sew masks. We also decided to donate 10 per cent of the proceeds to local charities. It is important to give back to the community and help people who are not as lucky and safe as we are. In a way, we were also helping our tailors by giving them some work. And, of course, the revenue helped us survive after we were forced to close our shop for two months.\nThe masks are still selling very well. They have been received with great enthusiasm and people seem to love them. In general, the pandemic has affected us a lot, but luckily we were already present online, so we just had to focus more on the e-commerce and the sales of the masks. Business is constantly growing despite the pandemic, so we cannot complain!\nWHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS?\nOur customers are curious, open-minded, love colours and are not afraid to wear something bold. They are mostly women aged between 25 and 50. We do have some unisex pieces and a line for kids but the majority of our customers are women. I’m happy that the customer base has grown a lot since we launched in 2017 but the general traits of our followers remain the same.\nDO YOU THINK CONSUMERS IN ASIA UNDERSTAND WHAT AFRICAN FASHION AND AFRICAN PRINTS ARE LIKE, AND HAVE YOU FELT A BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AN AMBASSADOR OF THIS CULTURE?\nIn a way, I was surprised to see how many Singaporeans are well educated and very knowledgeable about the fabrics and African fashion. I think one of the great things about Singaporeans is that they are used to melting pots and cultural mixes. So they have a very open mind and a lot of curiosity for new things. In another way, African fashion and prints are still fairly new to Asians in general. Let’s be honest — black brands historically marketed themselves to black people in terms of designs and image. One of our goals is to show that our clothes can be worn by everyone and anyone, without limitations.\nI don’t see myself as an ambassador yet, but I would love to become one, because that would mean I am doing a good job and achieving my goals as a person and as a brand. I never felt a burden either. Rather, I see it as a blessing and I am thankful for it. I would love to spread a message that goes beyond past history and borders, and inspire people to know more about and understand better not only African fashion but also the meanings and stories behind it. Fashion can be an entry point to learning about a culture.\nYOU HAVE SAID IN PAST INTERVIEWS THAT OLIVEANKARA IS A SLOW FASHION BRAND. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?\nSlow fashion means we don’t subscribe to the usual fast fashion schemes that reign in contemporary fashion culture. We put quality and design ahead of quantity and trends. We don’t make clothes that last a season, we aim to make timeless clothes. We pursue sustainability as one of our main pillars. We create small collections and limited editions and we try our best to reduce waste and optimise processes. Even as we grow as a brand and plan to increase our production, we will always work with the intent of creating something that is respectful of the planet and the people involved in the process.\nLOOKING BACK, WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT AS AN ENTREPRENEUR THAT YOU DIDN’T KNOW BEFORE YOU JUMPED INTO THIS BUSINESS?\nI could talk about this for hours and still not scratch the surface! Honestly, I didn’t know anything about entrepreneurship when I started, and I am still learning every day. I feel like it’s an endless learning experience. The more I learn, the more I realise there are so many things I don’t know and still need to learn.\nOne thing I had to learn is that when you own your own business, there are no days off or restful weekends. It’s a 24/7 job. But I also learnt that the satisfaction of seeing your hard work being rewarded is priceless. And that the motto “dream big” works if you restlessly chase your dreams!\nLET’S TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD. WHAT ROLE CAN FASHION AND FASHION ENTREPRENEURS LIKE YOURSELF PLAY IN THE FIGHT FOR MORE EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY?\nIn my opinion, before the role of fashion and entrepreneurs comes the role as a person. I feel like the fight has to start first of all at a personal level. Understanding the importance of equality and diversity is crucial to being a good person. Many good persons create a good society. What we can do as entrepreneurs is to push positive messages through our brands. The fashion industry is one of the major contributors to pollution, waste and unfair wages. To Inform and educate the customers about these issues, as well as create positive examples and spread meaningful messages, is a duty for forward-thinking fashion entrepreneurs. Being all equal in our diversities is what makes us beautiful.\nYOU ARE ONE OF THE FEW AFRICAN BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE LIFESTYLE SECTOR IN SINGAPORE. IS THERE A COMMUNITY THAT I AM SIMPLY UNAWARE OF OR ARE YOU ONE OF A SMALL NUMBER?\nI think you are right, we are part of a small number of African-inspired businesses. The community is still very small but we feel like the interest is there and the community will grow in the future. One of our projects moving forward is to partner with some like-minded brands to create events that focus on building a community. But right now, events are not doable so we are postponing that project until the timing is right.\nWHAT’S THE DREAM FOR OLIVEANKARA FOR THE NEAR FUTURE?\nTo be honest, one dream is not enough. I have quite a few! Evolving and growing the brand. Creating a community of curious and open-minded people. That’s just two of them! But I don’t want to spoil anything. Keep following us and you will find out.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', ""     Women's Voices "", '     fashion ']}"

      How to clean your jewellery: Using toothpaste or vinegar may do more harm than good
  </h1>, 'text': 'Jewellery typically doesn’t come cheap. For that investment, you’ll expect these to last forever or for a very long time at least. That assumption can turn into reality if you give these the care and maintenance they need.\nLike many other fancy objects, jewellery needs a good cleaning every now and then, and also regular “servicing” so that any damage can be repaired or even prevented from happening. Besides that, a little attention applied to how you are wearing your diamonds, gems and pearls will help preserve their beauty.\nYou’ll appreciate the importance of jewellery care even more so when it comes to sentimental pieces like heirlooms or a wedding ring, which you wouldn’t want to risk losing. So here’s what you need to do to keep your most valuable jewellery pieces in perfect shape.\n\n\nPUT ON JEWELLERY LAST\n\n\nA post shared by Tiffany & Co. (@tiffanyandco) on May 18, 2020 at 9:11am PDT\nRule number one is a no-brainer that applies to all kinds of jewellery, even costume jewellery – if you want these to last longer than they typically do, that is. Always apply lotion, perfume\xa0or hairspray before putting on your jewellery, so as to keep the metals from getting in contact with substances such as alcohol, which could tarnish, corrode, or even cause cracks in your precious accessories.\n\n\nTAKE IT OFF EVERY NIGHT\n\n\nA post shared by Chaumet (@chaumetofficial) on Jun 18, 2020 at 1:01am PDT\nSome people are used to wearing their jewellery 24/7, particularly pieces such as stud earrings and wedding or engagement rings. You may like to keep your most sentimental jewellery close to you all the time but here’s news – you’re more likely to damage these by never taking them off.\nRegular maintenance is essential – at least once a year, particularly for jewellery that features many linked components and stone settings.\nFirst of all, when you take a shower or bath with your jewellery pieces on, you’re exposing these to steam and moisture, along with other emollient substances in your toiletries, which can degrade metals over time or dull the sparkle of precious gems such as diamonds. On top of that, should a component of the jewellery happen to come loose while you’re in the shower, it’s likely that it’ll be sent down the drain hole and lost for good. God forbid that it should be an errant diamond that has escaped from its setting.\nSleeping with your jewellery is also a no-no –\xa0chains and hooks on bracelets and necklaces can be bent out of shape as you toss and turn in bed, while stone settings can easily come loose should you carelessly snag the prongs on a pillowcase or blanket.\nDON’T WEAR IT WHEN YOU’RE BUSY DOING STUFF\nObviously, don’t wear your jewellery when swimming or pounding the treadmill at the gym. In fact, leave your accessories at home or in your locker when you are doing any sporting activity during which you are bound to sweat.\nRemove your rings when doing any baking or cooking that requires kneading or mixing of ingredients with your hands. It goes without saying that all sorts of nasty germs could be hidden in the nooks and crannies of your rings. What’s more, the ingredients can easily get stuck within setting prongs and crevices, which are difficult to remove thoroughly.\n\n\nHAVE SETTINGS CHECKED REGULARLY\n\n\nA post shared by Van Cleef & Arpels (@vancleefarpels) on Mar 28, 2020 at 5:30am PDT\nMost reputable jewellers are happy to clean and check your fine jewellery for free, as long as your pieces were purchased at their stores. Regular maintenance is essential – at least once a year, particularly for jewellery that feature many linked components and stone settings.\nIt’s not that uncommon for gems to come loose from jewellery, whether they be set into a prong or bezel setting. This happens to even pieces from the finest brands and may not entirely be an issue of substandard quality. When you wear your jewellery regularly, they are subject to the effects of different environmental conditions – precious metals like gold, silver and platinum can expand or contract when exposed to varying temperatures and also be bent out of shape when handled carelessly.\nZIPLOC YOUR SILVER TO KEEP IT SHINY\n\n\nA post shared by Louis Vuitton Official (@louisvuitton) on Feb 21, 2020 at 1:00am PST\nSilver tarnishes very easily, particularly in our humid weather. Thankfully, it’s not difficult to remove the discolouration – all you need is a polishing cloth or solution that is specifically made for cleaning the metal.\nA smart and easy way to keep your silver pieces looking freshly polished for longer – instead of storing them in a jewellery box or bag, put them in mini-sized Ziploc bags.\nIt is, however, a chore to have to polish silver jewellery repeatedly. Hands up if you’ve ever taken out a piece that has been polished and kept away not too long ago, only to find it tarnished yet again.\nHere’s a smart and easy way to keep your silver pieces looking freshly polished for longer – instead of storing them in a jewellery box or bag, put them in mini-sized Ziploc bags, which will do a much better job of keeping them sealed away from the air. You’ll find these still in a gleaming state when you next want to wear them again.\nPROVIDE THE RIGHT TYPE OF STORAGE\nThere’s a reason why a plush clamshell box is always provided with a fine jewellery purchase – these provide the best storage for your prized accessories, even though these may not be great for those who are strapped for space.\nCan’t contain your ever-growing collection of jewellery boxes within your shelves or cabinets? Try stackable jewellery trays, which can be easily found online – these velvet- or suede-lined compartmentalised storage solutions protect your jewellery and keep these neatly organised, so that you can easily access the pieces you’d like to wear for the day.\nNever store multiple pieces together in a box or bag or simply leave your jewellery lying on a hard surface – the abrasion will cause scratches on shiny surfaces. Keep these separate, in soft bags or containers with a soft lining and, as far as possible, away from exposure to air and extreme temperature changes.\nUSING SOAP IS GOOD ENOUGH\n\n\nA post shared by Cartier Official (@cartier) on Jul 17, 2019 at 2:59am PDT\nDo not clean your jewellery with toothpaste, vinegar or baking soda\xa0– three substances that are popularly said to do the job quickly. These household items may be able to remove grime effectively but can be too harsh on fine jewellery.\nDo not clean your jewellery with toothpaste, vinegar or baking soda\xa0– three substances that are popularly said to do the job quickly.\nIf you would like to clean your jewellery at home, a simple solution of water mixed with a few drops of mild dishwashing soap will suffice. Soak the jewellery in it for five to 10 minutes and then go over the surfaces gently with an old toothbrush (soft bristles, please) to dislodge any dirt stuck in tiny crevices. Rinse with water, then wipe away the moisture with a soft cloth and lay the jewellery pieces on top of a dry cloth so as to allow them to air-dry completely before storing them.\n\n\nPEARLS DEMAND EXTRA ATTENTION\n\n\nA post shared by MIKIMOTO (@official_mikimoto) on May 19, 2020 at 7:01pm PDT\nPearls are particularly delicate and need to be given more care as compared to diamonds and other gems. The nacre (the coating on their surface) can be very easily marked, scratched or chipped, so these are best worn on the ears and around the neck (in a manageable length) where they are less likely to be damaged by sharp objects or hard impact.\nPearls also need to be worn frequently if you wish to keep them in tip-top condition.\nJewellers recommend that pearls be cleaned every time you wear these to remove the perspiration or oil from contact with your skin. Never run these directly under water, soak in water or soap though – just give a gentle polishing with a soft, dry cloth before you store them.\nStrange as it may sound, pearls also need to be worn frequently if you wish to keep them\xa0in tip-top condition. The reason is that pearls need to “breathe”, and do so by drawing moisture from the air or your skin. Without the moisture, the surface can become dehydrated and brittle, which is why you should not store these in airtight bags or spaces like safes.\nFinally, pearl string necklaces need to be restrung preferably once a year, if you wear these often. Such necklaces are strung with fine threads that can degrade, weaken and break with wear and tear, so it’s necessary to get your jeweller to change these out before it actually happens. Another word of caution: Never hang these up as this will add stress on the fine threads – always store your pearls lying down flat.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     jewellery ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style "", '     Accessories ']}"

      Ladies, here’s where to shop for plus-size clothes that suit Asian bodies
  </h1>, 'text': 'Finding flattering clothes that fit comfortably used to be unnecessarily difficult for women who weren’t sizes 0-12, but not anymore.\nWith celebrities such as Lizzo, Amy Schumer and Ashley Graham championing body positivity, society is increasingly embracing fuller body shapes. In fashion, this also means sizes bigger than XL are now more available for women, and they’re no longer frumpy nor ill-fitting. \xa0\xa0\nBut the definition of plus-size can depend on where you are in the world. Sophia Hung, owner of plus-size boutique The Amber Loft said: “In the Singapore context, this would mean sizes XXL (UK 14) and above. For most US brands, the sizes that are considered Asian plus-size are not really plus-size so it’s relative.”\n\n\nBeing a petite plus-size – or what she calls “inbetweenie” – who struggled to find well-fitting clothes led to Hung starting her boutique.\n“I couldn’t fit into anything in the usual shops, but plus-size clothes from overseas brands made me look like I was swimming in them,” she said.\n“Also, whatever was on offer in the plus-size market at that time was dismal – there were dowdy and expensive plus-size clothes in department stores made for women much older than me, or cheap and poor quality ones. I simply wanted clothes in which I could communicate visually to the world who I am.”\nFor most US brands, the sizes that are considered Asian plus-size are not really plus-size so it’s relative.\nSimilarly, the founders of another homegrown plus-size boutique Be You Co, Phyllis Tan and Jasmine Neo – all self-described “curvy girls” – started their label when they found it challenging to find affordable, flattering and well-made womenswear.\n\n\n“In Singapore, most female clothing stores usually only cater up to XL, or UK 10 to 12. We’ve seen a rise in regular stores trying to be inclusive, and bringing in XXL or UK 14 clothes,"" said Tan.\xa0\n""However, most of these clothes are not very true to size and usually only fit regular sized ladies with a slightly bigger built. So despite being more inclusive, there is still a gap or demand for larger sizes.""\nDedicated boutiques have helped to reinforce the need for acceptance of fuller figures.\nRani Dhaschainey, founder of The Curve Cult, another plus-size boutique, said she started her store because she wanted to foster inclusivity. “We started this business to create a safe space and foster a community of support for plus-size women. We chose to use fashion to create awareness and promote body positivity.”\nSo, embrace your curves and find your perfect fit with this list of fashion options that runs from homegrown plus-size boutiques to international fashion labels that cater to full figures. \xa0\xa0\nTHE AMBER LOFT\nThis local boutique features clothes that are exclusively manufactured and designed for Asian plus-size women who are more petite than Western women. Featuring a variety of colours and prints, the styles cater to confident women who don’t just want to play it safe. Sizes go from UK 12 to 22.\nAvailable\xa0here.\nBE YOU CO \nThis local label designs and curates apparel for the modern-day plus-size woman. The founders personally oversee the details, right down to the zips, buttons and lining. The company is also exploring illustration and print-making, and adapting self-drawn prints onto the apparels. Sizes are from UK 12 to 20.\nAvailable\xa0here.\nTHE CURVE CULT\nExpect\xa0styles that range from bodycon dresses, swing skirts and styles in bright colours and bold prints at this homegrown label. Sizes UK 14 to 28 are available.\nAvailable\xa0here.\n\n\nUNIQLO\nKnown for its everyday basics, high-tech garments and creative collaborations, the Japanese retailer has introduced sizes for the fuller figure (up to 3XL), available exclusively online.\nAvailable\xa0here.\nVIOLETA BY MANGO \nMango’s plus-size collection offers versatile and modern pieces for young women. There are wrap dresses, flowy tops and even playful jumpsuits, with sizes from European 42 to 54 (UK 14 to 44).\xa0\nAvailable here.\nASOS CURVE\nFrom sportswear and swimwear to party dresses, the brand has something for every occasion, even wedding dresses. Sizes go up to UK 30.\xa0\nAvailable\xa0here.\n\n\nH&M+\nThe Swedish fast-fashion retailer has thought of it all, from casual denim to office attire, basics and sleepwear, the line offers chic choices at affordable prices. Sizing goes from L to 4XL.\nAvailable\xa0here.\nMARKS AND SPENCER \nA staple among women and men for classics and intimates, the UK retailer also offers their “Curve” fit for fuller body shapes. Sizes go up to UK 32 for certain styles.\nAvailable\xa0here.\n\n\n4 SHOPPING TIPS FOR THE LADIES\nTo dress in plus-size perfection, here are some things to look out for when shopping for clothes.\nCHECK FOR QUALITY\nCheck the material of the outfit and the overall workmanship. “The fabric should have a nice weight to it and should drape well,” Hung advised.\n“Check the finishing of the hems, or the overall stitching to make sure there is no puckering or obvious signs of bad workmanship. It is a sad fact of life, but these flaws often show up so much more on plus-size clothes, because the clothes are overall bigger and worn on a bigger body.”\nCHOOSE A FLATTERING CUT\nBe aware of your body shape. “Some girls have an hourglass shape and can therefore wear fit and flare styles well. Girls who do not have such curves might be better off in shifts or drop-waist styles. For those who are tempted to break away from her comfort zone to try something new can do so with strong colours and interesting prints,” said Hung.\nTan agreed that dressing according to one’s body shape has its advantages. “A V-neck style elongates the neck and torso, a shorter dress complements the legs. A heavier or fluffier top complements a smaller bottom, and a flared bottom should go with a tighter fitting top,” she said.\nMAKE SURE IT’S ACTUALLY WEARABLE\nKeep practicality in mind and try the outfit if you can. “We might be attracted to certain outfits on Instagram and seek to emulate them, but make sure that these clothes are practical to wear. For example, wrap dresses or front-split skirts can look amazing, but their potential for wardrobe malfunctions is high,” Hung stated.\n\n\nCHOOSE SOMETHING COMFORTABLE \nPick an outfit that suits your personality, and one that makes you feel comfortable and confident. Tan explained: “We have come across customers who think that shorter dresses make their legs look “longer” but we also have customers who think that longer dresses accentuate their height.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      How fashion rental services keep their apparel clean and hygienic
  </h1>, 'text': ""In recent years, clothing rental services have been increasing in popularity because they offer customers access to a wide variety of clothes and accessories at a fraction of the cost of purchasing them.\nThey also provide subscribers with the flexibility of experimenting with different styles which they may not normally want to invest in. How do these services work?\xa0\nBased on their subscription plan, customers get to pick the items of clothing they want, wear them and return them within the time frame allocated.\nWith most people staying home in the last few months, many of these companies have had to temporarily close their physical stores and transition to operating entirely online, subjecting their extensive collections of delicate clothes and accessories to the perils of storage.\n\n\nHow have they been protecting them from the adverse effects of our humid climate?\nMing Bridges, CEO and Founder of Rentadella, explained: “When the ‘circuit breaker’ was announced, we had to immediately stop all appointments and move to fully functioning online. We still did delivery but paid extra attention to make sure clothes were properly disinfected after every wear and also had a 'breathing period’ before we handled it after the customer rental.”\nEverything is disinfected once worn or touched.\nStyle Theory also had to eventually close their store and move completely to contactless doorstep deliveries and collection while they continued to receive subscriptions for their services during the weeks of the “circuit breaker”.\nTo ensure that standards of hygiene were upheld, separate warehouses were allocated during this period to process returned apparel and to separate them from the new and clean clothes.\xa0\nRaena Lim, co-founder of Style Theory, said: “Our clean apparel are further handled by staff who are appropriately trained to sanitise all boxes prior to packing the orders for subscribers.”\nThe facilities are kept at optimal conditions- temperature-regulated and humidity-controlled – to ensure all inventory is kept dry and away from moisture to prevent unnecessary mould or mildew from developing.\nAdditionally, the aisles and storage shelving in their designer bags warehouse are being regularly cleaned and maintained. Lim added: “The facilities are kept at optimal conditions- temperature-regulated and humidity-controlled – to ensure all inventory is kept dry and away from moisture to prevent unnecessary mould or mildew from developing.”\nTo protect Rentadella’s collection, Bridges had to move the majority of clothing into her own home. She explained:“We put a dehumidifier in each room the clothes were in to make sure there was no chance of mould building up and kept things open and airy as much as possible for good air circulation.”\n\n\nApart from the usual dry cleaning, the company also invested in disinfection products specifically for clothes, shoes and their showroom. “Everything is disinfected once worn or touched. We also invested in top quality dehumidifiers to keep our clothes in top condition,” said Bridges.\nOn top of the health and hygiene measures that Style Theory’s staff practise, such as daily temperature-taking, mask-wearing, and regular hand-sanitising, along with the introduction of contactless delivery to safeguard the health of their drivers and subscribers, Lim also stressed\xa0that the standard practices that the company already maintains have become even more important during this period.\nOur apparel goes through a thorough seven-step process with our dry-cleaning partners to sterilise, clean and press our clothes, and our designer bags are cleaned after each and every rental.\n\xa0“The boxes that are used to deliver the apparel and designer bags are cleaned after every use with anti-bacterial sprays and disinfectants. After which, all boxes will go through a thorough wipe down prior to packing, to achieve the best cleanliness,” said Lim.\n“Our apparel goes through a thorough seven-step process with our dry-cleaning partners to sterilise, clean and press our clothes, and our designer bags are cleaned after each and every rental. We also seal all orders that exit our facility to maintain the cleanliness and condition the minute it leaves our warehouse and through the delivery partners.”\nWith the increasing anxiety over health and hygiene, it’s reassuring to hear that these rental companies are going the extra mile to ensure that their collections are well maintained. Moving forward, will these additional measures become part and parcel of their business practises?\n\n\n“Yes. As we adjust to the new normal, hygiene standards will have to be at the highest possible, even in between customer try-ons,” said Bridges. “We pride ourselves in having the best quality rental clothes and are happy we are able to run our business knowing our customers are getting the safest treatment possible.”\nAlong with the measures Style Theory already have in place, contactless doorstep delivery will stay on as part of their service. “We will continue to do so as increased hygiene measures are just as relevant and important post-circuit breaker as well, and we will continue to uphold this as a responsibility we pride ourselves in,” said Lim.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      T-shirts, tracksuits, bob hats: Air Dior capsule collection arrives in Singapore

      Punk princess: Chanel’s fall couture collection is a nod to rebel socialites

Viard’s first couture collection was described to be a simplistic take on the Chanel DNA, with soft, elegant looks presented at the Grand Palais, turned into a library.\xa0\nSimilarly, words such as simple and austere were used to described Viard’s second couture collection, featuring school girl looks inspired by the monastery of Gabrielle Chanel’s childhood. \xa0\nWhich is why the Fall 2020 Haute Couture collection is a complete about-turn for the designer.

There is so much love in each one of these silhouettes,” Viard said.\nThe collection may have strayed away from what we’re used to seeing from Viard, but the designer states that it was completely intentional. “I like working like this, going in the opposite direction of what I did last time.

      Using bangles to commemorate job promotions and professional milestones
  </h1>, 'text': 'I know where it began. I was sitting at a fashion show in Paris, the heat so intense that my clothes seemed to have vacuum-suctioned to my skin, when I noticed the fashion editor Camille Bidault-Waddington sit down at her seat. I’ve always had an admiration for the stylist’s effortless dress sense that borders on obsessive. To date, she’s the only woman who, in the social media definition, has “influenced” my style: I see her and want to wear what she’s wearing.\n\n\nOn this particular broiling afternoon, she was wearing a micro mini skirt, laced booties and a sky-blue silk shirt (see, I told you, the interest is a little bit unhealthy). But the thing that caught my eye were the enamel bangles that jangled on her arm. Shot with acid colours, orange, blue on a gold band, the jewellery suddenly made the leap from being something I had previously regarded as an essentially mumsy accessory, into a highly desirable object that I must urgently seek, and buy.\nWhich is how I came to find myself, days later, standing on the exquisite mosaic tiles of the Hermes flagship store at 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, with a brace of bangles in my hand. Why Hermes? No good reason, except if you are about to cultivate a habit, I feel you really owe it to yourself to go right in at the top.\nAlso, because there is such a range of enamel to choose from, from the scarf-print designs that were the basis for the original bangle, which launched in 1976 and was based on a Jacques Eudel print known as the Grand Apparat, to the hinged versions that fasten with a Kelly bag-style turnlock, or a ring.\nI was drawn to the Clic H bracelet, a solid ovoid of enamel and gold first launched in 2000, which is fastened with a chunky Hermes “H”. It has a snug, less jangly fit, feels pleasingly heavy on the wrist, and closes with a sound that lives up to the onomatopoeic promise of its name. Plus, it comes in a palette of delicious-sounding colours: Marron glace, rose dragee, craie. I bought the noir (of course), left the premises, and promptly considered buying more.\nI love my bangles. Stacked on the wrist, I feel instantly glamorous and grown-up – even when I’m wearing jeans.\nOver time, the bangles have come to represent small markers of achievement – entirely self-congratulatory, and almost certainly undeserved. In a market that has traditionally seen people purchasing jewellery for others (and most often men for female partners), I like to see myself among those emancipated women happy to buy jewellery for themselves.\nAfter the fashion shows, a new bangle has become a bit of Parisian bounty I seize to mark the completion of the season, each one a memento of a month spent on the road. Some commemorate a job promotion or a professional milestone. One, a shitty week.\nAnd, yes, they are an exceptional indulgence, but in lieu of champagne, shoes or diamonds, I love that these arm totems have longevity and are made of gold-plated hardware and the humbler glass.\nAll manufactured in Nontron, France, the bracelets combine a range of techniques that use the skills of Hermes’s many metiers: Screenprinting, developed through the silk and textiles department; hand-applied chromolithography, which is associated with the brand’s tableware division; and the leather and saddlery department, the starting place for so many Hermes’s icons.\nDespite their relative newness at the maison, jewellery has become a forceful commodity for Hermes as of late, contributing to a division, including fashion, that makes up 23 per cent of the group’s total turnover.\nSadly, my own contribution to those earnings won’t stretch very much further. After three years of collecting – I’m running out of wrist.\nBy Jo Ellison © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Accessories ', '     jewellery ', '     Accessories ']}"

      No runway, no fuss: Hermes unveils 2021 menswear with live performance art
  </h1>, 'text': 'The coronavirus pandemic has thrown the world of extravagant fashion runways into an existential crisis. With international travel\xa0still on hold, crowds controlled and face-to-face interaction reduced, large-scale fashion\xa0shows have become impossible to host. How, then, can fashion houses present their latest collections?\nInstead of cancelling Paris Fashion Week, show organisers instead decided to take the experience digital, giving designers a new creative challenge. Fashion shows are traditionally a grand spectacle, from the set and\xa0the soundtrack to,\xa0at times, even live performances. Can a fully digital experience completely live up to the\xa0experience?\nOn July 5, Hermes kicked off Paris Fashion Week by showcasing its Spring/Summer 2021 menswear collection through a live online film that was a joy to watch – to us anyway. Titled Hors Champs, or Behind the Scenes, the film was a pretend photoshoot for the lookbook of the collection. Models, photographers, stylists and even Veronique Nichanian, Hermes’s longtime menswear designer, were on set. \xa0\nThe film was a collaboration with visual artist and theatre director Cyril Teste. It kicked\xa0off with a model travelling down a glass elevator, before the camera wound\xa0through a backstage setting capturing the team at work. Nichanian adjusted\xa0the layers on a model;\xa0he walked, turned\xa0and posed. Satisfied, Nichanian moved\xa0on, as the camera then followed\xa0the other models around, from getting ready and\xa0interacting with one another, to posing for lookbook photos.\nThe entire film was meant to be casual. Models stopped\xa0to chat with one another, and even took\xa0selfies. One model was told he had\xa0two minutes. He asked\xa0if he could be excused, presumably to take a call – or answer nature\'s call. A piano soundtrack accompanied\xa0the film, interrupted only once by rock music that permeated\xa0through a model’s headphones.\xa0\n“Though the current situation forbids a live audience, spectators will be able to see backstage, and thus share in those moments of creative truth. Circumstances have forced me to pare down, both in conception of the collection and in choice for this presentation,"" Nichanian said in an interview appended to the show notes.\n""For me, these constraints are an opportunity and incentive to be inventive, to research, to recreate. It is quite rewarding to hone in on the essential, and to distill, refine, sharpen. It all pointed in one direction, the one I wanted to follow for this collection: Simplicity, nonchalance, lightness.""\n""For me, these constraints are an opportunity and incentive to be inventive, to research, to recreate. It is quite rewarding to hone in on the essential, and to distill, refine, sharpen.""\xa0– Veronique Nichanian\nThe fact that all this happened\xa0in real-time made\xa0the film all that more intriguing. ""I usually say that what I do is not theatre; it’s real-time film. Here too, the challenge\xa0–\xa0and what I find beautiful – is doing it in real time. We are going to accentuate the instant, that vertiginous moment before the start of a show, those few seconds backstage: The Opening Night effect, when you’re about to face the music,"" Teste said.\nNichanian is known for her understated aesthetic, and this collection is no different. The line-up consisted of light, airy pieces, ideal\xa0for Singapore\'s tropical climate. Jackets and blousons borrowed the characteristic stripes and suppleness of the shirt. The shirt adopted\xa0the volume of a blouson. Each look evoked\xa0timeless casualness – in tune to where fashion is headed, post-pandemic.\nThe colour palette was tightly controlled, consisting of mostly blues, greys, white and off-white, save for the occasional pops of green and fluorescent yellow.\nNotably, only 18 looks were presented. “This collection is smaller than usual because we were cut off from our usual means of production. I also selected eighteen silhouettes where I normally select around forty, partly due to the nature of the performance,” Nichanian said.\nThe film also put\xa0focus on accessories. A stylist picked\xa0up the Slim d’Hermes watch and handed\xa0it to a model, who slipped\xa0it on. At one point, Nichanian asked\xa0for a zoom-in on the Haut a Courroies Cargo bag.\nJust like the traditional fashion show, the film ended\xa0to\xa0rousing applause by the team. Were they acting as part of the closing of the faux photoshoot, or was that a celebration of the success of the film?\nThough the film may be a step out of the ordinary, Nichanian took the challenge in her stride. “Recent events and their damaging effects on the fashion world have not gotten me down. Quite the opposite in fact; I feel like the current situation is one from which we can all extract new wisdom, and a new momentum,"" she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Paris ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ']}"

      Decluttering your wardrobe? Here’s how you can offload your clothes – safely
  </h1>, 'text': 'For many people, it has been a long few months of staying home. Chances are, in a fit of inspiration (or boredom), you might have embarked on a bout of decluttering and tidying up a la Marie Kondo. Perhaps you have uncovered a few long forgotten items in your wardrobe that have you wondering: What was I thinking?\nWell, as the saying goes, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. If you happen to have unwanted designer items such as clothing, bags, accessories or even shoes, don’t toss them down the rubbish chute just yet. You might just be able to unlock some value by reselling or renting them.\nThe preloved market is big business these days – just take a look at sneaker resale sites like GOAT, where the most coveted kicks are sold at multiples of their retail value. And as the stigma against owning or wearing “someone else’s clothes” is gradually diminishing, it has also become increasingly commonplace to rent or buy previously worn clothing and accessories.\nThese days, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many resale websites have stepped up their collection and sanitising procedures to ensure a safe experience for everybody. The sites that CNA Luxury contacted have also implemented contactless pick-ups and drop-offs and stepped up deep cleaning of their premises as well as the items they receive.\nHere are seven pre-loved and rental sites where you can get last season’s possessions listed plus some insider advice on the popular brands and items that buyers are always on the lookout for.\n\n\nCOVETELLA\nIf you happen to have a collection of party dresses and formal wear that you might want to downsize, drop the folks at Covetella a message. Its founder Carol Chen first launched this dress rental company, which specialises in cocktail and evening gowns, as a way to rent or sell some of her excess clothing. It has since grown into one of the more popular gown rental services in Singapore, as they offer fitting and styling services as well.\nCovetella also accepts pre-worn dresses and gowns from individuals who wish to rent or sell them, although Chen says they are “quite picky” about what they accept. You have the option of holding on to your pieces or storing them in Covetella’s showroom. When an order is placed, the team will handle the delivery and dry cleaning to ensure a hassle-free process.\nOX STREET\nOx Street is an online marketplace for premium sneakers in Southeast Asia. The platform, which currently only deals in never-worn sneakers (they may soon accept gently worn shoes too), verifies and authenticates the shoes to ensure that all items sold are legitimate.\nTo comply with increased hygiene measures, the team wears masks at all times and sanitises their hands before handling boxes or products. The boxes are also wiped down with sanitising wipes – and also throw in a few wipes before shipping items out.\nSneakers that are currently in demand include Air Jordans, Nike Dunks and Adidas Yeezy’s. Serious collectors are also likely to pay top dollar for unworn collaborations such as those by Sean Wotherspoon x New Balance or Grateful Dead x Nike Dunks, so get in touch if you happen to have any of these unworn models lying around at the back of your closet.\nSTYLE THEORY\nHaute bag fiends can consider consigning up to 20 bags from their collection for rental on Style Theory – but there is a catch.\nThe fashion rental site will only accept bags from its designer list, which currently includes Burberry, Goyard, JW Anderson and Salvatore Ferragamo. All bags will be cleaned and maintained by a panel of leather care experts and stored professionally in an air-conditioned warehouse. You may also choose to list your bags for sale as well.\nSTYLE TRIBUTE\nYou could either do a DIY upload of your items via Style Tribute’s seller app or if you are unsure if your decluttered items might still hold some value, arrange for a virtual consignment appointment via FaceTime or WhatsApp video chat with the in-house team.\nOnce the items to be sold are confirmed, the team will arrange for a contactless collection between the seller and the driver with enhanced safe distancing measures, which include deciding on a designated drop-off location and strict adherence to phone communication only.\nThe site accepts all manner of designer fashion items for men and women and some of the most coveted brands include Chanel, Hermes, Gucci, Dior, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.\nTHE FIFTH COLLECTION \nIn pre-coronavirus times, a curator from The Fifth Collection would meet sellers in person to help select suitable items and to explain the details and paperwork.\nThese days, all communication is done via email and contactless pick-up is carried out by an in-house courier to ensure appropriate safe distancing. When the pieces arrive in the office, they are inspected and authenticated, the list price is confirmed in consultation with the seller and then added to the site for sale. Your items should be in at least good condition to pass muster – well used or damaged items will be rejected.\nThe site’s most popular brands are Chanel, Hermes and Louis Vuitton, so send them a message if you have products from these labels you would like to be rid of. Specific accessories that get snapped up quickly include Valentino Rockstud shoes, Chanel earrings, YSL Arty rings, Balenciaga bags, Dior slingback shoes and Chanel ballerina flats. Clothes by brands including Issey Miyake, Self-Portrait, Zimmermann, Sacai and specifically, the DVF wrap dress are popular too. And with folks spending so much time at home these days, designer homeware, especially those from Hermes, are in demand as well.\nTHE TREASURE COLLECTIVE\nThose who cannot bear to part from their treasured wardrobe pieces but still wish to generate some income from their belongings can consider the rental service by The Treasure Collective.\nThis sharing community fashion rental platform has what it terms a “managed-wardrobe solution” where your items are styled, catalogued, listed in an inventory, stored and placed on its platform for rentals.\nBefore your pieces are returned to you at the end of the consignment period, they will be carefully cleaned by the laundromat For The Love of Laundry. With a wide range of designers listed on the site, ranging from mid-priced brands such as Cos and For Love & Lemons to high-end labels including Saint Laurent and Dries Van Noten, this is a good one-stop shop for those who wish to rent out a mix of high-low products from their wardrobes.\nVESTAIRE COLLECTIVE\nIt is fairly easy to be listed on Vestiaire Collective, simply sign up for an account and you can start listing your items on the site. Do fill in the description of the item and its condition as accurately as possible. This is because when the item is sold, you will have to ship it to one of Vestiaire Collective’s logistics hubs for a quality control inspection before it is sent to the buyer.\nTo ensure that this contact-less process meets the highest hygiene standards, the company has also increased its backend processes, such as temperature monitoring and sanitisation of its buildings.\nPopular brands include Chanel, Hermes and Gucci, with labels including See by Chloe, Off-White and Louis Vuitton rapidly gaining popularity in the region. If you own bags such as Gucci’s Jackie, Celine’s Trio and Fendi’s Peekaboo as well as sneaker models including Gucci’s Ace, Balenciaga’s Track and Valentino’s Rockrunner, you will stand a good chance of selling them.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Singapore ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Prada sales are up double digits in Asia and China, even with price hike

Sales at Italy’s Prada are growing at double-digit rates in Asia, CEO Patrizio Bertelli revealed in an interview with fashion magazine WWD.\n“Asia and China are important markets for the Prada Group. Since the health situation in those countries has normalised, we have seen a fast and sustained return to consumer spending. In the entire area, sales are growing at important – double digit – rates and we are confident that this trend can continue also in the months to come,” Bertelli said.\nMeanwhile, Bertelli said that any predictions on the American market is hard to make, citing the uncertain health emergency in the country. “In the American market, the health emergency is still ongoing and it’s difficult at the moment to make any forecasts. Many of our directly operated stores are still closed and some department stores were beginning to show their financial difficulties before the arrival of COVID-19,” he told WWD.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the global luxury market. In response, brands such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior have raised their prices to boost revenue. When asked if Prada would do the same, Bertelli said, “The recent logistical and manufacturing complexities have forced us to raise our prices to recover the increase of organisational costs as well as those of raw materials. In any case, it is a matter of contained, single-digit price increases.”\nThe privately-owned Prada Group is run by husband and wife team of Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia Prada, whose grandfather founded the label in 1913. The couple’s eldest son Lorenzo Bertelli joined the company to lead its marketing and communications in September 2017.\nSpeaking during an interview with Business of Fashion, Lorenzo did not rule out replacing his parents as head of the company in the future.

      In a pandemic, can nature-inspired designs teach us to appreciate Mother Earth?
  </h1>, 'text': ""In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, people around the world stayed home to prevent further spread of the virus. There was no going out to the gym, to the movies, or out for a meal. For some of us, our only connection to the outdoors was stepping out for some exercise.\nHere in Singapore, during the circuit breaker, there were more people heading out for a jog\xa0or going for walks around the neighbourhood\xa0than any regular day. It’s not surprising – when we spend too much time cooped up indoors, there can be physical and emotional costs.\nIn a New York Times article, Benthany Borel, a senior associate at CookFox Architects said, “Humans have an affinity toward nature that’s biologically embedded.” It’s no wonder then that we’re drawn to nature, especially so during tough times.\n\n\nFor decades, jewellers have understood man’s connection to nature – and sought to replicate the natural world's\xa0myriad forms and colours in their designs. And during the gloomy days we’ve been experiencing of late, nature-inspired jewellery become all the more significant. Even watchmakers are jumping on the bandwagon, rolling out watches with green dials that are a subtle nod to nature.\nIn the jewellery world, nature-inspired jewellery collections include Van Cleef & Arpels's Frivole, Piaget’s Rose and Bvlgari’s Fiorever.\xa0The latest to reproduce the world of flora and fauna is\xa0Cartier's [Sur]naturel high jewellery collection, which uses the most exquisite stones to form pieces that are both dazzling and intriguing.\nKey pieces in the collection include the Hemis necklace, a reinterpretation of panther fur through the use of irregularly-shaped opals. The uneven distribution of the necklace’s diamonds and opals also bring to mind pebbles of a riverbed. In the centre sits a cushion-shaped kunzite totalling 71.80 carats, with an intense pink colour and a hint of purple.\nCartier’s association with the panther has spanned over a century. It first made its debut in the Cartier universe in 1914 through a bracelet watch sporting diamonds flecked with onyx, reminiscent of panther\xa0spots.\nThe [Sur]Naturel collection features a new rendition of the Panthere timepiece. Made of yellow gold and coral, the Panthere Tropicale is described as a hybrid that “lies somewhere between animal and organic”. The wristwatch is speckled with onyx stones and diamonds.\nBeyond the panther, a\xa0snakeskin effect is achieved with the Opheis necklace. Diamonds overlap in a staggering effect, while the onyx-stone triangles evoke the creature’s dorsal ridge. The stone in the middle, a Zambian emerald totalling 53.94 carats, evokes the head of the snake.\nElements of nature also make an appearance in the collection. The curves of the Sinope necklace is inspired by water and the way it moves. Boasting a scalloped lapis lazuli edge beneath the neck, the structure comprises other small pieces linked together and set with diamonds. There are five Ceylon sapphires on the rounded outer edge.\nLastly, the Tillandsia necklace is inspired by its namesake plant, which has become a part of Cartier’s signature plant family. The necklace captures the plant’s prickles and rounded, water-filled parts. It features a pair of oval-shaped beryls totalling 83.23 and 81.09 carats respectively, which seem to float above a lattice of paved diamonds. \xa0\nWith the onset of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns,\xa0public spaces in cities around the world were reclaimed by nature.\xa0Plants began to thrive again, and animals returned.\xa0\nThe pandemic has taught us many lessons. And one of them is that humans are reliant on nature for its healing effects. So while nature’s beauty is made to last forever in jewellery pieces, it’s time we look at conserving the real thing. \xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     Pandemic ', ""     Women's Style "", '     fashion ']}"

      Even with big spenders in Asia, Chanel forecasts ‘difficult’ two years for luxury
  </h1>, 'text': 'Chanel, the French fashion house known for its No 5 perfume and quilted leather handbags, has warned that COVID-19 will weigh on the luxury goods sector for the next two years but signalled it would hold firm on its strategy of avoiding discounting and online selling.\n“We expect COVID-19 will lead to significant reduction in revenue and profit in 2020 and that the next 18 to 24 months will be difficult for the sector,” said Philippe Blondiaux, chief financial officer, in an interview.\nAbout 85 per cent of Chanel’s 417 boutiques have reopened, although some in the US, Russia and Latin America remain closed because of quarantine measures.\nThe privately held company controlled by the billionaire Wertheimer family recently published its annual results that showed strong growth last year, its first without longtime designer Karl Lagerfeld at the helm.\n“We expect COVID-19 will lead to significant reduction in revenue and profit in 2020 and that the next 18 to 24 months will be difficult for the sector.” – Philippe Blondiaux\nThe company, founded by Coco Chanel in 1910 in Paris, posted revenue of US$12.3 billion (S$17.1 billion) last year, accelerating to 13 per cent growth on a comparable basis from 10.5 per cent in 2018. Operating profit rose 16.6 per cent to US$3.5 billion.\nThat cements the brand’s position in luxury’s elite, making it the second-biggest behind LVMH’s Louis Vuitton that had US$12.9 billion in sales in 2019, according to Bernstein estimates, and ahead of Kering’s Gucci with US$10.7 billion.\nSales of ready-to-wear clothing rose 28 per cent last year, said Blondiaux, and the transition to new designer Virginie Viard’s tenure had been “very smooth”. The brand has charted a quieter course lately, with Viard giving few interviews and holding more austere fashion shows.\n“Virginie worked with Karl for decades and knew all the codes of Chanel,” the CFO added. “She is gradually imposing her own style on the collections and on the decor of our fashion shows. Frankly, I think we have not seen any impact on the clientele of the house.”\nAsia was Chanel’s biggest region again for the second consecutive year, bringing in 44 per cent of revenue versus 37 per cent for Europe and 19 per cent for the Americas.\nThe COVID-19 crisis is expected to hit demand for luxury goods hard, especially among Chinese consumers, who have driven the vast majority of growth in recent years. With travel flows expected to be slow for some time yet, sales in duty-free outlets in airports, which bring in roughly one-fifth of sector revenue and an outsized chunk of profit, are also expected to fall sharply.\nAs a result, HSBC has forecast luxury goods sales to fall 17 per cent this year, while Bain has predicted a decline of up to 35 per cent. Analysts forecast it will take until 2022 or 2023 to return to the €281 billion (S$440 billion) of sales achieved last year.\nNevertheless, Chanel is not planning on major changes to its strategy or retail footprint to cope with the new reality, said Blondiaux.\n“We remain convinced that in-person relationship between fashion adviser and client will remain central to the luxury experience.” – Philippe Blondiaux\nIt does not plan to begin selling its clothing, handbags or watches online despite competitors such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton ramping up their own e-commerce activity. The brand does sell its perfumes and beauty products on Chanel.com though, as well as through Alibaba’s T-Mall in China, and said online revenue climbed 100 per cent in April and May.\n“We remain convinced that in-person relationship between fashion adviser and client will remain central to the luxury experience,” said Blondiaux.\nNor will Chanel discount products to clear inventory after lockdowns, even though analysts have predicted steep markdowns. “We adjusted our orders from suppliers at a relatively early stage, so we do not anticipate a problem,” said Blondiaux. “Discounting or destroying inventory has never been in the Chanel philosophy.”\nIn fact, he added, Chanel increased prices by 4 to 15 per cent in April on some of its products in an effort to keep pricing consistent across regions.\nBy Leila Abboud in Paris © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Asia ', '     luxury ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     business ', '     COVID-19 ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Is this the future of streetwear? Louis Vuitton releases first collection with Nigo 
  </h1>, 'text': ""In a 2019 interview with Dazed magazine, Louis Vuitton menswear designer Virgil Abloh declared that streetwear was “going to die”. At the time, Abloh’s thoughts polarised\xa0the fashion world.\xa0He has since clarified to Vogue magazine that his comment was “a little naive”, and what he meant was streetwear would be reborn in different forms, just as it has over the years.\nIndeed, Louis Vuitton’s first collection with Japanese designer Nigo\xa0showcases streetwear in a whole new light. For the uninitiated, Nigo is the founder of A Bathing Ape (BAPE)\xa0and Human Made. It marks Abloh’s first collaboration since being named\xa0menswear artistic director for Vuitton.\xa0\nThis is no ordinary capsule collection – inspired by the Mod London era viewed through a Tokyo lens, it takes streetwear to a new level with a tailoring focus. If traditional streetwear is dead, haute streetwear is very much alive.\nThe first wave of the LV² collection, pronounced LV Squared, is being released in boutiques today (Jun 26). The\xa0broad offering includes denim pieces, monogrammed loafers, hats, a monogrammed tie and collegiate-inspired suits and blazers.\xa0\nThe Monogram pattern and Damier check are crafted on shirts, jackets, trousers and bob hats, available in a choice of two colour schemes – blue and black. The LV² emblem of the collection can be found on everyday garments such as a grey sweatshirt and a zipped jacket, and also subtly embroidered on the back of a white shirt.\nVuitton’s iconic bags are given the LV² treatment as well. The shape of the Keepall, Soft Trunk and Campus backpack are retained, but have been reinvented by the designers, incorporating the key emblems of the collaboration. The combination of the Monogram pattern over the Damier check harkens back to the house’s early days.\nThe new Nano Amazone Messenger may just be the trendiest bag of the season.\nThe LV Made duck is the symbol of the collaboration, a re-interpretation of the world of Nigo and his Human Made signature transformed into signature Louis Vuitton style. It is available as a collector's figurine, on a coin purse, and attached to the handles of the collection’s bags. It also makes an appearance on the dial of the Tambour Horizon watch via an LV² animation.\xa0\nFootwear offerings include classic Derby shoes and black or Monogram leather loafers.

      Amid a menswear boom, Louis Vuitton opens its first men’s boutique 
  </h1>, 'text': ""In recent years, luxury brands have been courting male shoppers, as the menswear\xa0market continues to grow. According to a report by Mordor\xa0Intelligence, the global menswear market is expected to register a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.7 per cent during the forecast period of 2020 to 2025. This growth can be attributed to the popularity of streetwear\xa0and athletic-wear in recent years, which gave male consumers more options beyond the traditional tailored suit.\nWith menswear growth expected to outpace womenswear in the coming years, some of the world’s biggest fashion houses, including Prada, Gucci and Dior\xa0have responded to the trend by opening men’s-focused stores in the past few years.\nThe latest to dedicate a standalone boutique to all things masculine\xa0is Louis Vuitton, which will open its first men’s flagship store in Tokyo, Japan on July 6.\xa0\nLocated in Miyashita Park in Shibuya, the store extends over two storeys. It will offer the entire Louis Vuitton men's line-up as well as special collections across accessories, footwear and fashion. It will also include jewellery, fragrances and other store exclusives.\nWith crowd control and safe distancing being requirements amid the current COVID-19 pandemic, advance reservations are needed to enter the store in its opening weeks. Applications have to be made on the Louis Vuitton website.\nLouis Vuitton has been investing heavily in menswear over the last couple of years. Its biggest investment came in the form of hiring streetwear specialist Virgil Abloh in 2018 as creative director of the men’s line.\xa0\nAbloh has seen much success in Japan, which was among the first markets to have access to his designs when they launched in 2019. Abloh made his Louis Vuitton debut in Tokyo, where items were launched at a pop-up store even before they hit the maison’s global boutique network. The Tokyo pop-up alone outsold Vuitton’s extremely popular collaboration with Supreme (in 2017) by 30 per cent.\nOther prominent menswear designers in the luxury sphere include Kim Jones at Dior Men, and Hedi Slimane at Celine.

      Why were consumers in Asia buying luxury handbags during the lockdown?
  </h1>, 'text': 'If there is something the past few months of coronavirus-induced isolation has revealed, it is that people will do just about anything to stave off feelings of boredom. Some embark on circuit baking adventures, some socialise by playing Animal Crossing, and others embrace the solitude by going on deep bouts of soul-searching.\nThen there are those who have the means to go online shopping to get first dibs on the latest designer handbags from Gucci and Saint Laurent. According to figures provided by luxury e-commerce site Net-a-Porter, as of the month leading up to May 4, sales of its handbags saw a strong growth of 261 per cent in the Asia-Pacific, compared to last year.\xa0\nBut why handbags, when social life has essentially ground to a halt over the past few months and working from home is likely to be the norm for many people for the foreseeable future?\n\n\nWhile some shoppers may still have reservations about buying clothing or shoes online without trying them on for size first, it is typically much easier to pick a bag just based on its photographs.\n“The 2D visual of a bag does a good job of showcasing how it might look on someone’s arm, hence the risk of buying a bag is a little lower,” suggested Kapil Tuli, professor of marketing and director of the Retail Centre of Excellence at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University.\n“It’s retail therapy. When your social interactions are almost eliminated and stress increases, it is a coping mechanism, just like how the consumption of ice cream has gone up,” said Tuli.\nOnline shopping may also be a “compensation mechanism” for some, with travel and vacations more or less grounding to a halt for most.\n“Before the pandemic struck, consumers would usually purchase luxury goods abroad where it is cheaper than their home country. With travel restrictions and stay-home notices, however, purchases are now happening more frequently within their home country with online shopping fast becoming the new normal,” said Diego Dultzin Lacoste, co-founder and CFO of members-only flash sale platform OnTheList.\nThis surge in bag sales is a vast contrast to an otherwise gloomy retail outlook that is blighting the world. In Singapore, retail sales for the apparel and footwear category plunged by 85.3 per cent in April compared to the same time period last year, according to the latest data by the Department of Statistics.\nOf course, with many retail outlets around the world forced to shut their doors, it makes sense that online retailers would see a boost in sales as consumers shift their buying patterns.\nOnTheList, which has 250,000 members around the region, including 22,000 members in Singapore, saw a 15 per cent growth in consumer traffic in April and May. During this time, it sold 134,000 units of products, including cosmetics, wine and handbags, compared to just 60,000 units over the same time period last year.\nStill, these purchases may in fact indicate that luxury consumers too are becoming increasingly price sensitive. Brands including Bulgari, Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co. have been, or are in the midst of, hiking the prices of some of their products. As such, some shoppers may have decided to make their purchases before the price hikes set in.\nThe sizes of the most popular handbags suggest this as well. According to Net-A-Porter, shoppers in Singapore favoured small- to medium-sized bags in classic styles, with Bottega Veneta among the favourites. Other popular designs include Gucci’s GG Marmont and Dionsys ranges and Saint Laurent’s Monogramme, LouLou and Lou styles. All these bags tend to be smaller in size.\nSaid Tuli, “People are being a little more rational in their purchases by going for the smaller bags which could be perceived as an affordable luxury compared to larger, more expensive handbags.”\nNevertheless, regardless of size, those who have made a splurge on a new handbag have one more reason to cheer. With Phase 2 well underway, they are now ready to make a trip out to town – with a brand new arm candy in tow.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     luxury ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Customising a suit or gown? How bespoke services will change in Phase 2
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Singapore first entered the circuit breaker period, it was dark times for many businesses. With physical retail stores forced to shut, bespoke ateliers were plunged into uncertainty, and forced to find new ways to stay afloat.\nThough the arrival of Phase 2 is a welcome reprieve, it also brings with it new challenges for Singapore’s bespoke businesses. Safe distancing is required, so how will in-person appointments take place? What about taking measurements, which requires some form of body contact?\nCNA Luxury spoke with several bespoke designers in apparel, jewellery and footwear to find out how they’re reopening. With measures put in place to distance both staff and clients, will the bespoke business, which relies heavily on personal contact, ever be the same again?\nA DIGITAL PIVOT \nWhile various industries, such as fashion and horology, have been affected by a digital revolution in recent years, bespoke businesses have so far managed to preserve their traditional way of operating. Clients appreciate the face-to-face interaction that comes with tailoring a suit, or customising a pair of shoes.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic has since forced bespoke businesses to fully embrace digitalisation. “Since the pandemic, we’ve had to rethink our business and review the way forward,” shared Glenn Lee, Atelier Manager of Kevin Seah Bespoke, a tailoring house that offers bespoke and made-to-measure suits. To work around the restrictions of the circuit breaker period, the brand began offering virtual consultations for clients.\nThe lack of face-to-face appointments greatly affected bespoke bridal gown and wedding dress label Jessicacindy. “The COVID-19 pandemic definitely impacted our business greatly in terms of sales, as most clients were not keen to commit to orders without meeting face-to-face, especially for a wedding, such an important once-in-a-lifetime occasion,” said Jessicacindy Hartono, founder and Creative Director of the label.\xa0\nTo soften the blow, the label began offering video chat consultations to its local clients. Previously, video consultations were only offered to overseas clientele.\nBespoke jewellers have also begun to ply their trade online. Homegrown label B P de Silva launched a virtual concierge, allowing clients to make online appointments with its jewellery specialists.\n\n\n“Since the beginning of 2020, the brand has been building up its digital presence and capabilities so when COVID-19 hit, it became exceptionally clear to us that the best way to weather the storm is to remain connected with our clients through digital platforms,” said Shanya Amarasuriya, Creative Director at B P de Silva Jewellers.\nFor shoemaker\xa0Joshua\xa0Leong, pivoting online meant coming up with innovative ways to sell products, and get client measurements. Leong owns two labels, bespoke men’s shoe brand Josh Leong Shoes, and women’s shoe brand Palola that offers a made-to-measure service.\nFor the latter, Leong launched Advance Purchase Made-To-Order\xa0Shoes, where customers can purchase shoes online at a small discount, then get their measurements taken when the store reopens. Palola customers could also purchase a 24 hour Fitting Kit.\xa0The kit consisted of\xa0four pairs of fitting shoes in varying styles, sizes and widths, as well as leather sample swatches,\xa0delivered to their homes. Customers will then have 24 hours to try the kit, before a courier comes to pick it up.\n“We understood that buying shoes online from a brand you’re unfamiliar with is difficult, and that no amount of sizing advice would be better than allowing customers to try on the shoes in person,” said Leong.\nBY APPOINTMENT ONLY \nNow that Phase 2 has arrived, these bespoke labels are still being cautious with letting clients and customers through their doors. “We will continue to have appointments via video chat for clients who still prefer to have appointments virtually and wherever possible, we will recommend virtual appointments,” said Hartono.\nWhile Kevin Seah Bespoke and B P de Silva previously accepted walk-ins prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, they will now operate by appointment only to limit the number of people within the store. Kevin Seah Bespoke will allow only one customer at any time. B P de Silva will allow a maximum of 10 people inside its atelier.\nIn terms of overall safety measures at all ateliers, they appear pretty much the same as other retail stores. Hand sanitisers will be provided, both customers and staff will have to don face masks, and safe distancing measures will be implemented inside. At the Kevin Seah Bespoke, Josh Leong Shoes and Palola outlets, customers will have to check in and out with SafeEntry.\nNO ‘SKIN TO SKIN’ CONTACT\nThe biggest change for Phase 2 is that when it comes to taking measurements, body contact will be minimised. If a client needs her measurements taken for a gown, Jessicacindy’s staff will wear gloves. Josh Leong Shoes and Palola will adopt the same protocol.\n“Previously when I measured a customer’s feet for a bespoke commission, I would ask them to remove their socks and I would use my bare hands to measure. Moving forward, all customers will need to wear socks at all times, whether it’s when their feet measurements are being taken, or whether they are having a fitting appointment or trying on shoes. My staff and I will also be required to wear latex gloves at all times when measuring a customer’s feet, to eliminate the chance of any ‘skin on skin’ contact,” said Leong.\nAs for tailoring suits at Kevin Seah Bespoke, “Our measuring tools will be sterilised before every fitting,” said Lee.\nSEE NO TOUCH? \nTrying on products and apparel will also be a slightly more complicated process, albeit for the labels’ employees. Whether it’s a suit, gown, shoes or a piece of jewellery, the ability to touch and feel the product is an important aspect of the bespoke experience, and is not something the labels are keen to take away from customers.\n“Trying on Jessicacindy gowns will be allowed, but we will disinfect every gown touched or tried on after each appointment,” said Hartono.\nFor Kevin Seah Bespoke, “We will ensure that all apparel and our fitting room are sterilised regularly, whether through ironing and steaming, before and after a customer touches or tries them on,” shared Lee. “It is important for clients to feel the cloth during fittings for it to be a true bespoke experience. Examining the colour, texture, and weight of a fabric digitally can never be completely accurate.”\n“I believe that with the necessary precautions taken, it is perfectly safe for customers to try on (Josh Leong and Palola) shoes in store. The inside and outside of every pair of shoes that has been tried on by any customers will be disinfected immediately using an alcohol-based disinfectant after a customer has worn them,” said Leong.\nJeweller B P de Silva will also adopt the same precaution. “Jewellery is so personal – being able to explore and try on jewellery in our atelier in person is an intrinsic part of the B P de Silva experience. Our jewellery is always sanitised before and after each appointment,” said Amarasuriya.\n“Our jewellery specialists will assist our clients who would like to try any of our jewellery. We serve our clients with their own personal trays so we can keep track of the jewellery they want to try on, or have tried on,” Amarasuriya added.\nIS THE BESPOKE EXPERIENCE HERE TO STAY? \xa0\nSafe distancing and bespoke services are two terms that don’t seem to go together, which begs the question, can bespoke labels survive a post-pandemic world?\nThere’s a sense of optimism amongst the labels that CNA Luxury spoke to. Despite the added measures, clients will still seek out bespoke services, the labels believe.\n“Procedures will be slightly different in order to ensure the wellbeing of both staff and client, but I don\'t think it will majorly affect the experience as the luxurious aspect and exclusivity of it will not diminish,” said Hartono.\n“A bespoke B P de Silva piece is a commissioned jewel from scratch, and our bespoke journey continues to be one of our most sought-after services, where we are privileged to tell stories of life’s sweetest memories through jewellery,” said Amarasuriya.\n“Oftentimes the keepsakes we craft are engagement rings and wedding bands, sometimes it’s to celebrate milestones like anniversaries, or a request to redesign a family heirloom. For these reasons, we find that there will always be stories to tell and celebrate.”\n“One positive outcome of this global pandemic is the shift in spending habits,” said Lee. “There’s been a renewed focus on long-standing value, purchasing locally, and sustainability. Clients have come to realise that there is more value in being physically present, instead of shopping online for their needs.”\n\n\nIn fact, the bespoke experience can even be enhanced by embracing digital methods, Leong believes. “We’re deeply entrenched in the digital age, and our customers are just as, if not more technologically-savvy than us. Communicating with them over WhatsApp or Zoom has become the ‘new normal’. These digital communication channels have allowed us to continue developing our relationships with bespoke customers,” he said.\n“At the end of the day, when you really look at the core of what bespoke is all about, you’ll realise that it’s about the relationship between maker and customer. As long as that relationship is always at the heart of everything we do, I believe that the demand for bespoke services will continue to thrive in the years to come following this pandemic.”\n""At the end of the day, when you really look at the core of what bespoke is all about, you’ll realise that it’s about the relationship between maker and customer."" – Joshua Leong\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     Phase 2 ', '     Singapore ', '     Expert Advice ', '     fashion ']}"

      The new classics: 5 men's watches from 2020 that will never go out of style
  </h1>, 'text': 'Given the current climate, it’s natural for one’s tastes to veer toward the conservative. Those crazy complications and blinged-out wrist candy may have to wait for less tumultuous times, but this is the perfect opportunity to appreciate how far a classic, future-proof design can take you.\nThis doesn’t mean we’re asking you to load your winders with austere dress watches that, while suitably modest, aren’t terribly exciting. We’re talking about watches that won’t look out of place 20 years ago or 20 years on.\nWhether it’s carefully tweaking a successful formula a la IWC’s Portugieser and Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Master Control, or straight up plucking a design from the past, Zenith style, they all share a common goal: Timelessness.\n\n\nBAUME & MERCIER HAMPTON AUTOMATIC\nJaeger-LeCoultre’s Reverso and Cartier’s Tank seem to dominate the rectangular dress watch category, pushing less marketed options out of customers’ minds. A pity, really, when there are models like this year’s refreshed Hampton collection from Baume & Mercier that also do a stand-up job of distilling the essence of the Art Deco movement into a modern wristwatch. And at S$3,400 for the basic time-only model, it’s a steal compared to its more established peers.\nThat model, the Ref. 10522, is the smallest with dimensions measuring 43mm x 27.5mm, but the two larger ones (48mm x 31mm) make good use of the extra room. The Ref. 10528 features a small seconds counter and date, while the Ref. 10523 gets a dual time zone and day/night indicators.\nLike previous Hampton watches, these have domed sapphire crystals and a gently curved shape. But the new combination of grained opaline dials, replacement of Arabic numerals with riveted indexes, and black ruthenium sword-shaped hands makes these 2020 novelties the sleekest Hampton references yet.\nThe Ref. 10522 and Ref. 10528 use ETA movements while the dual-time Ref. 10523 uses one from Soprod, and all three feature Geneva stripes on the rotor, and can be seen through an exhibition case back.\nCARTIER SANTOS-DUMONT XXL\nThe Cartier Santos is possibly the first men’s wristwatch ever made, and the fact that new iterations haven’t stopped popping up for the last century cements its status as a watchmaking icon. So what more could Cartier do with it? Go back to its roots, by the looks of its recent additions.\nThe main Santos de Cartier collection took the emblematic square case and exposed screws and ran with it in more contemporary and robust case styles. The Santos-Dumont line on the other hand, stayed more faithful to the original, more refined watch worn by the Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont, and were often limited editions. After re-introducing the latter last year with an array of attractive quartz options, the maison now presents hand-wound editions for the mechanically obsessed.\nThe Santos-Dumont XL is available in steel, two-tone steel and pink gold, and full pink gold. Compared to the regular Santos de Cartier, here the bezel is noticeably skinnier and the crown is beaded and topped with a pointed blue cabochon. There’s only one size – 46.6mm x 33.9mm – but an ultra-thin calibre (based on the Piaget 430P) keeps it comfortably slim with a overall height of just 7.5mm. Those who worry that this too will become as mainstream as the popular Santos de Cartier can look to the four limited editions, each dedicated to one of Alberto Santos-Dumont’s aircrafts.\n\n\nIWC PORTUGIESER PERPETUAL CALENDAR 42\nWatch designs have evolved into some pretty crazy shapes and sizes to accommodate the innovation within, but there’s something to be said for a simple, round case. After all, IWC’s Portugieser has been a hit for over 80 years.\n“So to relaunch a collection everyone knows and has a very clear understanding of is not so easy,” quipped the brand’s creative director, Christian Knoop. “Even today it’s still a very modern design and while it’s not perceived as a classic, traditional watch, it has a certain crispness and purity that is very much what IWC is about.”\nThe collection introduces a number of new models and sizes, but the Portugieser Perpetual Calendar 42 is perhaps the best example of evolution done right.\n“It probably took the longest, too,” added Knoop. “Because we didn’t just want a small copy of the Portugieser Perpetual Calendar 44. We wanted a more wearable product, not just in terms of size but also in terms of design because now it sits nicely between the Automatic Ref. 5007 and the larger perpetual calendar.”\nKnoop is referring to how the new perpetual calendar has three sub dials instead of the usual four, and is a step up from the two-sub dial design of the 42mm automatic models.\nThis pared down dial and case size goes perfectly with a new, slimmer movement (the calibre 82650) which gives the case a height of 13.8mm. To make it even more accessible, it’s also available in stainless steel – a first for a non-limited Portugieser perpetual calendar.\n\n\nJAEGER-LECOULTRE MASTER CONTROL CALENDAR\nNowhere near as awe-inspiring as the Master Grande Tradition nor as sleek as the Master Ultra Thin, Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Master Control sits in the happy middle of being utterly inoffensive yet pleasingly effective. Now with four new models that show off a refreshed case and look, the Master Control can also claim vintage flavour as its draw.\nThe cases have been enlarged slightly to 40mm, compared to the 37mm cases of the older models, the bezels trimmed and the movements updated with new tech including silicon escapements and larger mainspring barrels. There’s even a completely new configuration of complications: The Master Control Chronograph Calendar is the first to combine a chronograph, triple calendar and moon phase.\nBut for overall balance and elegance, it’s the Master Control Calendar that comes out on top. The silver moon and stars (formerly gold) blend seamlessly into the silver dial, and the red logo-tipped date hand has the charming feature of jumping across the entire moon phase display from 15 to 16 so as not to obscure the view. It is available in stainless steel or the brand’s Le Grand Rose Gold – a palladium-tinged rose gold alloy that will never lose its colour.\nZENITH CHRONOMASTER REVIVAL MANUFACTURE EDITION \n\n\nZenith’s El Primero-powered chronographs are already a classic, having deviated very little from the original design 50 years ago. What makes this Chronomaster Revival Manufacture Edition special though, is its story.\nWhen quartz watches were putting mechanical watchmakers out of business in the mid-1970s, Zenith was sold to an American company that wanted to scrap production of all mechanical movements.\nThanks to one Charles Vermot, a rebellious employee who (rightfully) believed that there will be demand for such movements in the future, all the equipment and tooling were hidden behind a sealed wall in the attic of the Zenith manufacture.\nIts contents have since been discovered and safeguarded, leading to inspirations for limited editions like last year’s trio of Revival chronographs. This year’s novelty however, recreates a prototype dial that’s never been used before, featuring the tri-compax design in different shades of blue. It also follows the exact dimensions of the original Ref. A386 and, unlike the 2019 Revival watches, is cased in stainless steel and is not a limited edition. This will also be the last recreation of the A386 case.\nThe Chronomaster Revival Manufacture Edition was meant to be available exclusively to visitors of the Zenith Manufacture in Le Locle. But in light of current travel restrictions, the watch will be available through the brand’s e-commerce site in Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, the UK and the US.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Accessories ', '     Men ']}"

      Face masks are the new fashion accessories: How to match these with your outfit
  </h1>, 'text': 'Even as you’re making plans to step out in Phase 2, the face mask will remain part of our “going-out” gear for an indefinite period of time.\nEven if disposable surgical masks are now much more readily available, it might be less wasteful and more economical to put on a reusable fabric mask in situations where you won’t be in close contact with other people. The latter also provides an added perk by offering aesthetic appeal for those who are style-conscious.\nIs the fabric face mask a fashion accessory? It certainly can be, looking at the many interesting designs that have been produced ever since the battle with COVID-19 began. From designer versions that cost jaw-dropping sums of money to affordable ones that do the same job for much less – the choices are varied indeed.\nSince we have to live with the face mask, why not learn to embrace it? Make covering your face a little less tiresome with stylish designs that provide protection without cramping your style. You’ll need quite a few pieces to put on rotation – begin with these chic picks and learn how to mesh them with your style sensibility, while not compromising their protective capability.\n\n\nTHINK ABOUT BALANCE\n\n\nA post shared by Pierre Png (@pierrepng) on May 16, 2020 at 7:05am PDT\nIf you often wear clothes with prints, an unpatterned fabric mask will work better with your outfits. Think plain black is a tad boring? Jazz things up with a collection of masks in different colours. Alternatively, if you’d really like a mask with a loud print, tone down what you’re wearing on your body and allow your face gear to take the spotlight instead.\nIf you have returned to the office and are working in a corporate setting, a fanciful face mask might not set the right tone for your workplace’s dress code. Stick with masks in solid, neutral colours or the subtlest of prints, and save the funky prints for non-workdays.\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT FABRIC\n\n\nA post shared by OliveAnkara (@oliveankara) on Jun 13, 2020 at 10:11pm PDT\nFabric is everything when it comes to face masks – it will affect wearing comfort as well as whether you look smart or sloppy. Generally, thicker and stiffer fabrics like cotton have more form to them, and will look more presentable than those made with soft jersey.\nWe’ve even seen some fabric masks made out of silk and satin, which honestly are materials that are unlikely to hold up well against sweat and oil produced by the skin. Remember that there’s also moisture in your breath, which will show up very clearly on these types of fabric.\nIs a triple-layer construction absolutely necessary? There are no hard and fast rules about this, although it shouldn’t be so thick that it’ll affect the ease of breathing. In any case, there are mask liners and inner filters that you can purchase and use with your fabric mask for increased comfort and improved functionality.\n\n\nCHECK THE SIZE AND FIT\n\n\nA post shared by Lynda Lye (@littleoddforest) on May 13, 2020 at 6:15pm PDT\nUnfortunately, one size may not fit all when it comes to masks, and sizing options are not exactly wide-ranging, particularly for surgical masks. Many makers of fabric masks are, however, offering their wares in two sizes and also provide the exact measurements, as well as the option of tie fastenings, should you need a more customisable fit.\nTriple folds or a moulded front construction are standard requirements – they ensure that the nose and chin can be securely covered and create space for ease of breathing. Check for these features before buying your mask.\nIn the market for a new mask? Here are some options:\xa0\nFREE MOVEMENT’S PLUMP LIPS TRANSFORMATION FACE MASK, S$30\nThe neoprene fabric mask “transforms” when you laugh, showing off “your pearly whites”. Part of the proceeds goes to the ARC Children’s Centre, a non-profit charity that cares for children with cancer or life-threatening illness.\nhttps://freemovementsg.com/\n\nMADEWELL’S NON-MEDICAL FACE MASKS, S$31.60 FOR 3\nClassic prints of gingham checks, Glen plaids and tiny Swiss dots give these triple-layered masks a subtle dose of interest and style. They are made from leftover fabric scraps that would have otherwise ended up as waste – which translates to benefits for the environment.\nhttps://www.madewell.com/\nHOMESITE’S TOILE WASHABLE FABRIC FACE MASKS, S$65.40 FOR 3\nThese pretty masks will go perfectly with your Dior Toile de Jouy bag and don’t come with a designer price tag at that. They are made with two layers of 100 per cent cotton fabric and come with a choice of elastic ear bands or fabric ties.\nAvailable on Etsy here.\n\n\n\nSHOPBOP’S LE SUPERBE NO CHELLA FACE COVERINGS, S$36 FOR 2\nSince masks cover quite a large area of the face, why not make an artistic statement with the expanse of space? These painterly designs do just that.\nAvailable on Shopbop here.\nNILI LOTAN’S NL FACE MASK, S$16\nA simple, striped mask is kind of like a Breton tee – it’ll pair well with the majority of your clothes and is a classic item of perennial chic.\nhttps://www.nililotan.com/\nLITTLE ODD FOREST’S FOREST HONEY BEAR FACE MASK, S$32.90\nThere are also other options such as Fantastic Fox, Michief Monkey, Bunny Rabbit, Kooky Koala and Jungle Tiger, just to name a few. You decide what it’s going to be.\nhttps://www.littleoddforest.com/\nOLIVE ANKARA’S ETHNIC FACE MASK, S$19\nNot only are these super cool-looking, the makers have thought of everything – adjustable ear loops to offer a customiseable fit, its cotton wax material is breathable, reusable, washable and reversible, there’s even a pocket to fit a surgical mask for added protection. A portion of its proceeds will go in aid of migrant workers and the underprivileged.\nhttps://oliveankara.com/\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Even Savile Row’s tailors are switching from suits to work from home casuals
  </h1>, 'text': 'Many things have changed in the weeks since the UK went into lockdown – the least of them being that the suits in my wardrobe have started to look vaguely absurd. I have no idea when I am going to put one on again. The ties are dead, hanging there lifelessly like broken wind chimes. They’re toast.\nThis irks me a little because I like wearing suits. I would wear them more often, if it did not prompt so many people in the office to ask if I am going to a job interview. I realise, as a millennial, that this puts me quite firmly at odds with the prevailing sentiment. For my generation, comfort is king. Even before the pandemic, sweatshirts, trainers, even yoga pants and shorts were increasingly becoming permitted workplace attire. Now, with widespread working from home, they are all there is.\nNews has reached Savile Row. Made-to-measure tailor Richard James has just launched its first sportswear range, a collection that includes track pants, hoodies and T-shirts in striking colourways: Aqua, lilac, dove grey and egg yolk.\n“It’s a little bit anarchic, but it’s got our energy. It’s got our DNA,” said Sean Dixon, who co-founded the brand in 1992. Casualwear has always been a part of what Richard James does, Dixon says – a part that has become increasingly important as people’s attitude to work changes.\n\n\nThe 32-piece collection – titled the London Line – ranges from true activewear to more casual everyday clothes such as polo shirts and chinos. Despite its swagger, there is a certain elegance to it. Fits are true to size and silhouettes are clean and crisp. “We went back to the 1980s and looked at all those beautiful classic Fila and Tacchini sports kits,” said design director Toby Lamb. “The sort of thing that McEnroe and Borg were wearing.”\nOn John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg those kinds of clothes looked fantastic – sporty, masculine, effortlessly smart. But could they work for me? About three weeks ago I tried to go to the supermarket in Adidas track pants and my wife stopped me. I thought I had a kind of Paul Mescal in Normal People vibe going on. “You look unemployed,” she said.\nRichard James sent me some of its new collection to try on, with better results. The aqua T-shirt (£55; S$96) and hoodie (£95) I could get on board with. Teamed with a lightweight polyester mac in navy (£275), and I was starting to believe. Then I tried the track pants and the look collapsed. The public is not ready to see my short, lumpy frame in a minty green tracksuit. There is a catch to all this unstructured comfort – unless you are in great shape, it can be deeply unflattering.\n\n\nWith the collection two years in the making, its arrival just as the UK went into lockdown could seem like fortuitous timing. Many people are working out more than they ever have before, or they are hunched over a laptop all day, said Lamb, “and a lot of this product is ideal for working from home”.\nIn truth, it is a silver lining at best. This has been a terrible time for clothing retailers. Last month, Marks and Spencer announced a 21 per cent fall in annual trading profits, as its troubled clothing and home division was hit hard by the coronavirus shutdown. A few days later, luxury fashion house Burberry announced that sales had dropped 27 per cent in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, and that it was cancelling its end-of-year dividend to shareholders.\nAt Richard James, online sales are double what they are normally, said Dixon, but that does not nearly make up for the shortfall in in-store sales, and some staff have had to be furloughed. The company – which since March 2017 has been majority owned by New York-based real estate investor Charles S Cohen – is still planning to open a new store at 21 Noel Street in London’s Soho once the lockdown lifts. The London Line collection will form the basis of the line the brand sells there.\nEven before the virus outbreak, tailoring looked in trouble. Since 2016, suit sales in the UK have dropped by more than 24 per cent to £397 million.\nAccording to Anusha Couttigane, Kantar’s principal analyst in EMEA fashion, the decline in suit sales started in the 2008-09 recession, and has been compounded by the growing casualisation of the workplace.\n\n\nBut casualisation is not just about comfort, said Carolyn Mair, author of The Psychology of Fashion. It is also about status – and privilege. “When people ask me what they should wear at work, I say, ‘Do your homework. What are other people wearing?’”\nWhile those in more senior positions can get away with wearing casual or sports clothes to work, junior employees need to be more cautious about sending out the wrong message.\nLeafing through the suits in my own wardrobe, I wonder if we can ever go back to a more formal workplace. Because the move to casualwear does not always seem like the progress it is made out to be.\nWhen my dad came in from the office, he would change out of his shirt and tie and be done for the day. Now, thanks to the smartphones in our pockets, we are always working, and since lockdown, we are working in our kitchens and our living rooms and our bedrooms. Suddenly, wearing yoga pants and hoodies all day looks like a byproduct of the fact that we are required to give more and more of ourselves to our jobs.\nI ask Dixon if he thinks coronavirus has finally killed the suit.\nHe laughed. “Talk to me in a couple of months,” he said. “No, I think there’s always an action and a reaction to these kinds of things. There will be some perhaps so fed up of wearing pyjamas all day. They’ll think, ‘I want to put a suit and tie on.’”\nBy Nathan Brooker © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Myanmar ', '     WFH ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ']}"

      Masks and monochrome: What the Japanese are wearing on Tokyo's streets
  </h1>, 'text': 'The window of a luxury boutique on Omotesando, Tokyo’s fashion-laden avenue, will frequently turn my head. But it rarely stops me in my tracks.\nA few weeks ago, however, on an excursion from my house during Tokyo’s state of emergency, Saint Laurent’s shop grabbed my attention not because of what it was displaying but because of what it wasn’t: The entire ground floor was empty. The lights were on, bouncing off mirrored cabinets and the pale marble floor, but nothing was home. It was an astonishing statement, a luminous nihilism, while neighbouring boutiques at least nodded to normality with mannequins and stock.\n\n\nTokyo’s state of emergency, imposed in early April and lifted on May 25, was an unusual one. Because of the Japanese constitution, the government could only ask, rather than demand, shops not to open and people not to go out. While the former have largely obeyed, enough of the city’s population has disregarded the advice that even on starkly depopulated Omotesando, you have a good chance to observe lockdown looks as scorching summer comes in.\nAlmost everyone on Omotesando was wearing a mask. Looking from my vantage point in Asia, the fuss in the west about them – libertarians arguing about their right to cough in your face, influencers rushing to snap up something voguish – seems bewildering. On my pre-corona commutes from the chic Minamiaoyama area to the business district of Otemachi, generally half the subway carriage would be wearing standard white masks out of caution and hygienic consideration.\nOn the streets of Tokyo, the mask as a fashion item is non-existent. I must confess, however, that because of my own small stock and my lockdown boredom, I have been making masks out of old American Apparel T-shirts and an endless supply of ribbon I bought for a Taipei Pride costume. Issey Miyake won’t be calling me for advice on pleats, judging by those I’ve stitched, but I think they have a certain hygienic dash.\nIf my people-watching on a recent Sunday afternoon was any indication, Tokyoites are not letting coronavirus change their style, which, in my opinion, is the world’s best style. Black, white and (pale or navy) blue are still the order of the day, especially white tops, shirts and T-shirts and flowing black trousers, with plenty of shirt-dresses and a flush of Breton tops near the Meiji Shrine.\nHarajuku, famous for kawaii (cute) culture, cartoon characters and creepy schoolgirl kit, while ghostly earlier in the week, was a little busier, and grungier and more graphic. One man presented a chic paradox, cycling across the road in his STAY HOME T-shirt.\nTokyo’s summer is brutal, regularly above 30 degrees, nearing 100 per cent humidity on September evenings, and we are now clearly into a suitably lighter wardrobe – thin cotton, light shirts, though not much less black than in other seasons. The temperature was climbing on my Sunday outing, which made me even more appreciative of people’s efforts. All I want to wear in this heat is shorts and not much else. I do not understand the thermodynamics of the woman I saw in thick denim skirt-dungarees and a Victorian blouse.\nAlthough the number of people out on the streets has obviously changed since pre-pandemic days, the quality of their dress has not. When I actually have somewhere to go, my Sasha Velour T-shirt and billowing nikka pokka workman’s trousers should strike the right lust-for-life tone.\nDuring another lunchtime walk in Omotesando, I could not resist going past Comme des Garcons, whose glass spaceship flagship is an aggravatingly tempting five minutes from my front door. Oddly, given that the store has a closed sign, there were staff on the floor in their Comme garments – a woman in a ruffled red translucent skirt, another woman in a floor-length shirt-pantaloon dress, plenty of men in black.\nIn its windows were square black-leather bags with the painted slogan “My energy comes from freedom” and T-shirts reading “Thinking and doing will result in the future”.\xa0\xa0\nNot especially subtle, but at least it was a creative engagement with the global predicament, instead of a surrender to emptiness. More importantly, it feels like something we need to hear right now, as we emerge from captive spring into bright summer.\nBy Josh Spero © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Japan ', '     Tokyo ', '     coronavirus ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Shopping for shoes? Style cues from Zoe Tay, Rebecca Lim, Jeanette Aw and more
  </h1>, 'text': 'With many of us staying at home most of the time, footwear has been relegated to a bit of an afterthought. Well, except for sandals, which has had an increase of 54 per cent in sales in April on popular shopping site Net-A-Porter.\nBut on the whole, wearing shoes hasn’t been quite high on anyone’s list right now. And that spells bad news for our existing pairs. In this humidity, there’s a high chance that leather shoes can go mouldy, PVC can start flaking and rubber soles may crack or even crumble.\nSo if your pre-circuit breaker favourites didn’t make it, now might be the time to reconsider looking for new ones.\nNot sure where to start again? Here are some celebrity inspos to help you put your best foot forward for when you finally step out into the world.\n\n\nHI-TOPS\n\n\nA post shared by Nadya Hutagalung (@nadyahutagalung) on Dec 17, 2019 at 7:52pm PST\nThere are trainers and then there are hi-tops. That little extra in design not only provides much needed support for the ankles but at the same time, elongates the legs, which is why it is often paired with cropped pants.\xa0\nModel Nadya Hutagalung turned to a pair of\xa0canvas hi-tops to further elongate her statuesque proportions and\xa0ingeniously add street cred to her classic shirt and jeans combo.\nBOOTS\n\n\nA post shared by Sheila Sim 沈琳宸 (@sheila_sim) on Apr 18, 2019 at 3:12am PDT\nBoots aren’t just for trudging through harsh weather, they also make the perfect accompaniment to short hemlines as demonstrated by actress Sheila Sim.\nYou’ll want to take note that the finish and colour can make a world of difference to the same boot style – in light coloured suede for example, boots tend to look laid back whereas in shiny black patent leather, they look sleek enough for a sexy soiree.\nThe height of the boot also matters. Thigh-highs aren’t for everyone but there’s no stopping you from faking the look of thigh-highs simply by slipping on thigh-high socks. Same but different.\n\n\nLOAFERS \n\n\nA post shared by Rebecca Lim 林慧玲 (@limrebecca) on Apr 20, 2020 at 6:13am PDT\nLoafers are the lazy girl’s answer to formal shoes. Staple colours of black and brown are failsafe options that go with practically everything from work suits to weekend getups.\xa0\nMake like\xa0actress Rebecca Lim and add embellishment such as a recognisable monogram, some heritage cool horsebits or snappy chain links for an extra style kick.

Its cloth and jute combination is lightweight and therefore, perfect for the searing temperatures of summer.\nDesigners often auto-pilot to this traditional shoe whenever they needed to add a spring to their Spring/Summer runway collections. Some reinvented the shoe with flashes of eye popping colour. Others took it upon themselves to give this age-old shoe an overhaul with unusual materials like leather, suede and exotic skin. The experimental even added height to this classic masterpiece.\xa0\nThis mint colour wedge version seen on actress Zoe Tay is a completely updated version of the\xa0vintage shoe.\nBLOCK HEELS\n\n\nA post shared by Jeanette Aw 欧萱 (@jeanetteaw) on Aug 5, 2019 at 9:12pm PDT\nSkinny stilettos are easy on the eyes but super hard on your backs. Block heels, on the other hand, are much easier to strut around in and equally intriguing.\nFor starts, you can score the same four inches of extra height as the stiletto yet the block heel offers a much steadier stride that is similar to a wedge or a platform.\xa0\nThe chunky heel also means designers have more room to get creative. French shoe designer Pierre Hardy (who also designs for Hermes) fashioned a heel from stacking assorted circles and squares. Saint Laurent sent a shoe with its YSL initials where a heel should have been down the runway. Chanel trimmed the height of its heels with a neat line of pearls.\nActress Jeanette Aw got creative with her block heel. The facetted heel looked like it once belonged to a charming chandelier from an opt shop, lending a timeless vibe to her tres casual getup.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     celebrity ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      The future of fashion: Less ‘unnecessary product’, ‘less waste in fabric’
  </h1>, 'text': 'One Monday afternoon in May, in a sunbathed studio in Rome, Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele announced via a virtual press conference that the Italian label planned to reduce its yearly show schedule from five – three for women’s, two for men’s – to two. The brand has already cancelled its spring/summer show in September.\n“I don’t think we have enough time to listen to ourselves,” Michele said, intermittently waving a black fan. “We should not start over in the same way, breathless, because it has been too difficult.”\nThe hope, a spokesperson wrote in a follow-up email, is to produce fewer, more focused collections with a “greater emphasis on longevity”.\nThe brand’s Pre-fall and Cruise collections, which refresh the stores with new merchandise over the winter holidays and the summer, will be eliminated, although Gucci may still produce one-offs, such as collaborations or capsule collections for Chinese New Year.\n\n\nThe scheme still leaves Gucci with plenty of wriggle room to produce lots of stuff. But the move towards less – to show less, to produce less – is significant coming from a brand that has championed, both aesthetically and financially, “more is more”.\nSince the appointment of Michele and chief executive Marco Bizzarri in 2015, Gucci’s revenues have grown from €3.5 billion in 2014 (S$5.5 billion) to €9.6 billion, making it one of the world’s highest-grossing luxury brands.\n“I hope other brands will follow [our example],” Michele said.\n“We should not start over in the same way, breathless, because it has been too difficult.” – Alessandro Michele\nOthers are certainly considering it. In recent weeks, as stores and factories have closed, and major US retailers such as Neiman Marcus and JC Penney have filed for bankruptcy, members of the fashion industry have gathered, via video conference, to propose a reset of how they produce, show and sell collections.\nOne coalition, led by designer Dries Van Noten, Lane Crawford president Andrew Keith and Altuzarra chief executive Shira Sue Carmi, published a letter in May calling for a readjustment to the retail calendar, so that collections are sold in alignment with the seasons, and discounted only at the end. The group also proposed the industry cut down on “unnecessary product” and travel.\nA few days before Gucci’s press conference, I spoke with Van Noten, a Paris-based designer whose label is part of the Spanish fragrance group Puig, and Keith, of the Hong Kong-based luxury retailer Lane Crawford, on Zoom to discuss why they think the industry is in need of an overhaul.\n\n\nFT: Over the past decade, designers have dramatically increased the volume and frequency of new goods via “drops” and collaborations. Are we going to see those go away?\nKEITH: There is very much a place for new, exciting products. We need to stimulate customers, to get products in front of them at the right time, to be more agile within the season. [That could mean] smaller drops or special products for customers in particular regions. We need to get retail back into a position where it is not relying on discounts as the sole lever [to get customers to buy]. We need to get customers inspired again.\nVAN NOTEN: It’s also about respect. It’s not respectful for the customer who buys a winter coat in September to see that the moment it gets wintery, [the coat is discounted] 50 per cent. The customer who has a really strong love for fashion has felt manipulated. The luxury market has looked too much to fast fashion and the high street.\n""It’s not respectful for the customer who buys a winter coat in September to see that the moment it gets wintery, [the coat is discounted] 50 per cent.” – Dries Van Noten\nFT: If designers want to sell more at full-price, do you think prices also need to be lowered?\nKEITH: One of the issues that we have had is that pricing has not necessarily been consistent [across categories], and there is an opportunity to be more transparent. The pricing has to reflect the craftsmanship and the humanity and creativity that’s gone into producing it. Going on sale at the end of the season enables people who wouldn’t necessarily be able to buy at full price to have access to the products, and it should be like that. It’s about a balance. I’m not sure a blanket approach to reducing pricing is necessarily the way to go.\nFT: Do fashion weeks and fashion shows also need a rethink?\nVAN NOTEN: There’s not going to be a [women’s] show in September, we don’t have the budget, it’s not right to spend so much money on a show when maybe only 50-100 people can attend [because of social distancing guidelines]. Of course I’m going to miss it. I want to go back to that system, but in a more sustainable way, because now we realise we can do much better. It’s going to be really exciting what we can do digitally; maybe in the future it will be a combination of both.\nKEITH: The life of the buyer has been pretty horrendous, we’re constantly on the road, travelling 150-200 days a year. There is definitely an opportunity for us to do more digitally. [However,] if you’re selling [a collection] to a buyer using Zoom or FaceTime, there’s going to have to be a combination of [physical] fabric swatches that will make the experience richer.\n“The pricing has to reflect the craftsmanship and the humanity and creativity that’s gone into producing it.” – Andrew Keith\nFT: One way to cut down on travel would be to combine the women’s and men’s fashion weeks.\nVAN NOTEN: For me it would be very difficult. When we show, we get a lot of responses, positive, negative – we learn from it. We also get commercial input. Combining men’s and women’s fashion weeks would also be technically difficult because we couldn’t have all the clients at the same time.

      What will luxury shopping look like when Singapore stores reopen in Phase 2?
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s been quite a while since you’ve done any physical shopping, besides picking up essentials at the supermarket or pharmacy. Now that Singapore has exited the circuit breaker\xa0and\xa0embarked on Phase 1, Phase 2 – when retail stores, including luxury boutiques, reopen again – isn\'t\xa0too far away.\nTo discover how the luxury shopping experience will change as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CNA Luxury reached out to several brands to find out how they’re preparing to reopen, and what sort of measures will be in place.\nWill you have to queue for long\xa0before entering a boutique? Can you try on that bag you’ve been eyeing? Here’s what we found out.\nSTAGGERED ENTRIES, TEMPERATURE CHECKS\nWhen stores reopen again, get ready to factor in more time for your shopping trip. Prior to the pandemic, some luxury stores had already implemented some form of crowd control. When a store is particularly crowded, visitors are usually asked to queue outside before being let in. This is to ensure a pleasant experience for all visitors, as well as enable staff to ensure personalised attention to every customer.\nBut in Phase 2, expect to queue a little longer than usual. All stores are expected to implement staggered entries in order to better control the size of the crowd inside. When Thailand lifted restrictions on May 17, lines formed outside luxury brand stores at Bangkok\'s upmarket Siam Paragon mall\xa0as staff enforced new entry procedures.\nIn Singapore, these new entry procedures will include\xa0temperature checks for every customer. You\'ll have to check in with\xa0SafeEntry too. “The SafeEntry digital system will be deployed across all boutiques to facilitate contact tracing of all clients and employees,"" a Chanel spokesperson told CNA Luxury.\nSeeing that retail stores in Singapore are encouraged to implement this digital check-in system, we can expect the same at other luxury stores.\n""MAY I REFRESH YOUR HANDS?""\nOf course, all visitors and retail staff are required to wear face masks, as per existing regulations. But as you enter the store, don’t be surprised if a shop assistant greets you by asking, ""May I refresh your hands?"" When Paris emerged from lockdown on May 11, staff at the flagship Hermes store on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore\xa0greeted customers with this polite refrain.\xa0\nThough Hermes Singapore declined to comment on the measures the brand will implement in its\xa0local boutiques, saying that measures will be in line with government guidelines, Chanel said that customers will be asked to sanitise their hands before entering. In a press release, Capri Holdings, parent company of Versace and Jimmy Choo, indicated that hand sanitisers will be available in all boutiques globally, including Singapore.\xa0\nThe bottom line is, you\'ll be expected to have clean hands before exploring the store.\n\n\nNO TOUCHING OF ITEMS\nOnce you’re in the store, you may be asked to keep your hands to yourself. As sanitised hands are mandatory for entry, unnecessary touching of items in the store\xa0will probably be discouraged. In particular, the\xa0alcohol in hand sanitisers could damage leather goods.\xa0In Europe, sales assistants at luxury boutiques are warning customers not to touch items, which could also be applied here.\nBe sure to adhere to safe distancing measures when exploring the store as well. Even within the stores, Chanel said that “a distance of 1m\xa0[will be] maintained between persons at all times”. Capri Holdings said that signages will be placed around its\xa0boutiques to encourage customers to adhere to safe distancing guidelines.\nAt a Louis Vuitton store in Paris, safe distancing stickers were also placed on the ground outside the store. Louis Vuitton did not respond to CNA Luxury’s request for comment on local\xa0measures at the time of writing.\n\n\n‘SORRY MA’AM, THAT BAG IS IN QUARANTINE’\nSee a bag you like? Or a dress you fancy? Trying on items will not be as easy as before. Chanel informed CNA Luxury that “items will be quarantined for 24 hours after being tried on”. So don’t be surprised if sales assistants decline your request with, “Sorry ma’am, that bag is in quarantine”. Thus, our advice is\xa0to call the boutique to check on the status of a particular item before heading down.\nIf you’re particularly concerned about hygiene in the store, rest assured that thorough cleaning and sanitising procedures will be conducted, “with special attention paid to high-touch surfaces”, Capri Holdings said. In fact, Versace and Jimmy Choo stores may even operate under modified hours to allow for additional cleaning, the company said.\nCONTACTLESS PAYMENTS PREFERRED\nIf you do end up making a purchase, have a contactless credit card on hand. To minimise contact between clients and staff, customers will be encouraged to use credit cards and contactless payment at the register, Capri Holdings said.\nAt a Christian Dior store in Paris, the brand has erected Plexiglas shields by the counter. No word yet on whether this will\xa0apply to Singapore boutiques – a Dior spokesperson that CNA Luxury reached out to declined to comment on the brand’s measures in Singapore.\nFROM COMPUTER\xa0TO DOORSTEP\nAs Phase 2 looms closer, you may be excited to finally take a trip down to your favourite boutique, but there’s no need to rush. The silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that luxury brands have since ramped up their digital presence, with doorstep delivery to boot.\nFor example,\xa0Bvlgari now has an online store in Singapore. Hermes and Louis Vuitton both offer direct-to-door delivery. While Hermes’s local deliveries are handled by DHL, your Louis Vuitton items will arrive at your doorstep\xa0hand-carried by men in sharp suits.\nThe likes of Burberry, Loewe, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta also offer local deliveries. There’s also\xa0Marina Bay Sand’s virtual concierge that lets you shop from multiple brands such as Jimmy Choo, Fendi and Boss, with all your purchases delivered right to your doorstep.\nThough online shopping may not fully replicate the experience of browsing items at a physical boutique, it’s safe to say that even when stores reopen once\xa0Phase 2 rolls over,\xa0in-person shopping will no longer\xa0be the same.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     shopping ', '     luxury ', '     Singapore ', '     Phase 2 ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Creative Capital: How this serial entrepreneur became a crafty mask-maker
  </h1>, 'text': 'A few weeks ago, as I was perusing Instagram, a friend posted a story about a new and very stylish face mask she was sporting. It was a lovely, tailored mask made from a colourful traditional Japanese fabric with ear loops that were orange.\nMy friend also described it as well-fitted and very comfortable. Wanting to know more, I snooped around and found out that these attractive masks were made locally by one 28-year-old Juliana Yeow.\nMost well-known as a freelance host and emcee, Yeow has also been a radio DJ in the past. But what’s most interesting about this serial entrepreneur is how she turned into pretty serious craftsperson.\nHOW DID YOU START SUTAJIO?\nSutajio\xa0is actually a spin-off from a 30-day project I was working on during the initial ‘circuit breaker’ period. My intention then was just to push myself on the creative front, to design and create new items since live events were a no-go.\n\n\nThe face masks were the second project I posted, and at the time I made just five pieces out of a waterproof nylon material I had at home. My friend, Danli purchased one, and liked it enough to start sharing it with her friends. She got me my first 20 orders or so, and so I do credit her greatly for the existence of the brand.\nYOU’VE CURRENTLY PAUSED ON TAKING ORDERS, WHICH MEANS THE MASKS HAVE BEEN REALLY POPULAR. WHY DO YOU THINK YOUR MASKS HAVE BEEN SELLING AS WELL AS THEY HAVE?\nI’m super heartened by the response I’ve received for the masks, and it definitely is a combination of different factors leading to that. Face masks are undoubtedly the new necessary accessory moving forward. As it becomes our new normal, I imagine that more and more people would want to express themselves through different designs and styles.\n\n\nMost of the fabrics I use are imported Japanese cotton that have metallic gold or silver detailing on them, so really, the beautiful prints are the ones that are doing the work. From a product design standpoint, while it’s tricky to get a good fit for everyone with just one size, I opted for a higher coverage design coupled with a few additional features – a pocket to slot in an additional filter or surgical mask and adjustable elastic ear loops that allow the mask to fit most female and male faces.\nThe 3D structure of the mask also creates some room in front of the nose and mouth, making it a little easier to breathe and possible to wear lip balm. Finally, I’m super lucky to have some of my friends share the masks with their community on social media out of their own accord.\nDO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TO TURN THE OPERATION INTO A LARGER AND MORE FULL-TIME ENTERPRISE?\nOne of the reasons why I had to pause orders was largely because there was a limit to how many I could physically make in a day. Each mask is handmade individually from start to finish by a single person instead of a production line.\n\n\nSince\xa0Sutajio\xa0started four weeks ago, I’ve received help from both Danli and my mum, who help me to cut many of the fabric pieces outside of their WFH commitments. Right now, I have them both help me to cut the fabric pattern pieces on top of their full time jobs while I work on sewing, updating social media, packing and dispatching orders and whatever else that comes with running a small e-commerce business.\nThis week, I’ve also reached out to a couple of retired professional and hobbyist seamstresses – most of them elders who are more vulnerable and have to stay at home during this period – as well as others who might have been affected by the covid-19 situation to get them on board and hopefully help to provide some side income.\nCurrently, I have no plans to go full-time into the mask production business, and I do feel that the demand would be highly dependent on the virus situation overall as well as the habits surrounding mask usage. However, I’m keeping an open mind about things and I’d never say never!\nIS EVERY MASK UNIQUE? HOW HAVE YOU BEEN SOURCING YOUR FABRICS?\nEvery mask is certainly unique because they are all handmade from start to finish! As the pattern pieces are cut out from a single piece of fabric, every mask would have slightly different prints on it compared to if they were just mass manufactured and had the designs printed on.\nSince the start of the year, I’ve actually been working on launching a bag brand and was proactively prototyping at home. During that time, I got to know some of the local fabric suppliers whom I buy my materials from and so I now I can WhatsApp them directly to order my fabrics. Most of them are still pretty traditional businesses so they do not have e-commerce or much of an online presence.\nWHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR PASSION FOR HANDCRAFTED PRODUCTS COMES FROM?\nI think I’ve always loved to create! I initially applied to the NTU School of Art, Design & Media with the intention of majoring in Visual Communications but ended up deviating to Product Design after my foundation year.\nThere is just something wonderful about turning materials which have little function on their own into a product or tangible piece of art. I’m admittedly also very picky about details so where possible, I do like to be personally involved in the making process to have some control over the final product.\nCAN YOU SHARE ABOUT YOUR PAST ENDEAVOURS?\nOperation Overhaul – which is still running to this day – was the first business I started in 2011 with my childhood friend Roslyn. We both enjoyed crafting and brought different skill sets to the table – she was a graphic designer and I was then studying product design.\nAs we are a small craft agency providing personalised services to individuals and commercial brands, the both of us were involved in very much every aspect of the business from conceptualisation to production and accounting.\nConcreate Goods was my attempt at creating an independent brand after graduating from university. It was a continuation of my Final Year Project, having amassed knowledge and experience of working with concrete as a material for over a year.\nAs a one woman show, that meant full involvement in all aspects, from making the actual products to packaging design, photography and even setting up shop at local craft markets.\nKisetsu was my first foray into the world of manufacturing original designs and working with factories and suppliers. I worked on the creative direction and rebranding, and was also liaising with new suppliers, manufacturers, and shipping companies as the brand went through some restructuring. In 2019, I also helped launch the Kaizen wallet on Kickstarter, a crowdfunding site, raising over S$78,000.\nYOU’RE ALSO AN EMCEE, A HOST, A RADIO DJ…\nI genuinely love hosting events! Contrary to what people think, it’s a lot more than just speaking into a microphone to large crowds in public. It’s really all about the people and it is an amazing feeling to know that I get to be a part of a company or brand’s vision and help them communicate who they are in an event that usually takes weeks or even months of hard work to put together.\nI love that through hosting I get to meet and work with different people every time, and for every event I do, I learn a little more about a particular industry which I never knew before!\nWHAT LESSONS HAVE YOU LEARNT AS AN ENTREPRENEUR?\nI’ve never had any formal business training or education, but I’ve most definitely picked up some lessons through all the trial and error attempts over the years. Although all my businesses have been very small-scale, I’m lucky to have been able to experience different facets of business in each, getting a taste of being a service provider for an international brand, learning about merchandising and distribution for my own handmade products as well as dabbling in production and logistics for manufactured goods.\nOne lesson would be the importance of negotiation. This is definitely something I’m still working on right now but would be applicable in every business, and especially to a self-employed individual. It was important for me to distinguish what my service or business could bring to the table, and how to protect myself from an unfair deal that might hinder me from growing my business.\n\n\nI don’t think negotiation pertains to just monetary exchange but also to deliverables, timeline and working terms and conditions. Somewhat linked to the lesson above, I definitely also recognise the importance of maintaining business relations whether it’s with your client, vendor or business partners.\nI’ve experienced first-hand that when you take the time to connect with your network and find ways to create value in a partnership, that’s when you remain top of mind. I personally believe there has to be some level of give and take, and it’s not all about the chase to grab the biggest slice of the pie. The hardest lesson for me is learning that time is as important a resource, if not more important, than money.\nAll my businesses have had very low start-up costs due to their handcrafted nature and well, because I was doing everything myself. While it’s not a bad idea to keep expenses low in a business, what I didn’t realise was that I was actually paying with time. I’ve spent the majority of my twenties “always busy at work” but am now working to figure out my priorities, making time for myself, being okay with saying “no” and delegating tasks for more efficiency.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     Career ', ""     Women's Life "", '     Accessories ', '     fashion ']}"

      Can fast-fashion’s US$2.5 trillion supply chain be stitched back together?
  </h1>, 'text': '“As I am sure you are aware,” read the email, “the impact on retail will be vast.” It was only then, said Mostafiz Uddin, boss of Bangladeshi clothes manufacturer Denim Expert, that it fully dawned on him just how “vast” coronavirus was going to be for his business and his 2,000 employees, who stitch jeans for European high-street brands.\nThe note, from the UK fast-fashion retailer Peacocks, landed in Mr Uddin’s inbox on March 17 as several European countries and US states were entering lockdown. It explained that Peacocks would no longer be paying Denim Expert for any of the clothes it had ordered, including “stock already handed over”.\nWith shoppers forced to stay indoors, demand for new clothes has collapsed. Although some retailers are still operating online, revenue streams for many of the world’s largest companies have been wiped out, with rent and wages eating into cash supplies and stock piling up in warehouses.\n\n\nMcKinsey estimates that up to a third of global fashion players, such as brands and department stores, will not survive the crisis. And the impact is being felt all along the US$2.5 trillion (S$3.5 trillion) industry’s complex supply chains, hitting places where companies and employees cannot always access government-funded emergency support. Shuttered stores on London\'s Oxford Street very quickly transmit to closed factories in Bangladesh and Vietnam and stockpiles at the cotton farms of Central India.\xa0\nThe damage caused by the lockdowns in markets such as the UK raises the question of whether those supply chains can be stitched back together again – even in the unlikely event of a quick rebound in demand from consumers able to freely visit shops.\xa0\nSo at a time when retailers would normally be placing orders for their Spring 2021 collections, they are instead trying to unpick existing contracts. Peacocks has refused to pay for over 43,000 pairs of jeans that Uddin’s employees in Chittagong have already sourced, sewn or shipped. Topshop owner Arcadia has told Denim Expert – whose clients include Zara-owner Inditex and Canadian YM Inc – it will not pay for orders worth US$2.5 million.\nUddin said his employees tried to contact both Peacocks and Arcadia, proposing compromises for clothes still in production that would have enabled him to mothball his factory, but that neither retailer replied.\n“If I sue [the fast-fashion companies], I will forever be known as the supplier that sued its client. I would likely be finished as a business.” – Mostafiz Uddin\nArcadia, which has put roughly 90 per cent of its 16,000 employees in the UK on the government-funded furlough scheme, declined to comment. Peacocks initially said it considered its bill with Denim Expert to have been settled, explaining it was not aware of an issue, and called the cancellations “an essential step as, otherwise, we would be taking delivery of stock that we simply could not sell”. It did, however, later acknowledge that it had missed Denim Expert’s repeated demands for payment. Uddin said he has still not received any money.\nBangladesh is the second-largest exporter of garments in the world. And its clothing manufacturers have, since the crisis began, lost out on more than US$3 billion in payments for T-shirts, shoes and designer dresses already produced or sourced – a pipeline of months’ worth of clothes – according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA).\n\n\nThe industry makes up the lion’s share of the country’s export revenues and employs more than four million people, the majority women. Bangladesh industry groups estimate that over half of the workforce has already been laid off. In April, workers demanding that employers continue to pay wages clashed with police, prompting the government to step in and cover 65 per cent of wages – a loan that manufacturers are expected to repay. Some factories have reopened, raising concerns that workers are being put at risk to help the country reboot its economy.\nMark Cotter, chief executive of Baird Group, said the company behind menswear brands such as Ben Sherman has taken longer than usual to pay its suppliers “as money coming in to us has slowed down, but we have every intention to pay them”.\nHe does not understand the “legalities” of retailers refusing to pay for orders, but suspects that manufacturers do not have the power to object. “Behind the scenes, they might be saying ‘we’re not going to pay you, and you need to accept otherwise we won’t do business with you again’,” Cotter said.\nElizabeth L Cline, an author on labour rights and environmental practices in the fashion industry, argues that outsourcing has enabled retailers to distance themselves from risks in the supply chain.\n“Even though brands control everything about the supply chain, they’ve set it up so that workers cannot ask for what they need,” she said. The system is designed to operate similarly to the business model of gig economy companies such as Uber: “Let’s pretend our essential workers are not our employees and leave risk with people least equipped to deal with it.”\n“Even though brands control everything about the supply chain, they’ve set it up so that workers cannot ask for what they need.” – Elizabeth L Cline\nFAST-FASHION DEMANDS\nBangladesh, Vietnam and Sri Lanka are among the countries that have, in recent decades, become global production hubs for much of the rich world’s clothing, accessories and footwear. Once concentrated in China, manufacturing has moved to south and south-east Asia as retailers tried to lower their wage bill.\nThis approach went hand-in-hand with fashion retailers encouraging more frequent consumption of cheaper goods – so-called fast fashion – to drive revenue, said Patsy Perry, senior lecturer in fashion business at the University of Manchester. Many fast-fashion brands take in new stock every week.\nRetailers, she said, have always had the upper hand in their relationships with Asian manufacturers, with demands of retroactive discounts commonplace in the industry. “We hear a lot of talk about partnerships but if a supplier says it cannot agree to certain terms, then the retailer can always go somewhere else,” Perry said.\nUddin said he will not take legal action against clients that have left him with hefty bills. “If I sue, I will forever be known as the supplier that sued its client. I would likely be finished as a business,” he said.\nIn Vietnam, south-east Asia’s fastest-growing big economy before the pandemic, companies in the garment industry have already started “disappearing”, said Hoang Ngoc Anh, acting general secretary of the Vietnam Textile & Apparel Association.\nThe organisation estimated last month that if the lockdown lasted until June, the country’s textile and garment companies could lose more than US$500 million in revenues. However, the real figure will probably be much higher as official data do not capture the small suppliers likely to be severely affected by the collapse in demand.\n“Until now, about 400,000 to 600,000 workers have lost their jobs”, Anh said, out of the total 2.8 million workers in the sector. “This is an estimate, and we may be missing some smaller companies and micro enterprises.”\n“Until now, about 400,000 to 600,000 workers [in Vietnam] have lost their jobs. This is an estimate, and we may be missing some smaller companies and micro enterprises.” – Hoang Ngoc Anh\nCOTTON CRUNCH \nFurther along the supply chain from the retailers and manufacturers, Ganesh Nanote, an Indian cotton farmer in Maharashtra state’s traditional cotton-growing area Akola, is bracing for the impact of coronavirus. “Already our income is low and we cannot cope with more losses,” he said.\nThe cancellation of orders initially shaved almost a third off benchmark cotton prices since the start of the year and although they have rebounded slightly the International Cotton Advisory Committee, a global trade body, is forecasting that the average price for the upcoming 2020-21 crop year will fall to a 15-year low of 57 cents a pound.\nA leading producer and exporter of raw cotton as well as textiles, the impact on the Indian cotton supply chain is expected to be severe. Smriti Irani, the country’s textiles minister, appealed in April for international buyers not to cancel their orders. “Delivery schedules can be reworked. Payment plans can be extended. If we decide to work together, I reiterate my appeal – do not cancel orders,” she pleaded.\nThe plea went unheeded. A survey in April of 60 Indian garment factories by consultancy Rajesh Bheda showed that almost 40 per cent of orders were either partially or wholly axed.\nINDUSTRY SHAKEOUT\nDespite the torrid experience of bricks-and-mortar retailers in recent times, McKinsey last year labelled the global fashion industry one of the “rare economic success stories” of the past decade.\nBut behind that headline is a story of extreme consolidation. In 2019, 97 per cent of profits in the industry were generated by just 20 companies, including Inditex, the world’s largest clothing retailer, and sportswear retailer Nike – a dominance that is only likely to be tightened in a recession, said Achim Berg, who leads McKinsey’s consulting work on fashion.\nHe says that both fashion retailers and suppliers need to brace themselves for a “Darwinian shakeout”.\nH&M was one of the first global retailers to promise it would support manufacturers and the workers who make its clothes by paying for all ordered goods, including those still in production. “We want to ensure the future viability of the industry once the crisis has passed,” H&M said in a statement. Others\xa0such as Inditex, Marks and Spencer and Tommy Hilfiger-owner Phillips-Van Heusen\xa0have since pledged support for their supply chains.\n“We want to ensure the future viability of the industry once the crisis has passed.” – H&M\nBut some retailers have been accused of acting too slowly. Primark, the UK high street retailer, said in early April that it would pay garment workers affected by cancelled orders. But wages account for only about 15 per cent of the £256 million (S$446.9 million) worth of orders that\xa0Primark\xa0cancelled\xa0with Bangladeshi manufacturers, according to the BGMEA. The company, which before the crisis had monthly sales worth about £650 million, has subsequently announced that it will pay for clothes received by mid-April – worth £370 million to its global suppliers.\nNazma Akter, a trade unionist and founder of Bangladeshi labour rights group Awaj Foundation, said “charity” such as the Primark fund will do little to help affected workers. “They are protecting themselves, saying ‘we are taking responsibility’,” Akter said. “But our people are being beaten [by police] for protesting on the roads, asking for their money, and no one is with them.”\nBerg defends retailers, arguing that some are simply not in a position to pay suppliers. “It’s the biggest crisis for the fashion industry in over 100 years [ . . .] the first reaction has been to not pay anybody, not suppliers nor landlords,” he said. Primark’s owner Associated British Foods, which has furloughed 68,000 workers across Europe, is one of several UK businesses that has refused to pay quarterly rent to landlords.\n“It’s the biggest crisis for the fashion industry in over 100 years [ . . .] the first reaction has been to not pay anybody, not suppliers nor landlords.” – Achim Berg\nSupply chains will be different in the future, Berg believes. His clients are already trying to shorten the time it takes for an ordered shirt to arrive in shops, boosting their flexibility in the face of demand shocks. “The last couple of weeks have shown the vulnerability of the supply chain . . . and accelerated the realisation that you need to be closer to the source,” he said.\nThis chimes with those who have urged retailers to return production closer to home but, said Carry Somers, a designer and founder of the industry campaign group Fashion Revolution, “the garment industry is a lifeline for millions of people and a way of raising people, women in particular, out of poverty”.\nPaul Lister, head of ethical trade at Primark, does not expect the pandemic to have an impact on where the retailer manufactures its clothes in the future. “I think the system is very flexible,” he said, explaining the retailer works with more than 700 suppliers from Turkey to Cambodia. Adding that the long supply chains into Asia are important, allowing the company to “keep costs to a minimum"".\nBack in Chittagong – a seven-hour drive from the capital, Dhaka – Uddin’s factory has been operating at about 30 per cent capacity since the first week of May. But his warehouse is overflowing with jeans that he fears he will never be able to sell. And although he has received a few small orders, Uddin says his fabric suppliers are refusing to deal with him until they receive payment for denim that he never managed to ship.\nUnless retailers pay for clothes already in production, he said, he will have no business to save. “[And those payments] will not happen,” he added, “unless people understand the [scale of this] disaster.”\nVIETNAMESE PRODUCERS SWITCH TO PPE\nVietnam’s largest apparel producer, Garment 10 Joint Stock Company, is still negotiating payment of clothes contracted before COVID-19 struck. In pre-pandemic times, its regular customers included Marks and Spencer, C&A, Debenhams and Primark.\xa0\nFaced with plummeting demand, the company, which employs 12,000 workers in 18 factories across Vietnam, like some other producers in the country has pivoted to manufacturing something else: Face masks and other highly sought-after personal protective equipment. It recently signed a long-term agreement, said Than Duc Viet, the company’s deputy director-general, to deliver 400 million face masks to a global medical company based in Europe in the second half of this year.\nHanoi-based Mian Apparel, which has six garment factories and two washing plants in northern Vietnam, has also shifted to a medical footing. With foreign buyers’ demand falling for its shirts, jackets, and denim trousers, it is making masks and protective suits to guard against coronavirus transmission.\xa0\n“There is huge demand from the US, where some people are short of masks,” said James Jung, Mian’s senior sales director. He, however, makes clear that masks will not be a profit centre. “We are pursuing a reasonable price to be supportive for customers and workers, not pursuing profit.”\xa0\nMian had to cut working hours during the worst of the crisis by 20 per cent as some customers cancelled or postponed shipments of already produced goods. However, Walmart and Target were supportive during the crisis, the company said, and there are glimmers of hope as lockdowns end.\n“Women’s fashion brands plan to open stores in the US in the next few weeks, and we will see if the production we have been holding can be released soon,” Jung said. Mian is back to working regular hours.\nBy Patricia Nilsson and Emiko Terazono in London.

  </h1>, 'text': 'She is literally the face that launched a thousand social media posts. Noor Neelofa binti Mohd Noor – or Neelofa for short – is the stunning Malaysian actress, television personality and businesswoman who is highly sought after by brands ranging from fashion to tech, to front campaigns and grace events across the world.\nTo date, she is the face of Dior, Lancome and Swarovski. She has a shoe collection designed by Giuseppe Zanotti in homage to her style. She is seated on the front row at most of the glittering fashion shows she attends in New York, Milan and Paris. And she appeared in\xa0Forbes’\xa0influential 30 Under 30 list in 2017.\nNow 31, she is also one of Malaysia’s most-followed personalities (ranking second only to singer Siti Nurhaliza, according to a Silver Mouse survey in 2019) with a staggering 7.2 million followers on Instagram.\nWith such a formidable presence on social media, the former beauty queen is astute about the influence her celebrity affords her. She deftly wields it not just to grow her business and endorse brands she believes in, but also to support causes she is passionate about.\nDuring the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and Movement Control Order (MCO), Neelofa started a chat show on Instagram Live with the hashtag #BerseoranganBersama (#AloneButTogether) to raise awareness on COVID-19.\nHer first chat was with fellow actress Nora Danish (ranked third in the same Silver Mouse survey) to talk about the importance of staying home during this period. Subsequent guests included Malaysia’s ex-Prime Minister, Tun Dr Mahathir, as well as Dato’ Siti Nurhaliza.\n\n\nTaking an active role in COVID-19 relief, her modest fashion label Naelofar partnered with Mercy Malaysia to help the elderly, underprivileged and disabled communities affected by the pandemic. Her firm channelled a percentage of sales to provide food, personal hygiene products and other basic necessities.\n“This outbreak has affected so many people that I figured this was the fastest and easiest way to reach out to them. To be able to include Naelofar customers in this joint effort also gives me a good feeling, knowing that they can contribute to this too,” she enthused.\nWhen asked about what motivated her to take action, Neelofa revealed that she was particularly touched when she read about a single mother who lost her sole means of income: “This lady had to close down her food stall due to MCO and didn’t have an income to support her children. Thankfully, with our contribution, she was able to sustain her life again.”\nRUNNING A BUSINESS DURING MCO\nOn the business side, the young entrepreneur – whose brand has\xa0sold more than 10 million hijabs in the past five years, with RM50 million (S$16.25 million) of sales a year coming from Instagram itself – is happy to report that sales have been brisk.\nThis is largely because her company branched out beyond traditional brick and mortar stores early on.\n“I was worried that the pandemic might affect the business but it hasn’t done so. Well, not as bad as I expected, at least. The decision to introduce e-commerce into the business was a good one because everyone is constantly online now and everything can be done at our fingertips,” she said.\n“Naelofar is also now on Shopee which means a great deal for the business so I’m excited for that. However, operations-wise it was quite difficult to handle at first because only certain businesses were allowed to be open.”\nIn the run-up to Hari Raya, Naelofar Hijab adopted a different tact to marketing its products. While the main message of their campaigns has always been to encourage customers to feel good and look their best, this year the message included a reminder to appreciate the little things during Eid.\n“We wanted our customers to cherish not just the simplicity of it but the great joy that comes when we do so. I am grateful that we received really great feedback for Naelofaraya 2020.”\nFLYING THE FLAG OF MODEST FASHION\n“Every time I attend international events – specifically fashion weeks – I always carry the responsibility of spreading the true meaning of modest fashion.” – Neelofa\nFor one blessed in so many ways, it’s inevitable that success comes with its share of detractors but Neelofa remains philosophical about dealing with the occasional backlash. She takes it all in her stride.\n“I’ve been in the industry for more than a decade. I must say that it wasn’t easy to get used to the backlash at first, but I’ve learnt to manage it now,” she said.\n“I’m lucky to have a great team that assists me in handling this sort of situation. To be honest, most of the time, I usually don’t let it get to me because it would just affect my day or even my week. And I wouldn’t like for that to happen.”\nIndeed, Neelofa prefers to focus on the positive impact her influence can create, especially in changing the way Muslim women in hijabs are perceived.\n“Every time I attend international events – specifically fashion weeks – I always carry the responsibility of spreading the true meaning of modest fashion. Modest fashion is no longer conservative, rigid or even boring. It’s much more inclusive now and you can style the scarf or hijab in so many ways, not just for Muslim women but women all over the world,” she explained.\n“I think what differentiates me is [that I’m] a hijabi who has made her looks limitless. Besides that, more and more hijabis are being represented in the fashion industry, like Halima Arden (the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of Vogue magazine), which opens more doors for us.”\n\n\nNeelofa’s hijabi style isn’t being kept in the closet even during Malaysia’s extended MCO: The fashionista gamely dresses up even in lockdown.\n“During MCO, I wake up and get ready even though I’m at home. I still like to dress up to feel as though I’m heading out,” she laughed. “It gives me some kind of satisfaction to get dolled up even though my family and I are the only ones who can see it. And yes, I even succumbed to TikTok and dressed up to make my videos.”\nHARI RAYA IN AN ERA OF THE NEW NORMAL\nThis year, Neelofa spent her Hari Raya in Kuala Lumpur, in compliance with the Malaysian government’s restrictions on crossing state borders to balik kampung.\n“The vibe for Raya this year wasn’t that much different as I was very lucky to still be surrounded by my loved ones. However, celebrating it in an era of the new normal was a bit of a struggle because we still had to limit our socialising and it was my first time celebrating in Kuala Lumpur,” she admitted.\n“The feeling of not being in my hometown in Kelantan with my grandmother and doing the usual things definitely hit hard but I still felt blessed to have my close relatives here in KL. We also did the usual things like stuff ourselves with delicious Raya food, took OOTD shots and had an all-round wonderful time.”\nAs for facing life post-COVID, Neelofa is upbeat but humble, looking towards to her mother for inspiration.\n“My mother is my ultimate idol, she was the one that first got me into the business field and her amazing guidance and advice has made me the entrepreneur I am today,” she said.\nShe quickly acknowledged that her success didn’t come from her efforts alone but because of a great support system comprising her family, her team and her fans who are always ready to purchase the products she comes up with.\nBesides that, she describes herself as an opportunist, seizing whatever chances come her way. “Whether it’ll make a small or big impact, I still take it as a way to benefit me individually or for my business. I wish to take Naelofar to greater heights. With the new normal, we’ll have to make adjustments, but I look forward to it.”\n“The feeling of not being in my hometown in Kelantan with my grandmother and doing the usual things definitely hit hard but I still felt blessed to have my close relatives here in KL.” – Neelofa\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     celebrity ', '     lockdown ', '     business ', '     fashion ', '     Television & Movies ', ""     Women's Life ""]}"

      The COVID-19 pandemic has yet to dampen demand for luxury goods resales
  </h1>, 'text': 'When professional gambler Vegas Dave spent US$500,000 (S$711,000) on the world’s most expensive handbag, a diamond-studded Himalayan Birkin, he viewed it as one of the best marketing tools out there.\n\n\n“I was watching sports with a female friend of mine, we saw someone in the audience with a Birkin Bag and she thought it was crazy that people spend so much on these items. But I look at it as a piece of art,” he said. “I took it to big events, when I go to a [Los Angeles] Lakers game and sit on the floor, having the bag there with me gives me a lot of marketing. The people who sit courtside, they all know what a Birkin Bag is. They see it and think ‘What does he do, look me up and sign up to one of my gambling packages.’”\nWith stadia shuttered, will Dave – and those like him who crave the world’s most coveted luxury goods – lose interest now that there are fewer places to flaunt them? Are times for the super rich set to become so tough that they would even consider selling prized possessions? Or will all that time spent at home with time on people’s hands only have heightened desire?\nAccording to Dave, it’s the latter. “People still view it on Instagram, I’ll get 10,000 comments on it. Of course you’ll always have haters, people who say you could buy a house for half a million. But there are lots of houses for half a million, and there are only two of these in the world.”\nHe is not alone in his assessment that the pandemic has done little to dampen demand for the world’s most prized luxury goods. It has, however, led to some interesting trends in the broader luxury market.\nSELLING ELECTRIC DREAMS\nFor most of us, staying at home has meant donning leggings and hoodies. It’s different for the one per cent. Eager to impress on Zoom, sales of statement jewellery have shot up. The RealReal, an online luxury goods retailer, reported a 40 per cent rise in search demand from Cartier earrings and gold necklaces up 72 per cent month on month.\nAuction house Sotheby’s, meanwhile, set a new record for a jewellery piece sold online, selling a Cartier bracelet from the 1930s for US$1.34 million.\n\n\nThe pandemic is also catalysing a shift towards buying and selling even the most exclusive goods digitally. The auction house has reported strong demand for online sales, with traffic over the course of March increasing by 16 per cent – a trend matched elsewhere.\nA run on protective gear has affected the luxury market too: The RealReal saw scarf sales from mid-March to mid-April shoot up 24 per cent year-on-year.\nThe closure of physical stores has led to pent-up demand for luxury products. On its first day of re-opening, Hermes’ Guangzhou store raked in US$2.7 million, believed to be the highest-ever tally for a single boutique.\n\n\nIt has helped supply sellers in the secondary market too. Cecile Wickmann, chief executive and founder of rebelle.com, said the website benefited from higher supply from commercial sellers looking for “attractive alternative sale channels.” Karin Dille, head of B2B sales and estates at The RealReal, said: “A big draw with us is anonymity – [brands] appreciate the option to consign with us privately.”\nJane Angert of JaneFinds, a specialist in sourcing the world’s rarest and most collectible bags, said: “With all the Hermes stores closed, there’s an increased demand for the latest season’s bags. Many auctions have been postponed, meaning there are even fewer exceptionally rare pieces available.”\nShe added: “Being a small business, we’re still able to ship to people overnight. These are certainly challenging times, but people still want to treat themselves.”\n“These are certainly challenging times, but people still want to treat themselves.” – Jane Angert\nMONEY BAGS\nThe Birkin, long seen as the quintessential fashion accessory and touted as a better investment than gold or real estate, has also benefited from a gravitation towards classics.\n“When the economy is uncertain, luxury consumers want to focus their attention and bandwidth on smart collecting, straying from frivolous spending,” said Caitlin Donovan, head of sales for handbags and accessories at Christie’s America.\n“Our clients gravitate towards the classic pieces and heritage brands which have proven time and again to hold or appreciate in value, brands such as Hermes, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.”\nShe added: “As the market becomes more established, prices do too.”\nWickmann echoed this: “Some high-end luxury items of special brands – like Hermes – are proving more resilient in terms of prices than others.”\nDave, meanwhile, said the Birkin benefits not only from its rarity but its practicality – something which harks back to its origins. Named after British actress Jane Birkin, its design came about when – trying to place her wicker basket in the overhead locker on a flight between Paris and London – all of her belongings fell out. She complained to the guy sitting next to her that it was so difficult to buy a good-looking travel bag. It turned out the guy was Hermes’ then-CEO Jean-Louis Dumas and a legend was born, the original design penned on the back of an Air France sick bag.\n“I have a black crocodile Birkin that I use every day – I love it, some girls think I am crazy because I use it for my laptop. But it’s spacious, it’s big, I wouldn’t use anything else.”\nWe’ve mentioned that the prices of essential items have shot up since the pandemic began. What counts as essential, though, really does lie in the eye of the beholder.\n“Our clients gravitate towards the classic pieces and heritage brands which have proven time and again to hold or appreciate in value, brands such as Hermes, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.” – Caitlin Donovan\nBy Claire Jones © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Halima Aden reflects on Ramadan, modest fashion and her dream Eid outfit
  </h1>, 'text': 'Halima Aden is used to breaking barriers. Born in Kakuma, one of the largest refugee camps in Kenya, she moved to America when she was seven. In 2016, she joined the Miss Minnesota USA competition. In a game-changing moment, she donned the burkini, a modest swimsuit that covers the whole body except for the face, hands and feet, for the\xa0swimsuit round.\nSince then, the Somali-American model has gone on to push the boundaries in fashion. She has become the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of Vogue, and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit issue in a burkini. Aden has also walked the runway at fashion weeks for brands such as Yeezy, Tommy Hilfiger and Max Mara, all while donning the hijab.\nIn a recent interview with Net-a-Porter’s digital magazine\xa0Porter, Aden shared her thoughts on her Muslim identity, memories of Eid and championing the modest fashion movement. Here are some insights.\nON RAMADAN\n“Ramadan is our holy month in Islam for Muslims partaking in the holiday, but I think it’s a time for us all right now, while so many of us are at home – hopefully with family. The things that Muslim families typically practice during this time are now being shared by the entire world – reflecting and bonding with loved ones; it really is a time of self-growth.\n“Although nobody expected the world to shut down, I think one of the best things we can take away from this period is the extra time we’ve been given, because we all have busy schedules, work and life commitments. This month, I have much more time to reach out to some of those relatives I probably wouldn’t have, or to people I’ve lost contact with over the years. It is a time to reconnect – and not just with yourself.”\n“Although nobody expected the world to shut down, I think one of the best things we can take away from this period is the extra time we’ve been given, because we all have busy schedules, work and life commitments."" – Halima Aden\nON HER CHILDHOOD EID MEMORIES\n“There is always a big emphasis on what children wear for Eid. Growing up, I remember my mother having my outfit ready and laid out a month in advance. One year, I even recall sleeping in my fancy attire, as I was so excited to try it on the night before and knew I would be waking up early for prayer. I remember so much of that time, from the ages of about eight to ten, when I would go shopping with my mom.\n“Where I live in Minnesota, we have the largest Somali diaspora community in the US, so there were a lot of girls around my age who were also celebrating. We didn’t really have the option of modest fashion back then, so it was about running to the Somali stores, because a lot of the shops would get their Eid shipments around a month in advance. I was like, ‘First come, first served – we’re going, Ma!’”\nON DONNING THE HIJAB\n“I always knew the hijab was a big part of my identity. I still want to be able to attend a red carpet, or my cousin’s wedding – different events throughout life – and feel glamorous, beautiful, confident and wear something that still says, ‘I’m 22 and so full of life!’ For a very long time, finding looks that were modest but still modern was impossible.\n""I’m so grateful we’re living in a time where the modest movement has taken off and people are realising it’s the oldest fashion staple, and not just for Muslim women – so many women choose to dress modestly.”\n""I’m so grateful we’re living in a time where the modest movement has taken off and people are realising it’s the oldest fashion staple, and not just for Muslim women – so many women choose to dress modestly.” – Halima Aden\nON THE MODEST FASHION MOVEMENT\n""It’s not as if Muslim women don’t want to look classy or go to the gym. There’s a huge need, and I think companies are waking up to that. Whether I had a part in that I can’t say for sure, but throughout my journey, the conversation has changed. I’m still getting messages from parents telling me their daughter is taking swim classes for the first time, and that means so much to me. Even to this day, I don’t know how to swim, because I didn’t grow up with a burkini as an option.\n""It goes so much deeper than just clothes and looking good and what’s on trend – it really is something that will impact the lives of so many women. I’m incredibly happy these girls are getting a chance I never had, and my mother’s generation never even came close to having, which is positive representation: A\xa0young woman of colour who wears a hijab, who’s Muslim, who lives in a small town in Minnesota and still made it in fashion. I didn’t have to change who I am; that is the message I think it gets to these girls.""\n""I’m incredibly happy these girls are getting a chance I never had, and my mother’s generation never even came close to having, which is positive representation: A\xa0young woman of colour who wears a hijab, who’s Muslim, who lives in a small town in Minnesota and still made it in fashion."" – Halima Aden\nON WHAT SHE’S WEARING FOR EID\n“I already gave a preview on my Instagram of what I would probably wear this year. It’s a white dress by\xa0Ellery, and it’s so extra – my family would probably laugh me out of the room if I wore that look. In Minnesota we’re still really laid-back in terms of fashion; I think in reality I would most likely wear a cute summer dress with a blazer or a patterned skirt; something a bit more toned down but still classy. But in my dream Halima world, I would wear that white gown to enter Eid in, with the scarf styled like a ponytail, draping over one shoulder.”\nRead the full interview here\n', 'related_topics': ['     Ramadan ', '     fashion ', '     Profiles ', ""     Women's Voices "", '     celebrity ']}"

      Will department store shopping ever be the same in the post-pandemic era?
  </h1>, 'text': 'When department stores reopen their doors, a familiar whoosh will still greet customers at the entrance: The sudden gust of air-conditioning, the gleam of polished marble floors, the sensation of not really knowing where to start.\n\n\nBut beyond the doors, new and unfamiliar sights await: Hand-sanitiser dispensers scattered on every surface, employees smiling through their face masks, signs displaying checklists of “what we’re doing to keep you safe.” When Saks Fifth Avenue reopened in Houston, Texas, the store stamped a trail of warnings on its white tile floors, in blocky black text, asking shoppers to “please maintain social distancing of at least six feet (1.8m) from others.”\nThis is department-store shopping during a pandemic.\nAfter months of lockdown, the world of retail is reawakening. Stay-at-home orders are beginning to lift, even as coronavirus-related deaths mount. And in those places, department stores – when not preparing to file for bankruptcy – have been among the first to come back, rolling out detailed safety plans.\nSaks Fifth Avenue began unlocking its doors in Texas two weeks ago and said it aims to open a few Ohio and Florida stores this week. Galeries Lafayette began to reopen its stores in France last Monday. Nordstrom said that by the end of May, the company plans to have 32 stores open – a combination of full-line stores and Nordstrom Rack locations in South Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Selfridges and Harrods are also expected to reopen in the coming weeks, subject to British government directives.\nSo far their plans are similar: Employees will wear face masks and submit to health screenings; some store layouts will be reconfigured to create more space and promote one-way traffic flows; customer capacity will be limited; stores will be cleaned more often; hours will be reduced; hand sanitiser will be liberally available; in-store events or any services requiring close contact (beauty tutorials, bra fittings) will be suspended or adapted.\nThere are also a few differences: At Nordstrom all employees will wear gloves, for example; at Saks they will not.\nYet even with these plans announced, or soon-to-be announced, none of the retailers know how they’ll be received.\n“We have this idea of what it’s going to look like when we open the doors,” said Jamie Nordstrom, the company’s president of stores. “We’ll be wrong about half of it.”\n“We have this idea of what it’s going to look like when we open the doors. We’ll be wrong about half of it.” – Jamie Nordstrom\nDespite years of financial turmoil, the purpose of department stores has largely remained unchanged. They are still one-stop shops for a sprawling catalog of goods; they are still home to Santa Claus photo ops and panic buying before the holidays; they still exist in the imagination as settings for movie makeovers and dressing-room montages.\nMany people are hungry to have this kind of shopping experience again. But many are also feeling “psychologically vulnerable,” said Michael R. Solomon, a consumer behaviour consultant.\n“Obviously it’s going to be a downer,” he said. “Nobody wants to be out there wearing a mask, even if it’s from Gucci.”\nConsumers may turn to shopping, as they have in the past, to deal with the emotional stress of this moment. Yet how can they escape that stress when they’re surrounded by reminders of it?\n“The most basic thing people will be looking for is health and well-being: Am I going to be safe?” said Mary Portas, a retail consultant and broadcaster. “That said, the fact people want to come to that space means they are going to buy. They have made the effort. They have intention.”\n\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS\nFor pandemic-era retailers, the more obvious signs of cleaning, the better. One commercial cleaning company, Enviro-Master, has even begun offering clients certificates to hang in their windows proving they received a “virus vaporiser” service.\nVisibility offers reassurance, and wary shoppers need reassurance. That starts at the entrance to their stores.\n“It’s important that the measures implemented are visible and become rituals,” said Andrew Keith, the president of Lane Crawford, the high-end department store chain in Hong Kong and China (where its locations, bar one in a Beijing mall, remained open throughout the coronavirus outbreak).\nKeith said that his store’s employees, like most others, must wear masks and have their temperatures checked when they arrive. So must Lane Crawford customers (who also declare their travel histories). Such policies are unlikely to catch on in other regions, Portas said.\n“I can’t see somewhere like Britain having temperature checks on every entry and exit point for customers,” she said. “It doesn’t feel like a cultural fit. What feels reassuring in Asia might feel off-putting here, when buying a new piece of fashion. It is still about selling a dream, after all, even if this is the new retail reality.”\nThis is the challenge of reopening an upscale department store right now: Fitting the dream of luxury shopping – “the treasure hunt,” as Solomon put it – into the anxious reality of an ongoing pandemic.\n“In stores like this, you want to appeal to the senses, and not just visually,” he said. “You want to use textures and touch – and wearing gloves and so on doesn’t help that. So you design around that.”\nMJ Munsell, a retail designer and the chief creative officer at MG2, an architecture firm in Seattle, offered a number of ways retailers can manufacture warm environments upon entry. They could have associates show personality with customised protective gear; build elaborate and delightful displays of merchandise; diffuse memory-evoking fragrances throughout the store; or play high-quality music to boost energy, particularly when there are fewer shoppers around.\nCompanies shouldn’t take these steps only at their outsize flagships in New York or Los Angeles, Munsell added, but at their comparatively overlooked suburban locations, too.\n“The retailer who is going to succeed is going to understand the value of that suburban experience,” Munsell said.\n\n\nWHO GETS TO BE A VIP?\nThe beating heart of a department store is the beauty counter – typically on the first floor, near a busy entrance, staffed with eager and eagle-eyed representatives from each brand.\nMakeovers and smoky-eye tutorials happen here. Perfumes are spritzed and moisturisers are sampled there. A lot of money is spent. But without skin-to-skin contact, the experience of testing and purchasing products will change dramatically.\n“Brands are going to have to be very inventive,” Munsell said. “We still need someone to help us through the vast assortment of choices.”\nVirtual try-ons – technology already used by Sephora and Ulta, among others – could become standard. Employees will need to find new ways of demonstrating how to use products; they may still be able to put eye makeup on a customer (though that could violate social distancing), but lipstick and bronzer can’t be applied behind a face mask. And not everyone will want a high-touch, high-technology experience.\nAs with makeup, the experience of trying on clothes in a fitting room – those small, and confined, shared spaces – will also change.\n“Are customers going to feel safe going into a dressing room?” Munsell said. “Do we need to consider spacing them out or making them larger? Having them be by-appointment so they can be sanitised by a sales associate in advance?”\nAt Saks and Nordstrom, clothing brought into fitting rooms will be quarantined (48 hours at Saks, 72 at Nordstrom) before being returned to the sales floor. The same goes for returns – and Nordstrom expects its first few days back in business to be dominated by returns of merchandise bought online during lockdown.\nAt Saks, foot coverings used when trying on shoes will also be thrown out after one use. Nordstrom will rely on visibility, spacing out dressing rooms and posting forms indicating the last time they were cleaned – which will be after every customer, the company said.\nIf this all sounds like a more intimate, personalised and VIP-style experience than the traditional shopping trip, that’s intentional.\nMost high-end department stores are expecting foot traffic declines in the high-double digits when they reopen their doors, particularly in cities dependent on tourist shoppers. In Paris, Nicolas Houze, the Galeries Lafayette chief executive, said that he does not expect to see a return to normal levels of business until the end of 2021, adding that it had lost “hundreds of millions” of euros worth of expected sales.\nBut the expectation is that those shoppers who do return in the coming months will be far more likely to buy. Simply put, retailers need to be selling more goods to fewer shoppers. And that means rolling out the red carpet.\n“Last Monday, we had an extraordinary transaction in Beijing,” said Keith of Lane Crawford. “A customer contacted her stylist and said she was making one of her first journeys outside her home since January, and she wanted to come to the store but only had an hour. She bought 80 pieces of ready-to-wear and accessories, a total transaction of 1.4 million renminbi” – around S$279,000 at current conversion rates — “in that hour.”\nA tiny handful of shoppers can afford such a spending spree, but customers should expect a higher degree of service and attention, regardless of how much they can spend.\nMarc Metrick, the president of Saks, said that while store hours will be reduced, the company will offer by-appointment shopping before opening and after closing, “giving people the opportunity for one-on-one service when the store is limited to just a few customers.” Virtual appointments to shop via video conferencing are also in the pipeline. Lane Crawford has introduced an app that lets associates send personalised looks to customers.\n“Brands are going to have to be very inventive. We still need someone to help us through the vast assortment of choices.” – MJ Munsell\n\n\nDINE AND DASH\nBefore the pandemic, retailers were increasingly entering the hospitality business. But for now, department-store dining options – from coffee shops to cocktail bars – in cities like London and New York are shuttered. When they do reopen, most will adhere to the local directives are in place for the hospitality industry, from double spacing between tables and online rather than physical menus.\n“It’s certainly going to look different for some period of time,” Nordstrom said.\nIn Britain at least, food service has started to resume in some department stores. The food hall at Selfridges reopened on May 1, albeit with a limited number of shoppers allowed inside, a one-way traffic policy, hand sanitiser pumps everywhere and sneeze guards for staff, who also have their temperatures checked once a day.\nEventually, it’s assumed, food and beverage service will return to normal. Strict social distancing measures will be relaxed – like Saks’ decision to close off elevators to customers unless they are elderly, pregnant or disabled. (Escalators are still in service, though steps will be marked to keep shoppers 1.8m apart.)\nBut the last stop customers usually make at a department store – the cash register – may permanently change.\nAt Lane Crawford, centralised cash registers have been replaced by remote points of sale to limit lines, while associates roam floors with tablets or phones (wearing gloves to handle all cash and credit card transactions).\nWestern department stores are likely to follow suit, with many looking at how to install contactless checkout and create more space at stores for curbside pickup and returns and “click and collect” stations, where customers can claim items they already bought online.\nAccording to Portas, these services will become increasingly important as customers adjust to shopping in the COVID-19 era. Many shoppers will be too nervous or unable to browse or linger in line, she said. Munsell added that she expected to see more stores using Apple Pay, or their own apps, for payment transactions.\nDepartment stores were already becoming more technologically savvy, bridging their e-commerce and brick-and-mortar businesses.

      Roman jeweller Bvlgari launches Singapore online store ahead of Italy

      Light after the lockdown: What the future of fashion and luxury will look like
  </h1>, 'text': 'Not since 1939 have the worlds of fashion and luxury so completely ground to a halt. Stores are closed, orders cancelled, factories shut or repurposed to make PPE. The summer fashion shows have been called off, and it looks increasingly unlikely the September fashion weeks will go ahead – brands such as Saint Laurent and Tory Burch have already cancelled their shows.\nNo question, the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a reckoning for the £2.2 trillion (S$3.8 trillion) fashion and luxury industries – much of it around sustainability (and fashion’s lack thereof). What will emerge? Could a more responsible sector – one less damaging to the environment, that goes further to ensure the welfare of its workforce – materialise in its wake?\nEnvironmentalists are certainly hoping so. The fashion industry has been making far too much for far too long. Clothing production has become so cost-effective at scale that brands would rather over-manufacture by 30 to 40 per cent than risk running out of stock. Much of that excess ends up incinerated or in landfills – Burberry famously burnt £28.6m in bags, clothes and perfume in 2017 to prevent them from being stolen or sold for too little (a practice it has since halted).\nSince Europe went into lockdown, designers and executives from Giorgio Armani to Vetements’ Guram Gvasalia have been calling for change. They want their peers to produce less and less often. They want customers to buy more at full-price, and are petitioning retailers to realign the sales calendar so that summer sandals and dresses are discounted at the end of the season, in late September, rather than June. (Right now, flush with excess inventory, they are holding sales earlier than ever.) They are asking for an end to retail contracts where designers are given no order deposits and no security, and which leave designers financially liable for what stores can’t sell at full price.\n\n\nMany of these demands are wishful thinking. Independent designers will not secure better terms with retailers, who will be more beholden to creditors and big brands – and less able to make risky bets on lesser-known names – than before. Nor will suppliers obtain better terms with designers – with so few orders coming in, brands will be asking for discounts, and they will get them. Garment workers will in turn find it even more difficult to secure a living wage.\nChanges under way prior to the pandemic will accelerate. The big luxury brands, backed by even bigger conglomerates – namely LVMH and Kering – will rebound first and capture even more market share. The few globally recognised names that maintained their independence in the wake of the 2008 crisis – Prada, Ferragamo, Burberry, Tod’s – may take a look at their balance sheets and reconsider. Department stores will continue to consolidate and disappear – not just in North America, but perhaps also in Europe, which is more dependent on tourists.\nChinese shoppers, who were already shopping more at home following VAT cuts and a crackdown on daigou (personal shoppers who import luxury goods into China without paying duties), will be more likely to buy an Hermes bag in Shanghai than Paris or Hong Kong. Brands will close stores in capital cities and tourist destinations as a result.\n\n\nIt won’t be all doom and gloom. Fashion’s impact on the environment – the amount of carbon it produces, the millions of litres of dye that pollute the world’s waterways, its contributions to soil erosion and biodiversity loss – will drop sharply this year. Labels will produce fewer, smaller collections over the next few quarters, even years. Having seen the risks of a global supply chain, American brands will reinvest in local manufacturing, furnishing new jobs and skills.\nSeasonal trends will continue to disappear as designers focus more on classic items that can be worn year-round – and stay on store shelves longer. The shift to more restrained, timeless pieces will ultimately give way to exuberance and excess – just as wartime fabric rationing paved the way for Dior’s New Look in 1947, and the 2008 financial crisis set the stage for Alessandro Michele’s Gucci debut in 2015.\nFashion shows will get a much-needed overhaul. Already, the volume of resources poured into 10-minute shows – sometimes involving two full days of travel to see a single collection in Rio or Marrakesh – felt outrageous amid a climate crisis. They are also boring to watch online. Instead, brands will experiment with digital presentations and live interactions with designers. Storytelling around brands and collections will improve as a result. It already has.\nFashion weeks will be smaller. Many designers won’t be able to afford to host them. Nor will magazines have the budgets to send editors to attend them. Deep-pocketed brands will fill seats with more influencers, exerting yet more control over third-party coverage. Unable to host showroom appointments, brands will invest in better showroom software, leaving buyers with less reason to travel in the long-term. This will be good for the industry’s carbon footprint.\nShopping habits will change. With less disposable income, consumers will be more conscious of what they buy, treating luxury items as investment pieces that will serve them for years – or at least hold their resale value. The shift in spending from high-end handbags to health – skincare, supplements, boutique fitness classes – already on the rise pre-pandemic, will continue. Online shopping will become more of a habit. Similar to the 2008 recession, there will be more support for buying second-hand and directly from small businesses who manufacture responsibly. Others will turn to fast fashion for cheap thrills.\nOstentatious purchases will be out – athleisure, which was losing its appeal, will be back in. To quote GQ, we are living in the age of sweatpants and are never going back.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     luxury ', '     Pandemic ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      COVID-19: How the Singapore fashion community is pivoting to make face masks
  </h1>, 'text': 'Singapore-based Tala Alamuddin, sister of human rights lawyer Amal Clooney (yes, George Clooney’s wife), recently copped some flak for being tone-deaf by selling luxury face masks, priced at S$46 each, on her website. Accused of profiteering from the pandemic, the fashion designer eventually had to clarify that all proceeds from the mask sales will be donated to the Singapore Red Cross in aid of those directly affected by the coronavirus.\nBut while her gesture seems to have been taken the wrong way – at least initially – this has not stopped a slew of local designers from stepping up to contribute to alleviating the mask shortage that Singapore is currently facing.\nFrom fashion brands with in-house ateliers to local tailors and independent designers and even fashion school students, many in Singapore’s fashion community have risen to the challenge of pivoting their work to produce masks for the needy.\nArguably one of the most ambitious initiatives is bespoke tailor brand CYC’s plan to produce 300,000 masks for migrant workers. Even before the circuit breaker was implemented, Loo Fern Fong, managing director of CYC, said she felt a calling to find a way to alleviate the plight of foreign workers in the country.\n“I often see the foreign workers on the streets doing all the work that we Singaporeans do not want to do and I felt sorry for them and concerned about their safety during this pandemic,” said Loo.\nSo, she enlisted her team to begin prototyping and testing various mask designs to test their efficacy. As one of Singapore’s most established tailors, CYC already has the capability to cut the large amounts of fabric to size for the masks. What they needed were more people who could sew to help piece the masks together. The Textile and Fashion Industry Centre, the training arm of the Textile & Fashion Federation (TaFF), volunteered to help with the mask making efforts, inspiring Loo to also crowdsource for volunteers to sew the masks.\nSince then, in collaboration with TaFF, other fashion brands such as Bodynits, Common Suits and Fuchsia Lane have mobilised their sewing staff to pitch in. In addition, the Fairmont Hotel and other organisations including the Singapore Prison Services and Tzu Chi Singapore have contributed to sewing efforts.\nCYC also has an online application form for individuals who have the capability to sew 300 masks within 10 days to volunteer their skills. They will contact these volunteers – about 200 out of 4,000 sign-ups have been selected – on a rolling basis, to ensure proper coordination of logistics. To date, about 40,000 masks have been made.\nOthers in the fashion community have also found various ways to make a difference in this crisis.\nFashion brand Klarra’s design team has donated a batch of reusable non-medical masks to Project Masks by The People’s Association Women’s Integrated Network Council, while bridal designer Fatimah Mohsin launched an independent project to make washable masks for frontliners in Singapore.\nSingapore-based designers Ifeoma Ubby of Olive Ankara and Nicolas Laville of Nicolas Laville Couture have also turned to mask-making, with some proceeds from the sale of their masks going towards charities.\nUbby’s masks are made of African wax print fabrics and are reusable. “These are not medical masks (but thanks to the double layer construction you can fit your surgical mask inside for higher protection),” she wrote on Instagram, adding: “10% of the revenue will be donated to local charities helping migrant workers and Singaporeans in need.”\nLaville, a couturier who used to work for Anne Fontaine, Kenzo and Christian Lacroix and who now produces bespoke gowns and wedding dresses, applied his pattern-making skills to producing (non-surgical) masks, “Using material that I had and not used at all. Some were personalised as well.”\nLaville’s initial batch of 55 masks have sold out, but those who are interested can send him a WhatsApp message (details on his website) – 80 per cent of the proceeds will go to charity.\nThese efforts have in turn gone on to inspire even more kind hearted souls to pitch in with their skills. About a week ago, Corneliu Dinu Tudor Bodiciu, lecturer-in-charge of the Fashion Design and Textiles Programme at the School of Fashion, Lasalle College of the Arts, began sewing masks for migrant workers at home, made with sponsored fabrics and cotton bedsheets.\nWhen his fashion design students heard of what he was doing, he was touched that they began to offer their help as well, even though they are currently in the midst of completing their final year school submissions without access to the school’s design facilities. About eight of them will start sewing within the week, he told CNA Luxury.\nUltimately, those involved in mask making say they hope the fruits of their labour will convey their gratitude to the workers and frontliners who have consistently contributed to the country’s growth.\nSaid Loo, “The overwhelming support from so many Singaporeans show that our people do have a heart for migrant workers and that we are all very grateful for the work that they do in Singapore. We are thankful that there are so many people who are so committed to be on the frontline.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     fashion ', '     coronavirus ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Malaysian fashion designers to produce hospital gowns for healthcare workers
  </h1>, 'text': ""It’s been said that man never made any material as resilient as the human spirit. The human spirit is fine fighting fettle among the Malaysian fashion designers who are mobilising their workshops to make much-needed PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) gear for hospitals.\n\n\nTaking the lead is renowned fashion designer and newly appointed President of MODA (Malaysia Official Designers Association) Melinda Looi, who’s more accustomed to making clothes for fashionistas and socialites rather than utilitarian gowns, face masks, head and shoe covers.\n\n\nA post shared by Melinda Looi (@melindalooi)\nWhen the country’s Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented on March 16, Looi took to Instagram to announce that her Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur boutique would be shuttered.\nThe irrepressible designer, who’s been in the business for over two decades and built a fashion empire with her husband, Dirk Luebbert, utilised the social media platform to post daily tips and how-to videos on making masks with limited supplies, as well as other things to do at home.\nBut then Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia (Ministry of Health) medical frontliners also started posting on social media that that they had to use garbage bags as an alternative to cover their heads and shoes because of a shortage of PPE gear. Other postings also surfaced: Exhausted but resourceful frontliners sewing their own PPE gear because they had to be disposed of after each use.\n\n\nThis spurred Looi and her other fashion designer friends like Datuk Radzuan Radziwill, Salikin Sidik, Khoon Hooi, Alia Bastamam, Key Ng, Celest Thoi and Kit Woo to start posting on social media urging their followers to help by donating funds to buy the fabric to sew hospital gowns and other items.\nThen Vivy Yusof, co-founder of modest fashion site Fashion Valet, entrepreneur extraordinaire and super-influencer with 1.8 million followers on Instagram, got in on the act and set up an online fundraising page via KitaFund. (As of Friday, April 17, MYR 1.4 million – S$460,000 – has been raised, according to the site).\nThe group also started working with IMARET (IMAM Response & Relief Team), a medical NGO that provides humanitarian aid locally and internationally, to assist in the distribution of the PPE to their network of hospitals.\xa0\n“We started very small. It was only MODA members who were [helping to] get PPE items to the frontliners. Then… we started getting more materials and friends [helping] with more money to buy the materials. Designers and [home-based seamstresses] started calling in too. It was a very humble beginning but now we have Fashion Valet and IMARET on board to raise more funds,” said Looi.\nTo ensure that the funds are raised and disbursed in a transparent fashion, a project flow was put into place. The first batch of funds raised through KitaFund allowed MODA to commence operations – such as buying materials – by April 6.\nWhen the materials arrived about a week later, MODA sent them to its team of designers and volunteers to be sewn into gowns. The entire operation (sourcing, purchasing, logistics, cutting, sewing, QC, packing and transporting) was to take around two weeks, because materials were in short supply and becoming increasingly expensive.\nDespite this, Looi and her team projected that the PPE gear would be distributed to hospitals and clinics by the third week of April.\nThe process – and progress – of making these gowns, head- and shoe covers can be tracked on Instagram using the hashtags #MODAforFrontliners and #FashionFightsCOVID19.\nIt’s fascinating (and heart-warming) to see these designers, who are usually impeccably suited and booted whenever in the public eye, clad in gloves, face masks and shower caps when cutting patterns and sewing the items. To avoid contamination, all designers and volunteers were briefed on how to deal with the material and to be geared up appropriately when processing the PPE.\nDespite the long days of cutting and sewing, all the designers involved are doing so on a voluntary basis. On their respective social media channels, they expressed that being able to help in any way in this time of crisis is reward enough.\nMODA’s initiative attracted much interest, and soon more fashion designers – such as Jovian Madagie and Izrin Aziz of Innai Group, Fizzi Woo, Mimpikita, Dato Rizalman Ibrahim – and many volunteer seamstresses came on board.\nMeanwhile, local celebrities such as Neelofa and ex-Miss Malaysia Deboray Henry contributed donations or in practical ways (Henry drove Looi around to deliver PPE to government hospitals, for example).\nBy April 8 – ahead of schedule – about 1,200 gowns, 1,500 pairs of shoe covers, gloves and face masks had been sent to the Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and Klinik Kesihatan Daerah (District Health Clinics).\nOn April 11, a day after the Malaysian Prime Minister announced that the MCO would be extended until April 28, Yusof beseeched her Instagram followers to donate to the More PPE Hospital Gowns Urgently Needed for Our Frontliners campaign. The target of MYR 300,000 was achieved just five days later on April 15.\n\n\nA post shared by Vivy Yusof (@vivyyusof)\n“How can we sit tight at home while hospital staff work multiple shifts and overtime to care for infected patients that are increasing in number. Now is the time for us to do something that's bigger than us,” said Yusof. Malaysia has over 5,000 cases and 83 deaths as of April 17.\nCurrently, around 1,000 gowns are being made per day, with the designers working non-stop to produce another 8,000 PPE over the next two weeks.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     COVID-19 ', '     coronavirus ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Creative Capital: The working mother who wants you to reimagine your relationship with lounge wear
  </h1>, 'text': 'For some people, work from home means dressing like a slob. Or dressing to amuse. Take the increasingly popular Instagram account @wfhfits that showcases what people are wearing as they check into their home offices. As you can imagine, the posts that get the most likes feature the most extreme or incredible outfits.\nIndeed, dressing somewhat respectably for the work day, even if you’re at home, is important. One of the more elegant work-from-home wear available on the market actually comes from a local Singapore brand called Beddoni (www.beddoni.com). My wife was sporting some pieces recently and when I asked if there were men’s outfits available, she shook her head.\nBeddoni, launched by former banker Sharon Ngiam exactly one year ago, only makes clothes for women and little girls. In particular, I absolutely love the old-fashioned pajama pieces that are equal parts great for lounging around in bed and tackling the work day’s emails and calls. It’s not often I get jealous over my wife’s outfits, but whenever I see her in Beddoni’s Ellery or Zoe tops\xa0in black with white piping, I sigh wistfully.\nWe talk to Ngiam about her brand’s first year anniversary, complain about the lack of menswear and chat about her journey thus far.\nTELL US MORE\xa0ABOUT BEDDONI\nBeddoni is a ready-to-rest line offering comfortable, timeless off-duty night and loungewear pieces with no “wear by” date that, after the day’s chaos, our customers can look forward to lounging in.\nWe would love for our customers to reimagine the relationship they have with restwear, or lounge wear, given that these are the pieces they’ll spend the most time in. Putting on beautiful restwear is one of the smallest and simplest ways to take care of, and feel good, about themselves.\nOur collection currently caters to both women and children. The pieces have been designed so that our sartorially minded customers can also work our separates into their daytime rotation, given our pieces’ round-the-clock appeal.\nWHO IS THE IDEAL BEDDONI CUSTOMER?\nAs I worked on the brand, I set my sights on the woman that I was hoping to serve. I see our ideal customer as one who does her research, values style but in a way which does not compromise her lifestyle or individuality. That is to say, she wears the clothes, they don’t wear her. Fashion is a tool but not a daily costume.\nThe beauty of this product category is that it caters to a wide range of women, and is as versatile as the woman wearing them. It personally means a lot to me to see how different customers choose to wear the label according to their own styles and lifestyles.\nI hope to serve contemporary, modern women with active lives looking to spoil themselves with off-duty pieces that have comfort and character. We also design for the customer who consciously believes in buying less and buying better quality products as a basis toward a richer, more sustainable lifestyle.\nHOW MUCH OF THAT CUSTOMER IS YOU?\n\n\nA post shared by beddoni (@beddoniofficial)\nI consider myself a modern woman and mother tethered to reality. I have no problem finding brands that resonate with me in terms of ready-to-wear or accessories, but this was one category which always felt like an afterthought.\nUltimately I wanted pieces that I can look forward to as my marker that it’s time to unplug, pieces that contribute to an enhanced sense well-being. Almost akin to a uniform for my everyday life which makes me feel comfortable, restful yet still powerful. It really is about dressing for myself – not for the male gaze or for others.\nAs a mother, one of the deepest connections I share with my two young children is during the most intimate of family moments – getting them ready for bed. Personally I was not willing to succumb to a sea of dreary, cookie cutter and TV-character laden offerings, so incorporating a children’s line to the collection was also important to me.\nI really do want to encourage a habit for my kids of wearing simple, satisfying pyjamas. There aren’t many brands out there that offer an elegant product line for mothers and children to bond over and relax in.\nDO YOU MISS YOUR FORMER CORPORATE LIFE AND THE BANKING WORLD?\nI used to but more for social reasons and there are times when I do miss the structure and predictability. Other than that, I can’t say I miss the insane hours and travelling involved!\n\n\nWHAT EXPERIENCES FROM BANKING PREPARED YOU TO SET UP AND RUN BEDDONI?\nI’m not afraid of hard work, and the years in banking prepared me for the kind of persistence and drive required to start and build a brand in this space. During my time in banking I worked mainly with regional clients so I was used to flying alone and dealing with businesses in regional cities. Of course the ability to manage financial models is also very helpful.\nWHAT DIDN’T?\nClearly coming from a non-design background meant many parts of the process felt so unknown and at times daunting. For the second collection, I worked closely with a designer. Having someone else as a sounding board for the choice of fabrics and designs was invaluable.\nEntrepreneurship also has such drastic ups and downs that I don’t think the stress in banking – \xa0even on the worst of days – is wholly comparable. There is also an incredible amount of self-discovery that has to happen on this journey – besides some level of grit, there is also the ability to handle criticism and days of feeling absolute deflation, to be able to adapt to change and be able to make swift turns when things don’t work out, like factory mishaps.\n\n\nThat previous life in banking also didn’t prepare me for the depth of emotions I feel whenever I see the final finished product after a long gruelling process of product development. I remember that surreal feeling during our first photoshoot. I actually cried. It also didn’t prepare me for the amazing pinch-me moments whenever I witnessed how the brand resonated with a customer.\nTELL ME ABOUT DEVELOPING THE BRAND.\nI first spent about two years incubating the brand from my kitchen, cold calling suppliers and factories and figuring out everything from how to source for fabrics, negotiate with factories, and packaging and logistics. Along the way it was often disheartening. My idea met with quite a lot of “nos” initially. My brother connected me with Caroline Maguire, the Fashion Director of Shopbop, and I flew to New York to meet her and that meeting was pivotal in my decision to really go all out and pursue the idea.\nThe brand was launched online in April 2019 with a modest collection consisting of a small offering of women’s and children’s sleepwear sets. Pursuant to that, I wanted to involve other creatives in helping me come out of the gate with a fuller collection, stronger print design focus, as well as to help refine the branding. This culminated in a rebranding alongside a new website and the second collection was released in November last year.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST PART OF THE PROCESS AND THE MOST EXCITING?\nThe hardest parts really were trying to find suppliers and manufacturers who were willing to support the brand. Our initial small batch production quantities don’t win us any points. Plus I am not a trained designer and had no insider connections. Looking back, I found myself constantly oscillating between an immense stirring to pursue this passion project and self-doubt about being able to execute the idea. Thankfully we found niche family-owned manufacturers who were willing to come on board.\n\n\nI really wanted to try my hand at nurturing small humans while running a small business. It can be incredibly tough as most working mums will tell you.\nSome days you feel like you’ve hit the sweet spot but on most days the struggle is real. Becoming a mother was in many ways the catalyst for starting the brand and I also wanted to set a positive example for my kids.\nThe most exciting times have been when the team and I have thought about ways to add little moments of joy and beauty into brand – everything from little touches to the products, copywriting and packaging.\nWe have tried to consider all the touchpoints and imbue them with feeling and instinct, meaning and care. I consider myself incredibly blessed to have worked with an A team of like-minded creatives.\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE GREATEST SURPRISE IN YOUR ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY?\nThe greatest surprise has no doubt been the generous community of entrepreneurs and professionals I have met who have been so gracious with their time, advice and talent. I consider myself very blessed to have met so many creatives in the industry who have felt a connection with our brand, and agreed to be a part of our journey.\nHOW IS THE BUSINESS DOING?\nWe launched our latest collection at the Boutique Fairs in November last year and the sales and reception were very encouraging. I believe it gave us proof of concept. It has been a thrill to witness how our items have become wardrobe workhorses for many of our customers.\n\n\nTo be honest though, as with most businesses, we find ourselves in strange and testing times. There’s the awkward and seemingly trivial question of what a brand does during a time like this – business as usual with product release emails and sunny IG posts? These days I often struggle with marketing the brand as I feel that almost nobody really wants to read a “salesy” post amidst all the daily gloom and Zoom.\n\n\nA post shared by beddoni (@beddoniofficial)\nWe expect the next few months to be slow, so whatever word can be spread about local brands would be wonderful and so appreciated. Just as we are working from home and thinking about how to keep ourselves and the business safe, I also hope that our customers will find that our products provide real comfort as their stay-at-home clothes.\nHOW HAVE YOU FOUND CUSTOMERS?\nAs a consumer I always enjoy the stories brands tell through products and experiences, and there really is no better place to tell these stories than in person. Having a physical space to meet our customers has always been a dream for me – in particular at the Boutique Fairs which is the perfect place for a brand like ours. We loved how our brand story and offering resonated with people who stopped by our booth.\nThat experience also impressed upon me the importance of a physical touchpoint for this product category—since the magic is in the fabric—and to build a more intimate relationship with our customers. We very recently stocked at Isetan Scotts, only for the COVID-19 circuit breaker measures to come into play.\n\n\nMore recently we’ve had more customers looking to update their restwear game and buy our sets as their hero outfits of this stay at home season. I think our tops make great “upperwear” as you nail your Zoom meetings in the comfort of your home.\nAnd perhaps now is the best time to embrace the ultimate unsung hero – the elastic waistband! We designed our bottoms such that the waistband is elasticated only at the back, giving them a flattering flat-front silhouette, making it the ultimate everyday pant for both in and out of the house. In our current times I think wearing beautiful restwear is a small thing to do for yourself to get through this season, such that you don’t feel like you’re holed up in the house feeling like a shut-in slob waiting for the apocalypse.\n\n\nWILL YOU BE ADDING MENSWEAR TO THE LINE AT SOME POINT?\nWe want to spoil the men too! As a new brand, it was too daunting to include menswear right from the start. But we’ve been getting a lot of feedback that the men are feeling left out so we have started working on that. Bear with us – we are a very small business.\nWHO AND WHAT INSPIRES YOU?\nIn terms of “who” – so many people! Today it’s a friend of mine whom I know is powering through a crazy day with little sleep and up to her ears with household and work issues but who can still retain her savvy wit and wicked sense of humour with her head firmly on her shoulders.\nI love women who care about style but also have much more in their lives. Every day I add to the list. I think it’s such a beautiful thing to be able to procure inspiration and insight from the everyday woman.\nAs with most people, I get a lot of inspiration from travel, magazines and social media. I get a buzz from coming across great copy, typography or packaging.\n\n\nA post shared by beddoni (@beddoniofficial)\nMusic in particular is inherent not only to Beddoni’s finished product, but also to the process. I often relied on the energy of music to spur the creative process, or whenever I am pondering business issues. Our brand’s Spotify list is a mixtape of sorts, which makes me feel good and evokes a sense of embracing nostalgia – it’s essentially memory, i.e. music which brings us back to a certain season of our lives.\n\n\nThat really dovetails with our intention of focusing on simple, satisfying designs that transcend trends – items that tell the story of the past, present and yet are still wearable years from now. Beddoni’s first collection was also named after notable singers or special women, for example Joni Mitchell, Nina Simone, etc.\nWHAT’S THE DREAM FOR BEDDONI?\nI think that the brand occupies a large white space in the market and I hope that it will continue to be a brand that people immediately think of when they think of rest, or when hunting for the perfect gift idea to spoil someone they love.\n\n\nWe are still a very small business, and focused on one product with the intention of nailing it. It would be a dream come true to collaborate one day with like-minded resort or hotel brands. We also think there are many exciting opportunities to grow our breadth of offerings while expanding into other product categories.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Life "", ""     Women's Voices "", ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      What Asian women are buying online to make themselves feel better
  </h1>, 'text': 'With countries across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) in total lockdown or under restricted movement orders, and citizens encouraged to work from home and stay indoors, consumers have turned to online portals in droves to stock up on snug loungewear, self-care products and other creature comforts to line their wardrobes and feather their nests.\nSites like Net-a-Porter have witnessed a surge in sales of track pants, sweatshirts, lingerie and homeware, according to statistics from the week of March 16. “As the world contends with the new social norm of staying in and working from home, it is only natural that women’s preferences have evolved to reflect this change,” said the company in a statement.\n“A lot of people have been adapting the way that they dress now that they are working from home – seeking comfort is becoming a common theme, which nicely aligns with current trends such as the resurgence of the classic tracksuit, and the new appetite for high-quality essentials,” said Celenie Seidel, Senior Womenswear Editor at Farfetch.\nFarfetch did not reveal figures; while other luxury e-commerce sites that CNA Luxury reached out to, such as Matches Fashion and Mytheresa, declined to comment. Figures from Net-a-Porter, however, echoed this sentiment.\nSales of track pants rose 30 per cent over last year, while sweatshirts increased by 46 per cent, driven largely by brands like James Perse, Les Tien and Nili Lotan. Long-sleeved printed pyjama sets from Olivia Von Halle, Desmond & Dempsey and Eberjey also did well. As it’s still spring (or autumn, in the case of Australia and New Zealand), it’s no surprise that many APAC consumers opted for cosier, relaxed-fit items loungewear and sleepwear.\nDespite the preference for comfortable loungewear, women in APAC still felt the need to express their attractiveness and sexuality. Net-a-Porter’s entire lingerie category witnessed an 84 per cent surge, year-on-year. Strong sales were reported for both underwired- and soft cup bras, with Agent Provocateur, Coco De Mer and La Perla being the top-selling brands for underwires. Meanwhile, brief and thong sets jumped 146 per cent.\nTo keep in shape from an increased sedentary lifestyle, Net-a-Porter’s APAC shoppers also furnished their wardrobes with activewear, in tandem with the preponderance of home workout videos that have sprouted on YouTube, IGTV and other platforms. The report mentioned that “Yoga wear has been successful over the past couple of weeks in particular, with Alo Yoga, Varley and Ernest Leoty being key go-to brands.”\nNet-a-Porter’s Homeware category, a broad department spanning beauty and wellness, jumped 95 per cent over 2019. With more time spent at home, APAC consumers were devoting time to laundry care and keeping house – the biggest growth in this category came from laundry/home cleaning product brand The Laundress, which leapt 519 per cent over last year.\nTo entertain themselves and keep their spirits up, products such as wireless speakers, headphones, scented candles and travel books also proved popular among Net-a-Porter’s shoppers.\n“Typically during times of uncertainty, people will also look for a means of escapism. For some, this may be through buying something fun for themselves that can bring them a bit of joy in their day to day life,” offered Farfetch’s Seidel.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     luxury ', '     e-commerce ', '     coronavirus ', '     COVID-19 ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Accessories ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Fashion brands want you to shop online. Should you?
  </h1>, 'text': 'At 8pm on Monday evening, the jewellery designer Rosh Mahtani, of Alighieri, sat alone in her London studio in Hatton Garden, wondering if her building was about to be locked up.\n“Depending on what happens [when Prime Minister Boris Johnson addresses the nation] at 8.30, our entire building will be shut down. We won’t be able to ship our e-commerce orders,” she said. A half-hour later, as Johnson confirmed London-wide lockdown, she opened the company’s safe and emptied the remaining necklaces, bracelets and rings into cardboard boxes to take to her flat, where she will resume fulfilling online orders later this week.\nMahtani, who employs a team of 13 and last month was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design from Princess Anne, has lately depended on her company’s website for half of her sales, and wholesale for the other half. But as the coronavirus infections have spread, a third of Alighieri’s deliveries have been cancelled, and orders for the upcoming Autumn/Winter 2020 season are only half of what had been forecast. That has made Alighieri’s website its primary source of income.\n“Now is when 90-day payment terms really come back to bite you,” she said. “You’ve already been waiting 90 days for that stockist to pay you [for items already delivered], and now they say well actually we can’t pay you.” (Not every retailer has proven unsupportive: MatchesFashion has offered to settle invoices more quickly, and kept order levels consistent with previous seasons, Mahtani said.)\n“Now is when 90-day payment terms really come back to bite you.” – Rosh Mahtani\nCoronavirus-related lockdowns have been a boon to the top lines of online-everything stores such as Amazon, which is planning to hire 100,000 extra US staff to meet surging demand. But it has been a different story for sellers who do most, or all, of their business via bricks-and-mortar, or specialise in categories that are more susceptible to swings in consumer confidence, such as fashion accessories and perfume.\nSales in the US$1.4 trillion (S$2 trillion) fashion and luxury goods market are expected to plunge between 25 per cent to 35 per cent in 2020, compared with an increase of 4 per cent in 2019, according to Boston Consulting Group estimates shared with the Financial Times.\n\n\nThat would help explain the raft of promotions from fashion-focused retailers such as Net-a-Porter, Liberty London and Bergdorf Goodman, which are offering discounts of 15 per cent to 50 per cent on clothing and accessories that arrived in their warehouses weeks or even days ago. Such items would not normally go on sale until May or June.\nFor some founders and designers, the decision to keep selling online has presented a moral quandary. Patagonia’s US team and Paul Smith are among the brands who have stopped selling both in stores and online, citing employee safety.\n“It can almost feel inappropriate to keep trading,” said Buffy Reid, co-founder of &Daughter, a London-based brand that manufactures all of its knitwear in the UK and Ireland. The company’s three-person team has been working from home since March 17, and continues to fulfil online orders through its third-party logistics partner, which she says is adhering to the government’s advice on stringent hygiene and reduced staffing numbers.\nIn Reid’s view, the consequences of halting operations would be worse for workers. “To me [continuing to operate] feels like a more responsible thing to do in that it protects our immediate staff, and protects our network of suppliers and makers, who are all independent family businesses.”\n“To me [continuing to operate] feels like a more responsible thing to do in that it protects our immediate staff, and protects our network of suppliers and makers, who are all independent family businesses.” – Buffy Reid\nHenrietta Rix, co-founder of four-year-old British contemporary label Rixo, is in a similar situation. “Our online site is our only source of revenue right now,” she says. The label has 140 stockists worldwide, some of whom are more than 70 days late on payments. “[The site] is keeping us afloat. It helps us pay our team [as well as our suppliers in India]. It is that important.”\nSeveral designers and founders have made personal appeals via their websites and email newsletters to customers to support small business during this period. They are also promising to donate a portion of proceeds to charities working closely with coronavirus victims – a further incentive to conscious shoppers. Alighieri has pledged to donate 20 per cent of web sales to the Trussell Trust, a charity supporting UK food banks. Rixo is allocating 10 per cent of profits to Age UK, whose programmes are dedicated to helping older people.\n“We need people to support us more than ever,” said Alighieri’s Mahtani.\n“If everyone stops shopping, we have a profound economic problem. Supporting small businesses and prioritising them over the big brands is absolutely the right thing to do now.” – Jose Neves\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      Global fashion and luxury sales to drop by more than S$600 billion because of virus
  </h1>, 'text': 'The hit to fashion and luxury sales from coronavirus is expected to be much harder than previously feared, as a decade of growth comes to a crushing halt.\nRevenues are expected to plunge between 25 per cent and 35 per cent this year as a direct result of store closures owing to coronavirus lockdowns, according to the Boston Consulting Group.\nThe impact on fashion and luxury – a category that includes apparel and accessories, watches and jewellery, and perfumes and cosmetics – is expected be more severe this year than the recession a decade ago, with total sales dropping between US$450 billion to US$650 billion (S$640 billion to S$925 billion) from 2019 levels.\n\n\nThe outlook is far bleaker than the firm suggested in late February, when it estimated sales for the year would decline by about 15 per cent. That was before the virus took hold in Europe and the US and was declared a pandemic.\xa0\n“This is worse than 2008,” said Sarah Willersdorf, head of luxury at BCG. “There’s zero doubt we’re going to have a definite V curve. The question is whether it moves into a U or an L.”\nLike the 2008 recession, the pandemic has caused a financial shock that has hurt consumer sentiment and demand, she said. “To this you have this added uncertainty in the market about the crisis, prolonged store closures which you didn’t have in 2008, and disruptions to manufacturing.”\nSome regions will be more heavily affected than others, depending on the strength of their economies, the severity of outbreaks, and how much they rely on tourist sales for fashion and luxury sales, the group said.\nSouthern Europe is expected to suffer the largest drop, with sales falling between 85 to 95 per cent between March and May. The region’s economies are not as robust as the US or China and persistent travel restrictions will place a further drag on a recovery, BCG said.\nGucci parent company Kering said this week that it was already “observing encouraging signs in mainland China”, with declines in store traffic and sales “narrowing”. The French conglomerate is expecting a like-for-like sales fall of 15 per cent in the first quarter compared with last year.\n\n\nSales in North America, the world’s largest fashion and luxury market, are expected to fall somewhere between 75 to 85 per cent compared with last year during March and April and recovering to sit down 10 per cent by end of year.\n“Honestly, the jury is still out on that,” said Willersdorf, noting that the US government’s steps to stop the spread of the pandemic have been less aggressive than countries such as China and Singapore, which were quick to implement social distancing and data-tracking measures. “The reason the US is expected to return to that level is because of the size and strength of its economy.”\nWhile some regions are expected to rebound quickly, the impact on consumer habits are likely to be felt longer-term, Willersdorf said, with consumers shifting more of their spending online and embracing new technologies such as augmented reality, which allow shoppers to try on clothes and accessories at home.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     luxury ', '     business ', '     economy ', '     coronavirus ', '     COVID-19 ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Guys, wearing a shirt with the wrong type of collar can be a turn-off for ladies
  </h1>, 'text': ""Up until the mid-15th century, men's\xa0shirts tended to feature scoop or boat necklines, after which standing collars made their appearance.\nSince then, there’s no denying that the men’s collared shirt forms the backbone of the modern masculine wardrobe. But if you really want to go one up on the style stakes in order to impress the ladies, you’ll need to really know your shirt.\nFirst off, the collar should never fit too loosely or it will look like you borrowed an ill-fitting shirt. Too tight a collar and you could be accused of needing to go on a diet. Both of which might not go down well during a blind date.\nTo ensure the perfect fit, you should be able to glide one or two fingers between your collar and your neck.\nThen, you need to know the makeup of a collar’s anatomy, such as:\n\n\nThe style of a collar is defined by its points, spread, band and height. The right one can enhance your face shape, jawline and neck, showcase your personality, reflect your sense of style, and broadcast your awareness of the sense of occasion.\nHere are 10 collar styles and how to wear them.\n\n\nFORWARD POINT\nAlso known as a “point collar”, it’s considered one of the most traditional styles. There’s only a narrow distance between the collar points, which are not covered by a jacket’s lapels.\nBest for: Anyone and everyone, especially if you’re a no-nonsense minimalist who wants to maintain a more streamlined wardrobe.\nWear with: Jeans, chinos or dress pants.\nWear to: Anywhere you need to look like a regular guy on a regular day.\nBUTTON DOWN\nOriginally designed for polo players to keep their collars from flapping in their faces while riding, the points are buttoned down onto the shirt.\nBest for: Channelling a classic preppy, smart-casual elegant look. If you have a bit of a double chin, or chubby cheeks, the two buttons on the collar can help draw attention downwards, creating the illusion of a longer, slimmer face.\nWear with: Jeans, chinos or dress pants. Works with or without a tie.\nWear to: Work or play. Or both, if you just happen to be a professional polo player on his way to a tournament, in his convertible, with the top down.\nSPREAD\nThe collar points end and disappear right where they meet the jacket, in an elegant and symmetrical manner.\nBest for: Anyone who wants to add a certain je ne sais quoi to his outfit, without looking like he’s trying too hard. If you have a long, thin face, the spread collar can help those sharp angles appear to look softer and more spread out.\nWear with: Tie, or no tie. Jacket, or no jacket. Jeans, or dress pants.\nWear to: The office or to meet your online date for the first time.\nTAB\nThis has two small tabs in the middle of the collar points, which connect with hook-and-loop, a button, or snap beneath the necktie, pushing the knot up and out.\nBest for: Displaying debonair 1930s Art Deco flair. Also, if you’re slightly pudgy, that more pushed-out tie can help make you look a little less rotund.\nWear with: A bold tie and a double-breasted suit.\nWear to: A formal business meeting or to dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant.\nCUTAWAY OR WINDSOR\nPopularised by the Duke of Windsor, the collar points are angled outwards instead of pointing down, and the collar has a wide spread to accommodate a Windsor knot tie.\nBest for: Confident, flamboyant types with razor-sharp cheekbones and chiselled jawlines. Preferably with designer stubble.\nWear with: A Windsor-knotted tie, naturally. And collar stiffeners. Sharp pinstriped trousers, and maybe even suspenders a la Gordon Gekko in the classic movie Wall Street.\nWear to: A hostile corporate takeover or when some startup comes to you begging for venture capital. Or a third date, where you might get lucky.\n\n\nMANDARIN\nThis collar style\xa0–\xa0where the entire turned-down collar is completely missing, leaving just a flat band around the neckline\xa0–\xa0has many, many names. It’s also called standing collar, band collar, choker collar or Nehru collar.\nBest for: Relaxed dudes, especially if they happen to have short necks.\nWear with: Linen drawstring trousers, jeans, chinos, joggers, silk jacquard dragon-print kungfu pants, fedora hat, designer sneakers or pool slides.\nWear to: Sunday brunch, a hipster cocktail bar, a beach holiday or a God Of Gamblers costume party.\nCLUB OR ETON\nInvented by Eton College in the 19th century England, the sharp collar points are rounded off.\nBest for: Posh types who read politics, philosophy and economics, and consider themselves in the league of gentlemen.\nWear with: Sharp, pleated trousers or slim, flat front pants. Preferably designer, or better still, tailored at Savile Row.\nWear to: A cocktail party or semi-formal event. Or, of course, every Eton old boys’ reunion.\nPIN\nThe eyelets on each collar point are fastened together with either a collar bar or tie pin.\nBest for: The gentleman who has to attend lots of fancy events, and quite possibly, rub shoulders with the high society set and maybe even\xa0royalty.\nWear with: A bespoke tailored suit, of course. And a very expensive silk tie. Don’t forget the collar bar or tie pin.\nWear to: Formal and semi-formal occasions, or really important business occasions when you have to sign documents with your lucky Montblanc pen.\nCAMP\nAlso known as the Cuban, Cabana or Revere collar, this open-necked style comes with a notched lapel, and usually appears on short sleeved shirts that come in plain colours or tropical prints – upon which it becomes not just a camp collar shirt but a Hawaiian shirt.\nBest for: Channelling a relaxed, summery retro 50s vibe a la Elvis Presley.\nWear with: Jeans, chinos, bermudas. Can also be worn unbuttoned over a T-shirt.\nWear to: Barbecues, pool parties, beach vacations. To Cuba. Or anywhere with a cabana.\nWINGED OR WINGTIP\nThe most formal shirt collar of all, the stiff, heavily starched short collar doesn’t fold down like your usual shirt collar. Instead, the tips stand up and point horizontally, almost looking a seagull taking flight. Also known as the Gladstone collar.\nBest for: Strictly for evening events with black-tie or white tie dress codes.\nWear with: A tuxedo and a bow-tie. Under no circumstances should you wear a normal necktie with it.\nWear to: Grand weddings in posh hotel ballrooms, charity gala dinners, coronations.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      The pinstripe suit is deeply flattering. Here’s how to update the menswear classic
  </h1>, 'text': 'One of the great menswear classics to be discarded in the steady slide from business-smart to business-casual is the navy double-breasted pinstripe suit.\n“I don’t have a pinstripe suit and can’t say I’ll be buying one anytime soon,” said Rupert Gove, a 29-year-old analyst from London. He and his office mates prefer something much more relaxed now dress codes have eased – a Patagonia fleece gilet over a formal suit and tie – and when the day-to-day reality of office life often entails “tweaking Excel spreadsheets and joining conference calls”.\n\n\nWhich is in many ways a shame. “Oozing timeless British elegance” in the words of legendary Savile Row tailor Edward Sexton – who knows a thing or two about pinstripes, having cut suits for everyone from The Beatles to George Soros – the style is deeply flattering. A narrow low-contrast stripe emphasises the line from chest to waist, thereby lengthening and slimming the body while adding a subtle sense of business formality.\nBut outside the City of London, the pinstripe suit is finding new life. In Paris, creative director Hedi Slimane opened his achingly cool Celine spring men’s show in January with a three-piece pinstripe suit picked out in crystals, evoking all the Savile Row swagger of a young Mick Jagger in his Seventies rock-aristo pomp. (It’s a look best approached with caution – unless, of course, you can muster all the swagger of a preternaturally young rock god.)\n“It’s about subverting traditional menswear codes and interpreting them in a directional way,” said Nelson Mui, merchandising director at Lane Crawford. While traditional pinstripe suits haven’t always sold well for the multinational department store, Mui has seen an uptick in demand for suit separates, unconstructed soft tailored jackets and casual shirts, including those from Dries Van Noten, 3.1 Phillip Lim and Uma Wang.\nTo make pinstripe look more contemporary, he recommends changing up the silhouette – a shorter trouser with a polo shirt and simple sneaker would do – or pairing it with unexpected pieces, like boots.\nFor designers, pinstripes add a touch of formality and elegance to sportswear and casual separates. “I feel I can bring back traditional fabrics if I add something new,” said Berluti’s Van Assche. Echoing the logo trends of streetwear, he had the iconic Berluti “Scritto” design woven into the spring show’s silk and wool pinstripe to give extra dimension to the fabric.\n“In this new era of tailoring, pinstripes are now popular beyond the corporate environment because they go back to giving a heightened sense of style and masculinity,” he said.\nCraig Green is another designer playing with that notion of tradition, mixing the classic stripe in what he describes as “worker-style utility shapes and garments”.\nThe results are anything but corporate. For spring, Green has printed pinstripe-style stitch lines on to paper-feel cotton and created outerwear pieces from multiple layers of patchwork organza with pinstripe-style embroidery holding the layers together.\nThe change in tastes hasn’t dimmed Sexton’s own love of this business-like cloth. “Personally, I love to wear a pinstripe suit with one of my signature tab collar shirts, as much as I like to dress it down in winter with a roll-neck sweater. I tend to wear a pinstripe suit for formal meetings too,” he added. “But then I am quite traditional about these things.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Men ', '     business ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Is Billie Eilish the future of fashion? Tommy Hilfiger is betting on it
  </h1>, 'text': 'In 1986, when his business was just 18 months old, Tommy Hilfiger launched a billboard campaign proclaiming himself as the next Calvin Klein or Ralph Lauren.\nThe gatekeepers of the US fashion industry were not persuaded. “I give it a year,” the Fashion Institute of Technology’s Jack Hyde told the New York Times.\nThirty-four years later, and Tommy Hilfiger’s eponymous label, which was acquired for US$3 billion (S$4.1 billion) by PVH Corp in 2010, is one of the great success stories of American fashion, with product lines spanning men’s, women’s, denim, sportswear and childrenswear, and more than 2,000 stores across 100 countries. It is also growing: Sales were up 12 per cent to US$1.2 billion on a constant currency basis in the most recent quarter.\nIn 2016, the designer introduced TommyNow, collaborating with celebrities such as Gigi Hadid and Zendaya on collections available to purchase immediately after his catwalk shows. Its most recent instalment, co-created with Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton and American R&B singer Gabriella Wilson, aka HER, was released at London Fashion Week last month.\nWHY ARE YOU BACK IN LONDON?\nI love it. It’s Lewis Hamilton’s home town and this is a big Lewis moment. We did a three-way collaboration with Lewis, HER and me. This is really the first time a designer has ever done a three-way collab.\nYOU’VE BEEN PUTTING ON FASHION SHOWS FOR A LONG TIME.\nOver 35 years.\nWHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS THAT GO INTO A GOOD SHOW?\nIt has to be a big experience. It has to be disruptive. It can’t just be expected. I think fashion shows are archaic… just watching models walk up and down the runway (in looks you can’t get until) six months later. It doesn’t make sense.\nWe created TommyNow (in 2016), where you could click and buy whatever you see on the runway, basically to meet the consumer. And to create an experience. The experience comes from going to the show. And it’s not an exclusive, editors-only show – we allow the public to come in (via) a certain amount of tickets that we raffle off or give to people who wouldn’t normally be able to come to a fashion show.\nWHEN, FOR YOU, DID SHOWS BECOME LESS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY AND MORE ABOUT ENGAGING THE PUBLIC?\nIt was the first Gigi Hadid show in New York with the carnival (in September 2016). That was the pivot. During fashion week, I used to get calls from friends of friends, people we know, asking could we get a ticket to the show, (and I’d have to say), sorry, it’s for buyers and press. And I figured we should open it up to the public. And then I was thinking, the public who are seeing it, are they going to wait six months (to buy it)? By the time they go into the stores, they will have seen it and they will be tired of it.\nWHEN YOU LAUNCHED SEE-NOW-BUY-NOW DID YOU THINK THAT WAS THE WAY THE INDUSTRY WAS GOING –AND MAY STILL GO?\nIt’s very difficult to do. Because you have to look at your designs, basically on paper, and buy inventory way in advance. We have to ship it to the stores the night before the show. It’s a logistical nightmare. So a lot of people can’t do it. But we pulled it off and it’s been very successful.\nSPEAKING OF WHICH, WHAT ARE PEOPLE GOING TO WANT OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS?\nI think (18-year-old American singer) Billie Eilish just showed the millennial world the new shape. It’s relaxed, it’s oversized, it’s very 90s, street, it can be elegant, it can be vintage-modern, it can be high-low, it’s a new shape. That’s what we’re showing.\nWHY HASN’T AMERICA PRODUCED ANOTHER MICHAEL KORS OR TOMMY HILFIGER?\nIt’s very expensive for a designer to start up and get momentum now. There are not the same amount of stores to sell to, there’s a tremendous amount of competition, anyone can buy anything online. It’s going to be a rarity for someone to come on the scene and explode. Someone can do well, like (US designer) Brandon Maxwell, but it’s doubtful he would be able to build up a billion-dollar business or a megabrand.\nBUT DIDN’T IT ALSO TAKE A LOT OF MONEY WHEN YOU WERE STARTING?\nBut I was really lucky. I really had a lot of wind at my back. I had some big bumps, mainly about money and partnerships. I think at the same time, going global was a big plus for me. Because if things are a bit slow in the States, well, China is great. If things are a little slow in China, South America is on fire. If things are slow in Brazil, well, Europe is strong. So you get that offset. But getting there and getting the name known there (is hard).\nA lot of people say ‘Tory who?’ ‘Zac who?’(Tory Burch and Zac Posen) Getting the name known worldwide is a major hurdle. And once you do, then you have to supply and live up to the name. Diane von Furstenberg’s name is so much bigger than her business. We have 2,000 stores in the world, we’re in 100 countries. If you only have 500 stores in the world, it sounds like a big business but really it isn’t, because the world is so big.\nWHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO ANOTHER DESIGNER WHO WANTS TO ACHIEVE THE SAME CAREER LONGEVITY?\nI have always been flexible. And a lot of people think I have sold out, or I have given in. Maybe I’ve been too commercial. But you’ve got to be commercial or go home. You have to be disruptive or go home. You have to be sustainable or go home. A lot of those aspects of society are important to respond to.\nWHAT ELSE IS ON THE HORIZON FOR YOU?\nInclusivity. Embracing people of all different backgrounds regardless of race, colour, creed, size. Our Adaptive line (for children with disabilities). I know first-hand from having children on the autistic spectrum that these children want to look like other children and other people their age. But they really can’t get dressed the same way. Their dexterity (is different) –they can’t button buttons, they can’t zip zippers. So we created magnets for buttons, Velcro for zippers. It wasn’t rocket science. But nobody was doing it.\nCERTAINLY NO ONE AT SCALE.\nPeople’s families are so thankful. Because it builds esteem and confidence in these people’s lives that they didn’t have because they’ve been looked down upon, they’re in a wheelchair. It’s been a great experience for us.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Entertainment ', '     celebrity ']}"

      Louis Vuitton closes fashion month with dramatic time-travelling spectacle 
  </h1>, 'text': 'The Louvre may have been closed due to staff concerns on the coronavirus, but on Tuesday (March 3), the historic museum reopened its doors for Louis Vuitton’s fall collection runway show, the last of Paris Fashion Week.\nThe show was a dramatic spectacle right from the start. Before the models took to the runway, a five-storey living backdrop was revealed, featuring a 200-person choir dressed in period costumes ranging from the 15th\xa0century to the 1950s. The choir’s wardrobe was the work of Oscar-winning costume designer Milena Canonero, known for his work on A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and The Grand Budapest Hotel.\nThis idea of time translated on the runway too, as Nicolas Ghesquiere, Louis Vuitton Women’s artistic director presented a collection that juxtaposed different eras in fashion history. With Time Clash as the theme, petticoats were paired with motocross jackets, and Victorian style ruffled skirts were matched with pin-stripe blazers.\n“I wanted different eras to be confronted with another one, our own. All of these \'pasts\', embodied by a gallery of personalities in period dress, converge in our present. We are all together, looking at a collection that itself recounts a living, perennial, stylistic clash – and everything we can do with clothes by mixing and free-associating them,” Ghesquiere shared.\nAccessories sent down the runway included the Keepall, a pure, vintage piece that acquired a beautiful patina over time now customised with a new strap, amidst small satchels, mini-totes and little minaudieres. Shoes illustrated a very free rein: Revisited boots and metal cap-toe pumps that evoke wheel rims on a customised car.\n“I wanted different eras to be confronted with another one, our own. All of these \'pasts\', embodied by a gallery of personalities in period dress, converge in our present.""\xa0– Nicolas Ghesquiere\nEvident from Ghesquiere’s shows in the past years, Vuitton is not one to shy away from extravagance.

      One year after the death of Karl Lagerfeld, can Chanel find its voice?
  </h1>, 'text': 'It was just one year ago that Karl Lagerfeld’s final collection for Chanel was shown at the Grand Palais, 14 days after his passing. The air was thick, then, with the sense of the historical moment\xa0–\xa0Lagerfeld had been Chanel’s creative tour de force for 36 years –\xa0and models and clients marvelled or wept as they wandered through the snowy alpine village he had dreamt up for his last bow.\n\n\nA year later, much at Chanel remains the same, though it speaks more quietly than it used to. Instead of bringing in a well-known outsider, Chanel promoted his longtime right-hand, Virginie Viard, who has given few interviews. Those she has given have been devoid of the spark and controversy that would keep Lagerfeld’s name in the headlines for weeks. The show sets are also simpler, less costly, absent of the rockets or life-sized supermarkets\xa0of the Lagerfeld years.\xa0\nInstead, Tuesday’s show featured a plain mirrored catwalk, lightly misted, which wound between white-and-black risers stacked like Chanel hat boxes. Models stepped out, sometimes in twos or threes, outfitted in slim A-line tweed coats, boxy wool jackets with scalloped edges, and roomy jodhpurs left unbuttoned over, or tucked into, swashbuckling boots. They, and the waistless black velvet dresses, looked comfortable and easy after a week of sharp waists and skin-tight latex –\xa0an effect mired by the cheap-looking medallion necklaces, heavy cross brooches and chain belts piled on top.\nMissing was a theme, a narrative, a crackle of excitement. Chanel’s shows are often the most talked-about of fashion week, fetching front-page headlines and generating hundreds of millions of page views for online publishers.\nChanel is the world’s second-largest luxury brand behind Louis Vuitton, with 2018 revenues of US$11.1 billion (S$15.4 billion), an increase of 10.5 per cent compared to the previous year. Such growth will be difficult to sustain if Viard doesn’t learn to speak up.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Paris ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Is Korean designer Minju Kim the next big thing in fashion? We say yes
  </h1>, 'text': 'Fresh from winning Netflix’s new reality series Next In Fashion and with an almost-sold out capsule collection on luxury retail site Net-A-Porter, South Korean Minju Kim is the latest toast of the fashion town.\n\n\nBut before sartorial lovers even heard of her, K-pop fans had already been wowed by her design chops. Unbeknownst to many, the 34-year-old fashion designer has been dressing some very popular Korean pop stars, including BTS and Red Velvet.\nShe created boyband BTS’s world tour stage costumes for their songs DNA and I Need U. Back in 2016, Kim also designed the wardrobe for girl group Red Velvet in their music video One of These Nights, where her now distinct design hallmarks of voluminous silhouettes and feminine details like bows and ruffles were already well developed.\nAnd now, Kim’s win on the inaugural season of the design competition has given her the dream opportunity to make her name as a globally recognised designer.\nBarely a month after the 10-part series was launched on Netflix, the bespectacled, jovial Kim says she has already encountered fans of “dragon princess” on the street. This was the moniker that she and her competition partner Angel Chen from China had dubbed themselves on the show, to the delight of viewers.\n“That makes me happy. It is always an amazing moment for me to meet someone who knows (my label) MINJUKIM,” wrote Kim in an email interview with CNA Luxury.\nWith vibrant colours, bold prints and a penchant for billowing shapes reminiscent of the hanbok (Korea’s national costume), Kim’s whimsical pieces have a distinctly Asian inspiration. She believes that leaning into her roots was what gave her the edge in the competition – and is what will allow more Asian designers to earn their places in the fashion world.\n“It is really interesting how Asian designers can combine their culture and story into their collections – the colour and traditional shape result in a beautiful aesthetic. When they show their roots, they express more unique concepts. This is how we offer a different point of view,” she reflected.\nThe competition, hosted by model-presenter Alexa Chung and Tan France, who is also the fashion expert on Netflix’s revival of Queer Eye, immediately stood out from the existing crop of fashion shows with its sharp curation of international designers, all of whom already have stellar backgrounds. Many of the competitors either have their own well-received fashion labels or have experience working for established brands.\nFrom the earliest episodes, Kim’s quirky personality and impeccable craftsmanship – she holds fashion degrees from the Samsung Art & Design Institute in Korea and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp in Belgium – already made her the one to watch.\n“It is really interesting how Asian designers can combine their culture and story into their collections – the colour and traditional shape result in a beautiful aesthetic. When they show their roots, they express more unique concepts."" – Minju Kim\nBesides her outsized talent, the show also drew viewers in with its friendly, convivial vibe. Instead of mean, backstabbing competitors that most have come to expect from reality shows, in Next In Fashion, the designers are depicted helping each other out by offering encouragement and advice.\nThis close-knit atmosphere was not engineered just for the show, Kim revealed. After filming for each episode, where the designers had to come up with pieces based on a fashion trend or theme, they would retreat to their hotel bar for a drink and to talk about their work.\n“I was so amazed with their great work and it was really interesting to see different solutions to the same challenges. It was a really special experience to be surrounded by different styles and designs. I felt like I went back to school,” Kim said.\nNow, even though the show is over, they are still in close contact. “We have a WhatsApp chat group where everyone is logged in,” she said.\nWhile many of the MINJUKIM pieces from her SS20 collection on Net-A-Porter are sold out, fans can also try their luck at Singapore-based retailer SocietyA, the only store here that carries her label. Her apparel has been available at the Ngee Ann City boutique since 2018, when general manager and buyer Lily Hamid spotted Kim at the Generation Next fashion shows at Seoul Fashion Week.\n“What struck me immediately was Minju’s clever use of fabrics and amazing construction skills. For her FW18 collection, Minju used very unexpected materials such as an iridescent green/fold jacquard and silver foil fabric. It was something different compared to other Korean designers whom we saw so it stood out for me immediately,” said Hamid.\nKim’s latest Frida Kahlo-inspired collection, an extension of her winning work on Next In Fashion, was launched by SocietyA around the same time it dropped on Net-A-Porter. The boutique has already seen a “spike in demand” for MINJUKIM pieces, observed Hamid, with some pieces quickly selling out. SocietyA is currently working on restocking and adding a line of new drops from the collection.\nHamid added, “I love that she is a designer with a very clear vision of her design aesthetic. There is definitely a market for MINJUKIM – well-made clothes with strong concepts.”\nOver the past few weeks, much like her dreamy designs, Kim has been swept up in a fairy tale of star-studded parties in New York City in her honour as winner of the competition. But now, it is back to her regular life in Korea where she is also a lecturer at Kookmin University.\nTop on her to-do list is to solidify her newfound fame by appealing to a wider range of shoppers. “I would like to consider designing for the mass consumer. So we are exploring the idea of a MINJUKIM ‘starter kit’ for people who love our designs but are not yet ‘brave’ enough for the clothes we have now,” she mused.\nBut there will still be enough of her fantasy pieces for fashion lovers to feast their eyes on at her runway shows. “Every season, we separate our collection line from the commercial line, that’s where I can go a little crazy.”\n“I love that she is a designer with a very clear vision of her design aesthetic. There is definitely a market for MINJUKIM – well-made clothes with strong concepts.” – Lily Hamid\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Korea ', '     Netflix ', '     Profiles ', '     Beauty ', ""     Women's Life ""]}"

      Hermes livens the mood of Paris Fashion Week with welcome pops of colour 
  </h1>, 'text': ""The venerable house of Hermes is\xa0steeped in tradition, with a history dating\xa0to 1837, when it started as a harness workshop in Paris that made saddles, bridles and other leather riding gear for English noblemen.\nIt was this history that set the stage for the house’s women’s Autumn/Winter 2020 runway show at Paris Fashion Week. The collection was presented on a striped equestrian playground, as models walked among\xa0colour-blocked show-jumping poles in red, blue, yellow and green.\nJust like the set, the collection featured an invigorating use of colour. Creative director Nadege Vanhee-Cybulski appeared to use white as a base, pairing it with pops of colour for a more modern, youthful look.\nHermes's colourful palette\xa0was a welcome respite from the dark\xa0cloud that seemed to hang over Paris Fashion Week.

At the core of the collection was a focus on functionality. As other fashion houses choose extravagance for their runway shows, Hermes\xa0looked\xa0beyond the superficial and pared\xa0down its collection to the classics.\nThis philosophy\xa0is best explained by a phrase from the collection's show notes\xa0–\xa0“What is useful must be beautiful”.

      Crash Landing On You: The best fashion moments from the hit Korean drama
  </h1>, 'text': ""If you’ve finished watching popular K-drama Crash Landing On You\xa0on Netflix, chances are, you’re experiencing some kind of withdrawal symptoms. With an endearing narrative, tear-jerking moments and heart-fluttering romance, every episode was a rollercoaster of emotions.\nJust as intriguing as the storyline was\xa0the characters'\xa0wardrobe, in particular that of highly-successful businesswoman, Yoon Se Ri, played by actress Son Ye Jin. Despite being born to a wealthy\xa0household, Se Ri charts her own path away from the family by setting up her own fashion business, Seri’s Choice.\n\n\nThroughout the series, viewers are treated to the fashion mogul's impeccable style ensembles. We round up our favourite looks from the show.\nPOWER SUIT \nAs a stylish #girlboss, Yoon Se Ri donned several power suits throughout the series. Ever the style maven, she made\xa0a powerful fashion statement in this\xa0Off White suit, accessorised with a Longchamp\xa0handbag.\nCLASSIC CHANEL \nIn a shopping scene where Se Ri splurged on outfits for love interest Ri Jeong Hyeok, the CEO was dressed to impress. While giving Jeong Hyeok\xa0a makeover, Se Ri wore a cotton and wool jacket from Chanel. Finishing off the look was an embroidered Georgette crepe scarf, also from Chanel.\nCASUAL CHIC\nEven when she’s dressed down, Se Ri manages to stay effortlessly chic. In this scene in Switzerland, years before Se Ri and Jeong Hyeok’s fateful meeting in North Korea, Se Ri is seen in a cosy knit sweater pulled over a shirt, both from Celine. She paired the outfit with a pleated skirt and Celine tweed sling purse.\nFLORAL FANTASY \nThroughout the series, Se Ri was\xa0dressed in several feminine\xa0floral looks. Our favourite has got to be this long-sleeved, floral printed stretch silk dress from\xa0Dolce & Gabbana. In this\xa0scene, Se Ri is also seen carrying an elegant black crocodile-effect handbag from Miu Miu.\nPOP OF COLOUR\nWho would have thought that an all-yellow outfit could work so well? In this romantic scene where Se Ri and Captain Ri are strolling in the rain, the heiress was clad in a yellow mohair-blend blazer over a yellow wool turtleneck sweater with a mohair-blend mini skirt, all from Max Mara. Even her shoes were yellow too.\nPRINTS AND PLEATS\nWhile we’ve fallen in love with Se Ri’s show stopping looks, we have to give credit to the styling of North Korean department store heiress, Seo Dan.

      Creative Capital: The pop star turned sustainable fashion entrepreneur
  </h1>, 'text': ""I first met Ming Bridges in 2006. My wife and I had helped Chef Justin Quek publish his first cookbook, and to launch it, Justin said he wanted to do something for a children’s charity. So instead of a press conference or a bookstore launch, we helped him organise a charity dinner cum book launch that raised funds for the Children’s Cancer Foundation. I forget who introduced us to Ming but somehow, perhaps through one of the guests of the dinner, we had booked her to be the evening’s sole entertainment.\nI have to admit, I didn’t know who she was when the evening began, but to this day, I have never forgotten her name. 14-year-old Ming Bridges was a pint-sized powerhouse who looked like a pixie princess but could deliver a song with the power and panache that singers two or three times her age would have killed for.\n\n\nOver the next few years, Ming found stardom through a recording career that, for those of us on the outside, certainly looked successful and glamorous. But in truth, as her career grew, Ming became increasingly unhappy and unhealthy.\nToday, Ming Bridges no longer sings professionally. For her own mental and physical health, she had to step out of the spotlight. But, as she got better, she also began talking about her career, her life and the issues that affected her. Her TEDx talks are noteworthy for their honesty and because of the importance of her message.\nAt the same time, her time away from the stage has also allowed her to indulge a childhood dream, and in November 2017, she launched Rentadella, a sustainable fashion business. I decided to catch up with the former child star and learn more about Rentadella, as well as her own journey as an entrepreneur.\nTELL US ABOUT HOW RENTADELLA IS A SUSTAINABLE FASHION BUSINESS.\nBuying fast fashion is not sustainable, nor is buying a dress you wear once and then having it sit at the back of your closet for all of eternity. A service like Rentadella allows a dress to be enjoyed by multiple women, meaning the cost of production – of the garment and to the environment — is shared and used to its full potential.\nBelieve it or not, since I was a young girl, I’ve wanted to have a business in sustainable fashion. The idea of women, or girls at that time, sharing a wardrobe of gorgeous clothes had always been a dream of mine. My initial draft, created when I was just 12 years old, was to make it a sort of game in which girls would swap clothes with one another. This idea was put aside when I started my music career the following year but revived more recently when I started seeing the trend of renting on the rise around the globe.\nWhen I realised what was happening, I got jealous. Very jealous. And I knew it was because my heart was telling me, “That’s what I’m supposed to be doing.”\nTo me, using a rental service like Rentadella is a no-brainer. The fashion industry is the second largest pollutant in the world and we can slow this down by powering the sharing economy and saying “no” to fast fashion. Why not rent quality clothes that fit just right from the best brands for less money and also save the world at the same time?\n\n\nTHE BUSINESS IS NOW JUST OVER TWO YEARS OLD. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED SINCE STARTING IT?\nStarting a business is the hardest thing I’ve ever done. There was a lot of doubt on my end. I’m a big dreamer but everything I’ve done has been in the entertainment industry. Who was I to start a business all by myself with no prior knowledge? I took all my own savings, trusted my gut and started buying clothes. Everyone tells me my job must be so fun, getting to shop all the time, but funnily enough that has been my most dreaded task. Predicting what people will want to rent has been tricky, but fortunately something you learn on the job.\nI’m also a big people pleaser. I’d say my ultimate challenge with keeping Rentadella alive has been learning to stand up for myself and my business, and not letting others take advantage of me. The idea of people not liking me or thinking I’m a bitch for being a strong woman is very uncomfortable for me. I have to remind myself that being strong makes me a good boss, and not everyone will like that, especially when people don’t treat our clothing very well.\nI’d also never done anything like accounting and finance before! That was a huge shock to the system. But starting my business has opened my world up completely and I’ve learnt so much. I’ve also learnt simple things such as, if you get customers to pay a deposit for appointments, you only get 2 per cent no-shows instead of 50 per cent no-shows when they can book for free. Small things like that make a big difference to an entrepreneur.\nHAS BEING A KNOWN PERSONALITY HELPED WITH STARTING RENTADELLA?\n100 per cent yes! Having a following on Instagram gave me a great platform to start promoting Rentadella. I’m so thankful to live in an era in which social media allows you to jump start advertising without having an initial budget for marketing. It allowed me to test what designs people wanted to see without bringing things in. However, Instagram can only do so much, and that’s where networking came in.\nBeing a known personality, I’m lucky enough to be invited to a lot of events and meet other people in the entertainment industry. I’m actually a pretty shy person and the idea of networking has always filled me with dread but I quickly realised how powerful it can be. They say an introvert can become an extrovert if they are pursuing something they’re passionate about. I completely agree with this.\nMy desire for Rentadella to do well and to spread the word about sustainable fashion has made me more social than I have ever been before. Networking has brought me great opportunities. I know how fortunate I am that I already had one foot in the door; that helped me to meet a lot of people who could help me. If you’re someone just starting out, I cannot recommend enough just going out and talking to people about your business. If it’s something you care greatly about, then there will be others who care too. You just need to raise awareness!\nWHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS? AND WHAT HAVE BEEN THE MOST POPULAR ITEMS?\nMy customers are everyone from 16- to 18-year-olds going to prom, to working women heading for events, ladies who like to brunch and party, hosts and celebrities attending galas, and brides and their mothers.\nFunnily enough, when I started Rentadella, I wanted to focus on cocktail and party dresses as there are already quite a few gown companies in Singapore. Lo and behold, everyone kept coming in and asking for gowns! I saw a gap in beautiful gowns to wear for events and weddings that weren’t so over-the-top-glamorous that you would outdo the bride or feel silly at a work event. Those have definitely been our most popular items, along with statement pieces with big colours that you could really only wear once. When testing out new items, I post a photo on Instagram and see how many times it gets shared or sent to friends. That’s a really easy way to know what is popular.\nYOU CARRY A LOT OF DIFFERENT LABELS ON RENTADELLA. DO YOU THINK ONE DAY YOU'LL MOVE INTO DESIGNING YOURSELF?\nI would absolutely love to! I love shopping and so far my taste hasn’t let Rentadella down. Equipped with my new knowledge of what people want to rent, I think it would be a very exciting project to pursue!\nIt’s funny though – I love dresses and adore dressing up; however, I don’t consider myself a fashionable person at all. My go-to looks are comfortable dresses and playsuits that I can wear over and over again. I guess I have always prized quality and comfort. But now I am learning what everyone else likes.\nHOW WOULD YOU LIKE RENTADELLA TO EVOLVE? WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE?\nI’ve actually had a lot of requests to expand overseas. While, at the moment, it still seems like I have a long way to go in perfecting what we already have, it’s definitely something on the vision board! With new countries come new tastes and demands; it’s already so interesting to compare what people rent in Australia and the USA to Singapore. Every market is so different. For example, what people wear to a wedding in Singapore – more gowns and black tie – is very different from what someone attending a wedding in Australia would wear – more trendy cocktail attire.\nYOU'VE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC EYE FOR A LONG TIME. AND YOU'VE SPOKEN BRAVELY AND PUBLICLY ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH. IF YOU HAD A DAUGHTER WHO WANTED TO GO INTO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AT A YOUNG AGE, WOULD YOU LET HER?\nOh this is a question I’ve dreaded! I have thought about and talked about this a lot. It’s such a hard one. If my daughter wanted to go into the entertainment industry at a young age, I don’t think I would stop her. I don’t regret anything I’ve personally gone through and I’m proud of the person I am today because of my experiences, good and bad. However, I would make sure my daughter was having consistent therapy alongside her career. Therapy still sounds very ‘taboo’ and I feel silly even saying that I’d want my child to have it but I think it’s so important to have someone to talk to. You need to be mindful of your own thoughts and actions, especially in the entertainment world where it’s so easy to fall into the trap that your self-worth is predicated on looks and career success. You need someone by your side constantly reminding you of what is real and also why you’re doing what you’re doing. And hopefully it is not for the fame and attention but because you actually enjoy it.\nWhen I fell into anorexia my family frowned upon seeking help and therapy, and everyone just avoided the elephant in the room. I’d make sure this possibility was addressed at the very start. Your mental health is so fragile in the entertainment environment and has to be monitored, at any age. Seeking help and therapy is what saved me at the end but it took me quitting the entertainment industry and hitting my lowest point before even considering it. Things might have turned out a lot differently if I had been seeing a therapist from the start.\nHOW ARE YOU DOING THESE DAYS? EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY?\nI’m the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I was bullied in my high school years and then jumped head first into a pop star career fuelled by anorexia. The concoction of desperately wanting to be accepted and having my career pinned to my looks and personality was a dangerous one. I’d be given homework for the next day’s interview and wouldn’t sleep thinking of how to be the funniest, prettiest, coolest, most interesting girl in the room. I’d have to remove posts on Instagram because I’d be told that I looked too fat in them and should have asked for permission before posting. I put everything into my anorexia and career, thinking success would make me invincible and bullies would never be able to touch me again.\nNow, although I’m still haunted by the past, I’ve come to accept that I was ok being myself all along. Working hard for Rentadella, a business that is about helping others feel beautiful, has been so rewarding. In the past, if a song didn’t do well or my Instagram post didn’t get many likes, I felt worthless. The lines between my own worth and career were blurred. A career failure meant that I was a failure. Now, if Rentadella has a bad month, I can change things. I can work harder. I’m no longer worthless because it’s not about me. It’s about how hard I’m working. I am no longer the product, I am instead working on the product. This brings me massive relief. Waking up with the mission of making others feel beautiful instead of focusing on myself is an amazing one.\nI also surround myself with a good group of people who love me just for me. That’s something I still have to remind myself is possible.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     style ', ""     Women's Voices "", '     fashion ']}"

      Singaporean handbag designer Ethan Koh finally sets up shop on home ground
  </h1>, 'text': 'Like sightings in the wild, designer Ethan Koh’s luscious yet understated exotic skin handbags often turn up on the arms of some of the most famous women in the world without the slightest notice. Eagle eyed observers have spotted Princess Eugenie carrying Ethan K clutches on the red carpet while actress Carina Lau is known to tote favourites from her collection to various society soirees. Then there are the models Hailey Bieber and Sofia Richie who prefer dressing down their bags with athleisure wear.\nAlthough the Ethan K bags do not display showy logos – at most, the brand’s signature hedgehog emblem may adorn a clasp – the designer’s quirkily stylish designs and use of vibrant, jewel-hued crocodile leather are showstoppers in their own right.\nNo wonder for the past decade, the Singapore-born, London-based maestro has become the go-to bespoke bag maker for those in the know. But scoring an appointment with Koh can be elusive.\nWhile a selection of his creations can be found in exclusive boutiques around the world, including Harrods in London, The Ritz Hotel in Paris and Malmaison by The Hour Glass in Singapore, the truly determined had to travel to his private atelier in London to meet with him. But even then, they would have to make plans to sync their schedules with the globetrotting designer, or their voyage would be in vain.\nNot anymore. This Singapore boy made good has finally set up his first permanent gallery locally to be within closer reach of his clients in Asia.\n“There is a growing demand for one-of-a-kind handbags among luxury consumers in Asia. Also, Singapore is my birthplace and my design DNA is very inspired by nature and the tropics so it is a natural next step to launch an atelier here,” said Koh, who intends to spend more time in Singapore now that the atelier is launched.\nStill, there is an air of mystique around this rarefied bag procuring process. Access to the Ethan K gallery is strictly by-appointment-only and the address is kept secret until details are confirmed. He will only hint that it is located in a heritage building in the River Valley area.\n\n\nThe space is simply but elegantly decorated, with a plush velvet settee and marble topped display tables that evoke a comfortable reading room – ideal for perusing the wares on display.\nHere, besides taking bespoke orders, Koh has also made available a selection of bags that are available for immediate purchase. This will please his growing pool of eager customers who are loathe to wait between a month and a year for an order to arrive before they can post about their acquisition on Instagram.\n“Our business has evolved as the modern luxury consumer prefers instant gratification. She has evolved from wanting creations that match an outfit to carrying pieces that stand out and tell a story,” he said.\nIndeed, over the past year, Koh has been focusing on creating statement pieces that add punch to an outfit. Recent highlights include the cuboid shaped Glamourbox which looks compact but can fit a smartphone and the even tinier crossbody Minibag which can barely hold a compact, lipstick and credit cards – but looks cute in photographs.\nThe gallery also stocks his newly launched fragrance and candle capsule as well as designs from his latest Mystical Landscapes collection where he made his first foray into mixing exotic skin with other materials such as calfskin and even rattan. Up next is a full leather collection which Koh, who famously does not follow the fashion calendar, says he will launch when he is ready.\nIn the meantime, here’s an insider tip for Ethan K fans: At the Singapore atelier, if you ask nicely, Koh and his assistants might just trot out brand new, never-before seen pieces from their “secret” stash. Now, that is how exclusivity meets instant gratification.\nFor more information, email info [at] ethan-k.com () or privateorders [at] ethan-k.com (). \n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Singapore ', '     Profiles ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Coronavirus wreaks havoc on luxury groups amid fashion weeks in Europe
  </h1>, 'text': 'The\xa0coronavirus outbreak\xa0has kept as many as 1,000 Chinese fashion buyers from Europe’s top fashion shows this month as the luxury industry faces its biggest threat since the 2008 financial crisis.\nChina has become all-important to the global luxury and fashion industries as a driver of sales and a core manufacturing hub. Chinese consumers accounted for roughly 40 per cent of the €281 billion (S$426.3 billion)\xa0spent on luxury goods globally last year, according to Jefferies, but drove 80 per cent of the growth, powering sales increases at companies such as\xa0LVMH and\xa0Kering.\nThe outbreak has also started to disrupt supply chains for more mid-market apparel, with retailers and fashion brands expressing concern about whether Chinese factories will be able to deliver autumn-winter collections as planned.\nCompanies such as LVMH, Kering and\xa0Richemont are less vulnerable because they are not as reliant on China for manufacturing as those apparel makers, or industries that have integrated global supply chains like cars or smartphones.\nBut Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Bernstein, said luxury sales in the first quarter could be “heavily impacted” and considered it possible that revenues would fall by “low to mid-teens” digits.\n\n\n“If all goes well, then maybe the second half will come roaring back,” he added. “But for now we need to take into account that the situation is really very negative when it comes to Chinese demand globally.”\nFive Chinese designers have cancelled fashion shows scheduled for Paris Fashion Week, and\xa0Chanel and\xa0Prada postponed separate events planned for May in China.\xa0\n\n\nThe National Chamber for Italian Fashion said an “optimistic” estimate would be for Italian exports to fall by a minimum of €100 million\xa0in the first quarter and €230 million\xa0“in the event of a prolonged crisis” for the first half of the year.\nTo keep Chinese buyers engaged, Kering’s Gucci brand\xa0live-streamed the catwalk show for its autumn-winter women’s collection in Milan, using Weibo, one of China’s biggest social media platforms.\xa0\nBefore the event, viewers were treated to a bird’s-eye view of the area where models were being made up. Once it began, they could see voluminous ruffled dresses and military-inspired coats in all their splendour.\xa0\n\n\nGucci, Kering’s biggest and most profitable brand, started streaming fashion shows to the Weibo channel last year to win over Chinese consumers, who now buy more luxury goods than Europeans or Americans. Rivals such as LVMH and Chanel and the organisers of Fashion Week in Milan and Paris scrambled to set up similar live feeds.\xa0\nLuxury goods groups have activated contingency plans that include closing stores and offices in China, scaling back product launches and advertising, and clamping down on staff expenses globally. Some have instituted hiring freezes.\xa0\nWith many workplaces and stores in China still shut, there is a sombre mood that does not lend itself to conspicuous consumption. One executive described eerie scenes of Shanghai’s luxury shopping mall Plaza 66 being deserted on Valentine’s Day. The doors to Cartier and Tiffany’s were also closed.\n“We are now, brand by brand, reallocating that inventory to other regions in the world so that we are not too heavy in stock in China,” Kering chief executive Francois-Henri Pinault told a press conference last week. He described the environment in China as\xa0“changed significantly” and said it remained difficult to predict how it would evolve.\xa0\n“We are now, brand by brand, reallocating that inventory to other regions in the world so that we are not too heavy in stock in China.”\xa0–\xa0Francois-Henri Pinault\nThe crisis comes as the luxury sector is trading near all-time highs of about 26 times forward price-to-earnings, according to Morningstar, after years of strong growth driven in large part by Chinese consumers.\nMid-market fashion brands have more supply chain exposure to China than their luxury peers. Analysts said that while rising labour costs mean China is not as important a manufacturer as it used to be, it is still a major source of fabrics for garment makers in places such as Bangladesh and Vietnam.\xa0\nFor retailers, which follow a traditional two-season model with long lead times, most stock for spring and summer will already have been dispatched before the virus hit, and will be en route to distribution centres. The bigger issue is whether manufacturing and dispatch of autumn-winter stock will be disrupted by a delayed return to work in China after the lunar new year.\xa0\n“Our discussions with companies suggest factories remaining closed beyond the end of February may start to impact stock availability,” said UBS analyst Olivia Townsend.\xa0\nGary Wassner, whose New York-based company Hilldun Corporation provides supply-chain finance to fashion brands and designers that manufacture in China, said he was\xa0hearing of disruptions.\xa0\n“We have already received new schedules of delivery from some factories with delayed ship dates out of China,” he said. “In some cases, this will mean the designers will miss their delivery deadlines with retailers, so they may have to fly product in instead of boat it in.”\xa0\nHe added that the industry was worried: “The insecurity is mounting both for factory owners in China and the brands on this side of the world.”\n""The insecurity is mounting both for factory owners in China and the brands on this side of the world."" –\xa0Gary Wassner\nBy Leila Abboud and Jonathan Elley\xa0© 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     coronavirus ', '     COVID-19 ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     luxury ', '     business ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      What Raf Simons joining Prada as co-creative director means for fashion
  </h1>, 'text': 'Raf Simons is to join Miuccia Prada as co-creative director of the Prada label, in a move that the luxury group hopes will reinvigorate interest in the company and attract new generations of high-end shoppers.\nThe appointment also puts to rest questions of who will succeed Prada, who is in her seventies. It also quells speculation: At the menswear shows in January, the front row was abuzz with talk that Raf Simons would soon be appointed creative director of the men’s collection, Miu Miu, or even the whole shebang.\nLike Prada, Simons is widely considered to be one of the industry’s most inventive designers. However, his tenures at both Dior and Calvin Klein were tumultuous, with him exiting the Calvin Klein business nine months before his three-year contract ended.\nThe Belgian designer, 52, will continue to operate his eponymous men’s label in Antwerp when he joins Prada on April 2. Simons’ and Prada’s first collection will debut at Milan Fashion Week in September.\nLast Wednesday’s show, held at the Prada Foundation complex on the second day of Milan Fashion Week, was anticlimactic. At their best, Ms Prada’s collections challenge the conventions of good taste and alter the course of fashion; other times, she serves up saleable clothes and accessories that riff on her greatest hits.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Prada (@prada)\nHer Autumn/Winter collection was the latter, with grey wool blazers and top coats belted over car-wash skirts, sporty sandals strapped over opaque rib-knit tights, and black nylon bags in rich supply. The problem here is that the Prada customer already owns most of these.\nThe company has been slow to embrace e-commerce and social media, and has struggled to compete with rivals Louis Vuitton and Gucci in the all-important China market.\nPrada generated sales of €1.5 billion (S$2.27 billion) in the first half of 2019, up two per cent from the previous year but trailing competitors such as LVMH and Kering. Annual sales declined in 2016 and 2017, recovering slightly in 2018.\nAt an unexpected press conference at the company’s Milan headquarters on Sunday (February 23), Simons said he had been approached by Patrizio Bertelli, Prada chairman and chief executive, to join “right after” his exit from Calvin Klein in 2018.\nHis appointment will mark a reunion of sorts: Bertelli and Prada hired Simons to design the Jil Sander label in 2005, which he led for seven years before joining Dior as artistic director.\nCo-creative directors are a rarity in an industry that panders to the myth of a single creative force – one responsible for a company’s entire output of clothes, accessories and advertising campaigns.\n“This may be the first time in fashion that two experienced designers who are individually very successful decided to work together,” Bertelli said.\n“This may be the first time in fashion that two experienced designers who are individually very successful decided to work together.” – Patrizio Bertelli\nPrada and Simons said they wanted to issue a “strong challenge to the idea of singularity of creative authorship” and would shoulder “equal responsibilities for creative input and decision-making”. Prada added that she had no plans to retire soon: “I like working. I’m here to work even more.”\nPrada and Simons have long admired one another’s work, which has at times so closely dovetailed that critics speculated Simons was consulting for Prada – speculation he denied on Sunday. His appointment is unlikely to kick-start a big aesthetic shift, with the company stressing that the “distinct values and ethos of the Prada brand remain unchanged”.\n“Prada tapping Raf Simons is a message to the industry that fashion in this day and age needn’t, and probably shouldn’t, have a singular view,” said Maria Milano, head of womenswear at Harrods, the luxury department store. “What Simons will bring is a symbiotic vision of the house that has been steeped in creativity and individuality since it launched ready-to-wear in 1989.”\n“Prada tapping Raf Simons is a message to the industry that fashion in this day and age needn’t, and probably shouldn’t, have a singular view.” – Maria Milano\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Milan ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Your leggings too sheer or tight? How to choose the right one for the gym or yoga class
  </h1>, 'text': ""The hallway to your gym or yoga class is no different from the runway. Like it or not, you’re definitely going to get several once-over glances from listless peers who are waiting for entry into their respective classes. Naturally, you want to give them something to look at right?\nBut before you dive feet-first into the most outstanding pair of leggings money can buy, let’s back up for a minute. These days, leggings don't come cheap and there are far too many pitfalls when shopping for these costly tights.\xa0\nSo how should one\xa0navigate the potential pitfalls of roll-down waistbands, a too-sheer derriere and the dreaded camel toe?\nDON’T FORGET TO ACTUALLY TRY THEM ON FIRST \nAccording to Sylvia Lim, founder of Vivre Activewear, “a good pair of tights should feel extremely comfortable and doesn’t require frequent adjustments.”\nAs sizing varies from label to label and cut to cut, the only way to pick out a pair of leggings is by trying them on. “Head to the physical store to try them on for yourself. Pick out a few popular styles and try them on in different sizing – depending on whether you prefer a snug or looser fit,” she said.\nAnd just because a pair of tights looked awesome on your classmate doesn’t mean it'll have the same effect on you. Because every body\xa0is different, what works for others may not work for you.\nA good pair of tights should feel extremely comfortable and doesn’t require frequent adjustments.\nWhen trying on leggings, don’t just stand there. Make use of the opportunity to roadtest the leggings by moving in them. “I encourage customers to do some jumping, squatting and stretching in the tights to make sure it holds up well,” said Lim.\nKeep your eye on the mirror during the roadtest. Look out for fabric sheering when you bend over and pay attention to whether the waistband shifts or rolls down. Are there unsightly folds in the nether region or are the hems gaping around the ankles?\n“If any of that happens, either you are wearing the wrong size or the fit/fabric of the leggings isn’t working out for you,” said Lim.\nCOMMON MISTAKES? WRONG SIZE AND TOO SHEER \xa0\nBuying the wrong size is the most common mistake when shopping for leggings, added Lynn Chong, founder of Rangoon Active. “The other mistake we tend to make is buying a pair of leggings that is too sheer,” she added. “While it is understandable that we want the thinnest possible leggings in this tropical climate, there is a huge difference between breathability and stretchability.”\nBuying the wrong size is the most common mistake when shopping for leggings.\nWhen it comes to activewear, two-way stretch (only stretches sideways) just won’t do. Which is why non-stretchy\xa0cotton tights splitting\xa0down the middle is not uncommon when worn for exercise.\xa0\nFor complete freedom in movement, you’re better off with four-way stretch (stretches across the width and length) materials such as spandex and lycra. “A good pair of leggings should stretch well, without becoming sheer, and yet still feel breathable,” explained Chong.\xa0\nBig brand names are no guarantee for a good fit.\nBig brand names are no guarantee for a good fit. “I’ve bought leggings that were expensive but unfortunately, they did not wear on well at all,” she said. “The main thing you need to look out for when shopping for leggings, is to find a brand that makes quality leggings for your body shape.”\n\n\nScroll down for a list of affordable leggings that are built for form and function.\nUNIQLO AIRISM TIGHTS, S$29.90\nThe low price point isn’t its only winning quality. These tights boost UV Cut technology that protects skin from harmful UV rays, as well as moisture-wicking DRY technology and a cool-to-the-touch AIRism function that releases heat and moisture so the wearer always feels cool.\nVIVRE ACTIVEWEAR NOVELTY ELITE PERFORMANCE TIGHTS, S$79\nFit is everything when it comes to fitness tights. The brand’s premium Elite line is designed with the Asian body frame in mind. Enhanced compression fit means you put your best curves forward and its no-dig, mid-rise waistband takes care of muffin-tops. Its refined moisture release technique improves breathability, too. \xa0\nRANGOON ACTIVE ISABEL 7/8 LEGGINGS, S$72\nThe devil is in the details. It’s high-waisted, so you never have to worry about the waistband rolling down. It’s got side pockets, so the locker key, hair slides, entry card and mobile phone are kept safe. The ankle-grazing 7/8 length is particularly flattering for petite girls to fake endless legs. And it’s got “odour control” so you can still smell fresh as a flower even after a sweaty hot class.\n\n\nKYDRA ACAI MOVEMENT LEGGINGS, S$78\nHomegrown activewear Kydra’s claim to fame is, in fact, a pair of men’s gym shorts. The two-in-one flex shorts were such a hit, a woman’s version quickly followed. But interestingly, it’s the leggings that have garnered a loyal following. Users especially like the soft material and elegant gemstone colour chart. Sizing tends to run small so size up if you’re between sizes. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nUNDER ARMOUR MERIDIAN TIGHTS, $89\nDo compression tights feel\xa0too restrictive? Then you’ll love this specially-engineered “chill leggings” that are made of fine fibers from UA’s signature sweat-wicking material.\xa0\nBut don’t let its soft-to-the-touch texture fool you into thinking that it’s not going to hold up against your high-intensity workout. Its updated ergonomic design keeps seams off high abrasion areas and a four-way stretch construction significantly increases durability. This new-to-the-market style will drop in April.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Creative Capital: This bespoke leathersmith makes award-winning bags you want to wear
  </h1>, 'text': ""Leathersmith\xa0Ho Kuan Teck believes that a custom-made bag can bring out an individual’s unique sense of style.\nThe founder of Myura, a bespoke bag-making outfit, has been making award-winning bags since 2014. His unconventional\xa0Lemniscate\xa0bag picked up three international awards in the last two years: Winner best of overall design, Design A Bag Competition organized by APLF (Asia Pacific Leather Fair) in 2018 (Hong Kong); A' Design Award Winner for Fashion and Travel Accessories Design Category in 2018 (Italy); and Gold Medal winner, Muse Design Award for Fashion Design Category in 2019 (New York).\nWhat sets a Myura design apart from the competition is Ho’s ability to turn leather into unique works of art. To Ho, leather is not just a material but a vehicle for creation.\nTELL US ABOUT YOURSELF.\nMy grandmother was a professional embroiderer. She passed her skill on to my mum and in turn,\xa0my mum\xa0passed the skill on to me.\xa0I remember the first thing I ever embroidered was a handkerchief at the age of 10.\nSubsequently, I started helping mum out whenever possible. One of my proudest achievements back then was when a Baba Nyonya bridal gown made by my mum appeared on TV; most of the floral designs on that piece were drawn by me.\nSO HOW DID YOU GET INTO LEATHER MAKING?\nI have always loved working with leather. It was my guilty pleasure when I had a day job. My hours as a 3D generalist were uncertain which meant I had time to hone my craft [in leather making].\n\n\nWHY DID YOU\xa0START MYURA?\nI started Myura because my wife could never find that perfect bag. So I decided to make one for her.\nWHAT DOES MYURA MEAN?\nI love Cangjie (the legendary figure who is said to be the inventor of Chinese characters) so I took a cue from him and created my own font. Myura is a combination of the words “My” and “Aura”.\nThe hourglass logo is symbolic of the handmade process of each leather product – from concept to production to completion. The four dots and the “X” represent leather stitching; whereas the inverted line triangle represents the design, research and development; and the solid triangle represents the finished product. The four elements form an hourglass. Last but not least, the circle represents the process.\n\n\nWHY DOES LEATHER MAKING APPEAL TO YOU?\nTo me, leather is not just\xa0a material, but an elegant\xa0artistry that stimulates the senses. A beautiful leather product is mesmerising in so many ways. It possesses exquisite lines. It\xa0has a distinct\xa0smell. The dyeing process is complicated yet beautiful. From tanning to dyeing, cutting and stitching, every step needs to be executed with\xa0perfection.\nHOW HAS RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS BEEN?\nStarting a business is not easy. I'm still learning the ropes on how to run the business more efficiently and more importantly, to turn my passion into a success. It has been difficult transitioning from employee to employer, to not have a monthly pay cheque to fall back on. But this is the reality of an\xa0entrepreneur. \xa0\nWHO WAS YOUR VERY FIRST CUSTOMER? WHAT DID YOU MAKE FOR HIM OR HER?\nShe was my wife's colleague. I made her a card case bag, which she loved. Thereafter, she ordered two more for her friends. I guess I did a good enough job that she wanted to share my work.\nOF YOUR DESIGNS, WHICH\xa0STOOD OUT?\nMost of my bags are unique, in that I design each bag with its own unique concept. But of them all, the Hour Glass and Lemniscate bags are Myura’s signature designs.\nWHAT DOES\xa0BAGMAKING MEAN TO YOU?\nEach product is part of\xa0Myura's growth. To me, the making of a bag is like\xa0birthing a new piece of art. The joy comes from the creative\xa0process. And in particular, I love the moment when you hand the bag to the customer, the excitement on their faces when they receive the\xa0bespoke piece is everything.\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A PRODUCT?\nIt depends on the complexity of the product. If it is fully customised, it may take more than two\xa0months to develop and design.\nWHY SHOULD A CUSTOMER ORDER A BAG FROM A LOCAL ARTISAN?\nA bag should represent a person’s inimitable sense of style. A customised bag will be able to offer the wearer a unique representation that run of the mill bags will not be able to.\xa0The bag is representational of the wearer therefore, the customised characteristics of a bag will\xa0reflect the unique traits of the wearer.\nHOW DO CUSTOMERS USUALLY FIND YOU? \nI have customers from all over the world – Europe, the Middle East and Malaysia to name a few. Recently, the Singaporean base has been growing. The bulk of the inquiries come in via Instagram or through the Myura website.\nWHAT’S YOUR DREAM FOR MYURA?\nIt takes time to build both brand presence and a good portfolio of products. Myura is a very young brand, we’re still in the brand building stage. At the moment, originality and quality are my priorities. But my long-term plan is for Myura to venture beyond leather goods, to become a manifestation of art. I hope that Myura\xa0will make its mark in the fashion world in time.\nWHAT’S THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE STARTING MYURA?\nThat the Lemniscate bag won three different international design awards in 2018 and 2019. That gave me a lot of motivation and recognition to move forward.\nWHAT’S THE COMMUNITY OF LEATHERSMITHS\xa0HERE IN SINGAPORE LIKE? \nMost of us know each other. I am grateful to them for sharing experiences and exchanging ideas and skills.\n\n\n\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Gucci’s Alessandro Michele takes the fashion crowd behind the seams
  </h1>, 'text': 'Fashion is full of strange, archaic rituals. For designers, there is the ritual of making and presenting fashion collections six months before they’ll ever be bought or worn; for journalists, the ritual of viewing and reporting on those collections, which require the toil of hundreds of models, stylists, dressers and make-up artists, most of whom do their work unobserved. Those collections are shown, hour after hour, season after season, year after year, in a four-week stretch across New York, London, Milan and Paris – a dizzying cycle of, wash, rinse, repeat.\n“We share the same job,” Gucci’s Alessandro Michele told a room of bemused reporters following his show at the company’s campus-like headquarters. It was Wednesday, the opening day of Milan Fashion Week, and most had taken early flights in from London.\n\n\nHe’s been working in fashion for 25 years, he said, and at the end of a fashion show, he’s deeply tired. “And I think that your role is also tiring, because in a circular way you travel from place to place, to find the right words, to look for visions.”\nAnd so he decided to swap places with us journalists, to show us not just the finished product but also the linings and seams. Behind panes of glass on a revolving circular platform, Michele’s own team of grey-suited dressers, hairstylists and make-up artists moved as if preparing for a show backstage.\nSixty looks hung from rails marked with numbers and the names of models such as Elaine, Li and Delphi, who stepped out of white cotton robes and into lacy Gone with the Wind-esque ball gowns, severe Quaker coats and hats, and baby-doll dresses fastened under black leather harnesses. Just as his teams were on display for us, so we were on display for them.\nThe effect was magic. Powerful. The applause at the end of the show was thunderous. Inside the real backstage after the show, dressers wiped tears from their faces as Gucci chief executive Marco Bizzarri snapped a photo with diversity activist Bethann Hardison and actress Dakota Johnson paid her compliments to the designer.\nIf only the clothes had been as moving. Michele said he has been amassing an archive of vintage children’s clothes from the 1930s, 40s and 70s, many of them English school clothes.\nHe translated their proportions, their doll-like perfection and sense of play into Wednesday’s collection, dressing models in red and black toggle coats shrunken into jackets with three-quarter sleeves, and grey flannel school dresses that looked as if they’d been long outgrown. There were some new elements here, for sure – but the vintage-eclectic, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink aesthetic that Michele brought to Gucci in 2015 has come to feel a bit tired, faded.\nGucci is the world’s third-largest luxury fashion brand after Louis Vuitton and Chanel, responsible for 80 per cent of parent company Kering’s profits. Its annual revenue is on track to surpass €10 billion (S$15 billion) for the first time this year, and Michele is under tremendous pressure to persuade customers to fill their closets with yet more Gucci loafers, blazers and belts.\nMichele has sometimes pondered aloud to journalists the possibility of a future career outside of fashion but confessed Wednesday that he remains under its spell. “Somebody told me when I’m 45, I’ll do something else,” he said. “I’m 48 and I’ve not yet found something else.” One hopes he never will. But a little newness wouldn’t hurt.\nBy Lauren Indvik © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Milan ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      US school apologises for ‘racist’ runway show at NY fashion week

      Fashion conscious, conscious fashion: The French label making upcycling sexy
  </h1>, 'text': 'Denim jackets spliced with Chanel tweed, crisp white shirts with double Ralph Lauren collars and trenchcoats cut with oversized lapels, lined with Burberry’s signature check. I am not looking at the perfectly curated rail in a “hype” Parisienne concept store; I’m standing in the showroom of 1/Off Paris, a new label selling genderless clothes upcycled from vintage items, many of which are designer.\n\n\nDutch co-founders Xuan-Thu Nguyen, head of design, and Renee van Wijngaarden, head of communications and marketing, met just 14 months ago. Both had seen first-hand the amount of waste produced by the fashion industry. Nguyen’s family once owned large-scale clothing factories in the Netherlands, where she saw 20,000 sq. ft. storage facilities piled floor-to-ceiling with unwanted clothes.\nWijngaarden was formerly head of brand partnerships at luxury vintage etailer Vestiaire Collective and watched as warehouse after warehouse was filled with unwanted luxury products. Thus they decided to create a brand that would use these discarded clothes, extending their lifecycle and helping to make the industry more circular by using existing resources.\n\n\nThe response was immediate: Within six months of releasing their first collection, they have produced a capsule collection and pop-up shop for Harvey Nichols and moved into bigger offices in Paris to accommodate their growing staff (their atelier now boasts five full-time seamstresses).\nWhy? Because customer demand for their one-of-a-kind items is high – very high. Almost as soon as each trench, jacket or jean goes online, it sells out. This doesn’t surprise me; most upcycled clothing looks drab, but 1/Off’s pieces look as if they came fresh from the luxury stores in which they originated.\n“I think our consumers see we have a very different approach to other fashion labels,” said Wijngaarden of 1/Off’s rapid growth. “They can understand our story and what we do, they can see it is authentic. Consumers more than ever want to know where their clothes come from and how they are made. Our process is transparent and so our clothes feel personal.”\n“I think our consumers see we have a very different approach to other fashion labels. They can understand our story and what we do, they can see it is authentic.” – Renee van Wijngaarden\nCONSUMER MINDSETS ARE CHANGING\nConsidering the enormity of the fashion waste crisis, 1/Off feels highly topical. A 2017 report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation showed that one garbage truck’s worth of textiles is wasted each second, and not even one per cent is recycled. It also estimates that by 2050 the industry’s contribution to annual global carbon emissions will rise to 25 per cent.\nHowever, consumer mindsets are changing. A 2019 Euromonitor International consumer survey revealed that 60 per cent are worried about climate change, and 64 per cent try to have a positive impact on the environment through everyday actions. That behaviour does not always translate to shopping, however, which is still driven primarily by aesthetics and price.\nIt’s 1/Off’s ability to compete on three fronts – looks, eco-credentials and, to a certain extent, price – that have made its collaboration with Harvey Nichols a hit. “Without doing anything other than putting them on the shop floor, all the blazers sold out in the first week,” said buying director Laura Larbalestier.\nAlthough 1/Off’s clothes aren’t exactly cheap, their prices are certainly competitive compared with box-fresh luxury garments. Shirts retail between £180-£350 (S$325-S$633), trenchcoats start at £850 and one striking Saint Laurent denim hybrid coat is online for £2,200 (on Saint Laurent’s website trenchcoats retail between £1,930- £3,460).\n“Fashion has for so long been dictated by season, old versus new, discount versus full price – 1/Off works outside of this cycle,” said Larbalestier. “It’s original, the pieces make a statement and are easy to mix with things you already own. They are extending the life of the clothes by reinterpreting them into something completely unique whilst also creating a more circular system.”\nThe practice of upcycling is growing within fashion, highlighted at Paris Couture last month with houses Maison Margiela, Ronald van der Kamp and Julie de Libran all showcasing collections using second-hand materials.\nBut it’s not just luxury houses making the changes, an entire cohort of young designers are forging a new future for upcycling and making it into a luxury concept.\nLondon-based menswear designer Bethany Williams only uses organic or recycled materials such as discarded bell tents. Dutch designer Duran Latnik, like 1/Off, uses discarded vintage pieces from Gucci to McQueen to create his collage-feel collections, Latnik has also collaborated with retailers Liberty London and Browns Boutique. And last year, four out of the eight LVMH finalists used either recycled or waste materials within their collections (Williams among them). Upcycling also now has an official certification process, “UpMade”, created by Estonian-based fashion designer Reet Aus, to ensure brands meet specific criteria.\n“Upcycling has really started with designers themselves,” said Larbalestier. “They are looking at ways to recreate the supply chain and consumers have really responded.”\n\n\nUPCYCLING IS NOT WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES\nOne of the biggest challenges for the duo is sourcing their pieces to create a continuous and coherent ready-to-wear collection that is appealing and wearable. “We used to pick out a lot of the vintage pieces by hand going to vintage markets or buying loads of clothes by the kilo,” said Nguyen. “It was hard to get a lot of similar pieces; it was too mismatched. We would find a great Saint Laurent jacket but not another.”\nThe two now predominantly rely on specialised vintage buyers and second-hand sites such as eBay. “The vintage market itself is not transparent,” said Wijngaarden, “but last year we worked to correct this within our business model, focusing on a supply chain with a more transparent network.” The team has done this by attempting to work with suppliers who value a more sustainable process.\n\n\nHowever, although 1/Off uses pre-owned clothing the duo do seek high-quality items that aren’t necessarily always destined for landfills. Discarded luxury pieces are often sought out for resale. To counter this, both say that they are not using virgin materials (except for some strong thread which they do have to buy new to use on their more technical pieces), and this makes their business unique. Buttons are recycled, taken off old clothing and the majority of threads are old stock.\nMaking an item of clothing can take anywhere from four hours to a few days. Because each vintage piece is unique, and because the pair like to work almost exclusively with high-end labels such as Saint Laurent, Chanel and Ralph Lauren, their seamstresses have to tackle each garment individually from start to finish.\n“Not all Chanel tweed blazers have buttons in the same place, or sleeves sewn the same,” says Nguyen, “so it takes a lot of expertise to re-work it into one of our in-house styles. The trick is to make each old piece work within the current collection whilst keeping its identity. The pieces we choose are already of such high quality – we just want to update them.”\nDue to the nature of 1/Off’s model, surely the idea of scaling production is of some concern? Apparently not. “The vintage market is vast, there is so much waste and there are plenty of resources,” said Wijngaarden. “And due to our production being entirely in-house, we can expand easily. We aren’t limited; it’s just a new way of thinking.”\nWhat does 2020 hold for the brand? “We now have massive labels approaching, like Levi’s, to collaborate or asking us to give advice on our upcycling model,” said Wijngaarden. “It’s a super exciting time, for us and also for the industry. We hope to grow, sustainably, and we want to show that fashion’s mindset can change.”\n“Fashion has for so long been dictated by season, old versus new, discount versus full price – 1/Off works outside of this cycle. It’s original, the pieces make a statement and are easy to mix with things you already own.” – Laura Larbalestier\nBy Flora Macdonald Johnston © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     sustainability ', '     Paris ']}"

      Streetwear is ‘not finished’, says Burberry’s Riccardo Tisci
  </h1>, 'text': 'As one of the headlines show of London Fashion Week, many look to Burberry for clues as to where fashion is heading next. Designer Riccardo Tisci’s SS2019 debut for the brand ushered the return of Nineties beige and the knee-length skirt. Streetwear, too, has been one of the hallmarks of the “New Burberry”, and so the absence of heritage-check puffers and logo-stamped hoodies on Monday’s catwalk was conspicuous. Could it be that streetwear – the defining look of the 2010s – is finally on the way out?\nPerhaps not yet. “We are doing very well with sportswear, with outerwear,” Tisci said in a round-table interview following the show. “I don’t agree that [streetwear] is finished,” he continued, observing that younger shoppers are simply wearing streetwear with more confidence and creativity today – mixing pieces with classic tailoring instead of outfitting themselves head-to-toe.\nTisci’s show, set to a live piano performance on a catwalk tiled with thousands of mirrors, was styled in much the same way. Whereas the designer’s first collections for Burberry\xa0segmented its offering for two wholly separate customers – luxe trench coats and sharp tonal suits for the seasoned City worker; studded and monogrammed down jackets and parkas for the street-hip millennial – recent shows have presented a cohesive vision.\nThey have fluidly mixed tailored trousers with trainers, and trenches with puffers – sometimes in a single garment. House signatures are diligently worked and reworked season after season.\nTisci plumbed the Burberry archives once again for AW2020, enlarging, miniaturising and layering – often piling – legacy checks and plaids on every manner of garment, from look-at-me suits and duffle coats to shirt dresses tied at the waist in the manner of Nineties grunge. The house’s signature quilted coat – a perennial favourite of American soccer moms – was reworked into a tailored riding jacket.\nTrench coats were given new dimension with faux-shearling lapels and sleeves. Rugby stripes once again made an appearance, fashioned into polo tops and casual dresses. For evening, there were full-length black sequins, a black velvet suit with a trim waistcoat and snug polo-neck dresses with cut-outs edged in metal eyelets.\nCompared to labels like Kering-owned Saint Laurent, which attributes 69 per cent of revenues to handbags and leather goods, Burberry is not a top player in accessories. This season’s offer – supersized woven totes in chocolate leather, large bowler and bucket bags coated in heritage check, a pointed-toe wedge heel tied back at the ankle – are unlikely to change that.\nA more pressing challenge is China. Burberry’s sales, already battered by eight months of violent protests in Hong Kong, have taken a further beating as the coronavirus has spread throughout Asia and other parts of the world.\n\n\nShare prices have fallen 16 per cent since mid-January on account of Burberry’s comparatively high exposure to the Chinese market – 40 per cent of its sales are made to Chinese nationals. In a note to investors on February 7, chief executive Marco Gobbetti acknowledged the virus was having a “material negative effect on luxury demand”, leading Burberry to close 24 of its 64 mainland China stores and cancel its April show in Shanghai.\nI asked Tisci how closely he paid attention to sales. “Obviously a lot,” he said, adding that part of what attracted him to Burberry was that it presented an opportunity not only to be creative “but also where you could build a business"".\xa0Knowing what sells each week keeps him in tune to broader cultural shifts. “It makes you understand what women need, what men need, what the young generation needs.”\nBy Lauren Indvik\xa0© 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     London ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Prada makes anti-racism deal with NYC after blackface merchandise scandal

      The Singaporean designer who changed the way we look at the cheongsam
  </h1>, 'text': 'In a fashion scene as small as Singapore’s, few names tend to have staying power while simultaneously becoming synonymous with a single type of garment.\nBut that’s exactly what Goh Lai Chan has done. For nearly 40 years, the couturier has been outfitting Singaporeans with exquisitely made cheongsams while growing an international clientele along the way.\nNow in his late 50s, Goh runs his eponymous label Laichan at his boutique in Paragon, where a pret-a-porter cheongsam collection is available. He also offers a made-to-measure service for those looking for customised creations.\nWhile Goh also designs evening dresses and gowns, it’s his cheongsams that stand out – women from Singapore and other countries know who to look for if they want a creative take on the traditional garment that also retains a classic touch.\nA SELF-TAUGHT DESIGNER\nFor someone who’s considered a local fashion institution, it may come as a surprise to some that Goh didn’t have fashion training during his tertiary school years.\n“I studied building and real estate management at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, even though I had a big interest in fashion,” Goh shared.\n“Back then, I was already designing cocktail dresses for friends and customers who wanted something nice to wear to parties. I spent my weekends buying fabric, beads, sequins and trimming to make dresses, and even wedding and evening gowns. I made enough to allow me to continue to make more clothes.”\nGoh learnt how to bring his designs on paper to actual clothes by trial and error. “I had no official fashion or dressmaking training in that sense; I had only interest and an eagerness to figure out how to do it right. I drafted, cut and pieced together samples out of paper and with staples – and I was already fiddling with this process as early as when I was in secondary school. I would keep on altering the paper samples until I got them right.”\nIt was a somewhat DIY approach at the start but for Goh, it was inevitable: “I knew I would be in the fashion industry ultimately. But at the same time, rather oddly, I liked the idea of knowing nothing (about it) for a start. It was like jumping into a pool without knowing how to swim.”\nOBSESSED WITH THE CHEONGSAM\nThe one type of garment that Goh was immediately drawn to was the cheongsam. “My passion for the cheongsam started with my interest in Chinese traditions, culture and also its relevance to Singaporeans. It represents the significance of our roots and heritage in contemporary times and the future,” he said.\n""I don’t refer to the standard schoolbook for dressmaking. Some parts of my cheongsam creations can only be crafted and sewn by hand. I work with different figures by varying the cutting.""\nBeyond the cheongsam’s cultural significance, “it’s such a beautiful garment,” Goh explained. “With it, women can make a subtle yet strong statement. Put any woman – regardless of her age, shape, weight, cultural background and social standing – in a good cheongsam, and she is suddenly poised and respectable.”\nAnd there are also the challenges it presents to a designer or dressmaker. “A good cheongsam is not easy to craft – you have to get the fabric, cut, finishing and proportions exactly right,” he pointed out.\n\n\nAnd thanks to the changing lifestyles of women, the approach might differ through the years – a cheongsam that is cut and sewn in the 1920s would be different from one made in 1950s or the Noughties.\nGoh is keenly aware of this and has boldly implemented his distinctive touches to make the garment more relevant in contemporary times and wearable for his customers – while balancing tradition.\nGIVING TRADITION A MODERN TWIST\n“The more I loved the cheongsam, the more I needed to understand its silhouette. At the same time, there was this explosion of western ideals, fashion and that desire for modernity. I thought the branches of the future could not be spread wider without digging deeper into the roots of tradition,” Goh shared.\n“I had the privilege of working with old shifu drafters who let me break the discipline. I collect beautiful vintage cheongsams only to study and tear them up. While measuring and fitting customers every day, I realised that modern women are different from their mothers. Their diets, lifestyle and thinking cannot agree with traditional clothes, be it a cheongsam or a garment belonging to any other culture,” he continued.\nHe doesn’t agree that only svelte women can carry off a cheongsam well.\nIt’s the reason why he doesn’t agree with the stereotyped notion that only svelte women can carry off a cheongsam well.\nThe result has been cheongsams that are “softer"" in terms of cut, silhouette and fabric to accommodate modern figures better than a traditional cheongsam would.\n“The cheongsam should be drafted to suit each individual woman in an ideal manner. I don’t refer to the standard schoolbook for dressmaking. Some parts of my cheongsam creations can only be crafted and sewn by hand. I work with different figures by varying the cutting,” Goh revealed.\nAnother interesting feature that sets his cheongsams apart from others is the fastenings. Bead buttons made out of semi-precious stones such as jade, turquoise and quartz are used in place of traditional knotted frog buttons, and they run all the way from the collar down to the hip in a dramatic fashion.\n“I thought it\'d be interesting to make the cheongsam contemporary yet luxurious,” he explained, adding how he was inspired by how “the emperors and maharajahs wore jade, pearls and precious stones along with their imperial or royal robes.”\nCLOTHING GENERATIONS OF WOMEN\nMany of Goh’s loyal customers have followed him over the decades – from his first boutique at Liang Court in the 1980s to the Raffles Hotel Arcade in the 1990s and, three years ago, to Paragon.\n“My clients from back then are now my regulars and friends – they are now bringing their daughters and daughters-in-law here to get outfitted for their weddings even,” he shared.\nAnd in case you’re wondering if most of these customers are Chinese, Goh says that they are actually of many races – some are even from Europe. “They also come from all walks of life. It’s not just the society ladies who are interested in investing in a well-made cheongsam. They want the outfit for various reasons – special events, weddings and even for everyday wear,” he shared.\nAn off-the-rack cheongsam from Laichan starts from S$780, while made-to-measure pieces can cost anywhere from S$3,000 to more than S$10,000 depending on the complexity and the materials required. But of course, the returns a customer gets from the purchase are infinitely more than its value in monetary terms: As Goh himself said, “a Laichan cheongsam always makes a woman happy and beautiful inside and out”.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Step Up: 6 of the most iconic shoes to ever walk the fashion runways
  </h1>, 'text': ""From literature to popular cinema, shoes have played a vital role in the stories we've grown up with. Consider this: Cinderella's fairytale ending wouldn't have been possible without the glass slipper she left behind on the steps of the castle. Ditto Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz – the adventurous young girl would've been stuck in the Emerald City if not for her enchanted ruby slippers.\nFashion is filled with fantastical footwear, too. And even though the shoes don't come with magical powers (some might argue otherwise), they possess the rare ability to make women feel like they're on top of the world the moment they step into a pair.\nIn turn, some of these styles have gained fame and spawned a fervent cult of collectors who revere the ingenuity that go into crafting the shoes. From an otherworldly creation that looked like it came from outer space, to a macabre version that might have belonged to Dr Frankenstein's laboratory, here are six iconic heels that have graced fashion's catwalks.\n\n\nALEXANDER MCQUEEN\nTitled Plato's Atlantis, Alexander McQueen's last runway collection before his untimely death in 2010 was an exploration of humankind's mutation into eerie-looking sea creatures.\nSet against the backdrop of a dystopian future, the show was notable for bridging the gap between fashion and technology (two cameras writhing like giant serpents broadcasted a live stream of the collection online), and clothes that demonstrated McQueen's cerebral approach to fashion. The shoes stood in a league of their own – dubbed the Armadillo, this bizarre creation commanded the attention of the world then, and continues to do so in the future.\nBALENCIAGA \nBefore Demna Gvasalia sparked a buying frenzy with the chunky Triple S sneaker, there was Nicolas Ghesquiere, erstwhile Creative Director of Balenciaga whose 15-year tenure at the House produced some of fashion's most memorable shoe designs.\nGhesquiere’s rejuvenation of the Parisian brand melded the past and present for the future, and the shoes reflected that concept as well. There was the Lego shoe, a cutting-edge work of art that transformed athletic gear into heels. And then there was the knee-high Gladiator boot, a piece of statement footwear that gave legs to one of the decade's most defining footwear trends.\nDSQUARED2\nFact: Instagram was launched just months after Dan and Dean Caten showed their fall/winter 2010 Dsquared2 show. Had the social media app been around then and wielded the same influence and power as it does today, this pair of boots by the designer duo would've shaken up the Internet instantly.\nPart of a high-octane, ultra-glam collection filled with motorcycle jackets, bustiers and latex leggings, the boot's most defining feature is its heel. Shaped like a spinal cord, it had all the potential to star in many of today's viral memes.\nLOUIS VUITTON\nMarc Jacobs filled his 17-year reign at Louis Vuitton with plenty of high points – his collaborations with artists such as Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami and Yayoi Kusama cemented the luxury goods powerhouse's spot on the top rung of fashion. There were other standout moments too, including his buoyant spring/summer 2009 collection that celebrated Parisian style with eclectic tribal-art accents.\nBesides sculptural necklaces and chunky bangles, the shoes were a highlight – those came as a smorgasbord of prints, textures and colours. Jacobs later sealed their appeal when he enlisted Madonna to model them in the season's campaign shots.\n\n\nPRADA\nFor her spring/summer 2008 collection, Miuccia Prada enlisted Taiwanese-American comic artist James Jean to illustrate a surreal, Art Nouveau dreamscape filled with nymphs and fairies.\nShe later applied the drawings on a turnout of covertly sexual outfits that riffed on the hedonism of decades such as the 60s and 70s. Prada extended that sense of whimsicality to the shoes as well, resulting in an assortment of colourful heels that brought the realms of art and fashion even closer.\nYVES SAINT LAURENT\nStefano Pilati's stint at Yves Saint Laurent may have received mixed reviews from critics, but one thing's certain: He is the mastermind behind some of the most recognisable It bags and shoes that have defined the Noughties.\nFirst conceived in 2004, the strappy Tribute sandal is an example of a timeless footwear style that can still be seen on the feet of women all over the world. In 2009, Pilati followed up with another hit that proved his mastery at coming up with hit accessories: A sensual cage-like boot that walked off the runway and into the hearts of women.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     women ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Why fashion's fairy grandmother Agnes b wants 'to have nothing to do with fashion'

I have nothing to do with that world where everyone is in a bubble,"" said the veteran creator, a lifelong activist for progressive causes.\n""Some people like to go out and be seen,"" said the 78-year-old who dressed her friend David Bowie for decades and who made the famous black jacket with the leather collar that John Travolta wore in the movie Pulp Fiction.\nLike her, Bowie would run a mile from the ""celebrity scene"", she told AFP.\nBoth, however, shared a passion for all kinds of modern art. And now Agnes b – whose real name is Agnes Trouble – is opening her own gallery in an up-and-coming corner of the French capital.\nFab will not only house her eclectic private collection of more than 5,000 works – half of them photographs – but will also, she promised, be a ""factory of culture and social solidarity"".\nNext to Station F, the world\'s biggest startup incubator in the shadow of France\'s national library, the designer wants to put some fizz into what was a soulless corner of French capital.\nHer idea is to bring the art, music, fashion and publishing worlds together with the neighbourhood\'s young tech crowd and its multi-ethnic working-class residents.\nEven as she approaches her eighth decade, the grandmother of 16 and great-grandmother to 19, has lost none of the daring, drive and curiosity that helped her build a fashion empire of 300 boutiques, largely in Asia.\nART AND ACTIVISM\nIndeed, Fab\'s first show is called La Hardiesse, or The Audacious One, a nod to the self-taught designer who started out in fashion as a penniless young single mother with twin boys to look after.\nBack then, after marrying a much older man straight from school, the young Agnes Bourgois (hence Agnes b) dreamed of being a museum curator.\nNow, she has a collection of Basquiats, Warhols, Nan Goldins, Martin Parrs and paintings by Gilbert and George all of her own that many institutions would mortgage themselves for.\nBut Agnes b sees herself more as a motherly custodian than a collector of artists who can fall rapidly out of favour.\nThe art world can be just as ruthless and as capricious as fashion.\n""Suddenly, no one cares about what these artists have done, and they drop them. I don\'t like that,"" she told AFP.\nFor her, an artwork becomes ""an orphan when it leaves an artist\'s studio. It needs to be adopted, loved, seen and understood,"" the designer insisted.\xa0\nBorn in Versailles, near Paris, into a genteel, but impoverished Catholic family, Agnes b\'s adolescence was marked by abuse by her uncle.\nIt took her more than 60 years to tackle the subject with the film Je m\'appelle hmmm (""I\'m called hmmm""), which she wrote and directed, although she insisted it wasn\'t actually her own story.\nAgnes b married the future publisher Christian Bourgois – who was 12 years her senior – when she was 17.\n‘78-YEAR-OLD GRETA THUNBERG’\n""After I had my twins at 19, I left Christian at 21 without a penny.

I would buy ham from the shop with the money they gave me for bring them empty bottles.\n""One day, one of the twins said to me: \'Aren\'t you lucky Mammy\xa0to have us!\'""\nThe experience helped forge her social conscience that has seen her support innumerable liberal causes in France and beyond.\n""I really feel for the Rohingyas, the Uyghurs and the climate,"" the designer declared, adding that she is ""very afraid of Trump"".\nWith France hit by strikes sparked by government pension reforms, she worried for those who have been ""forgotten"".\n""Nobody talks about the cleaners or the artists who have nothing. Who is defending them?\n""I am a bit of a 78-year-old Greta Thunberg,"" she joked, referring to the teenage Swedish climate activist.\nHer liberal Catholic faith, however, is a comfort.

      Why this Taipei shoemaker takes five days to craft a bespoke pair of shoes
  </h1>, 'text': 'With his straggly locks, fedora hat, faded vintage jeans and baggy shirts, that give us a peek at his tattoo-filled chest, EJ So is just the kind of guy you want designing an unabashedly hipster pair of shoes.\n“Since young, I knew that I was a rebellious kid. People considered me to be a problematic student. But my rebellious nature made me more courageous. I wanted to challenge myself and try new things with different perspectives,” he said.\nHis love for shoes began at an early age when he started collecting special-release limited edition sneakers, which subsequently led to a deep dive into the art of shoemaking.\n“I started doing lots of research to learn how shoes were made; why a certain approach was used; how these techniques made the shoes look better; how they have evolved. That was a starting point for me and I just threw myself into it,” he recalled.\nHis keen interest in the trade led him to Osaka, where he studied traditional shoemaking from master craftsman, Kazuo Hanada. Four years later, he moved to London and worked for Italian shoe brand, Sergio Rossi. While in London, So launched his own shoe label in 2014, calling it Kazuo Craft, after his Japanese mentor. When the time was right, he returned to Taipei in 2016 to market bespoke footwear on home soil.\nBest described as “reviving retro romance”, Kazuo Craft gives traditional English shoes a refreshing update using So’s special brand of quirk and originality. In his repertoire, you’ll find plenty of Brogues, Oxfords and Derbies – styles from the early 1900s – which are crafted by marrying traditional English techniques and styles with time-honoured Japanese craftsmanship.\nHe constantly challenges the rules of design by incorporating fun details like cut-outs or blending the leather with interesting fabrics or materials. “I like to use more modern materials or design ideas to give traditional leather shoe styles a new look. Rather than focusing on trendy patterns or colours that are in season, I’d like to design something that customers would still like to wear after 10 to 20 years,” he attested.\nWorking together with his customers, So’s creative process begins with an idea followed by a sketch, and the final product is ready for collection after five days of meticulous craftwork. From making the threads to hand-sewing the soles and stretching out the leathers, So personally oversees the creation of each pair of shoes, from start to finish.\n“It takes quite a number of steps to make sure we know where every single thread should go, whether the stitching will join at the seams, and whether it would be uncomfortable to customers when they’re wearing it. These are important points we take into consideration,” he explained.\nA perfectionist at heart, So continues to push boundaries with designs that he is proud of, ensuring he never makes the same pair of shoes twice. “When it comes to traditional handcrafted shoes, we glue on the leather layer by layer, and sand the leather along the edges to a suitable shape. A shoemaker needs to calculate the angles of the layers precisely, so the heels will be flat and steady. These require constant practice and experimentation,” he added.\n“Even though I have made so many pairs of shoes, every time I witness a pair being completed, I get very moved. To me, it may be just a pair of shoes, but to my customers, it could be a pair they made for their wedding or to their first job interview. At those key moments … I bring them more confidence to help them get through that stage. I’m so moved by those emotions,” he gushed.\nFootwear artisan by day, shoemaking teacher by night, So also runs Acid Lab – a co-working space for independent creatives to share resources and ideas, like bag-maker Daria Melnikova. “I think EJ has a really unique style. He’s a person of details and everything he creates, including this working space, reflects his inner world. He’s really creative, helpful and always ready to share,” she said.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Meet the designers changing the face of female fitness
  </h1>, 'text': '""Women don’t need a hand-up or empowerment from brands. No motivational quotes to help them get out for a run or say, ‘It’s OK to eat a cupcake’,” says Joanna Turner, one of the three founders of London-based activewear brand LNDR, a label that took on Nike for infringing its intellectual property and won.\n\xa0“We wanted to create a brand around the lifestyle we wanted to live,” says Turner. “One that cut through all the marketing fluff and fast-fashion trends. We believe in better products and less of them. Women are smart and just want great products that make them look and feel good, pieces they can rely on so they can just get on with it.”\nAT LNDR, those standout pieces include everything from seamless, waist-to-ankle sculpting leggings and high-neck, long-line sports bras through to soft, yoga-ready, merino wool track pants, matching loose knits and funnel-neck, apres-ski jackets made with recycled polyester padding.\nThe wellness revolution of the past few years has triggered a wave of independent, small and female-focused activewear labels with a similar ethos to LNDR – often run by women in tune with precisely what their customers need from their clothes. A high-profile example is the return of Beyonce’s Ivy Park range this month. Originally launched with Topshop in 2016, the star bought back the full rights for the name from Philip Green in November 2018.\nSelfridges, through activewear buyer Louise Sadgrove, was one of the first stores to invest in LNDR, and puts the female exercise experience front and centre. She says Selfridges’ Body Studio “was conceived as a space for women to discover brands that respond to their fitness and wellbeing needs”.\n“Activewear is at the core of what we offer, with niche and independent labels founded by women best placed to understand what is important to our customers,” Sadgrove says. “Our approach is to seek out brands from around the world with a positive story to tell and a focus on quality, innovation and style.”\nSeattle-based label Girlfriend Collective, founded in 2016 by wife-and-husband team Ellie and Quang Dinh, focuses its messaging on body positivity, using a range of models of different sizes, ages and ethnicities in all of its marketing campaigns.\n\xa0“Our core values are all about recycled materials, ethical manufacturing, performance and inclusivity but, at the end of the day, it all comes down to accessibility,” says Quang Dinh; Girlfriend Collective’s sizes range from XXS to 6XL. “We strive to be as accessible as we can through the types of products we create, making great activewear in a size range that will continue to expand,” he adds. “Our customers are our biggest supporters, advocates and critics. They celebrate us when we do things right and help us be better when we make mistakes. We’re extremely lucky to have them and want to work hard to do right by them.”\nThis month, London-based brand Silou will launch a sub-brand, the Raya Collection. Founded by former model Tatiana Kovylina and yoga teacher Phoebe Greenacre, the small capsule collection of unitards, gym tops and leggings is made in Europe using the latest shapewear technology. It also includes bonded seams for a more streamlined silhouette and garment flexibility.\nParisian heritage label Ernest Leoty has a more unusual story. Once a famous 19th-century corsetry maison, it has been refashioned by chief executive Marion Rabate as the first “couture-for leisure” brand. Not surprisingly, the brand focuses on fit, with crop top-style sports bras and bodysuits conceived using corset technology that is both couture-level flattering and comfortable.\nNew York label Wone also focuses on a minimalist aesthetic. Launched in 2018 by Kristin Hildebrand, who was formerly creative director at Nike, it has an all-black collection of high-waisted leggings, loose-cut T-shirt tops and wide-legged popper-pants that look more like chic loungewear than gym-ready kit\xa0– but everything is made from professional athleticwear fabrics. Shortly after the brand launched, it was snapped up by sites including Net-a-Porter and Matchesfashion.\nA strong colour palette is something that unites all of these female-led fitness brands; today, consumers want gym kit that can take them from barre class to brunch and beyond, and the splashy patterned leggings and fluoro tops that had a moment four or five years ago are starting to look slightly garish. Instead, all of these labels offer kits in hues of navy, charcoal and khaki\xa0– pieces that can blend with existing garments in a customer’s everyday wardrobe.\n“We sell technical activewear you can wear to the gym as well as items that work with your daytime wardrobe,” says Tiffany Hsu, buying director at luxury website Mytheresa, citing brands such as Lanston, Ernest Leoty and Live the Process as some of the site’s most popular.\nNelson Miu, merchandising director at Hong Kong and Chinese luxury stores Lane Crawford, agrees that versatility and understated styling is key to an activewear brand’s success today. “Our customers integrate their active styles into their day-to-day wardrobes,” he says. “They look for items that are comfortable but not too technical; they have to be fashionable.”\nPrism², founded by former fashion journalist Anna Laub, was built on this ethos. The multipurpose crop-tops, vests and leggings are stylish and understated, and are designed to be worn in a multitude of ways. “When I am travelling, I can pack these pieces in my suitcase and know they are versatile enough for several different workouts,” she says. “Plus, I can go swimming in them or wear them as a bra or as control wear under a dress.”\nHer pieces are also sustainable. “All our packaging is compostable, recycled or recyclable,” she says. “Our philosophy is to make long-lasting classics that are fashionable and ethical, but with functionality and comfort at their core.”\nBy David Hayes © 2020 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Fitness ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Hands-on at the last glove shop standing in Lisbon – and also the tiniest
  </h1>, 'text': 'Blink and you may miss this hole-in-the-wall shop dedicated to selling handmade gloves. Located on Rua do Carmo, a well-known shopping street in Lisbon’s Chiado neighbourhood, it is also believed to be the one and only glove shop in Portugal’s capital city.\n“As the only glove shop left in this country, practically everyone has gone through our store. From politicians to those in show business, everyone comes here,” said owner Carlos Carvalho.\xa0\nEstablished in 1925 – when gloves were a fashion staple – Luvaria Ulisses stands at a very cosy 4 sq m, meaning it can accommodate only one shopper at a time.\n\n\nWhile it could very well be the tiniest store not just in Lisbon but in all of Portugal, the history and its glove designs outweigh everything. The shop was once the office of city councilman, Joaquim Rodrigues Simoes, who singlehandedly revived this ageing district and turned Rua do Carmo into the most fashionable lane in Lisbon.\n""All the others have gone, and after 95 years, we are still here.""\n“It was unthinkable for ladies to walk around without gloves back then, so you would find glove shops everywhere. But ours has always been a house that distinguishes itself from the others. All the others have gone, and after 95 years, we are still here,” said Carvalho, who has been managing the shop since 1974.\nTaking its name from the Greek hero, Luvaria Ulisses’ well-preserved neo-classical façade and classical art deco interiors is a tourist attraction in itself, evoking old-world charm and elegance as you step inside.\nFrom the outside, you can see a large display of readymade styles in various leathers, offered in a kaleidoscope of colours. From classic forearm gloves to sporty racing gloves, and even fingerless ones that allow you to use your smartphone, there’s something for everyone here.\nCarvalho proudly shared he designs all the gloves himself. “I get my ideas from everywhere. Sometimes they can be small details like blending in another colour, using the seam of another colour, or incorporating embroidery or a button. There are always things that can be changed to enhance the glove,” he explained.\nTo this day, your elbow will rest on a velvet pillow and your fingers are measure down to the last millimetre. Then Carvalho will shortlist some styles for you consider, made with locally-sourced leathers that are ideal for creating beautifully soft gloves. Further details, such as folded cuffs, buttons or special lining, can be added.\n\n\nTo ensure your pair truly fits like a glove, Carlos offers half-day turnaround alteration services. “It happens a lot, especially for foreigners because they have to leave. They come in the morning and return in the afternoon to pick up the altered gloves. They are always amazed, ‘How is it possible?’” he laughed.\nIf you have the luxury of time, you can opt for a more personalised design, cut and sewn in the same way as it has been from the beginning, at a nearby atelier in Travessa do Almada. It is also managed by Carvalho and his son, Diogo, who work with a team of eight cutters and tailors to churn out more than 14,000 gloves a year.\n“When I was a kid, I always admired my father and I thought he had an interesting job,” said the latter. “When I turned 18, I began working at the workshop and learnt everything from cutting to the manufacturing aspects. These days I can make a glove from start to finish.”\n“Glove making is not easy. There has to be dedication.""\nIn a time when fashion changes so quickly and unforgivingly, it’s heartwarming to see that some things have stood the test of time. Even after close to a century, Luvaria Ulisses’ mode of operations – right down to the traditional sewing machines it uses – has remain unchanged, delivering high-quality gloves made with very exacting standards.\n“When I’m out on the street and come across people wearing our gloves, it is very gratifying to see that people like our product. I’m proud of it,” said the younger Carvalho.\nHis father added: “Glove making is not easy. There has to be dedication. Above all, a willingness to want to learn. This is perhaps the biggest challenge because there are no machines that can replace this part of manufacturing.

      Budget buys: Everything in this fashion spread is from neighbourhood shops
  </h1>, 'text': 'Buying new clothes is a big part of prepping for the Chinese New Year festivities. But it can be quite a strain on the pocket, especially right after all that expenditure on Christmas gifting and gatherings.\nHowever, it’s possible to procure stylish new clothes without spending too much money, and, more importantly, look like you spent a lot more on them than what you actually did. You’ll need to know where to shop, as well as how to pick out items that belie their origins.\n\xa0\nContrary to what many people think, shopping on a budget doesn’t mean that you’ll end up with clothes that look cheap and tacky. With so many options available out there these days, it’s not that difficult to find pieces that are affordable yet surprisingly chic.\xa0\nCNA Lifestyle shows you how those\xa0hole-in-the-wall fashion outlets in your neighbourhood are some of the best places to score fancy\xa0outfits for next to nothing.\xa0\nScroll down for five complete looks assembled from the best of neighbourhood shopping – for as low as S$20 and S$55.\xa0Don’t forget to follow our\xa0shopping and styling tips to look\xa0razor sharp\xa0this Chinese New Year, too!\n\xa0\n\xa0\nDO THE NECESSARY QC\nWhile it may be true for the most part that quality standards are relative to the cost of a piece of clothing, it doesn’t mean that it’s impossible to find a well-made garment at affordable prices. They are out there – you just need a good eye to spot them.\nYou need to be extra picky when it comes to shopping for clothes on the cheap because of their propensity to come with more imperfections. We aren’t looking for couture standards, of course, but they should be of a reasonable quality.\nAvoid fabrics that tend to look tacky, such as satin, faux silk, lace or organza – you won’t find them in a good quality at lower prices. Also, unless you are very sure about what fits well on your figure, give shops that don’t allow you to try on clothes a miss.\nAvoid fabrics that tend to look tacky, such as satin, faux silk, lace or organza.\nLook out for loose threads sticking out or trailing all around the hems and seams, which are obvious signs of poor quality. We don’t expect a piece of budget clothing to rate high on longevity, but they shouldn’t be unravelling at the hems on the first or second wear.\nAnother issue with budget clothing is that prints may not always be executed perfectly on the fabric. Give the print a once-over before you purchase the garment: Are the outlines a little wonky? Is the print out of alignment at the seams? Put it back on the rack if you spot any of these problems.\nMIX OLD WITH NEW\nSome people take the custom of wearing new clothes for Chinese New Year very seriously, buying multiple new outfits – undergarments and sleepwear inclusive – to take them through the festivities. Others – particularly those who already have a closet that’s bursting at the seams – take a more practical and economical approach to their shopping and choose to pair their existing clothes with new separates.\nSpend less, conserve your wealth, and make your new clothes go further by pairing them with the separates that are already in your wardrobe.\nWe are all for the latter strategy – spend less, conserve your wealth, and make your new clothes go further by pairing them with the separates that are already in your wardrobe. A fancy new blouse works well with basic bottoms, such as a simpler skirt or your favourite pair of jeans. Or perhaps you found the perfect pleated skirt in a dramatic print – buy it and pair it with a simple tank, shirt or tee (all three which you probably already own).\nKNOW WHAT NOT TO BUY\xa0\nThere are many stylish, affordable fashion buys to be found at stores such as Zara, Mango, H&M and, at times, even Uniqlo. However, they do tend to be a little ubiquitous for our liking – you know how it’s like when you can immediately identify the source of a dress that someone on the street is wearing.\nAvoid the flashy, statement-making designs\xa0that come in a very distinctive and recognisable cut or print.\nWant to avoid the same situation or being seen wearing the same outfit as your relatives when doing your house-visiting? Avoid the flashy, statement-making designs (particularly one-piece outfits) that come in a very distinctive and recognisable cut or print. Anything else should be fairly\xa0safe, especially separates that can be paired with other items already in your wardrobe.\nGO BOLDER THAN YOU USUALLY DO\nWith the above said, budget-shopping can also be a good way to experiment with styles that you typically wouldn’t buy at a higher price. Always wanted to try a strong colour or perhaps something in a print or with details like pleating, embellishments or ruffles? Here’s where you can afford to have a little fun with your wardrobe without breaking the bank on purchases that you’re not quite sure you’ll be wearing very often.\nSTYLE IT UP WITH ACCESSORIES\nAccessories can instantly elevate a look – there are so many you can make use of and they should mostly already be part of your existing wardrobe. Make a basic outfit look chic and expensive with your best heels or handbag – provided they go with your look, of course.\nJewellery\xa0play a complementing role to your outfit or make a strong statement when matched with pared-down clothes.\nJewellery is an important component to any look, budget or not – depending on the rings, earrings, bracelets or necklaces you choose, it can play a complementing role to your outfit or make a strong statement when matched with pared-down clothes.\nPhotography by Aik Chen, photo assistance by Alvin Tan, styling by Lena Kamarudin, hair and makeup by\xa0Delanie Wong, model Jia/Mannequin, artistic direction by Jasper Loh, style editor Serene Seow.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Chinese New Year ']}"

      The 60-year-old who is arguably Singapore’s fanciest dressed grandfather
  </h1>, 'text': 'Even before Mervin Wee partnered up with his wife, Jean Yip, to launch a humble hair salon business in the 80s that has today become a beauty juggernaut with nine brands under its wing, he already had a keen sense of style as a teenager.\nWhen he acquired his first pair of Levi’s jeans, he didn’t like how it looked – new, blue and crisp – so he bleached it, scraped it on the pavement, and even buried it to make it look more distressed!\n“Style is one thing that’s very individual. I see perfection in imperfection. I don’t like everything to be too perfect. That’s why sometimes, my pants, my shirt can be totally out of shape but I think it is nice,” professed the 60-year-old creative and managing director for Jean Yip Group.\nHis approach to fashion definitely stems from his love for hairstyling, where he considers shapes, textures and colours in an ensemble to create a look. Don’t expect Wee to suit up in head-to-toe Hugo Boss or Ermenegildo Zegna; he will gravitate to something more unexpected like pairing Yohji\xa0Yamamoto with John Galliano.\nTo a certain degree, working in the hairstyling business has also given Wee the freedom to experiment and develop his keen sense of style. According to his daughter Rachel, who is the brand manager for the family business, his wardrobe is filled with pieces from Japanese labels such as Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons and Issey\xa0Miyake, as well as British designers, Craig Green and Neil Barrett.\n“I never thought that my dad was particularly fashionable. I always figured that was the norm. It was only when my friends kept asking me about his clothes and accessories, then I realised maybe his dressing is a bit loud and flamboyant! I think it’s very different from his character because he’s actually quite a quiet and reserved guy,” revealed Rachel, whom Wee often shops with or consults for fashion advice.\nAs Tatler’s Most Stylish Man 2019, the youthful grandfather believes that age should have no bearing in how you should dress yourself. “It doesn’t matter what age you are; I believe in just being myself,” he attested.\n\n\nWee has a soft spot for trousers, which he believes are the foundation to every outfit, and is obsessed with eyewear. He owns close to 70 pairs of spectacles. “A lot of people would say, glasses are glasses, right? But the details are different. Even the slightest shape, makes a lot of difference, just like hairstyling,” he explained.\nJapanese luxury eyewear brand Matsuda features prominently in his eyewear collection because of its vintage feel and casual, distressed shapes and textures. But his favourite is a practical pair of foldable spectacles by Ray-Ban, gifted to him by his daughter. “I treat all my spectacles as objects of art because they complement the individual styling and enhance the outfit I’m wearing. It’s all about the total package.”\nHe defends his passion for eyewear as any fashion expert would: “Fashion is not about your hair, it’s not about your glasses, it’s not about what you wear. It’s a complete look, so the hairstyle has to compliment your face, and the glasses have to also compliment your total outfit,” he advised.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Why did this former engineer-turned-leather craftsman take apart Hermes bags?
  </h1>, 'text': ""In an era of mass production, Lin Yi Shiang applies a high level of mastery into the creation of his leather products, which are completely crafted by hand. His bespoke leather goods are made for his eponymous label, Atelier Shiang.\n“Most products on the market are either made by machines or they are partially machine-made and partially handmade. I’m good at making everything with my hands, including cutting the leather and patterning,” shared the Taipei-based craftsman.\nWhat would commonly take a leather manufacturer a day to do, Lin would need three to four weeks to accomplish. But he wouldn’t have it any other way. Part of why he makes everything by hand is the euphoria he gets when he’s saddle-stitching – his favourite step of the process.\n“With every stitch, I feel it’s kind of meditative, as if I’m the only person in the world making this leather piece. I barely hear anything, only the sound of my fingers touching the leather and threading the needle,” he waxed lyrically.\nA self-taught artisan, his favourite tools are the awls and leather knives. “An awl is something I use when I need to punch in holes and do the stitching at the same time. I use a leather knife to fix and skive the thickness of the leather,” he described.\nLin uses tools, threads and ethically-sourced leather imported from France – the same vendors that work with well-known luxury brands. The hand-stitch thread and pricking iron, for example, are the same ones used by Hermes. And the tanneries, where he acquires his leathers, also supply to Hermes, Louis Vuitton, and other big fashion houses.\n\n\nLin's\xa0appreciation for leather began in his youth. “I visited Gongguan Night Market when I was a university student and I saw a guy selling handmade leather crafts. I enjoyed looking at the leather as well as feeling it. Since then, I have fallen in love with leather bags or just the feel of leather,” he said.\nIt was only after working many years as an engineer that he decided it was time to start Atelier Shiang. At the time, he also became a father and wanted to spend more time with his family. “To me, real luxury means that I get to spend time on what I enjoy doing. I think this is something that’s relatively rare nowadays – to get paid to do something you love,” he admitted.\nLeft to his own devices, he would spend hours examining various leather products to understand their make. He even took apart a few vintage Hermes bags to finesse his hand-stitching techniques.\nOne of his most challenging projects was to incorporate an antique rose-cut diamond cross pendant into a long wallet. “I applied a special technique and set the cross into the leather. The feel of the wallet was good and the customer was happy with what I had customised for him,” he said.\nFrom custom watch straps to exquisite bags and wallets, Lin's\xa0dedication, discipline and meticulous attention to detail is evident in each item he crafts, and a testament to his background as an engineer.\nThe quality of his products is, we dare say, on par with those sold by big-name brands. “The moment when one product is finished, I get to feel how it has transformed from its original skin to the final product. Every time after I finish, I feel reluctant to hand it to the customer,” he joked.\nRecently, Lin's work caught the attention of international brands like Graff and Jaeger-LeCoultre, who invited him to conduct leather appreciation workshops. He’s even had the opportunity to collaborate on a bejewelled leather collection for American label Cody Sanderson.\nTo him, anything handmade and bespoke is considered a luxury item, even if it doesn’t sport a well-known label. “Real luxury is not about how much you spend. It is about knowing what you truly need and finding someone who can bring it to reality. It’s something that money can’t buy.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Thinking of getting a new wallet for Chinese New Year? Here are our top picks
  </h1>, 'text': 'Amassing wealth is something that’s probably on most people’s Chinese New Year resolution list. And according to symbolic tradition, buying a new wallet is a good place to start.\nIt’s believed that choosing the right colour is crucial to attracting wealth. For example, black represents prosperity and is particularly helpful in spurring career advancement and business fortune. Meanwhile, brown is said to have the ability to help curb spending, thereby increasing savings. Yellow attracts money, period. (On a side note, pink attracts luck when it comes to relationships, making it the colour for those looking for love.)\nAnd then you’ve got those to avoid: Red is said to burn away wealth, while blue symbolises water (and wealth, supposedly) flowing out.\nAside from colours, some beliefs passed down by older folk include filling your new wallet with cash to symbolise abundance and throwing out expired credit cards and receipts as they represent debt. Other things to note: A long straight wallet that keeps your money neat and in mint condition comes in handy for enhancing wealth, while irregularly-shaped wallets and second-hand ones aren’t good (the latter supposedly imbibed with the luck – or lack thereof – of its previous owner.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThen again, if you’re not into all of these, you could always do with a new wallet anyway, Chinese New Year or not. Here are some of our new wallet inspos.\xa0\xa0\nCOACH’S SMALL ZIP AROUND WALLET WITH HORSE AND CARRIAGE PRINT AND RAINBOW, S$175\nSecond-hand wallets are supposedly not a good thing because of residual “bad energy”, but that doesn’t mean you can’t go for the vintage, retro look. Its iconic rainbow, horse and carriage designs hark back to the past while its zipper design is totally au courant.\nHere’s what logomania with a touch of minimalism looks like. This bi-colour option says (but doesn’t shout) “designer”. And it’s easy on the, erm, wallet, to boot.\nKATE SPADE’S TOM & JERRY CHAIN WALLET, S$350\nJerry from Tom & Jerry lends his fame to Kate Spade this Chinese New Year. This crossbody wallet will hold your lucky money and trusty credit cards, with room to spare for bits and bobs like a lipstick and a mobile phone. Not big on shoulder straps? Just slip the metal chain off and it’s a wallet clutch.\n2020 is the Year of the Rat – which makes this wallet’s adorable rodent\xa0charm timely and gives your new purchase just that bit of edge.\nCARTIER’S GUIRLAND DE CARTIER FLAP INTERNATIONAL WALLET, S$840\nIn the market for a classic black wallet that’ll last? This understated option features the golden Cartier marking that only the truly discerning will pick up on. It also comes in a mini size.\nIf your feng shui belief of losing wealth is stopping you from getting irregularly shaped wallets, this might be a compromise. The modernised\xa0Mondrian design plays on optical illusion without compromising on form and function.\xa0\nGUCCI’S DISNEY X GUCCI ZIP AROUND WALLET, $1,050\nFor those looking to curb spending, here’s a brown wallet with a difference. Far from a yawn, this number features a remake of Gucci’s GG pattern from the 1980s and offers a nod to the Year of the Rat with Mickey Mouse taking centre stage. How cute is that?\nLOUIS VUITTON’S EPI LEATHER TWIST WALLET, S$1,550\nThere are two compartments for money (hello, abundance!), a zipped coin pocket, multiple card slots, and an LV Twist lock to hold it all in. Now this is what an abundance and prestigious combo looks like.\nThis punk-rock rendition breaks away from wallet norms. It’s basically two for the price of one, with the addition of a chain offering cross-body convenience and the option to double up as a purse.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

The logo appears in all pieces in the limited-edition collection, which includes T-shirts, jackets and baseball cap.\xa0\n\n\nTOD’S\nIn the Chinese zodiac, the rat appears first in the 12-year cycle.

This includes the Victo Ngai Pefect Journey Home scarf, a fashionable accessory printed on premium silk. The scarf can also be used as a pocket square or tied to a handbag or tote, and is available exclusively at the Marina Bay Sands store for MBS Rewards members.\nVERSACE\nVersace celebrates the new year with a range of limited-edition accessories from the Virtus line.

      High society, high fashion: Is this Singapore’s most flamboyant style maven?
  </h1>, 'text': 'If there is one mantra that society fixture Susanna Kang lives by, its “drama or pyjamas.” By day, you’ll find her kicking back in comfy oversized shirts and shorts. By night, she’s turning heads on the red carpet in one of her many over-the-top outfits that she considers pieces of art.\n“My collection is wearable art. It’s about celebrating whichever phase you are at. I suppose when I got on later in life, I got very adventurous and even more daring,” admitted Kang, who is in her 50s.\nThere’s no room for insipid ensembles in her eclectic wardrobe, which is filled with whimsical get-ups from feathery headpieces to dramatic capes. “When I was a child, fashion didn’t matter because it was all hand-me-downs. But even with whatever was given to me, I tried to put the pieces together in a very ‘my way’. I was mismatching all the prints. I was just having fun and doing what I thought was fashionable. I suppose my interest in fashion is innate,” she said.\nFor someone with such a rarefied sense of style who doesn’t follow trends, it’s always exciting to see what Kang will pull off at the next red carpet do. “My style is constantly evolving. Creativity; there’s no full stop to it. We are living our styles of how we want to be or how we wear it, and it never stops,” she affirmed.\nShe equates fashion akin to wearing art, and gravitates towards avant-garde designers like Alexander McQueen “who possesses a passion for expression and likes to push boundaries”.\nOne of her favourite pieces is a Comme des Garcons trench coat that features the iconic work of Japanese illustrator, Macoto Takahashi, designed in collaboration to celebrate his 65th anniversary as an anime artist. “I love how Comme des Garcons transforms art into clothes. Living without art is dull and dry. It transcends into every part of our lives.”\nKang also likes to collaborate with local designers to create specific looks, such as Alfie Leong, who designed a fibre optic pantsuit for a futuristic ball. “The idea of a very modern futuristic Princess Leia without the buns, seemed to be a very exciting idea. I wanted something that’s comfortable for the evening and he took my ideas, and he went into his dream world and fantasised this beautiful creation,” she remarked.\nA regular face in the party pages of high-society publications, Kang spent more than 20 years working in product and brand management at companies such as FJ Benjamin before retiring in 2008. Today, she keeps herself busy by sitting on the board of theatre company Wild Rice and supporting its Annual Rice Ball, which raises funds for education programs and programming.\n“I think the Rice Ball gives Susanna the permission to be playful, outrageous and fabulous. Some of her outfits included this evil queen with antlers on her head and feathers as if she’s about to take off,” recalled Ivan Heng, artistic director and founder of Wild Rice.\n“Well, life’s a stage. I dress to play the role. It’s not a regular, daily life, where I wear simple clothes. When I’m at the theatre, my clothes become more avant-garde, more expressive!” she replied.\nKang is also in-charge of Wild Rice’s Gift of Theatre program, which enables the under-privileged a chance to enjoy the theatre. “What I like about local arts is that it’s something that is very close to home, to who we are, what we are, our very own culture, and it speaks to each and everyone of us,” she explained.\nHer ardent love of the arts has also spawned passion projects of her own like watercolour painting and participating in charity art exhibitions. Recently, she even opened a brick-and-mortar store, Takumi Artisans, at Capitol Piazza. It’s the exclusive retailer of renowned Japanese gold leaf producer Hakuza, offering all things gold-plated – from homeware to skincare, and even edible gold leaves and gold-foil ice cream.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Meet the Turkish jeweller behind the famous M ring worn by Madonna
  </h1>, 'text': 'In a country where women stop at nothing to bedazzle themselves with heavy, ornate jewellery for special occasions, designers like Milka Karaagacli are stripping it back and offering delicate contemporary everyday jewellery that can easily transit from day to night.\n“I wanted to bring a new point of view to jewellery in Turkey,” she said, referring to her brand, Kismet by Milka, which personifies “urban reflections of Istanbul’s oriental identity”.\nWhile working as an advertising suit in London, Karaagacli gifted a necklace with an evil eye pendant to her friend. “We believe the evil eye protects us from bad luck. All my friends and family kept asking me to send them more evil eyes from Turkey and it gave me an idea: What if I started designing my own evil eyes?” revealed Karaagacli on how Kismet was born.\nIn 2009, she launched her first collection, Nazar, featuring rose gold necklaces, rings and bracelets embellished with tiny white diamonds and sapphires that beautifully reinterpret the Turkish evil eye symbol. A subsequent line, Eter, took inspiration from the crescent moon – another cultural symbol of Karaagacli’s homeland.\nKismet’s special appeal lies in its understated beauty: From slender gold rings that sport a single motif to delicate gold chains with charm pendants. All while maintaining a certain Turkish aesthetic using a multitude of textures and finishes, and intricately paved with precious gems.\nAll of Kismet’s collections are produced in its workshop in Istanbul, where Karaagacli works with 3D designers who bring her concepts to life. At her atelier, a group of skilled artisans handcraft the pieces in gold and set them with white, black or champagne diamonds, rubies and natural sapphires. “We have our own special colour of gold. It’s not rose, it’s not yellow, it’s in-between,” she revealed.\nPart of why it’s loved by both young and old is due to its versatility: It can be worn daily with jeans and T-shirts, or to a big nighttime event, and you can layer all you want. “We give our customers the freedom of creativity. They can combine it themselves. And it’s important that they are timeless,” said Karaagacli, referring to her earrings which are sold in single pieces rather than pairs.\nKismet’s jewellery is also customisable. “After I became a mother in my forties, I became more emotional, more empathetic and understood the importance of having customised jewellery. For example, the bracelet that I wear honours my family with all our names on it,” she said.\nHer strength in advertising is probably what propelled the brand to an international level that caught the attention of fashionistas and celebrities, including Madonna.\n“I gave birth to my daughter. And I made this M ring. I took a picture and posted it on Instagram saying ‘M for Mayra’. Madonna’s stylist saw my post and ordered it. The next thing I know, I’m getting an email about the pop star wearing it. She (Madonna) was posting pictures of the ring on Instagram all the time. I was so happy because one of my dreams was to have her wear my jewellery!” she gushed.\nKaraagacli’s jewellery has also received the royal nod from Meghan Markle, who is often seen wearing Kismet’s signature Hamsa ring, which Prince Harry purchased when they were courting.\n“Apparently Meghan liked it, and Harry returned to the store after she left. He asked the store manager which one she liked and he bought it as a gift for her. I think it has a meaning for them which is why she’s still wearing the ring. It’s a very lovely and romantic story because Kismet means destiny or fate,” said Karaagacli.\n“I always believe that we create our own destiny in life. Whatever you believe, it becomes true. It was my destiny to quit my 14-year career back then to become a jewellery designer,” she professed.\nKismet launches three to four new collections a year. Its latest release, Innerland – featuring African symbols like arrows, claws, feathers – is inspired by the strength Karaagacli draws from motherhood.\n“Life is not easy, it’s a battle. After we’ve won the battles, we go back to nature, to our inner self. I think when women are together, they are invincible, and they can make a better world.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Meet Thailand's first designer to customise jeans using selvedge Japanese denim
  </h1>, 'text': ""Amid Siam Square’s warren of indie fashion boutiques and youth-oriented beauty emporia, Selvedgework stands out with its bespoke denim services that has built a fan following of well-heeled hipsters and fashion mavens.\nAt the forefront of this hip label is denim connoisseur, Vitchapong “Boom” Hutasuwan, a young Thai designer whose parents have been running a denim factory for the last 30 years.\n“As a kid, I watched my parents work with different types of denim fabrics and designs. I was really living and breathing jeans. When I slept, I could hear sewing machines. I grew up with the mindset that jeans would always be in my life,” he remarked.\nIn college, Boom had the idea of moving into retail to sell selvedge jeans. Selvedge is the tightly woven band on the edge of denim which prevents it from unravelling, a detail visible only when jeans are folded at the cuff.\n“As a child, I loved going into department stores. I told myself that one day I want to open a shop of my own,” he recalled.\nBoom’s parents, however, were not keen to start another business and preferred for him to choose a different career path, like his siblings, who were in sales and engineering.\n“I think my family saw me as a kid. It’s not that they didn’t support me, but they just said it’s not the right time yet because I didn't have the experience. But I was a dreamer and Selvedgework was in my head 24 hours a day, for many years!” he exclaimed.\nIn 2012, 20-year-old Boom started Selvedgework, an online retail store offering bespoke jeans. Two years later, he opened his first physical store at Siam Square. According to him, there were no other shops offering custom-made jeans or sold premium Thai jeans.\n“I think denim can be considered a luxury item. Luxury represents good quality, like going into every detail of the product and really putting your heart and soul into it,” he attested.\nNot long after, Elle Men Thailand listed Selvedgework as one of the best denim brands in 2014 and 2015 – a sign that Boom’s risky undertaking was paying off. “The dream is for people to really love it and see the quality of the craftsmanship, and appreciate it.”\nAs you enter his workshop-styled studio, you’re greeted by industrial interiors from buffed cement floors to hardwood panels, white brick walls, leather sofas and black metal accents. Along the walls, you’ll find bales of selvedge denim and a wide selection of buttons and add-ons like tailored waistbands, leather patches, pocket linings, and more.\nOwning a pair of jeans from Selvedgework is akin to possessing a piece of art. The intricate process involved in its creation is remarkably painstaking. First, you select the fabric: Denim from Japan’s Kaihara and Kurabo mills – some of the best mills in the world. Then, you get to select your preferred thread colours, pocket linings, buttons and fit. Even the smallest details like leather patches and your initials can be added on – anything to make the jeans stand out in the crowd.\n“The reason I create custom-made jeans is because I want people to express themselves and not just follow trends. If they like pink-coloured thread, why not?” Boom enthused.\nThese days, Boom is applying paint to jeans and creating literal works of art on fabric. “I love art and I love jeans. So I fused my two loves, and will be offering customers the option to paint their jeans,” said Boom, who most recently hand-painted a sample collection featuring the works of Andy Warhol.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Back from holiday and thinking of dry cleaning your wool sweaters? Don’t bother
  </h1>, 'text': 'There’s a unique thrill to beating the system. Scoffing at the “dry clean only” label on your delicate duds may not be the most exciting rebellion imaginable, but it’s a scheme that pays off on laundry day every week. It has for me: Instead of spending my money at the dry cleaners, I wash most of my silk and wool at home, right in the bathroom sink.\nYet certain items really do need the extra TLC of a dry clean. So how do you know which is which? We asked the experts, including a master tailor, a laundry specialist, and an authority on cleaning fine fabric, to help sort out when to heed the label’s warning and when to break the rules.\nWHICH FABRICS CAN YOU WASH?\nAccording to Lindsey J. Boyd, co-founder of the specialty laundry brand The Laundress, “The instructions found on care tags aren’t necessarily the best way to clean an item.” The key to a successful wash lies in the fabric. Most items made from plant fibres like cotton and linen, and durable man-made fabrics like nylon and polyester, have labels that say they’re machine washable. If they’re too fragile for the washer (which may be the reason dry cleaning is suggested), our experts say these fabrics are generally safe to hand wash.\n“Items made from wool, silk, linen, cotton, and other natural fibres usually can be hand washed,” said Gerri Young, owner and founder of Allo Laverie, a cleaner specialising in fine linen. Although these and other animal fibres – such as cashmere – sometimes “require” dry cleaning per their label, they usually tolerate water very well. Martin Greenfield, owner of custom tailor shop Martin Greenfield Clothiers, told us wool rarely needs dry cleaning. “Wool is an animal’s hair – they don’t get dry cleaned. They go out in the rain.”\nHe recommends that his clients spot-clean and steam-press their suits, which restores the natural finish. “We find the dry cleaning fluid to be very caustic on fine wools, so we try to avoid it as much as possible,” he explained.\nDry cleaning certain delicate fabrics may also shorten their life span, causing them to lose their lustre and contributing to wear and tear. “The clothing gets tossed into a machine with a spin cycle – it’s pretty rough on hand-tailored clothing,” Greenfield said.\nHand washing is simple and cheap – you likely have the supplies on hand. For the best results, use a detergent for delicates (many all-purpose cleaners can be rough on wool and silk). We like no-rinse formulas like those we recommend in our guide to the best detergent for hand washing. Just fill your basin with tepid (never hot!) water and your detergent, and soak for 15 minutes. Then carefully squeeze out the water and air dry.\n“Never put silk in the dryer!” said Cora Harrington, founder and editor of The Lingerie Addict. Similarly, keep wool away from hot water and agitation unless you want to make felt.\nIt’s often easiest to hang up silk blouses and dresses in the shower, where they can drip dry. Wet sweaters must be laid flat and “blocked” – that is, shaped so they dry correctly. It might be worthwhile to invest in a drying rack (like this one from OXO), which helps air circulate, but you can also use a bath towel. Hand-washed clothing, especially silk, often dries with some wrinkles or crunchiness, but a once-over with a steamer will quickly bring back its suppleness and lustre. We have several recommendations in our guide to the best clothing steamers.\n“The instructions found on care tags aren’t necessarily the best way to clean an item.” – Lindsey J. Boyd\nHOW TO TEST YOUR FABRIC\nIt’s always a bit of a gamble when you go off-label and ignore a manufacturer’s advice. “Generally certain things should be able to withstand hand washing,” Young said. “But that doesn’t always translate into everything going well.”\nTo lower the risk, the experts suggest testing your fabric to check for warping and colour transfer. “Find an inconspicuous area on the garment, like the side seam or hem, and dip it in water,” Boyd told us. “If you notice any sort of distortion, we don’t recommend washing.”\nYoung said she used a similar method to check for dye transfer: “Place a white paper towel on each side of the dampened area and press down. If any colour is seen on the paper towel, the item isn’t colourfast.” And, she said, the more colourful your garment, the bigger the risk. “When it comes to silk, dark and brilliantly-coloured pieces and patterns are best dry cleaned.” Patterns with contrasting colours are especially susceptible to damage, as any leaking dark dye can easily stain the lighter areas.\nAnother clue? The price. As Young explained, cheaper, low-quality silks are often less stable than the expensive stuff, so they don’t do as well with hand washing. “A good test for silk items is to gently bunch it into a ball with your hands, then release. If the fabric feels luxurious and liquid, it likely will do fine with hand washing. If it creases and wrinkles badly, send it to the dry cleaners.”\n“Items made from wool, silk, linen, cotton, and other natural fibres usually can be hand washed.” – Gerri Young\nWHEN MUST YOU DRY CLEAN?\n“There are some fabrics that react poorly to water like viscose, a type of rayon,” Boyd said. “Although many rayons can be washed, viscose has been known to shrink to extreme proportions.” Similar fabrics in the rayon family include lyocell (known by the brand name Tencel), modal, and cupro (often branded as Bemberg), although these are usually washable. “The important takeaway about rayon is to follow the care label,” Young said.\nRemember, if your item has a blend of fabrics (or two different fabrics, as in a coat with a lining), always clean according to the more finicky one. You may be able to hand wash silk, but since viscose usually requires dry cleaning, you shouldn’t wash a silk-viscose blend at home.\nNo matter the fabric content, when the label for an item with a decorative finish (such as moire or pleats) or delicate beading recommends dry cleaning, don’t ignore it – those details are very easy to ruin. If you have something particularly sentimental or fragile, playing it safe may be the better option. “Generally, it’s often fine to hand wash silk. For very special pieces, you may still want to opt for a dry cleaner,” said Harrington.\nFor particularly filthy or stained items, call the professionals. “If somebody spills red wine all over your suit then yes, you’d need to have it dry cleaned,” Greenfield said. “But only when it’s absolutely necessary.”\n“Wool is an animal’s hair – they don’t get dry cleaned. They go out in the rain.” – Martin Greenfield\nBy Jennifer Hunter @ The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Looking back at the 2010s: How the luxury industry embraced sustainability
  </h1>, 'text': 'In many ways, the 2010s has been a landmark decade for our planet. The science can no longer be ignored – we now have incontrovertible proof that climate change is real and may lead to an irreversible tipping point in the future.\nBut there is hope, too. Sustainability has become more than something that dreadlocked hippies do. Increasingly, the global population is making personal choices to go green and at the same time, play a part in spreading awareness for this cause. For instance, it is undeniable that teenage activist Greta Thunberg has single handedly made the world think more closely about the urgent need to push for change.\nThe first signs of this paradigm shift happened in the early 2010s, when we were first introduced to the concept of the resource-saving sharing economy via ride-sharing app Uber and home-rental service Airbnb.\nBy the end of the decade, Japanese minimalist Marie Kondo would have charmed legions of people around the world into reexamining their hoarding habits, both via spring cleaning their homes and also by making careful decisions about the things they buy.\n\n\nAnd as conscious buyers flex their influence by voting with their dollars, the consumer industry has followed suit. Remarkably, the luxury sector, which is sometimes viewed as the epicentre of frivolous spending, has been adapting rapidly to the green revolution. Case in point: In 2012, the Tesla Model S was the first luxury electric car to be launched. Multiple car brands including Audi, Jaguar and Porsche now have their own premium electric vehicles for motorheads.\nIndeed, across practically all sectors of luxury, from fashion and beauty to food and travel, companies are taking concerted action to offer eco-conscious options to their customers.\nHermes, one of the most highly respected fashion houses in the world, was an early adopter of the luxe green movement. In 2010, Hermes family member Pascale Mussard started petit h as a way to creatively reuse leftover material that would otherwise be discarded. The whimsical creations, which range from tote bags and paperweights to decorative objects, have been a hit among customers. There are now several petit h pop-ups in Hermes boutiques around the world, including a recently concluded one in Singapore.\n\n\nChanel has stopped using exotic skins in its collections while Prada, Gucci, Coach and Giorgio Armani are among the brands who have gone fur-free this past decade. In August, Francois-Henri Pinault, chief executive of luxury conglomerate Kering, led a group of 32 signatories, including Chanel, Prada and H&M in signing a Fashion Pact to minimise the industry’s impact on the environment.\nThe reselling economy has gone upscale too. The stigma of using a pre-owned item is gone and secondhand does not necessarily mean rummaging around misty thrift stores. Today’s vintage and pre-loved retailers such as The Fifth Collection and Vestiaire Collective offer savvy shoppers guilt-free access to covetable luxury goods while clothing rental services like Rent The Runway and Covetella offer clotheshorses a virtually limitless “wardrobe in the cloud”.\n\n\nThe beauty industry has also been coming around – terms like “ethical”, “vegan”, “natural” and “organic” are more commonplace than ever. High-end beauty brands are taking the effort to source for sustainable and ethical ingredients when formulating their products.\nFor instance, Chopard Parfums has a sustainable luxury programme that ensures it uses responsibly sourced ingredients and that people working in its supply chain are fairly taken care of. The L’Oreal group, which owns Kiehl’s, Lancome and Urban Decay, plans to reduce the environmental footprint of its production sites by 60 per cent by next year and to ultimately put an end to animal testing. Dior has reduced the amount of packaging used in products by removing excess cardboard and paper – and more companies have pledged to follow suit.\nThere has never been a better time to be a plant-eating gourmand. Whether you are a devout vegan, a flexitarian or even a carnivore seeking something a little different for your palate, there are now so many more ways to enjoy veggie-forward meals.\nGlobally, plant-based restaurants like Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s ABCV in New York City, Peggy Chan’s Nectar in Hong Kong and Kim Ji Young’s Balwoo Gongyang in Seoul are pushing boundaries in meat-free fine dining. Singapore’s no slouch in this department either. Odette, St Pierre and Jaan serve exceptional vegetarian degustation menus and many other restaurants now offer delightful meatless options that go far beyond a plain old Caesar’s salad.\nPlant-based alternatives to replace carbon producing livestock, such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, have become such a big deal they have secured hundreds of millions in funding to expand on a global scale. On the local front, Tempeh Culture, a premium artisanal tempeh brand has in the past year impressed many of the country’s prominent food connoisseurs with its versatility and high nutritional content. Could this heritage dish be the next decade’s big food trend?\n\n\nIt is now possible for conscious individuals to adhere to their sustainable lifestyles even when they travel. Resorts that tout their eco-friendly credentials are finally taking steps beyond the cursory gesture of asking guests to forego housekeeping services or to give up a fresh change of sheets and towels. A new wave of green resorts are built with energy saving light and air conditioning systems and are designed to minimise their impact on their environments.\nMany of the world’s largest hotel groups, including Marriott, Hyatt and InterContinental are in the process of replacing travel-sized plastic toiletry bottles with wall-mounted dispensers to minimise plastic waste. Other hotels have corporate social responsibility programmes where they make an effort to hire locally or channel funds into charitable projects for the environment and the community.\nStill, despite all these advancements in sustainability, conscious consumption is still fraught with plenty of loopholes. It is tough to buy ethically, even among the most well intentioned. For one, it is up to the individual to do his or her research to decide if a company is truly making an effort or is merely spouting marketing spiel.\nOften, green consumption comes at the expense of something else. Remember the social media-friendly campaign to eliminate plastic straws? A study found that producing a single metal straw requires 100 times more energy than a plastic straw – and releases more greenhouse gas. This means the metal straw could be the more eco-friendly alternative only if the user remembers to use it as a substitute at least 101 times.\nSimilarly, counter arguments could be applied to just about every example of sustainable consumption. For instance, Kering-led The Fashion Pact has already been critiqued for not having a clear plan of action and while the luxury fashion industry might be moving away from using controversial furs, many brands still produce waste on a huge scale by destroying unsold stock.\nThen, there are concerns that people who switch to a vegan or vegetarian diet may end up with nutritional deficiencies if they are unaware of the necessary substitutes they should make. And of course, travellers incur a carbon debt each time they fly – at best, they can buy carbon credits to offset their footprint.\nNevertheless, while many of these green options are imperfect solutions, it is still worth starting with baby steps because the consequences of the alternative – inaction – could potentially be catastrophic. Begin by drinking directly from a cup instead of using a straw today, and who knows what you might be inspired to do tomorrow?\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     sustainability ', '     fashion ', '     Beauty ', '     cars ', '     Restaurants ']}"

      Commentary: The rise and rise of the sneaker
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: In June this year, hundreds of Australian shoppers queued – some overnight – to buy a pair of Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Black Static Adidas sneakers the moment they went on sale.\nBefore lining up, customers had to register and go into a draw to determine whether they could buy a pair. The shoes sold for a few hundred dollars but are now being traded for up to AU$3,000 (US$2,070).\nThis quest to obtain limited edition sneakers designed by rapper Kanye West is not an isolated phenomenon. People have long gone to extreme lengths to get their hands on the latest kicks.\nThere have been reports of sneaker violence since the 1980s.\nFor those wishing to form a more orderly queue, the internet has responded with news services and dedicated message boards to help people get the latest kicks. Other sites treat sneakers like stock market commodities.\nBut how does society’s sneaker love tally with our awareness of the environmental and human cost of consumerism?\nA LONG HISTORY\nThe first sneakers appeared in 1830s England, when Liverpool Rubber bonded a canvas outer onto a vulcanised rubber sole, creating the original sand shoe for the Victorian middle classes to wear on the beach.\nDifferent styles of the shoe were developed in the UK and the US throughout the 19th century to respond to athletic pursuits like running, tennis, jumping and sailing.\nThe term “sneaker” was coined in the US in the 1870 to describe the shoe because it was noiseless. Athletes in Paris wore sneakers at the first modern Olympic Games in 1900.\nThe American pro-basketball player Charles H\xa0Taylor, passionately promoted the sneakers designed by Marquis M Converse in 1917. By 1923, Taylor’s improvements had been incorporated into the shoe, his signature added to their design, and Converse “Chucks” have remained unchanged since.\nAdidas was founded by the Dassler brothers in Germany in 1926, and Puma was founded in 1948 when the Dassler brothers split. Onitsuka Tiger (ASICS) were founded in Japan in 1949 and Reebok started making sneakers in 1958.\nNew Balance started creating their “Trackster” sneakers in 1961, and Nike was founded in 1972. At every point, sneakers were created to support athletes, but also to promote lifestyles that connected leisure with physical activity.\nSince the 1970s, sneakers have been linked to skateboarding and hip-hop culture, including break dancing; urban pursuits that require a high degree of comfort and ease of movement.\nThe explosion of hip-hop from the mid-1980s and its global dominance in the 1990s meant that sneakers quickly became a visual symbol of hip-hop and a symbol of its separation from the mainstream.\nRun DMC’s 1986 track, My Adidas was as much about the band’s love for sneakers as it was about how quickly people judged youths who wore sneakers to be troublemakers.\nLikewise, when rave culture blossomed in the 1980s and 1990s, sneakers became the footwear of choice for the 24-hour party people who dressed to sweat.\nSNEAKERS TODAY\nThe current nostalgia in sneakers extends to design imagery, styles, and colour combinations. In April this year, Adidas issued a limited edition version of the My Adidas Superstar 1986 sneaker.\nLuxury brands have also taken note, capitalising on historical references, status concerns and a relaxation in social dress codes.\nLeading high-fashion brands, including Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga now consider sneakers a must-have fashion item in their collections.\nBalenciaga’s recent Triple S sneakers (priced at around AU$1,300) echo the platform sneaker trends of the 1990s, with the company’s CEO Cedric Charbit, noting “sneakers … blend nicely with the way we live”.\nWhere once 1980s women swapped their commuter sneakers for power heels at the office, people now wear their sneakers all day.\nCharbit believes the sneaker has become, “very versatile, it goes from day to night, it goes for the weekend, it goes for work”.\nSUSTAINABILITY AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nWhile many sneaker fans continue to prioritise style over environmental concerns, others are demanding transparency around the ethics and impact of production, leading to the rise of the sustainable sneaker.\nMeghan, The Duchess of Sussex, favours Veja sneakers made from wild Amazonian rainforest rubber.\nAdidas has been making sneakers using recycled ocean plastic since 2015, but says it wants to go further. It launched the Futurecraft Loop in April, a sneaker made exclusively from 100 per cent reusable Thermoplastic polyurethane that can be recycled again and again.\nAdidas, Brooks, Reebok, and Salomon showed positive working conditions at their factories in a 2018 survey, but there was still a problem with low wages.\nSites like the Good Shopping Guide can help customers\xa0make more informed choices. But sustainable fashion expert Mark Liu notes, “Sneakers are still extremely problematic because of all their toxic petrochemical components, glues and the amount of greenwash in the industry”.\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND\nOne key to enduring sneaker love is scarcity. Adidas only released 1986 of their limited-edition My Adidas Superstar 1986 shoes.\nWest also generates exclusivity with low production numbers – only 40,000 pairs of Yeezys are made worldwide for each drop and shops in Australia may only have 25 pairs of each incarnation.\nThe combination of rarity, and the myriad cultural meanings embedded in sneakers creates an emotional pull for collectors like DJ Jerome Salele’a, that\xa0ties them to sneaker, hip-hop, skater and rave communities around the globe.\nThe ultimate sneaker is a comfortable vehicle for the body to move through the world that expresses the wearer’s desires, dreams and aspirations and crosses social, geographic and language boundaries.\nEmily Brayshaw is a\xa0 Lecturer in\xa0Fashion and Design History at the University of Technology Sydney.

      The Vietnamese fashion designer who credits his mum for his success
  </h1>, 'text': 'Vietnamese designer Lam Gia Khang, a fourth-generation tailor in his family, first discovered his love for fashion at the tender age of eight. “When I was a child, my mother – who inherited the business from my grandaunt – used to let me play around the tailor shop. The tailoring tools soon became my toys,” he revealed.\nHe loved imitating his mother at work and soon, he too, began to develop a deep passion for tailoring. “All those years watching her create beautiful bespoke dresses made me fall in love with dressmaking. I was deeply inspired by the joy that women felt whenever they wear a new dress,” said Lam.\nHis mother, Mdm Hang Nguyen, had reservations about her son’s lofty ambitions in the beginning, as tailoring in her eyes was perceived as blue-collar work, but Lam’s natural talent and creativity changed her mind.\n“Khang has always been very passionate about fashion design. He learned to sew by watching me. He was also very eager to design clothing for my customers. The ladies were always full of praise for his creations. It was then that I realised that he would go far in his career,” she said.\nThat passion steered him closer to his dreams of becoming a full-fledged couturier when he bagged third place in the first season of Project Runway Vietnam in 2013. Shortly after that, he attended the\xa0London College for Design and Fashion\xa0in Hanoi before launching his\xa0LAM GIA KHANG\xa0label in 2014. The following year, his “less is more” aesthetic earned him the title\xa0“Upcoming Fashion Designer of the Year” for Elle Vietnam.\nHis takes a classical approach to design with clean, modern lines in a neutral colour palette of beige, white and black – timeless colours that will fit every occasion and every season. The rationale behind his minimalist approach to style is simple: “I’ve always wanted to design for women who pursue a simple yet elegant aesthetic. I don’t want to just design trendy and bold outfits that will be thrown away after the season ends. My designs will follow customers throughout their lives.”\n\n\nThat distinct point of view continues with his second eponymous label, Gia Studios, which hit a home run when his debut collection sold out at Hong Kong’s Lane Crawford in 2018. Lam’s work has also been featured in Vogue China and Grazia UK.\nThe by-appointment-only boutique offers bespoke dressmaking services, as well as ready-to-wear collections inspired by Saigon style. Lam’s latest collection is inspired by beautiful images from the past, such as the timeless elegance of old Saigon, when office ladies donned pencil skirts, flared trousers and fitted shirts.\nLam is deeply nostalgic about his hometown and hopes his brand will be able to give a fresh perspective of Vietnamese fashion at an international level. “It is important to let the world know Vietnamese fashion has evolved beyond traditional costumes,” he remarked.\nAt the helm of his production team at Gia Studios is none other than Lam’s mother, who continues to work tirelessly to help her son achieve his artistic vision. On the plus side, having your mother work alongside you has its perks, too. Lam’s mother packs home-cooked meals to the office for him daily, including his favourite soup!\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     design ', '     Vietnam ', '     Artisans ']}"

      A decade in fashion: A look back at the most important designers who left us 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Much has happened in the 2010s. The fashion landscape has changed forever with the passing of fashion greats such as Karl Lagerfeld who reinvented not just Chanel but the very definition of cool; raven-haired Sonia Rykiel who made granny sweaters chic; and Alexander McQueen who made looking cheap incredibly sophisticated. Before 2019 draws to a close, CNA Lifestyle pays tribute to the style mavens we lost in the last decade. \xa0\nGLORIA VANDERBILT \nDied 17 June 2019, aged 95, of stomach cancer.\nThe “poor little rich girl” was born into Vanderbilt railroad and shipping family. Her father died when she was 18 months old, upon which she inherited a US$4.7 million (S$6.37 million) trust fund (US$70 million in today’s terms).\nClaim to fame The American socialite found early fame as an actress, model and painter. She had an extremely colourful personal life – close friends included Truman Capote and Diane Von Furstenberg. She dated Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Gene Kelly and Howard Hughes, married four times (to non-celebrities), and had a famous son – CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.\nCareer Highlights She started a line of scarves in the 1970s, and launched a self-branded denim line for women in the 80s. The jeans’ success was due to a then-revolutionary cut that curved in at the waist, especially in the small of the back, to flatter the female shape – sales reached US$10 million the first year. The brand expanded to encompass clothing, perfume and home goods. Vanderbilt retired from fashion in the 1990s, and focused on art and writing several books of poetry and her memoirs.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without her At 85, she published her second novel Obsession: An Erotic Tale, with saucy content involving nipple clamps and spankings with a hairbrush.\nKARL LAGERFELD\nDied 19 February 2019, aged 85, of complications from pancreatic cancer.\nA Hamburg-born German who had no formal education in fashion, he majored in drawing and history at Lycee Montaigne in Paris before becoming the most prolific designer of the 20th and 21st centuries.\nCareer Highlights Lagerfeld got his first break in\xa0the fashion industry in 1955 by entering a clothing design competition sponsored by the International Wool Secretariat, winning in the coat category. Soon after, he was hired by Pierre Balmain as an assistant and apprentice. In the 1950s and 1960s, he designed for Jean Patou, Charles Jourdan, Chloe, Krizia and Valentino, before Fendi hired him in 1967 to revamp its fur line. Chanel engaged him in 1982 to breathe new life into the fabled French fashion house. In 1984, he started his eponymous label. Lagerfeld was presented the Outstanding Achievement Award at the British Fashion Awards in 2015.\nClaim to fame He was best remembered for reinventing Chanel. The “Kaiser of fashion” helmed not just one, but three world-renowned fashion labels for decades, right up to his death. He had a truly distinctive signature look, which comprised heavily powdered white hair, black sunglasses, fingerless gloves, and high-collared white shirts.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without him He was so famous for his bon mots there’s even a book called The World According To Karl devoted to his pithiest quotes, such as “Trendy is the last stage before tacky”.\nKATE SPADE\nDied 5 June 2018, aged 55, of asphyxiation by hanging.\nThe American designer worked her way up from an entry-level temp position to senior fashion editor for accessories at Mademoiselle magazine. Dismayed by the styles and prices of designer handbags she encountered, she asked herself:\xa0 ‘Where’s a bag that I can afford, that’s simple, that’s not saying too much and that I won’t be embarrassed to pull out every season?’. She then started a handbag business with no formal design training.\nClaim to fame Her signature nylon handbags were a 90s staple, with sturdy construction, practical designs and cheerful colour palettes.\xa0Her whimsical novelty handbags, shaped like lobsters, gnomes, carousels, swans, Volkswagen Beetles, \xa0and old fashioned cameras, were also much sought after.\nCareer Highlights Founded Kate Spade in 1993. The boxy Sam bag, which was part of her inaugural collection became one of its signatures. Vogue and other magazines featured her creations, and celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow were spotted carrying them. In 1996, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) awarded her the New Fashion Talent in Accessories prize and in 1998, Best Accessory Designer of the Year.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without her In a world obsessed by trendy bags, and impractical trends such as micro or maxi sizes, or OTT materials, she was the voice of reason.\nHUBERT\xa0DE GIVENCHY \nDied 10 March 2018, aged 91, of natural causes.\nHis father was the Marquis of Givenchy and his mother Beatrice Badin’s family owned the Beauvais tapestry workshops. As a child, his maternal grandmother allowed him to play with fabrics, while his mother and cousins pretended to be customers. His mother introduced him to couture houses and sent him to study fashion at Paris’ Ecole des Beaux-Arts.\nClaim to fame For being Audrey Hepburn’s lifelong go-to designer. He created the long black dress she wore in 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and dressed her for Funny Face, Sabrina, and How To Steal A Million.

Only 24 when he started his own house, he championed the concept of separates with his first couture collection in 1952, and became the first designer to launch a high-end ready-to-wear line in 1954. Awarded Paris couture’s Golden Thimbles in 1978 and 1982, the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York and the Musee de la Mode in Paris have held exhibitions of his creations. He retired in 1995.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without him The “Master of Draping” held true to his philosophy that a dress should defer to a woman’s shape.\nAZZEDINE ALAIA \nDied 17 November 2017, aged 82, of a heart attack.\nBorn to a wheat farming family in Tunisia in 1940, he studied sculpture in Tunis’ fine arts school before working at a dressmaker’s shop. He moved to Paris in 1957 in an attempt to break into fashion.\nClaim to fame Known as “The King of Cling”, for his figure-hugging designs that celebrate the female form, especially in the body-conscious 1980s and 1990s. And for being the man supermodel Naomi Campbell called “Papa”.\nCareer Highlights Landed his first job in Paris at Christian Dior which lasted all of five days – he was asked to leave as his immigration papers were not in order, and replaced by Yves Saint Laurent. Alaia designed freelance for Greta Garbo, the Rothschild family, and the dancers at Crazy Horse cabaret before he worked at Guy Laroche and Thierry Mugler, and subsequently starting his own label in 1979. Famous (and famously sexy) fans included Grace Jones, Tina Turner, Madonna, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell. Former FLOTUS Michelle Obama wore an Alaia sweater to Buckingham Palace.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without him Alaia always marched to his own beat – he refused to follow the international fashion week calendars, releasing collections whenever he wished.\nSONIA RYKIEL\nDied 25 August 2016, aged 86, of complications from Parkinson’s disease.\nBorn Sonia Flis, the daughter of a Romanian watchmaker and a Russian lady of leisure, worked as a window-dresser in her teens in Paris. Artist Henri Matisse was so entranced by a scarf display she had created\xa0that he bought most of it. In 1953, she married Parisian boutique owner Sam Rykiel.\nClaim to fame Unable to find something suitable to wear while pregnant in 1962, she asked an Italian knitwear supplier to her husband’s boutique, to create a sweater and a knit dress for her, with high armholes and a shrunken fit. Her friends began to place orders for what came to be known as the Poor Boy sweater, which ended up on the cover of French ELLE. Audrey Hepburn bought 14 of those sweaters in every colour.\nCareer Highlights Rykiel opened her first boutique in 1968 on Paris’ Left Bank and is credited as the first designer to put seams on the outside of a garment, leave hems unfinished and use slogans on sweaters. She’s also been credited with popularising wearing black.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without her She championed that brand of Rive Gauche (or Left Bank) chic we associate with Parisian women.\nANDRE COURREGES \nDied 7 January 2016, aged 92, after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease.\nThe Frenchman initially studied Engineering, then served as a WWII Air Force pilot for two years, from 1944 to 1946. Post-war, he enrolled in a training college, studying fashion and textile design.\nClaim to fame His truly modern (especially for his time) approach to fashion, which saw stark, futuristic styles based on geometric shapes, inspired by the race for space. Famous fans included Catherine Deneuve, Brigitte Bardot, Francoise Hardy, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Miley Cyrus.\nCareer Highlights Courreges scored his first job as a designer at couture house Jeanne Lafaurie, where he worked for four years. He was offered a job at Balenciaga, where he worked for 11 years, and met the woman he was to marry, Coqueline Barriere. The couple set up their own couture house, AC, in 1961. Courreges introduced trousers for every occasion in 1963, a bold fashion move that reflected social changes. His 1965 silver-and-white Space Age collection caused a stir as it presented radical looks such as the mini, trouser suits with midriff cutouts worn with no bra, accessorised with out-of-this-world, astronaut-inspired items such as flat boots, goggles and helmets.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without him Together with Paco Rabanne\xa0and Pierre Cardin, Courreges defined the 1960s “go-go girl” look.\nMADAME CARVEN \nDied 8 June 2015, aged 105, of natural causes.\nBorn Carmen de Tomasso, her chic mother used to take her along to view the Paris collections. Carven was told she would never be elegant due to her petite stature (she was just slightly over five feet tall). She studied interior decor and architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Her first stab at fashion involved making outfits for her pet cat.\nClaim to fame In an industry dominated by male designers creating clothing for statuesque models, Carven became known as the petite woman’s go-to couturier. Her creations were modern, unfussy yet feminine, and unusually, featured humble-yet-cheerful everyday fabrics such as pink gingham, broderie anglaise and Indian cotton. An early pioneer of pret-a-porter, she also patented the push-up bra in 1950.\nCareer Highlights Carven launched her eponymous house in 1945, with the objective of dressing vertically-challenged women. Famous clients included Leslie Caron and Edith Piaf. She invented the idea of a trunk show in 1949, touring her collections (with models in tow) in far-flung locations such as Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Thailand and even Singapore. Brigitte Bardot wore a Carven dress for her 1959 wedding. She retired aged 84, in 1993.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without her She was one of few designers who kept real women’s needs in mind, while taking a 360-degree approach to the design, fabrication and marketing of fashion.\nOSCAR DE LA RENTA \nDied 20 October 2014, aged 82, of complications from cancer.\nThe only son of a well-to-do Dominican family, he headed to Madrid aged 19 to study painting, but switched to fashion design, sketching clothes for newspapers and couture clients to earn extra pocket money. The wife of the US Ambassador to Spain, Francesca Lodge, saw his sketches, and commissioned him to design a debutante gown for her daughter. It appeared in a cover story on Life magazine in 1956. He then got a job at Balenciaga’s Madrid branch, before getting hired by Christian Dior in Paris.\nClaim to fame Feminine, fabulous evening wear worn by several FLOTUS, such as Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama, and A-list celebs such as Amy Adams, Penelope Cruz and Sarah Jessica Parker at red carpet events.\nCareer Highlights Within a day of moving to New York in 1963, he was offered a job designing couture for Elizabeth Arden’s boutique on Fifth Avenue. He founded his own house in 1965, and won the Coty Award in 1967 and 1968. In 1990, he received the CFDA Lifetime Achievement award. He designed haute couture for Balmain from 1993 to 2002, and received the\xa0Council of Fashion Designers Designer of the Year Award\xa0in 2000 and in 2007.\nWhy fashion will never be the same without him Trends came and went, but de la Renta never wavered from his Old School vision of elegance.\nALEXANDER MCQUEEN \nDied 11 February 2010, aged 40, of asphyxiation by hanging.\nBorn Lee Alexander McQueen, the Brit son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher started off as an apprentice in London’s Savile Row, before earning his MA in fashion at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.\nCareer Highlights His entire 1992 graduation collection was bought by influential Brit fashion stylist Isabella Blow, and he started his eponymous label that very year. He was chief designer at French fashion house Givenchy from 1996 to 2001, and was voted British Designer of the Year not just one, but four times, in 1996, 1997, 2001 and 2003, as well as\xa0 the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s International Designer of the Year 2003.\nClaim to fame Ultra low-rise trousers known\xa0as Bumsters came from this “enfant terrible” of fashion. McQueen was feted for his subversive gothic sensibilities, razor-sharp tailoring, and bold use of print. He also popularised skull prints and put knuckledusters on evening clutches. His eagerly-anticipated catwalk shows featured cutting-edge technology; model Shalom Harlow was rotated on a revolving section of the catwalk of Givenchy’s Spring/Summer 1999 show while being spray-painted by two robotic guns.\xa0\nWhy fashion will never be the same without him No other designer could pull off extravagant runway shows that wowed audiences with such drama, theatricality, and shock appeal.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

Readers also loved\xa0a good bargain when it came to beauty products and, it seems, were also itching to put on their cardigans thanks to the recent pleasant weather. Read the stories below.\nAARON KWOK IN SINGAPORE: HOW DOES THE MAN STILL LOOK THIS GOOD AT 53?\nThe Hong Kong superstar was in town last August for the launch of Lancome’s new anti-ageing product – and was the perfect poster boy for looking young. “I started to take care of my skin from way back in 1995. That’s 24 years of persistence. Taking care of the skin is not just what women do; men should do it, too,” he said, also revealing secrets such as keeping his body in shape, eating well and getting some rest. Well, a lot of people do that and they’re still not Aaron Kwok, so he must be keeping some vital tips all to himself.\nMUST GOOD SKINCARE BE COSTLY?

      How luxury resellers are waging war against counterfeit goods in the digital age
  </h1>, 'text': ""The second-hand luxury market is booming. Whereas customers once preferred their purchases to be box-fresh, they have now embraced the idea of owning pre-loved items. The figures are encouraging, too: In 2018, the resale market rang up a total of S$8.2 billion in sales in the US alone, according to data from Bain & Co. Meanwhile, statistics from Berenberg have projected that this segment of the industry will account for nine per cent of all luxury transactions by 2020. Sales will hit close to S$70 billion by 2023, based on numbers published by Forbes.\n\n\nThe rise of the second-hand luxury market can be largely attributed to the digital revolution that has swept across the world and disrupted traditional business models. In turn, this wave of radical innovation has led to the birth of “re-commerce” websites such as ReBag, The RealReal and ThredUp – platforms that have been calibrated to offer a speedy and fuss-free experience for discerning Millennial and Gen-Z shoppers with their insatiable appetite for luxury products.\nHowever, the emergence of such players in the online sphere has presented a set of hurdles and challenges. Amongst them: The issue of authenticity. Counterfeit goods have been a sore point for fashion for as long as the industry has existed. Vestiaire Collective, a Paris-based resale website with more than eight million users in its database, noted in its 2018 findings that “the value of imported goods accounted for over three per cent of global trade, totalling over S$683 billion.” In Singapore, 59 per cent of women surveyed have unknowingly purchased fake goods, while 78 per cent are unable to spot a fake product.\nTo that end, Vestiaire Collective has taken steps to combat the problem. “In 2012 we signed the ‘Fight Against Online Counterfeiting Charter’ alongside brands such as LVMH and Christian Louboutin to help ensure a zero-tolerance approach to counterfeit products,” explained co-founder and President, Fanny Moizant, in a statement.\nIn order to ensure that its members can shop with an ease of mind, Vestiaire Collective has assembled teams of authentication experts based in its Paris, New York and Hong Kong hubs. Led by Victoire Boyer Chammard, Head of Authentication & Quality Control, these specialists are either trained auctioneers from top auction houses, gemologists, or leading professionals armed with valuable brand and product experience.\nDuring the authentication process, these experts pore over every little detail to ensure that the legitimacy of the items. The first step to identifying a counterfeit is usually tactile – time is taken to feel the material to ascertain its quality. Logos or any form of typography on the products are then examined because they are obvious tell-tale signs. Uneven or slanted stitching warn of a badly made item. Serial numbers help with the identification process, too, and Chammard recommends asking for proof of purchase if you're buying an item online.\nIt's a thorough process akin to a detective piecing together clues to solve a mystery, but other resale sites such as The Fifth Collection have begun utilising cutting-edge technology to circumvent authenticity issues altogether. As one of Singapore's leading second-hand luxury e-commerce destination, The Fifth Collection recognised the growing role of technology and in 2015 invested funds to develop Entrupy, a cutting-edge system developed by a group of scientists from New York University.\nHow Entrupy works is simple: Like a scope, it allows the user to take microscopic pictures of the product. Highly advanced AI then takes over and compares the shots with millions of others in its database. “The imaging is so sensitive, it can fingerprint the item and recognise the next time it is scanned,” the team at The Fifth Collection explained. With an authentication accuracy of more than 99.1 per cent, counterfeiters, be warned.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     luxury ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Introducing Caroline Low-Heah: Doctor, donor and Dior dress collector
  </h1>, 'text': 'At the Singapore Tatler Ball 2019, Dr Caroline Low-Heah said: “It’s hard work to start a charity but if you\'re passionate, sincere and have a damn good committee, the satisfaction and gratification will come."" said. She was presented the Singapore Tatler Award for Community Service for her work with Kidz Horizon Appeal.\nAs founding Chairperson of Kidz Horizon Appeal, Low-Heah, who’s a medical doctor, played a pivotal role in gathering a group of friends who saw their success in businesses or professions as opportunities to do even more for others who are less fortunate.\nEstablished in 2004, the charitable organisation attends specifically to the medical needs of the most vulnerable in society – the needy children and women with chronic illnesses. Almost S$1 million is raised annually to help children with chronic illnesses, including HIV and cancer.\n“I always tell people, “If you want to do charity work, you must make it count. It has to be qualitative, not quantitative,” said the medical director of Drs Jiten & Caroline Medical Centre, which specialises in androgen- and menopause-related issues and preventive medicine, including skin treatments, anti-ageing screenings and hormonal therapy.\nMarried to Dr Heah Sieu Min, a surgeon in private practice, the couple have a son and a daughter.\nAside from her passion for charity work and her medical practice, Low-Heah is also a devotee of French luxury brand Christian Dior. She wore a Dior ensemble to the Tatler Ball, accessorising her outfit with her mother-in-law’s brooch worn in her hair.\n“It’s a jumpsuit with a long, flared skirt which is… very modern. Maria Grazia [Chiuri, the label’s current creative director] did a modern take on a Princess Margaret dress that I think was from the 50s,” she said.\nHer first Dior piece, purchased 22 years ago, was a white blouson from Gianfranco Ferre’s last collection for the storied marque. It sparked off an enduring love affair for the brand’s creations.\n“My affair with Christian Dior started in 97. I’ve always enjoyed good design, good material and I think with Christian Dior, it’s because of the history, the romanticism, the old glamour that it projects. The reason why I continued to stay with the same brand is because the silhouette never changed. The boat neck, the cinched waist has always stayed, and I find that that is perfect for my body shape.”\nHolding up a three-hole dress, she said: “This is my trademark, three-hole dress, one for the neck, two for the arms. I loved it so much I bought it in three different colours because it’s not waisted, and you don’t have to be fat or thin to wear this.”\n“I won’t consider myself a hoarder. But certainly, I do buy and I don’t [discard them]. So over the last 20-odd years, I have been buying only Christian Dior and… voila, I’ve got a huge collection sitting in my wardrobe, not knowing what to do today,” she said.\n“Wearing a Dior dress makes me feel very loved. It makes me feel very appreciated. I don’t think it makes me look beautiful or fashionable or anything, but because of the [legacy], it’s like you’re carrying a bit of history with you and you wear it with pride. That’s the way I look at my clothes.”\nLow-Heah also loves the artistry and nostalgia that fashion can convey. She holds up a Raf Simons-designed Opera Coat as an example. “This is the only piece available in Singapore. The embossing on the jacquard is so beautiful and you wear this with a dress inside. Doesn’t that make you feel like you’re back in Paris in the 50s?\n“Think of your grandmother, perhaps [wear your hair in a] little low bun and make an evening out of this. You notice that, like the Peranakan [kebaya], it has a three-quarter sleeve. The reason? You can wear bracelets. I tend to wear it in Paris a lot because [when] you wear this [with] a beautiful dress inside, and you walk down the street, it feels very uplifting.”\nSome of the pieces also carry sentimental value. Showing off a Lady Dior handbag dating back to 1992, she said: “My mother bought this for me when I first got married, when Lady Dior was the hype to buy. You see the ‘scars’ from my daughter when she was young, pen marks everywhere!”\nLow-Heah also hopes her fashion collection will serve as a legacy for her only daughter Dr Elizabeth Heah, who is now in her 20s, and also a medical doctor.\n“It would be my dream if my daughter would love all [the pieces in] my collection, but you know, it’s a different generation. I’m hoping that as she comes of age, she will understand it has become a nice vintage,” she said.\n“Her style is conservative, but she plays with colour, she plays with fabric. I think the reason she likes [Dior] so much is because, time and time again, they give her the exact look that she wants,” said Heah, who adds that she’s inspired by her mum to give back to society.\n“It’s important to give back to society. It’s an important value that she has instilled in all of us, really. And she does it so effortlessly. I definitely felt very proud. I’m just her number one fan.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     doctor ', '     Philanthropy ', '     Singapore ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Family ']}"

      These sisters escaped their corporate lives to tell stories on silk scarves
  </h1>, 'text': 'As a line by the Persian poet Rumi (1207–1273) goes: “Let the beauty of what you love be what you do”.\nThis is exactly what a pair of Turkish sisters, Pinar Yegin and Deniz Yegin Ikiisik, are doing with Rumi Su, an Istanbul-based accessories brand they set up together in 2011.\nBoth sisters studied and lived in the United States for more than a decade prior. Pinar read economics at Harvard and finance at Wharton, while Deniz studied fashion and design in New York, and designed women’s apparel for several brands.\n“Corporate life did not really suit me or satisfy me completely. I understood that I wanted art to be a bigger part of my life,” said Pinar.\nTheir love for illustration and design prompted them to return to Istanbul and start Rumi Su.\n“Rumi is our favourite mystical poet. His writing and philosophy of life motivates us and directs our lives,” said Pinar. “We were both really into accessorising with scarves. So we said maybe we could try our prints on scarves, to bring those two together.”\nEvery single scarf they create has its own story, characters, inspiration and colour mood, with a big dash of whimsy and humour thrown in – think a gang of dinosaurs fighting to be at the top of the food chain; a traditional Turkish wedding featuring lots of dancing and drum-playing – except that the guests are aliens; safari scenes; even humorous reinterpretations of Noah’s Ark.\nEach scarf has a unique character, such as a zebra or rhino, attached to its bottom right-hand corner, adding an element of fun. These handmade crochet charms are part of a social enterprise project run by the United Nations. “It’s very playful, makes it pop,” said Deniz.\nIt’s also reminiscent of oya, or Turkish lace. Dating back as far as the 8th century BCE, oya is traditional female folk art, used on headdresses, scarves, undergarments and outer garments of Turkish women, and even on household textiles such as the edges of towels, napkins and tablecloths. The different styles include needle-made ones, crocheted ones, and even ones combining beads, sequins and other decorative pieces.\n“Usually, ladies in Turkey wear very muted colours, but the only exception is this oya where they go crazy,” explained Deniz, who collects oya, on the art form being used as a means of self-expression.\nAccording to Wikipedia, “young girls, new brides traditionally convey their love, hopes, expectations and happiness through the oya they wore. Many motifs are inspired by nature, usually flowers and fauna found in the Turkish countryside”.\xa0\nGrowing up in a family of craftsmen, the sisters were always surrounded by art. Their parents ran a textile business.\n“We grew up with yarn and textiles surrounding us. My grandmothers were crocheting, and I kind of learned by watching them. Basically, during our childhood, the one thing that brought us together was sitting down and laying all the crayons out there and just drawing,” said Pinar. “(Our scarves are) a great way to bring our art into someone’s daily life. So they can be wearing our paintings around their neck or on their shoulders.”\nTheir friend, jewellery designer Zeynep Mursaloglu, said: “When they first began, we didn’t have any scarves or accessories like theirs with that much colour, and that many strong illustrations. Modern women in Turkey don’t really use scarves as daily accessories. But after them, I see lots of young, modern women using their scarves as daily accessories everywhere.”\n“They always use positive colours. But when you look deeply into the scarves and illustrations, you start to feel the story. The stories are always about, for example, body positivity, and maybe their own childhood memories or horse-riding. They have really deep stories,” added Zeynep.\n“Anything could inspire us. One season, it was a book that we had read,” said Deniz.\n“We both read this book called Women Who Run With The Wolves by Clarissa Estes. It inspired our entire collection because there are incredible folk tales in that book. And the protagonists of the folk tales are always very strong female archetypes,” said Pinar.\n“Another season, it was a trip we took to Africa,” recalled Deniz.\nMoved by stories they had heard about orphaned elephants in Kenya, the sisters decided to create a scarf with designs of elephants on them. Some of the elephant orphans’ names are also printed on the scarves. Part of the proceeds from their Sheldrick Wildlife Collection go towards helping to support an elephant orphanage in Kenya.\nRumi Su recently launched a line of ready-to-wear clothing featuring their distinctive designs. Their dream is to illustrate a children’s book and to start a homeware collection.\n“We don’t target a specific group of customers. We just want to slowly widen our reach. We are happy to welcome anyone from any kind of background, age group, gender, to enjoy Rumi Su for as long as they like. But above all, whatever we do, our prints and illustrations and colourful approach will be in the centre of everything,” said Deniz.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Turkey ', ""     Women's Life "", '     Artisans ', '     Accessories ']}"

Or really don’t want bra/back fat, a muffin top, a poochy belly or bumpy cellulite marring the lines of your #OOTD.\nIf you’re not up for some body positivity pep talk, the good news is that proper shapewear can deal with any – or all – of those issues.\nAs Commando founder and designer Kerry O’Brien said on her website: “The right underwear can do wonders for how a woman looks in her clothes. When you have the right foundations, you feel that much more confident and beautiful.”\nIndeed, shapewear can temporarily “condense” your fat, and even redistribute it to look more flattering.\nIt can give you a slimmer, more streamlined silhouette, while helping your clothes sit better for a more flattering fit. It also protects you from wardrobe malfunctions and improves your posture, translating to a more confident you.\nWhat’s more, shapewear can also provide health benefits, such as stimulating circulation, and providing support to muscles.\nBut where do you start your hunt for the right shapewear? Consider the following tips:\nBUY THE RIGHT SIZE AND CUT\n\n\nA post shared by commando (@wearcommando) on Oct 3, 2019 at 11:58am PDT\nObviously, buying shapewear that’s too large totally defeats its purpose. But don’t go to the other extreme and buy shapewear that’s too small – its seams might roll or cut into your flesh, resulting in unsightly lumps and bulges.\nEven worse, excessive constriction can make you feel uncomfortable and cause breathing difficulties, or even cause numbness, tingling, acid reflux or blood clots. Plus, if your shapewear is difficult to remove, you might put off going to the bathroom – which can increase your risk of getting a urinary tract infection.\n\n\nDON’T SHOP ONLINE – GO TO A STORE\nThis is not the time to be lazy – you want to actually try on the item. Bring along the clothes you plan to wear over it and, while in the fitting room, try sitting, squatting, bending over and walking around in it to check out its staying and holding power as well as comfort level. If you really must shop online, check for free returns, and order two different sizes so you can see which fits better. Then return the one that doesn’t fit as well.\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT MATERIAL\n\n\nA post shared by commando (@wearcommando) on Sep 7, 2019 at 1:21pm PDT\nMany shapewear items are constructed with panels or zones made of thicker fabric or tighter weaves to hold in or lift your trouble spots. The higher the nylon content, and the thicker the material, the more the garment will alter your shape.\nLighter pieces made of thinner fabric, or even cotton/spandex, offer subtle overall smoothing; medium construction garments offer smoothing and support; strong construction items can create total body transformation temporarily.\nSome shapewear comes with thermal properties while others made for warmer climes may feature fabric with cooling or odour control properties – a good option in our hot, humid weather, especially if you’re prone to yeast infections.\nUNDERSTAND YOUR SHAPEWEAR OPTIONS\nIt all depends on what your trouble zones are, and what clothes you plan to wear. Here are nine types to consider, and what they’re good for.\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by commando (@wearcommando) on Jul 15, 2019 at 4:17pm PDT\nGood for: Smoothing out back and bra fat, giving the appearance of a flatter stomach and smaller waist. Bonus points if it comes with built-in bra cups.\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by SPANX by @SaraBlakely (@spanx) on Oct 29, 2019 at 11:47am PDT\nGood for: Eliminating panty lines, slimming down tops of thighs, hips, rear, and stomach. A high-waisted style that stops right under your boobs, with a panel that covers the stomach, helps to slim down the torso and tummy; look for a rear-enhancing style that lifts the butt, instead of flattening them. Wear with skinny jeans or bodycon dresses to look skinnier overall.\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by SPANX by @SaraBlakely (@spanx) on Oct 14, 2019 at 6:02am PDT\nGood for: Slimming and shaping the waist, hips, thighs, and even the entire leg, and perking up your derriere, while eliminating VPL (visible panty line). A standard bicycle-shorts style is a good all-rounder – just make sure the thigh band fits properly instead of cutting into your mid-thigh, otherwise you end up with VTL (visible thigh line). A high-waist one slims the entire torso and is good for wearing under dresses; a knee- or calf-length one is good with long gowns.\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by commando (@wearcommando) on Aug 30, 2019 at 3:23pm PDT\nGood for: Shaping the entire torso but not the hips. Wear under dresses that are looser on the lower body, or with jeans or trousers. If your behind doesn’t need reining in, you can even opt for a thong style to prevent VPL.\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by SKIMS (@skims) on Nov 21, 2019 at 12:06pm PST\nGood for: Creating the illusion of a more streamlined body, while allowing you to wear whichever bra you want. The open U-shaped bust helps push together and lift up your girls,\xa0creating a sexier cleavage. A bicycle shorts- or knee-length-style is the most versatile as swimsuit-style ones can create VPL issues, while full-length ones can only be worn under long dresses.\n\n\nGood for: Super-low cut and/or backless dresses and tops – perfect for cocktail and party looks.\n\n\nA post shared by SKIMS (@skims) on Dec 3, 2019 at 12:03pm PST\nGood for: Eliminating bulges and panty lines under thin or sheer dresses. You can even choose from various neckline and strap options. A half-slip that starts at the waist is good for wearing under skirts.\n\n\n\n\n @KimKardashian’s tried and tested solution to sculpting your midsection is back in stock TOMORROW, DECEMBER 11 at 9AM PST / 12PM EST.

What’s more, you can even wear it over a shirt or a dress as a thick “belt”. We say, skip the pull-on “tube” version as it is pesky business getting it on and off.\xa0\n\n\nGood for: If you’ve been neglecting your bicep curls, triceps dips and chaturangas.

      Lessons in ethical fashion – from Vietnam’s diverse ethnic traditions
  </h1>, 'text': 'Thao Vu’s fashion collections are made from nuts, wood, cotton, hemp, fruit – 100 per cent natural, ethical and eco-conscious. For her, creation goes beyond design. “Luxury here means that it’s not harmful to the environment. Most of the raw materials, we grow ourselves. We do the weaving, dyeing and designing in-house, so it’s a complete cycle,” she explained.\nAfter graduating from design school, she explored her homeland, meeting Vietnam’s ethnic villagers, and discovering the century-old techniques of using indigo and magenta plants to produce rich dyes for fabrics.\nAbout seven-and-a-half years ago, Thao Vu started working closely with women from Cao Bang, a remote village in the mountains north of Hanoi. This village has since become her creative base where she grows and produces natural dyes and fabrics for Kilomet109, her eco-conscious clothing line.\n\n\nThao Vu, 41, credits her diplomat father for stirring her interest in art and travel. “Listening to my father’s travel stories ignited my passion to learn more about other cultures as well as my own. He believed in artisanal craftsmanship and encouraged me to embrace new ways of understanding fashion and appreciating beauty,” she said.\nSince she started her eco-fashion label, she has collaborated with 45 artisans from five North Vietnamese ethnic minority groups, learning not just indigo- and ebony-dyeing, but also calendering and batik printing. Now she is moving on to silk-making families in Central and South Vietnam.\nThe experience has been fascinating for her. “You learn a lot more than about making textiles. You learn about the place, the people, their culture. Each community has not just one technique or one textile, they have multiple techniques. And learning that has been such a gift to someone like me who appreciates textile culture,” she enthused.\nFor the many kilometres travelled visiting remote villages, she named her company Kilomet109, which is also the distance between her hometown and Hanoi, where her flagship store is.\nAcknowledging that producing eco-friendly clothing using natural materials or working with traditional weavers is not unique, Thao Vu said, “I’m not the first one in Vietnam or in the world to try to work with communities or to use the old methods to create something new. But I am the first one to change what exists in Vietnam.”\nIt has taken years to build relationships and trust. Just to convince local craftswomen to move away from traditional black and indigo hues took several years. “Trust here is not about the money. It’s about sharing your vision of using textiles for real products.”\nThe hard work has paid off. Thao Vu has managed to use ancient techniques to create contemporary fashion that’s urban, well-made and trendy. “With every new collection, I try to apply one or two new techniques and introduce one or two new communities,” she shared.\nMost importantly, Thao Vu believes in the storytelling of how each quilted jacket is a genesis of the creative journey she has with Vietnamese artisans. “I want people who put on my clothes to not only know about the garment, but also understand the story behind the garment as well.”\nTo showcase Vietnam’s ethnic textile craft to the world, Thao Vu went public with her brand at Elle’s Fashion Journey in 2017, followed by an exhibition at the London Design Biennale 2018. She was also selected as Young Creative Entrepreneur for Fashion & Design Award by the British Council. “I always prefer to present the work in the context of an exhibition; to be able to tell the story behind the products. People who are not in Vietnam will be able to look at this country in that perspective. And that is a privilege for me,” she said.\nHer line is now carried in eco-centric boutiques in Germany and Portugal, and also sold online by ‘slow fashion’ stores in Bangkok and Los Angeles. “The part that I enjoy from my work is the collaboration, not just with communities and artisans, but also with other artists and creative communities outside of Vietnam. I love to tell people about my culture in a very modern context.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      ‘Real clothes for real women’: How Max Mara is redefining power dressing
  </h1>, 'text': ""Ian Griffiths is no stranger to Berlin. The Creative Director of Max Mara has visited the German capital to take in its artistic and cultural legacies many times before, but on his last trip there he had an epiphany.\n“I realised that 2019 marked the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, so I thought it was a great opportunity for Max Mara to show a collection there to celebrate the city,” he recalled.\nWhat transpired was a showing that not only feted Berlin's indomitable spirit and a turning point in modern history, but also reiterated the unique spot Max Mara occupies in the world of fashion. Held inside the Neues Museum, a landmark once ravaged by war but now restored to its former glory, the collection saw Griffiths pull together references from vastly different worlds to weave them into a compelling Resort collection.\nGriffiths tipped his hat to Marlene Dietrich and David Bowie. One a legendary German singer-actress who stood at the forefront of reinvention, the other a radical pop culture icon who spent his most creative years in Berlin, both were juggernauts whose inimitable, gender-fluid styles have constantly sparked fashion's collective imagination.\nIn the hands of Griffiths, their unapologetic and non-conformist attitudes manifested in the form of bold-shouldered pantsuits and belted coats. The collection's hint of rawness came courtesy of sculptural metallic bracelets, necklaces and earrings designed in collaboration with Reema Pachachi – those were inspired by the Bronze Age artefacts on display inside the hallowed halls of the museum. Griffiths rounded things up with delicate floral embellishments inspired by renowned German porcelain maker Meissen.\nThis interplay between the structured and fluid, strength and fragility, heritage and modernity is integral to the narrative at Max Mara, an Italian marque that has stood behind powerful women since its establishment in 1951.\nLike Maramotti, the iconography of a contemporary working woman is one that Griffiths has explored throughout his three-decades-and-counting tenure at Max Mara. But with the conversation surrounding women's rights continuing to evolve, the designer has skilfully tweaked and updated Max Mara's lexicon to reflect the changing times.\n“The height of that power dressing phase in 1987 was a very successful formula, but it was a uniform. You couldn't really depart from the strictness of the dress code. But now, because of a variety of factors such as social media, women expect – and why shouldn't they? – the opportunity to express themselves a bit more within that code. Anonymous clothes are no longer acceptable.”\nTo that end, Griffiths has, for the past few seasons, infused Max Mara with an undercurrent of rebellion. He has contrasted the primal energy of leopard spots with the studied appeal of checks; dipped Max Mara's iconic camel coat in an assortment of electric hues such as cerulean and yellow; tweaked suiting codes by replacing pants with shorts.\nGriffiths also enlisted supermodels such as Joan Smalls, Karen Elson and Lara Stone to walk the Max Mara runways as displays of feminine strength. Most notable of all his decision to cast the hijab-wearing, Somali-American model Halima Aden for the fall/winter 2017 season. It was one of those game-changing catwalk moments that brought diversity and inclusivity to the fore.\nDespite Griffiths' retooling of Max Mara's facade, he has never once strayed from the philosophy of making clothes that are rooted in classicism and functionality. It's especially important during an era where fashion has become increasingly frenetic, in part due to the increased speed of communication that comes with advancements in technology.\n“A lot of people are confused or disillusioned with the idea of fashion because it's gotten to the point where ideas would've been consumed way before any kind of products actually hit the stores,” he offered.\nTo Griffiths, however, this state of flux represents an opportunity for Max Mara: “That's why people turn to Max Mara. They see clothes with a real lasting quality, cultural value, and meaning. Why buy 15 T-shirts that don't really mean anything at all when you can have a coat to wear for the rest of your life?”\n“Why buy 15 T-shirts that don't really mean anything at all when you can have a coat to wear for the rest of your life?” – Ian Griffiths\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     women ', '     Singapore ', '     Profiles ', '     Community ']}"

      A very rare visit to the Hermes workshop turning scrap into whimsical treasure
  </h1>, 'text': 'Started in 2010 by Pascale Mussard, the great, great, great granddaughter of Hermes founder Thierry Hermes, petit h is a creative atelier in Paris, France, where a small team of designers and master craftsmen repurpose scraps from the French luxury house’s workshops.\nBack then, Godefroy de Virieu joined Petit h as a designer. “When I was in school, I wasn’t paying attention. I got bored very easily. That gave me time to think about creating things, which was where my inspiration arose,” he recalled. “To create objects – I did not know I could do it as a job; I was studying economics and should have worked in the finance sector, but I hated that.”\n“She [Pascale] saw that Hermes is a green brand, but all these materials were being thrown away and not used anymore. She decided to take all these materials and bring it to this workshop and ask the craftsmen and artisans to create dialogue around these materials, to create some new things,” he explained.\n\n\nNew things, such as bag charms, Christmas ornaments (made from Hermes silks), cuckoo clocks, mobiles, life-sized horse sculptures in leather, advent calendars, miniature, ornamental sailing boats in silk, crocodile, and wood, and even a one-of-a-kind Origami Monkey Shape Sculpture with Shelves (which, despite being made of scrap leather, carries a price tag of US$167,300; S$227,770).\n“We don’t actually know where we will go when we start working. We follow the material, we follow the idea, we follow the dialogue,” said de Virieu, who took over as Creative Director of petit h in 2018.\nThe team continues to focus on sustainability while designing ever more innovative products.\nDe Virieu said he was very impressed by the quality of the leather that petit h works with. “Looking closely, you can find wrinkles on some of it. And these parts were not used, they were thrown away because they couldn’t make a purse or a bag with this leather. So I wanted to make paper weights, that can be used on your desk and to create a family of mushrooms that would weigh down the folders,” said de Virieu of the fungi-inspired paperweights he designed 10 years ago, and which are still in production.\nThe production process is one of collaboration between designer and craftsman, and is a constant to-and-fro.\n“We have many discussions about what precisely he [de Virieu] wants until finally, we have something that he is happy with and then I’m able to develop a technical approach to make it work,” explained craftsman Julien Desclouds, who has worked at petit h for the past decade.\n“As a craftsperson, I really like the texture of the material when you’re working with it, you really get to feel the materials and there’s something a bit childlike about it; it’s fun. The most exciting part is actually taking material from a flat object and then ending up with this final product.”\n\n\nPetit h products can be found in the Hermes store on Rue de Sevres in Paris, and are sold seasonally within Hermes stores in Europe, Australia and Singapore.\n“They are useful objects; you can use them every day, and you can bring them with you. So it was a very new and very simple idea, but this was an ingenious idea,” said de Virieu.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Transformers: Interchangeable jewellery that's more than meets the eye
  </h1>, 'text': ""The birth of transformable jewellery can be traced back to the 19th century, when royals and aristocrats tasked master jewellers to come up with innovative pieces that could be assembled and worn in a myriad of ways. Soon after, luxury behemoths such as Cartier, Graff and Van Cleef & Arpels began crafting their own exquisite interpretations to reflect the multifaceted lifestyles of women.\nWhen it comes to pushing the boundaries of transformable jewellery design, Van Cleef & Arpels is a heavyweight in the field, dedicating much of its savoir-faire to engineering these breathtaking creations – each one more intricate and complex than the last.\nIn 1938, for example, Van Cleef & Arpels released the Passe-Partout, a masterpiece comprising two flower clips and a yellow gold chain that can be worn in five ways. Twelve years later, the French Maison struck gold when it introduced the Zip necklace, a gem of a design that saw an ordinary object transformed into a stunning work of art.\nOnce found only in Van Cleef & Arpels' haute jewellery lines, the concept of transformability has informed the inception of several new items from its signature Perlee range. This sense of versatility is most notable in a long necklace attached with a pendant made of three concentric rings in varying sizes.\nNondescript at first glance, the magic happens when the middle ring is replaced with another circle strung together from turquoise, coral or onyx beads, thereby changing the outlook of the necklace completely. It's a necklace for every occasion – the sleekness of onyx lends sophistication to a Little Black Dress, while the fiery rouge of coral pairs well with an effortless t-shirt-and-jeans combo.\nAnd for the first time ever, Van Cleef & Arpels has also introduced a bracelet watch to the Perlee family. It's a design sure to please the modern woman who values functionality in her accessories. Two elegant discs sit on opposite ends of an open bangle, with one swivelling to reveal a discreet mother-of-pearl watch face accentuated with diamonds.\nThe addition of diamonds not only injects sparkle to the bracelet watch, it also brings to mind a festive tribute the House has dubbed Diamond Freeze. Aptly titled, it is an homage to the daring and ingenuous ways Van Cleef & Arpels' artisans have emphasised the brilliance of diamonds by skilfully contrasting the precious gemstone with the unlikeliest materials, then transforming this wondrous explosion of shapes and forms into the most unforgettable jewellery and watch creations.\nIn partnership with Van Cleef & Arpels.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     women ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Working mum Victoria Tang-Owen of Shanghai Tang on being stylish yet practical
  </h1>, 'text': ""When lifestyle brand Shanghai Tang launched in 1994, it wowed fans with its unique take on Chinoiserie, riffing off 5,000 years of Chinese history, sprinkling everything with a tongue-in-cheek, pop-tastic irreverence, and a generous serving of luxe – all the while channelling the bravado of the Shanghainese underworld in the 1920s.\nThink Mao jackets featuring dragon-print silk jacquards in so-bright-it-hurts neon shades. Severe yet sexy cheongsams in navy pin-striped menswear suiting fabric, featuring crimson piping that was oh-so-subtle, yet shockingly feminine – perfect for modern Dragon Ladies ruling boardrooms with steel fists encased in velvet gloves.\nFine porcelain objets d’art that remind one that the Chinese invented and perfected chinaware a thousand years ago, featuring imagery that was unmistakably Oriental, yet nothing like what your grandparents might have owned.\nMost of all, the brand was a personification of its larger-than-life founder, Sir David Tang. The hi-so, bon-vivant Hong Konger attended boarding school and university in the UK, then went into oil exploration and gold mining, before venturing into the lifestyle business, creating tony member’s-only China Club, cigar retailer Pacific Cigars, upscale China Tang restaurants, and contemporary heritage lifestyle store Tang Tang Tang Tang, which “embraced the new bourgeoisie of modern China” with wares such as innovative rice cookers, Bluetooth speakers and monogram accessories.\nTang was also director and adviser to Blackstone, Tommy Hilfiger, the Savoy Group of Hotels and British Airways, helmed a satirical Agony Uncle column in the UK’s Financial Times, and authored a 2016 book entitled Rules of Modern Life: A Connoisseur’s Survival Guide, offering tongue-in-cheek advice on first world problems, such as what polite society would think if you installed a massage room in your second home.\nTang passed away in 2017 at the age of 63.\nShanghai Tang was sold to Swiss luxury conglomerate Richemont Group in 1998, which in turn sold it to a group of investors headed by Italian entrepreneur Alessandro Bastagli in 2017.\nIt seems things have come full circle. In 2018, the company was acquired by Shanghai-based private equity firm Lunar Capital, and the late Sir David’s daughter, Victoria Tang-Owen, was appointed its creative director.\nDescribed by the South China Morning Post as “a regular on the international art and fashion circuit” (her 2015 Beijing wedding was featured on Vogue), she studied photography and graphic design in London, and is co-founder of creative consultancy Thirty30 Creative, which does brand identity and design projects for the F&B industry, hospitality groups and retail customers. Its clients include department store Lane Crawford, fashion boutique Joyce and French handbag label Moynat. Her husband, British former lawyer Chris Owen, is Thirty30’s other co-founder.\n“I was lucky to have an international upbringing” she told CNA Luxury via email.\xa0“I was born in London but came back to Hong\xa0Kong as a young child and studied there until high school.\xa0I then had an opportunity to move to Tokyo, which was a totally different way of life from Hong Kong.\n“After graduating high school, I chose to return to London and do a degree in graphic design and photography at Central Saint Martins, which was an amazing institution for shaping creativity. I feel I have been blessed with a wide range of experiences and opportunities which enable me to express myself with an appreciation for the wider world we live in.”\nAnd what was it like growing with such a famously flamboyant father?\n“I think of myself as a product of both of my parents,” she replied. “My father was a larger than life personality, deeply generous and cultured and very proud of his heritage. I also learnt a lot from my mother who is patient, elegant and extremely stylish. Both my parents encouraged me to follow my passion, work hard and treat people the right way.”\xa0\nAs creative director of Shanghai Tang, she’s responsible for “everything from design to marketing to brand image … a broad portfolio that ensures there's never a dull day”.\n“I set the overall direction of our product design (both hard and soft goods), direct our campaigns and brand imagery – some of which I shoot myself – and lead our marketing team to ensure our audience hears about and sees our collaborations,” she explained, recalling that growing up, her family home was decorated with Shanghai Tang homewares. The Tangs often wore Shanghai Tang clothes, and, as kids, she and her brother (Edward, from Tang’s first marriage to Susanna Cheung) had “a lot of fun exploring the iconic Pedder Street flagship store”.\n“My father lived the brand and it was a reflection of his pride in his Chinese culture, with a big dose of his sense of humour. But it's been more than 15 years since he had any involvement in the brand. It's like the brand is in my blood, but I never had any involvement with it until last year when I was offered the chance to take over as creative director, with a vision to inject a fresh perspective on what made the brand so well loved with such a loyal following over the years,” said Tang-Owen.\nOne might go as far as to say the brand is indeed firmly embedded in her DNA, seeing how elegantly she outlines what it stands for: “We have five brand pillars we lean on to ensure we are telling our own story through our brand image and our products.\xa0They are: Authentic; Heritage; Disruptive; Irreverent and Lifestyle.\n“The essence of our brand is to be proudly created by Chinese. We are blessed with such diversity within Chinese culture, geography, design inspiration and craftsmanship that we can draw on to express our vision as a modern Chinese lifestyle brand.\xa0\n“By valuing disruption and irreverence, we can mix in some unexpected twists on classics, such as our newly-released Tang jackets in modern, technical fabrics, or pops of colour on traditional formalwear.\xa0We target customers with a sense of individual style, and the confidence to dress up or dress down according to their own routines.”\nTo mark the brand’s 25th anniversary, Tang-Owen spearheaded a special collaboration with renowned Chinese artist Xu Bing, commissioning him to reimagine the Shanghai Tang logo using his unique “Square Word” calligraphy style which, coincidentally was developed the same year Shanghai Tang was born.\xa0\nA limited edition Silver Jubilee capsule collection of silver-toned accessories and leather goods was also created, and Shanghai Tang’s bespoke and made-to-order services was re-introduced, “to tap back into the brand’s history as a tailor, while showcasing traditional Chinese garments in modernised fabrics and silhouettes”.\n“Right now it feels like my foot is firmly on the accelerator, always moving forward,” Tang-Owen explaind.\nShe travels two to three times per month to visit Shanghai Tang’s six regional stores, to understand more about what customers are buying, and how to serve them better. Her work for her lifestyle clients at Thirty30 Creative provides her insights into trends in other fields, which she uses to inform her design direction at Shanghai Tang, because “we don't want Shanghai Tang to live in a fashion vacuum, it's a brand that should serve the lifestyle needs and aspirations of our customers”.\n“Down time is family time for me,” she added. “My young son is a source of smiles and gives me the energy to tackle a full ‘In’ tray”.\nAnd what about living up to the name her family has built for being stylish regulars on the international art and fashion circuit?\n“I'm a working mum so although I try to be stylish, there's a big nod to practicality and comfort too!” she exclaimed. “I travel a lot so lightweight, breathable fabrics are a must and we've recently launched a range of travel accessories with super convenient pockets and pouches for frequent travellers.”\nBut she added: “Over the years, I have built up a wardrobe with some pieces by favourites such as Chanel, Lanvin, Huishan Zhang etc. And I'm a big fan of a mix-and-match approach, where I pair a vintage Chanel blazer with jeans and combat boots.”\nWe think the late Sir David Tang would have been proud to hear that.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     business ', '     fashion ', '     Parenting ', ""     Women's Style "", '     Profiles ']}"

I think men are interested in things that are worn every day, not just on special occasions. There are many pieces that can be worn so often, they really become part of your personality.

Only five cities worldwide where DSM is present are privy to the launch: Los Angeles, New York, London, Tokyo and Singapore. And the pieces will only be available for a limited period – in Singapore, from Nov\xa029 to Jan\xa08, 2020.\nWhy DSM?

      How to dress for unseasonably 'cool weather' in Singapore without looking silly
  </h1>, 'text': 'Once in a while, sweaty, suffering Singaporeans get a break from the sweltering heat of the tropical paradise we\xa0call home. And we don’t just mean being holed up in a frigid cinema.\xa0We mean actually having some cool weather outside.\n\n\nSure, it’s not quite winter but we’ll take what we can get. Also, it\'s a chance to dig out the stuff at the back of our wardrobe that\'s usually reserved for our escapes from the equator.\nHere\'s what to wear when the weather gets a little ""chilly"" (but definitely wet) in Singapore. Just remember to skip the scarves and Heattech, please. It’s not that cold. No matter how bad we\'d like to pretend it is.\nWarning: Nothing in the story below applies to people who are always too warm. Sorry, sweaty bettys!\nSWAP OUT THE USUAL COTTON TEE\nNormally your cotton tee will do just fine in our 30-plus degree heat. But why not take advantage of the temperature drop – even if it’s just a few degrees – and unpack that\xa0short-sleeved Merino wool top once the sun goes down.\nAnd if you\'re wondering how to still make your feather-light\xa0day dresses work when it’s a bit chilly, simply slip a fitted, long-sleeved top under it – it also puts a brand new spin to the look.\n\n\nYES, FEEL FREE TO LAYER UP – BUT WITHIN REASON\nWe totally understand if, for a split-second, you are tempted to pile on a turtleneck and a wool jacket. After all, how often do we stop sweating on humid home ground? But remember – it actually only gets cooler later in the day.\nAs a compromise, it’s wiser (and less silly) to opt for layers you can easily take off, like a jacket or cardigan. Steaming like a har gao in a woolen turtleneck is never a good look no matter the weather.\n\n\nBREAK OUT THE WINDBREAKERS\nThe catch with all this nice, cool breeze and cloudy days is that it comes in a package – hello, showers and thunderstorms.\nIt’s time to break out that Goretex and just leave your umbrella tucked away. But while black windbreakers have mileage because they are\xa0more likely to go with everything in the wardrobe, where’s the fun in playing safe? Try a brightly coloured number or prints instead.\xa0\xa0\nSLIPPERS OFF, PLEASE\nStaying dry also means waterproof or water-resistant\xa0footwear. That means no slippers, Singapore. Slip on water-resistant Melissas or stay afloat in flatforms, we say.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Focus on your domestic market, not foreign buyers: The Hour Glass’s Michael Tay
  </h1>, 'text': 'In a young nation like Singapore, homegrown companies that have been around for decades are a bit of a rarity. That’s perhaps why The Hour Glass, which was founded in 1979, is pulling out all the stops to mark its 40th anniversary.\nIts flagship store off Orchard Road, Malmaison by The Hour Glass, has been redesigned by JoAnn Tan Studio, a Milan-based firm specialising in window display, installations, scenography and set design. The new – albeit temporary – refresh is an ode to Stanley Kubrick’s iconic retro-futuristic movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nThe refresh sets the stage for Then Now Beyond, an exhibition featuring special commissioned works by four renowned designers and contemporary artists addressing the beauty and essence of time. It will run from November 24, 2019 until January 31, 2020.\n\n\n“The idea to have this themed exhibition came about two years ago,” Michael Tay, The Hour Glass’s Group Managing Director since 2015, told CNA Luxury. He first joined the company in 1999 as its Business Re-Engineering Manager, and has been its Executive Director since 2005; his parents Dr Henry Tay and Jannie Chan founded the company in 1979.\n“We decided to leverage on our reputation as specialist watch retailers, to dig deep, to expand the cultural milieu of watchmaking arts, to locate contemporary watchmaking right alongside contemporary art and design,” he elaborated.\nHorology and art are twin passions of Tay’s, so it was a natural decision to commission works that fuse the two disciplines. Studio Wieki Somers’ artwork Beetle Clock, for example, sees two beetles chase time around the age rings of a tree trunk. It explores the increasing destruction of insect habitats through urbanisation.\nA cuboid shaped clock by Nendo sees the clock’s hands neatly overlap only twice a day (at 12 o’clock), uniting the shape in its original appearance and signifying the resetting of the mind.\nA bronze structure by Daniel Arsham (who frequently collaborates with brands such as Rimowa and Dior) examines the constructions of time and immortalises the form of the ancient time-telling device, the hour glass.\nMarc Newson’s Klepsydra reinterprets the ancient hour glass, with 2.8 million metallic-dusted nanoballs trickling between two interconnected crystal structures to provide accurate recordings of time.\n“We commissioned Newson to produce a limited-edition series of hour glasses to mark our 30th anniversary in 2009, so it seemed fitting to invite him back to do a limited edition collection of 10 Klepsydras for our 40th anniversary, especially since he also designed other timepiece-related works before, for example, Jaeger LeCoultre’s Atmos clocks,” said Tay.\nSpecially-commissioned commemorative watches from brands such as Audemars Piguet, Chopard, TAG Heuer and Ulysse Nardin will also be on sale.\n“We decided to leverage on our reputation as specialist watch retailers, to dig deep, to expand the cultural milieu of watchmaking arts, to locate contemporary watchmaking right alongside contemporary art and design.” – Michael Tay\n\n\nNO REST FOR THE WICKED\nDespite The Hour Glass’s apparent success, which includes representation of forty luxury brands such as Cartier, Hublot, Patek Philippe, Piaget and Rolex; and dozens of stores across the Asia-Pacific – Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia – Tay still feels it’s not time to rest on his laurels.\n“You know that quote by Jack Kerouac? ‘When you get to the top of the mountain, keep climbing’? To me, there’s never an end in sight; there’s no way one can stop improving,” said the self-confessed workaholic, who names his biggest learning experience as the Asian financial crisis in 1997.\n“Back then, we had a handful of regular foreign clients who made very big purchases; half our business was driven by them. When those clients faced difficulties, they stopped buying, which definitely impacted us,” he recalled.\n“I learned it’s important to build and scale a business with a keen focus on the domestic clientele in each market we’re in, and to diversify our client base. We also needed to overhaul our retail setting and customer service – complacency had set in.\n“And, even though our borrowings were nominal at that point, we still felt pretty intense pressure from the banks. We also owned brands such as Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth, which we’ve since divested. It was almost the perfect storm for disaster. But I believe we should always be forging ahead to continue creating our destinies. Mistakes will of course be made, but the point is just never to repeat them!”\n“You know that quote by Jack Kerouac? ‘When you get to the top of the mountain, keep climbing’? To me, there’s never an end in sight; there’s no way one can stop improving.” – Michael Tay\nWhen the global financial crisis hit in 2008, Tay and his firm were more than ready.\n“One of my staff commented that there seemed to be a lot of froth on the market, given the way people seemed to be spending so recklessly. That’s the point I knew the bubble was going to burst – I didn’t know when, but we reduced debt and started to prepare for the downturn.\n“When the economy went belly up, it caught everyone off guard except us. Between 2009 to 2012, we managed to negotiate excellent leases and went on an expansion spree. This help put us in a great position for when the economy picked up again,” he recalled.\nAs for the firm’s overarching strategy, Tay offered: “Our singular aim is to advance watch culture, to pursue qualitative growth. We don’t need to be the biggest, to make the most sales, to have the largest number of stores. What we aim for, is to be the favoured and trusted place where customers know they’re getting good service from knowledgeable watch experts, and feel welcome and at home when they visit us.\n“In terms of online engagement, we’re not focusing on e-commerce, but on providing quality content, with lots of storytelling, to engage and educate consumers, to push CRM, to get a better sense of our clients. What we do know is, for big-ticket items such as luxury timepieces, people still prefer to buy offline, even if they do a lot of prior research online.”\n“We don’t need to be the biggest, to make the most sales, to have the largest number of stores. What we aim for, is to be the favoured and trusted place where customers know they’re getting good service from knowledgeable watch experts, and feel welcome and at home when they visit us.” – Michael Tay\nTHE WATCH INDUSTRY TODAY\nIn spite of ongoing US-China trade tensions and the crisis playing out in Hong Kong, Tay remains bullish about the current state of the watch industry.\n“We’re operating in a part of the world that’s experiencing very strong growth rates, seeing very keen interest from a large and growing pool of young watch enthusiasts. If you look at the Swiss luxury watch industry, 65 to 75 per cent of its products end up on Asian wrists.\n“The Hour Glass is poised to benefit from this trend… we’re in a region where there’s tremendous wealth creation, coupled with huge income disparities. That creates a tremendous need for status competition, and that’s where sales of objects of prestige really take off,” he noted, adding that “watch enthusiasts are still mainly men”.\nHe observed that the idea of a “starter watch” has evolved. “Fifteen or 20 years ago, a recent graduate might treat himself to his first nice watch with his first paycheque, and upgrade over the years in tandem with his annual bonus or a big promotion. These days, the bar seems to be set higher. People seem to be buying fewer watches, but buying better. And they seem to have it all planned out.\n“Now, a recent graduate might spend up to four months’ salary –\xa0 not on a ‘starter watch’, but on a watch that’ll be part of the collection he plans to amass over a lifetime. There’s an ‘always-on’, ‘instant gratification’ approach, with people buying watches when the whim hits them or when an eagerly-awaited model becomes available.”\nAnd what of having grown up in a family that’s been involved in the watch business for this long? “Working [in the business], having a passion for [watches] and building my own collection of watches, I really have to say that timepieces form the core of my being.\n“I consider myself very, very fortunate that I’m in the business of watches, and I have a personal passion for them. Not many people get to love the products they deal with. For example, a guy who runs a waste manufacturing plant may love his business and his work, but I doubt he gets to say he loves his products,” he concluded.\n“I consider myself very, very fortunate that I’m in the business of watches, and I have a personal passion for them. Not many people get to love the products they deal with.” – Michael Tay\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     business ', '     Singapore ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Profiles ', '     Opinions ']}"

      How to take care of your favourite sneakers so these last longer and don’t stink
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sneakers are big business. They serve many purposes, aside from the whole being shoes part: Some sneakers we wear for comfort, some we wear for health, some we wear as high fashion. And while many of our sneakers can look a little better a bit banged up (Chuck Taylors, hello!), there are times when – for the sake of appearances or smells – your sneakers need a cleaning.\xa0\nMOST SNEAKERS CAN BE MACHINE-WASHED\nCleaning athletic shoes in the washing machine will be, by and large, the way to go for most pairs. This will be the best choice for sneakers made from synthetics or canvas — like Vans and Keds — though don’t machine-wash sneakers made from hides, like leather and suede. It’s a fairly straightforward endeavour, but there are some nuances to the process that will ensure your kicks come out as clean and, more important, undamaged as possible.\nKeep these five tips in mind before tossing your shoes in the washing machine:\n- Remove the laces before washing. Dirt collects around the eyelets, so removing the laces will give water and detergent access to what can be a surprisingly grimy part of the shoe.\n- Wash those laces while you’re at it. Put the laces in a small mesh washing bag and launder them along with the sneakers.\n- Pretreat badly soiled sneakers. Dirt and mud are protein stains, so they’re best treated using an enzymatic stain remover.\n- Use cold water, and don’t overdo it with the detergent. It can be tempting to use extra detergent – the shoes are extra dirty, after all – but resist that urge, as detergent residue will create a dingy appearance.\n- Air-dry your sneakers. Flip the tongue over the toe box so air can better circulate through the interior of the shoe as it dries, then stuff the toe box with a balled-up towel (a washcloth or dishrag will be the right size) to help absorb moisture.\nSPOT TREATING AND DETAILING\nThere will be times, however, when machine-washing isn’t the best choice, and that’s where spot treating and detailing come into play.\nAll kinds of specialty cleaners exist for detailing sneakers, but, truth be told, you don’t need them at all: Good old dish soap and an all-purpose cleaner will do the job. (Just make sure to use an all-purpose cleaner that doesn’t contain bleach to avoid color loss.)\nThe best tool for cleaning leather uppers, midsoles and outsoles is an old, soft-bristled toothbrush. Pour some diluted dish soap or diluted all-purpose cleaner in a small bowl, leaving enough headroom to accommodate a toothbrush or small rag (here, again, a washcloth is a great choice). Remove the laces from the shoe, stick your non-dominant fist in the toe box and chh-chh-chh away to remove stains and soiling.\nA Magic Eraser, too, can work, ahem, magic on dirty, scuffed sneakers. To use it, wet a small section and rub it on the midsole to take out stubborn marks that the toothbrush or rag left behind.\nToothbrushes and Magic Erasers, however, should not be used to clean suede or knit uppers, which brings us to those more, shall we say, temperamental materials. Suede, as you likely know, does not love liquid, and while there are liquid suede cleaners, it’s generally best to approach suede cleaning as a dry proposition. A suede brush can be used to wick away dirt and grime that can create a dingy appearance, and to restore the suede’s nap, which will become matted with wear. The suede eraser – which, unlike the Magic kind, is used dry – is designed to gently eliminate stains from suede without damaging what tends to be a fussy material.\nKnit sneakers, too, require some special handling because the strands can easily get pulled. Always use a gentle touch when cleaning knit sneakers, and never use a toothbrush on them, as the bristles can cause snags.\nODOUR MANAGEMENT\nLet’s level with one another: Foot odour happens. There are ways to prevent it, or at least abate it, and ways to handle it when it becomes overpowering. Let’s start with what to do when foot odor becomes overpowering.\nThe first thing to try, provided the sneakers in question can handle it, is to machine-wash the shoes, possibly adding an odour eliminator like white vinegar. You can also try a sports detergent (these are formulated to be especially good on very smelly things, because sports). Removing the insoles and washing those can also help to freshen up a pair of sneakers that have turned rank.\nWhen odours are developing, using an odor-eliminating spray like Kiwi Fresh Force or Dr Scholl’s Odor X is a simple way to fix the problem in seconds. (Powders like baby powder or baking soda also work, but they can be messy to apply, so skip them in favour of better options.)\nTo prevent odours before they happen, practice good foot hygiene, rotate your sneakers by leaving at least a day in between wearings, and consider using a set of sneaker balls to help eliminate smells while the shoes aren’t on your feet.\nPROTECT YOUR SNEAKERS\nSince we’re on the subject of prevention, a word on using protective sprays to keep dirt, road salt and food grease from staining a favorite pair of sneakers: You should use one.\nSpecifically, you should use one on suede sneakers, like Kiwi Suede & Nubuck Protector. Canvas sneakers, too – if you prefer that brand-new look to a broken-in one – will benefit from a protective coating, like Scotchgard Fabric & Upholstery Protector. The trick to using these sprays is to truly follow the manufacturer’s directive to hold the can six to eight inches from the shoe during application; it’s also a good idea to reapply the protective coating every six to 12 months.\nA NOTE ON STORAGE\nOne of the best things you can do for the health and good looks of your sneakers is to store them properly when you’re not wearing them. Tossing them in a heap, where they’re likely to become soiled and misshapen under the filth and weight of other shoes, is a good way to drastically shorten the life span of your sneakers. Storing sneakers in the box they came in, or in clear boxes that allow you to see the shoes inside, is a good option; using a shoe rack or bench is another way to prevent damage to sneakers while they aren’t being worn.\nAnother common sneaker affliction is creasing. Using shoe trees will help to reverse the natural creasing that occurs while wearing your favorite kicks and keep them looking, as true sneakerheads would say, fresh.\nBy Jolie Kerr © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Born in the Year of the Rat? A Virgo? Why jewellers are turning to the zodiac
  </h1>, 'text': 'What’s your “spirit animal”? Depending on what you want to achieve in life, there is, apparently, a talisman to suit. Those looking to achieve calm, for example, could opt for a pendant adorned with a slow-moving tortoise, which is said to bring a sense of stillness and togetherness.\nGeorge Root, founder of New York-based fine jewellery brand Milamore, says his spirit animal is “definitely the goldfish. It means purification and will lead you in the right direction,” he said, referring to the ancient folklore prevalent in Native American, Japanese and Chinese cultures, where certain animals symbolised different spiritual leanings – similar totems also feature in pagan and Wiccan witchcraft.\n“When goldfish die, samurais thought that they took negativity along with them, which brings good luck.” The 30-year old jeweller even got a goldfish tattooed on his wrist. “When I moved to New York from Tokyo, it was so difficult to adjust, find friends and a job. But now, every time I face a challenge, I look at my tattoo and it encourages me.”\nHe is, however, acutely aware that permanently inking on to the body a spirit creature such as a fish, a turtle or a snake (each of which “have sacred meanings in Japanese culture”) can be an extreme measure. So Root instead channelled these ideas into animal charms for his fine jewellery collection. Crafted from 18K gold, these delicate diamond-set trinkets are designed to be worn around the neck or wrist – and, for upwards of US$1,500 (S$2,043), promise to imbue wearers with all manner of “good energies.” The pieces come with illustrated tarot cards scrawled with positive mottos.\nFrom spirit animals to star signs, mystical jewellery is a burgeoning trend. As well as the turtle talismans, Milamore also offers a zodiac line laced with diamonds “that shine as bright as the constellations” they derive from, says Root.\nElsewhere, Mumbai-based brand Misho and London-based Alighieri both offer astrological jewellery – imprinted on coins affixed to necklaces, they are subtly textured with the shape of a bull (Taurus), a crustacean (Cancer) and a centaur (Sagittarius).\nRather than personify each zodiac sign, American jeweller Brooke Gregson instead portrays each constellation in diamonds (from £1,135; S$1,999), while Californian label Azlee included all 12 signs on her “Zodiac” necklace (£3,435). Givenchy, meanwhile, recently unveiled a collection of star sign trinkets, where 3D depictions of scorpions (Scorpio) and fish (Pisces) form part of a sculptural chandelier earring (£435), while jeweller Stephen Webster was so enamoured with star signs, he created his own – Ophiuchus (a snake), for those born in November.\n“Star signs mark a moment in time,” said Suhani Parekh of Misho, who first created a zodiac necklace as a gift for a friend – a keen equestrian who was born in the year of the horse, according to the traditional Chinese calendar. “I thought it was an amazing coincidence. I love the idea that we’re all part of something bigger than us – the cosmos,” she said. “I think the energy around you at the time of your birth stays with you.” For Parekh, wearing your zodiac or spirit charm token around your neck or wrist makes jewellery even more intimate. “Jewellery is incredibly personal and for centuries it’s been worn as an identifier of origin or status, of belonging.”\nWearers of such zodiac jewellery will find themselves a part of a new wave of astro enthusiasts. For astrology – which first developed in the Babylonian era some 2,400 years ago – is having a 2019 moment. Horoscope apps are on the up; Co-Star, one of the most popular, takes its planetary data from Nasa. Founded only two years ago, it now has 5.3 million global users and recently secured US$6 million in investment.\n“Horoscopes are always fun to read,” said Parekh. “We’ve always looked to the stars for answers, and I think we always will. I believe in energy.”\n“We’ve always looked to the stars for answers, and I think we always will.” – Suhani Parekh\nRoot agrees: As well as his spirit animals and horoscopes, he uses crystals to “keep his energy in a healthy place”. To maintain the good vibes, he recently introduced a spindly Spider Web crystal necklace into the Milamore collection (US$3,200). “It features a small crystal quartz laced in 18-carat gold thread. It’s not only beautiful but vital to spiritual health,” he said.\nRoot thinks the fact that people are spending hard-earned money on such spiritual talismans is a sign of the times. “Social media causes so much anxiety,” he said, referring to the surge in young people gravitating towards ancient beliefs. (Lunar ceremonies, where participants manifest their desires using sage, crystals and a campfire, are incidentally also on the up – #newmoonritual has more than 50,000 tags on Instagram.) “Naturally, people are looking for a cure. Thousands of years ago, before science or medication, people wore items they believed to be talismans, wearing rabbit’s feet believing it would protect them from illness,” he says. “As humans, we still have that same instinct.”\n“Thousands of years ago, before science or medication, people wore items they believed to be talismans… As humans, we still have that same instinct.” – George Root\nElizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at Net-a-Porter, says she too has noticed “the rise in popularity [of the trend]. Whether or not you’re a devotee of all things zodiac, there is a mystical element that aligns well with the longevity of jewellery,” she said. “Everyone knows their star sign, and carrying it with you can feel significant. Meaningful jewellery has become something of a trend.”\nBut can a diamond tortoise or a horoscope talisman around one’s neck really help with a stressful commute or a meeting at work? Root thinks so. “[They are] energy generators. Whatever object resonates, it can become your lucky charm and protect you.”\nYou may not be certain that such jewels are truly imbued with magical powers. But never underestimate the placebo effect – and the mood-enhancing benefits of a really pretty necklace. As Root puts it: “They give you power.”\n“Everyone knows their star sign, and carrying it with you can feel significant. Meaningful jewellery has become something of a trend.” – Elizabeth von der Goltz\nBy Grace Cook © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Meet the co-founder of Hermes-backed luxury lifestyle brand Shang Xia
  </h1>, 'text': ""The perception of “made in China” has shifted in recent years. While the label is still some ways away from being regarded with the same cachet as, say, “made in Japan” or “made in France”, brands like Shang Xia (“up and down” in Mandarin) are slowly but surely altering the status quo.\nBacked by the financial muscle of Hermes, the label began life in 2008 thanks to a chance encounter between one Jiang Qiong Er and Patrick Thomas, then-CEO of Hermes. In the spirit of the French maison, the idea was to tap into the skillset of China’s artisans to craft products imbued with the same quality, attention to detail, design sensibility and sophistication that Hermes is known for.\n\n\nWith China better known for mass production than high quality craftsmanship at the time, the idea was so novel that it immediately resonated. In 2010, the company opened its first boutique along Shanghai’s Huaihai Middle Road, in the heart of the French Concession.\nIn the decade that followed, stores opened in Beijing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hong Kong and Paris. A Singapore outpost will open in 2020, although its location is yet to be confirmed. In the meantime, fans of Shang Xia can head to a pop-up at #01-112, Takashimaya Department Store. The pop-up will remain open from December 4, 2019 to February 9, 2020. Ahead of the launch, Jiang gives CNA Luxury an insight into her stewardship of the brand, and why she thinks Singaporeans will take to it.\nSHANG XIA WAS FOUNDED IN 2008, AND OPENED ITS FIRST BOUTIQUE IN SHANGHAI IN 2010. WHAT ARE YOU PROUDEST OF IN ITS 10 YEARS OF EXISTENCE? \nOf creating the brand from scratch, finding a distinctive style, and building up our supply base of excellent craftsmen. In the early years we visited a lot of workshops. There are still some masters and craftsmen existing, but no management or real process, no supply chain with quality standards. They could produce one piece, but not 50. We spent 10 years accompanying the artisans to evaluate, improve, and move forward. I’m proudest of SHANG XIA as a brand. Each and every product is like my own child.\nHOW HAS SHANG XIA DEVELOPED THIS PAST DECADE? \nWe started with four product ranges – garments, accessories, furniture, and homeware. Now we have five, as we added leather goods. We’re launching a new range in Beijing this month called Space Products. It's a total package life experience, designed with the room, furniture, and objects together. The future of luxury is not just one object, but an emotion, an experience, a moment that you will keep remembering.\nIn our first decade, we focused on creating brand value, not revenue. The trend of the revenue is important, not the exact number. This year had almost 40 per cent growth compared to last year.\nWe opened a new store in Shenzhen this year, with two more openings planned for 2020. We’re also working on a different base model which is not 100 per cent retail, but more experience-oriented.\nFor the future we will keep working on beautiful objects, discovering excellent craftsmanship in China, and deepening our style. We’ll also focus on leading a real luxury experience.\n“The future of luxury is not just one object, but an emotion, an experience, a moment that you will keep remembering.” – Jiang Qiong Er\nHOW IS SHANG XIA DOING AMID A CHANGING, CHALLENGING, FICKLE LUXURY MARKET?\nThe market is changing, the people and generations are changing, but there is always a constant – Time and Emotion, two things deeply rooted into SHANG XIA’s DNA. We’re not aiming to be the trendiest, but instead use traditional handcrafts and contemporary design to create a timeless style. We believe that people, whatever the age, whatever the nationality, and whatever the culture, are all looking for beauty and love.\n\n\nWHERE DID YOUR LOVE OF THE ARTS COME FROM? \nMy family. My grandfather was a famous artist since his 20s, doing what I’m doing now with SHANG XIA: Combining the heritage of ancient art with contemporary modern art, creating a beautiful encounter between East and West. That he did it 100 years before I did, inspired me a lot. Also, my father and mother are both architects.\nWHAT WERE YOUR GROWING UP YEARS LIKE?\xa0\nI was born in Shanghai in the 1970s and lived in a traditional little lane house. My brother and I helped our parents around the house, invented our own games, and started painting, doing calligraphy, travelling and creating in nature from a young age. We did lots of crafts at home. Life was very enriching and meaningful, full of beautiful memories.\nMy father was the architect for Shanghai Museum and did the renovation of The Bund. My mother [worked on] Shanghai libraries. Later, we moved to a contemporary home in a skyscraper, and two years ago, I moved to a garden villa. I’m lucky to witness how Shanghai has grown and changed so much.\n“When I was young I learned Chinese calligraphy with masters from China… My three years in Paris invited a new blood into my body… What I’m doing now with SHANG XIA is a result of this beautiful encounter between the two cultures in which I lived.” – Jiang Qiong Er\nWHAT DO YOU LIKE MOST ABOUT SHANGHAI?\nOne of my favourite places is Xintiandi, a zone of old houses transformed into a lively neighbourhood where people dine out, meet friends, and enjoy the art of living. It combines traditional Chinese Shikumen architecture with Western influences. I like Shanghai Museum for its world-renowned collections of bronzes and antiques. And my current home, located in a beautiful estate filled with greenery.\nI visit France often for work or holidays, and when I return to Shanghai I always feel its strong, positive, vivid energy. This energy has existed over the decades, and continues to; that’s the magic of Shanghai. Also, it’s very open-minded. There’s always been a dialogue between the Eastern and Western cultures.\nYOU SPENT SOME TIME IN PARIS AS WELL?\nAfter graduating from Shanghai’s Tongji University, I was supposed to do my Masters in the US, but a trip to Europe changed my decision. I told myself: “If you could go to Paris to study, if you could one day read a French book in its original version, watch a movie in French, speak to the people in their own language, what a rich learning experience you would have”.\nWhen I arrived in France aged 22, I didn’t speak French. I spent a year learning the language and the culture at a small local university in Nice, majoring in French Literature from the 20th and 21st centuries. It was very difficult in the beginning, but I didn’t want to attend language school where you’re often with other English-speaking foreigners.\n“I think emotions are the most precious things in the world. I cannot feel the emotions from looking at a photo of a building or a masterpiece.” – Jiang Qiong Er\nA year later, I passed the entrance examination for the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs in Paris and enrolled there. It wasn’t only about academia, but the environment. There were so many exceptional things to see, interesting people to meet, and destinations to travel to.\nI think emotions are the most precious things in the world. I cannot feel the emotions from looking at a photo of a building or a masterpiece. But sitting in Ronchamp, in the beautiful chapel designed by Corbusier, I felt those emotions. When I was in front of a famous painting, I understood the power of the painting.\nWhen I was young I learned Chinese calligraphy with masters from China, and during my five years at Tongji, I discovered graphic design, architecture, product-, interior- and digital design. My three years in Paris invited a new blood into my body.\nThese two worlds were totally integrated into one, allowing me to have a kind of global thinking and creativity. What I’m doing now with SHANG XIA is a result of this beautiful encounter between the two cultures in which I lived.\nWHAT WAS YOUR EARLY ARTISTIC CAREER LIKE, BEFORE YOU WERE INVITED TO DO HERMES WINDOW DISPLAYS?\nI started my first design company when I was still a student at Tongji University together with one of my professors. The year I graduated from Tongji, I received support from the founder of\xa0 Xintiandi, Vincent Lau. This allowed me to create my own brand of jewellery, fashion accessories and home items, and I opened my first store in Xintiandi.\nThen I went to Paris but continued to manage the brand from a distance. After I graduated in Paris, I started a company with Jean-Marie Charpentier, the famous French architect who designed the Shanghai Grand Theatre. Our company mainly focused on interior design and branding. Hermes China was one of our clients. I also established my own gallery exhibiting antique furniture alongside my contemporary furniture creations. There was lots of regular exhibitions with artist friends, so I was quite busy.\nWHAT DO YOU THINK SINGAPOREANS WILL APPRECIATE ABOUT SHANG XIA?\nIt’s a country with a mix of [Eastern] and Western cultural influences and Singaporeans are very open-minded – perfect for SHANG XIA. In the last 10 years, we’ve had many clients from Singapore who travel to Shanghai, Beijing, or even Paris to discover SHANG XIA.\n“[Singapore is] a country with a mix of [Eastern] and Western cultural influences and Singaporeans are very open-minded – perfect for SHANG XIA.

      Do Louis Vuitton’s New Classics bags encourage careful, considered spending?
  </h1>, 'text': ""It has been an eventful few weeks for Louis Vuitton. In October, the French luxury house opened a 100,000 sq. ft. production factory in Texas, with American President Donald Trump on site for its inauguration alongside LVMH Chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault. Despite the latter's assertion that the move was to meet the growing demand for Louis Vuitton goods on American soil (the Louis Vuitton Rochambeau Ranch is also expected to employ 1,000 people over the next five years), President Trump's presence at the ribbon-cutting ceremony sparked an outcry from a segment of the industry.\nGrab Your Wallet, an organisation that monitors companies with ties to the President, has called for a boycott against the French luxury conglomerate. Nicolas Ghesquiere, Louis Vuitton's Artistic Director of its womenswear universe, took to Instagram to voice his disapproval. Accompanying an album art of 80s dance hit High Energy by Evelyn Thomas, Ghesquiere captioned: “Standing against any political action. I am a fashion designer refusing this association.”\nDespite the brouhaha, it seemed like it was business as usual for Louis Vuitton, at least in Singapore. Days before the opening of the Texan plant, the French maison announced the launch of an e-commerce site dedicated to the Singapore market. For many of Louis Vuitton's loyal customers here, the move couldn't have come any sooner. Since its launch in France in 2005, the e-commerce service has been extended to 25 countries such as China, Brazil, Japan and South Korea over the years.\n\n\nAvailable on web and mobile platforms, a wide range of products can be found online\xa0 – including Louis Vuitton's agenda-setting ready-to-wear pieces for men and women, its signature leather goods, as well as footwear, accessories, jewellery, luggage and fragrances. You may choose to collect your purchases from Louis Vuitton's Ngee Ann City store – but what's the point when the brand has one-upped its personalisation offering with a complimentary same-day delivery?\nIt shouldn't matter that Louis Vuitton's four outposts are easily accessible from any part of the island. If anything, the introduction of the site demonstrates an embrace of Singapore's digital landscape. According to Statista Portal, revenue from the city state's e-commerce market is set to hit US$4 billion (S$5.43 billion) by the end of 2019 – well on track of a ten-year forecast by Google and state investment firm Temasek Holdings that the sector will be worth US$5.4 billion (S$7.5 billion) by 2026.\nOf course, convenience remains the biggest draw of the e-commerce site. And adding to the incentive to hit the checkout button is the release of the New Classics collection, a leather goods range conceptualised by Virgil Abloh, its menswear Artistic Director. Reminiscent of Staples Edited By Louis Vuitton – a pre-fall capsule that saw Abloh introduce a series of wardrobe staples elevated with the House's know-how – the new line consists of four iconic bags that have been tweaked slightly to suit the tastes and lifestyles of the contemporary male customer.\nSave for the resin chains that have become an Abloh signature at Louis Vuitton, you'll be hard-pressed to pinpoint the exact updates the designer has made to the bags – now rendered in ultra-masculine black-and-grey shades of the Monogram Eclipse. That's because Abloh has applied his famous “3% approach” to the bags, a modus operandi which sees him altering a form to that number in order to update its relevance.\nThe release of Abloh's New Classics follows a burgeoning fashion movement in which designers are redefining fashion's notions of timelessness. In the wake of the discussion on sustainability, this anti-trend trend encourages careful and considered spending.\nIs Abloh's “3%” enough to sustain interest in the collection? Time will tell. But the 39-year-old's track record has shown that he is adept at generating hype for all his endeavours, from his collaborations with brands such as Nike and Ikea, to his own work at Off-White. He is also one of the few designers of his generation who has managed to connect with a new legion of consumers on a quest for clout in the digital sphere – those will surely add the bags to their shopping carts.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     sustainability ', '     Men ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Now in Singapore: Hermes’s playful objects upcycled from leftover materials
  </h1>, 'text': 'Fabrics with print irregularities, leather remnants, and past-season buckles, zippers and buttons. In the world of luxury fashion where trendiness is key, items like these would usually end up in the trash pile.\nAt Hermes, they become the sparks for the next whimsical idea under the French maison’s petit h (“petit” is French for “small”) collection, which will be on display at the Hermes flagship Liat Towers store from November 22 to December 15, 2019.\n\nThe Singapore stopover spins a green yarn in a scenography created by local industrial designer Olivia Lee, who was handpicked by petit h’s creative director Godefroy de Virieu to bring out the island’s natural charms that parallel the whimsical petit h universe.\nTraverse a “planet” populated by organic forms and materials before passing through a second space pierced by brilliant light to evoke a futuristic workshop. The collection include pieces specially chosen and made for this stop: Mushroom paperweights, leather charms of our ubiquitous red plastic chairs, and fish-shaped bags take their place together with objects such as a saddle tree chair, leather coat hook and clock clad in crocodile skin.\n\n\nHermes family member Pascale Mussard started the collection in 2010 when she saw perfectly usable materials being discarded, a practice that went against her sustainable vision for the brand.\n“She decided to take all these materials and bring it to this workshop, and asked the craftsmen and artisans to create a dialogue around these materials to create some new things,” shared de Virieu, who joined the petit h team as a designer that year, and became its creative director in 2018. “They are useful objects, you can use them everyday, and you can bring them with you. So it was very new and very simple idea, but this is an ingenious idea.”\nThe spirit of petit h is “creation in reverse”, where skilled in-house craftsmen work with a select group of designers and artists to produce functional beauty with juxtaposing leftover materials.\n\n\nThe possibilities are limitless, as each unused item carted over by Hermes’ other crafts yield another imaginative detour, and the team assembles, adjusts and combines disparate things into the most unlikely melange of colours, shapes and textures.\nBullcalf leather, a mother-of-pearl button, Saint-Louis crystal and cork combine to become a salt shaker, surplus zippers are pulled together to form a 1m-tall decorative dog sculpture, and various leather remnants become pretty charms and delightful moveable animal puppets that will tug at your heart (and purse strings). All pieces are one-off or limited edition, with a permanent retail space at Hermes’s Rue de Sevres store in Paris, and seasonal availability in stores in Europe, Australia and Singapore. Two to three times a year, petit h makes a stop in various cities, digging into the local culture and lifestyle with special-edition products and collaborations.\nWith petit h, the thrill for the craftsmen and designers is the explorative journey they can take with each product. “The thing that makes me extremely happy is the idea,” de Virieu said. “At the very beginning of the process, I know if the idea is good or not. This is what I really like. We don’t actually know where we will go when we start working. We follow the material, we follow the idea, we follow the dialogue.”\nThe mushroom paperweights in ostrich and clemence bullcalf, for instance, have a special significance for de Virieu, as he started working on the concept 10 years ago when he first joined.\n“I was very impressed by the quality of the leather. And looking closely, you can find some wrinkles on some of it. And these parts were not used; they were thrown away because they couldn’t make a piece or a bag with this leather. And so I wanted to make paper weights that can be used on your desk and to create a family of mushrooms that would weigh down on the folders.” The craftsman then comes in to make that idea a reality, by twisting, turning and shaping the materials until it meets the desired form.\n“The cheerful part is part of our creative process. The idea is not just to say we are going to make stars, to be playful, joyful or anything. This is not the purpose of petit h; we are really thinking of the objects that create something joyful.”\nHermes petit h runs from November 22 to December 15, 2019 at Hermes, 541 Orchard Road, Liat Towers, from 10.30am to 8pm daily. Admission is free. \n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     sustainability ', '     Singapore ']}"

      How to dress right for your company D&amp;D – so you don’t embarrass yourself
  </h1>, 'text': 'The annual company dinner and dance – it may be an enjoyable event for some, but it can also be quite a headache for others. Finding something appropriate to wear when there’s a dress code requires a bit of planning and expenditure. Is it necessary to buy a new dress? How formal should you go? What if the dress code is something generic like “elegant” or “glamorous”? There really is no guideline for interpretation.\nThere’s also the question of making an appropriate fashion statement – you don’t want to look boring or bland, but you definitely don’t want to stand out for the wrong reasons.\nSo how do you make a stylish impression without damaging your professional image? There’s a fine line to tread, and here’s how to ace it.\nFOLLOW THE DRESS CODE\nThemed parties aside (since those don’t really go by typical dress codes), is it formal or casual? This will dictate the direction of your outfit. If the invite doesn’t explicitly spell it out, the venue will usually provide an indication of how formal it’ll be.\nConsider also the culture of your company – is it unconventional and flexible or traditional and conservative? This will tell you how “out-there” you can get with your D&D ensemble. As much as we want to be individuals, you don’t want to stick out like a sore thumb at the party.\nDON’T REVEAL TOO MUCH\nWhile you’re there to enjoy yourself, a D&D is still a work event where you’ll be with the people you see almost on a daily basis. Having fun doesn’t mean throwing your professional image out the window – and this applies to both your behaviour and your fashion choices. Do not go for plunging necklines, skirt slits that go up to your hips, super-high hemlines, or barebacked tops or dresses that leave nothing much to the imagination.\nRemember that your bosses and company directors will be at the same event, so think about what kind of impression you’ll be leaving them by dressing too provocatively.\n\n\nGO EASY ON THE MAKEUP\nIt’s a party, not a magazine cover shoot or your wedding. Go ahead and dial up the makeup by going for a slightly smokier eye, or darker or brighter lip colour than what you’d wear on a normal day, but don’t go OTT by combining both, and then putting on a plush set of falsies and dusting on copious amounts of glitter all over your face and body. You want to look appropriately glammed-up and still remain recognisable to your colleagues.\nBRING OUT THE STATEMENT ACCESSORIES\nBlack is always the most popular (and easiest) colour choice for a semi-formal or formal outfit. There’s nothing problematic about that – you can’t go wrong with black, plus, it’s great for concealing figure flaws. The only issue is that it can be a little bland.\nDon’t want to blend into a sea of black at the event? A good way to jazz up your LBD is with statement accessories, be it a sparkly pair of chandelier earrings, a cuff for the arm, or heels and a minaudiere, or small decorative handbag, in another colour that pops against black. A statement red lip could be your perfect “accessory” too. Don’t pile on everything, of course – you want to make a measured statement and not look like a decorated Christmas tree.\nRENT OR BUY SOMETHING YOU CAN WEAR AGAIN\nHurrah, if you’ve already got something suitable in your closet. But should you should need to go shopping for a new dress, look for pieces that you’ll be able to wear again so you won’t be wasting your money on a single-wear outfit. In other words, look out for styles and colours that you’re likely to use again, or go for the classic LBD if you really want to be safe.\nIf the invitation has a dress code that’s more specific – like a colour that you don’t own and typically won’t wear – or properly formal, why not rent a dress instead? There are quite a few local fashion rentals online (try Runway Rent, Style Lease, Covetella or Style Theory) with a stylish range of cocktail dresses and gowns to suit different sizes, figures and occasions.\nExpect to pay around S$120 and upwards for a rental piece, which typically will be laundered, delivered and then picked up by the company after your event at no extra charge. It’s quite a good deal, compared to having to buy a new dress that is likely to be pricier than the rental cost and unlikely to ever be worn again.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Career ']}"

      Commentary: Why would anyone ask Google for fashion advice?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: The tech giants Amazon, Google and Facebook have all begun to use machine learning to give you tips on what to wear. Is fashion styling the next field to be disrupted by artificial intelligence (AI), or will the human eye remain supreme?\nIt’s too soon to know for sure, but understanding what machine learning is good at and how that overlaps with what fashion is all about can help us make some educated guesses.\nGET THAT LOOK\nOne thing machine learning does very well is finding patterns and common features among groups of items.\nTaking advantage of this, Google Lens and Amazon Style Snap can each identify a garment from a photo or video and then tell you a bit more, like how other people have worn it or where you can buy it.\nThis serves the same function as a fashion magazine taking a celebrity look and breaking it down into pieces.\xa0\nBy allowing consumers to recreate looks from movies, music videos, magazines and the runway, machine learning helps democratise elements of styling.\nAmazon also goes further, linking garments to a database of looks from popular fashion influencers.\xa0\nThis offers the customer inspiration for building looks and conveniently gives the influencers a cut if the customer buys the clothes.\nThis system has great potential, but it can only be as good as the data that is fed into it.\xa0\nA large and diverse database could bring out cultures and beauty standards that are not often seen in magazines or television, allowing people to find their tribe. But a narrower collection of sources will only produce more of the same.\nTHE STYLIST IN THE MACHINE\nThe next step in computer fashion – using AI to offer styling judgements – has so far been less successful.\nAmazon’s Echo Look is a voice-controlled camera that aims to function as a style assistant, comparing two photos using a machine learning algorithm and telling you which one scores better. So far it has received lacklustre reviews.\nThis service seems doomed to struggle, as it neglects many basic principles of fashion design.\nFor example, many looks from influencers only have a front view. How could you possibly style an outfit properly without the whole picture?\nMost principles of styling also take into account the wearer’s body shape, how well-fitted their clothing is, their personality, and the occasion for which the garment is being worn. Context, symbolism, nostalgia, and personal preferences also play a role.\nThe AI assistant has no way to address these nuances. To succeed, the machine learning engineers will need to understand fashion better and find useful and tangible tasks for AI to perform.\nALGORITHMIC ZHOOSHING\nFacebook’s experimental Fashion++ project goes further still, trying to tell you how to improve the outfit you wear.\nThe idea behind the software is to make small changes (known as minimal edits) to an outfit, such as tucking in a shirt, rolling up a sleeve, changing the length of a hem, or removing an accessory. Garments are defined as “fashionable” if they are popular on a database and the AI learns to edit looks to make them score more highly in this regard.\nThis relies on a massive oversimplification of how the craft of fashion design works. Simply mimicking elements of what is popular and putting them together is no guarantee for an aesthetically pleasing look.\nThere is no guarantee that the most popular look – the statistical “mode” – will be truly fashionable, or “à la mode”.\nA SPY IN YOUR WARDROBE\nAs we start taking photos and streaming videos of what we desire, or begin uploading photos of ourselves in our underwear, we should keep in mind that our data is being stored and mined. Data-mining corporations can use our personal information to influence our behavior, or sell it to advertisers.\nEven if you are unconcerned with your personal data being shared, AI products are likely to encourage needless consumption over the actual goal of making you look attractive.\nOften when people seek the help of a stylist or a second opinion on their appearance, it is not even about the clothing. Some need validation or attention, or are set in their ways what makes them look attractive.\nFashion styling serves a whole range of functions: Creating a look of beauty, projecting power, attracting a romantic partner, or making the wearer feel special.\xa0\nThere is no guarantee that even a stylist and some new clothing can achieve these goals – an app barely stands a chance.\nMark Liu is a fashion and textiles designer, and a Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Technology Sydney.

      Creative Capital: How a self-taught Singaporean fashion designer got into the business of interior design
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Carolyn Kan, founder of Carrie K and Keepers, and fairy godmother of the local design sector speaks highly about someone, you tend to pay attention. So, when she mentioned that her latest boutique in Funan Centre was designed by one Priscilla Tan, I immediately clicked over to the interior designer’s IG page (@styledbypt).\nTan has a great eye for colour, space, and light. She has a great innate understanding of the relationships of objects within a space and how to make a space breathe. Given that she is a self-taught designer makes what she does even more impressive.\nTan, however, is no newbie to the design world. In a short but busy career, she has been a fashion designer and a jewellery designer. As the former, she even had her own label, Chalk, which when it launched in 2010 was lauded by fans and critics alike. Local magazine Her World even declared “this is one label that every woman should own a piece of.”\nYOU’VE BEEN AN INTERIOR DESIGNER, JEWELLERY DESIGNER, AND FASHION DESIGNER. OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A TALENT AND PASSION FOR DESIGN, WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS COMES FROM? DID YOUR PARENTS ENCOURAGE IT? WERE YOU ALWAYS INTO DESIGN AS A CHILD?\nI took art lessons since I was five years old and continued till I was a teenager. That fine art base help set the foundation of my interest in art and design. My mum is also naturally creative and she cooks very well. She was the one who exposed me to the world of dance, art and music since I was a baby. I will credit her as the earliest influence in my creative journey.\nWhen I was in my primary school, I drew on every single empty paper in the house and my father asked if I was keen to consider fashion as a career. He signed me up for pattern making and fashion illustration courses in my teenage years and I was even a finalist in the Singapore Young Fashion Designer contest when I was doing my ""O"" levels. I’ve always known that art was a part of me as I loved observing what was around me and translating that either into drawings or into my imagination.\n\n\nOne of my design highlights was winning the Topshop/Topman graduate award which offered me a trip to London to intern at the Topshop headquarters. I had the crazy opportunity of meeting Sir Philip Green and Kate Moss, as she had a collection that time. Most importantly, I got to learn what goes behind building a brand or a label.\nYOU HAD A LABEL CALLED CHALK ALMOST A DECADE AGO. TELL US\xa0ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE.\nIt was a dream come true as I had always wanted to be a fashion designer with my own label. The timing came when PARCO next NEXT, initiated by TAFF (Textile and Fashion Federation of Singapore), wanted to groom a new pool of Singaporean designers. We had our own retail store and I launched four collections a year. I met so many fashion designers that became close friends. It was such great peer support as we grew our brands and had the opportunity to show in Paris and London fashion weeks.\nDue to the exposure, I have had the opportunity to have my clothes retail at Isetan and Tangs department stores in Singapore. The highlight of my fashion design career was designing corporate uniforms and I made my dad proud when I designed the first batch of uniforms for Gardens by the Bay when they opened.\nWHAT LESSONS DID YOU LEARN FROM STARTING AND RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS AT A REALLY YOUNG AGE?\nBeing commercially viable and listening to your clients are the key lessons to running a business. In a way, I believe one has to fill a gap or a niche that is missing in the market, while adding your own flavour to what you do. In fashion, I designed pieces that did not require much ironing. This gained the approval of many working professional ladies as they wanted something fuss-free, while still being able to look presentable for work.\xa0\nIn interiors, I noticed there was a gap in Singaporeans doing interior styling in the international market. I wanted to show that in Asia, we are also able to create a home that reflects our lifestyles and clients’ needs while also maintaining the functionality of a well-designed home.\nDO YOU FIND PEOPLE SUPPORTIVE IN GENERAL OF LOCAL CREATIVE ENTREPRENEURS OR IS IT A TOUGH LONELY BATTLE\nYes, generally Singapore is a nurturing place to start a business or to learn something new. Being open, humble and appreciative are the best ways to connect with people. I find asking questions, and crediting people who have taught you goes a long way too.\nDID YOU EVER SEE YOURSELF AS AN INTERIOR DESIGNER? WAS THERE A SPECIFIC MOMENT WHEN YOU REALISED YOU COULD TURN INTERIOR DESIGN INTO YOUR CAREER?\nI always loved looking at beautiful spaces but I never thought of myself as an interior designer. Even up till now it’s hard to say that. When I first designed my own home, I had friends and guests who came by and found my approach unique. With their support, I did a few homes for them and enjoyed the process.\n\n\nThree years back, while watching HGTV Fixer Upper at my friend\'s home, it dawned on me that interior styling could be a career. I took the plunge to start the business with a few clients. It was all via word of mouth before I started sharing my work on Instagram. That’s how STYLEDBYPT was born.\nCAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN ONLINE DESIGN CONSULTING AND ONLINE SOURCING? HOW DOES THAT WORK?\nI have just started conceptualizing this. It\'s in the early stages of the final plan but this is how it works. Clients will first provide me details of their home or the space they wish to makeover or design, along with their budget and preferred style. I then ask for images they like, along with images of what the space looks like now. This is all done via email.\nBased on the information provided, I will be prepare three initial design concepts which will be sent to them. I will follow up with a video call to discuss what they like or don’t like about the ideas. Once the final design has been firmed up, if it\'s a whole house makeover. they can work alongside with me and my appointed contractors. We will do weekly calls and text messages to walk through the whole design process.\nFor a smaller room makeover that only requires styling and sourcing help, I will prepare a shopping list and instructions on how to set everything up with an online sourcing list that ranges from furniture to soft furnishings.\nHOW ARE YOU ENHANCING YOUR SKILLS AS A DESIGNER? YOU ADMIT YOU’RE UNTRAINED, BUT DO YOU SEE YOURSELF GETTING PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS?\nI am researching degree courses in interior design in Wellington, New Zealand, where I am now based. I have also been practising my online rendering skills with Sketch Up every day. I make sure I read up and save images on Pinterest and Instagram featuring homes every single day as well.\nWHAT’S THE MOST COMMON DESIGN MISTAKE YOU SEE IN HOMES?\nNot planning enough storage space for your lifestyle needs is one of the biggest mistakes which leads to clutter and mess. Another design mistake is not planning the right areas for the electrical switches and power outlets. Lastly, one that I see often is not finding the correct size furniture. That mistake alone can overwhelm or underwhelm a room.\nWHAT’S YOUR CURRENT INTERIOR DESIGN OBSESSION?\nI am obsessed with collecting and reading design coffee books. I also cannot stop buying throw cushions to refresh my home. I am not big on trends but I have a huge love for all things rattan lately and I think it\'s creeping into my work too.\nTELL ME ABOUT YOUR RECENT MOVE TO NEW ZEALAND? WAS IT FOR WORK OR PERSONAL REASONS?\nMy husband and I have always wanted to live and work overseas together. The dream came true when he found work in Wellington and we took the crazy plunge to try a new adventure in September this year. It\'s only been a few months since we arrived but we are loving the slower and better quality in life. Having a new home – we are currently renting –also means I get to dress a home for ourselves which is such a therapeutic and fun experience.\nIS THERE A PROJECT YOU’D SIMPLY LOVE TO DO? A DREAM JOB?\nI would love to design and style a boutique hotel. It\'s always been my dream to translate a vision into a bigger space through a brand story.\nWHAT WERE TOUGH MOMENTS IN STARTING AND RUNNING STYLEDBYPT? CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT ONE?\nThere are plenty of crazy moments which, in hindsight really shaped how I see life. In interior renovation makeover work, there are always hiccups or delays, even with the best planning possible. I used to beat myself up a lot for all the mistakes I made but I came to realise that I learn so much from these mistakes. My husband encouraged me by saying these mistakes are like lessons you will never learn in school. He is right. Because of past mistakes, I am able to advise clients on potential issues and also challenge myself by pushing past previously established boundaries.\nWHO AND WHAT INSPIRES YOUR WORK?\nHonestly, the conversation with the clients are the best. The stories I hear from them and making their dream homes come alive are just insanely fulfilling. I am also inspired by Emily Henderson, Joanna Gaines and Kelly Hoppen to name a few female international leaders in the design field. I love how they make design attractive, approachable\xa0and so accessible while maintaining a clear vision of their own branding.\nWHAT’S THE VISION FOR STYLEDBYPT? WHERE DO YOU HOPE THE BUSINESS IS IN 5 YEARS?\nWith the move to New Zealand, I hope to design and create more spaces STYLEDBYPT globally. The aim for the next five years is to build more awareness of what I do here in New Zealand and Australia, And\xa0maybe design a yacht next!\n', 'related_topics': ['     homes ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Life "", ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      Ji Chang-wook, Rebecca Lim, Rui En, Sheila Sim attend Cartier pop-up launch
  </h1>, 'text': 'A bevy of stars descended upon Robertson Quay and the STPI on Thursday evening (Nov 14) for the opening of Cartier’s Clash de Cartier Studio pop-up.\xa0South Korean actor-singer Ji Chang-wook headlined the evening, while homegrown celebrities Rebecca Lim, Rui En, Sheila Sim lent further stardust.\nAlso in attendance were fashion influencers Yoyo Cao and Arissa Cheo; siblings Irfan Fandi and Iman Fandi; as well as homegrown musical talents Charlie Lim and Jasmine Sokko, fresh from her Best Southeast Asia Act win at the 2019 MTV Europe Music Awards.\nWith the theme of the evening being all about clashing attitudes, duality and rebellion – after all, the Clash de Cartier collection features punk-influenced designs – we were curious about how the celebrities interpreted the concept.\nFor Chang-wook, who is both an actor and a singer, there is a very distinct division between his roles. “As an actor, I’m more focused on my work. As a singer, I enjoy myself more. If there’s a fun project that I can enjoy doing, I’ll do it. I’m more serious about my career as an actor,” he told CNA Luxury through an interpreter.\nChang-wook stars in the ongoing Korean fantasy rom-com Melting Me Softly alongside Won Jin-ah and Yoon Se-ah. The show’s premise revolves around variety show producer Ma Dong Chan (played by Chang-wook) and part-time employee Go Mi Ran (Jin-ah), who, in 1999, participate in an experiment to be frozen for a day. But due to mysterious circumstances, they only get thawed in 2019.\nThe 32-year-old’s biggest claim to fame was his lead role in the action thriller Healer (2014), for which he won the Popularity Award and Best Couple Award (with Park Min-Young) at the 2014 KBS Drama Awards, and Most Popular Overseas Actor at the 2015 China TV Drama Awards.\nThe babyfaced star has since appeared in many highly-rated productions, including Korea’s The K2 (2016) and Suspicious Partner (2017), as well as China’s Whirlwind Girl 2 (2016). Chang-wook\xa0also had cameos\xa0in a number of music videos, and has lent his vocals to the soundtracks of several of his dramas. To date, he has released eight singles, as well as a Mandarin EP, Be With You (2016).\nAsked whether he has two sides to his personality, and whether he’s the same person in public as in private, Chang-wook replied: “Personally, I’m shy. But when I’m working, I can’t really be shy. So, I’m really trying very hard not to be too shy!”\nIt’s a feeling that Rui En can empathise with. “I tend to be kind of chor lor [rough around the edges], unglam, awkward and clumsy in private. When I’m at an event like this, I’ve got to rein that in!” she shared. “I find that I have infinite sides to my personality. I can be a rather complicated person, and the Clash de Cartier collection reflects that.”\nCiting Avril Lavigne as a major influence on her teenage sensibilities, Rui En shared about going through a punk phase in her teens. ""I fancied myself an emo punk rocker. I [had] all the studs and chains. This jewellery is a grown-up, more expensive version of that!”\n\n\nBeing a teenage rebel was out of the question for Rebecca, who grew up with strict parents. “[I grew] up in a very traditional family with very strict parents – who gave [me] a curfew all the way till [I was] 21 – even now, if I’m out till 3am, I’ll get missed calls from my mum asking where I am.\n“Growing up in that environment, you have a lot of rules that you abide by, like not starting a meal until everyone is seated at the table, or greeting everyone you meet along the way. It doesn’t matter who they are, or whatever position they hold.”\nShe let on that she has “more than two sides” to her personality, and reveals these facets depending on the company she’s with, the situation she’s in, and how she’s feeling that day. But all things said and done, Rebecca is proud of the fact that her “core” personality – her respectful, law-abiding nature – has remained the same throughout the years.\n\n\nFor Sheila Sim, a duality definitely exists between her public persona and her personal life. “I’m a Gemini, so my horoscope already has two sides. What people see in me is someone confident, but there’s another side of me that’s really quiet and demure… okay, maybe not demure! Just quiet and sometimes insecure. But I think that’s really every human. It’s about embracing the two sides and balancing the yin and yang.”\nMeanwhile, the actress is continually discovering herself. “My husband sometimes sees 10 different sides of me… in an hour. I really enjoy it! I feel like sometimes there’s a part of me I don’t even know exists. [I sometimes have] sudden confidence or sudden knowledge and wisdom… and I’m like, ‘who is that person?’! I think that’s growth. I’m still exploring the different sides of me. And it’s been quite fun.”\nClash de Cartier Studio is up from Nov 15 to 17, 11am to 9pm, at STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery, 41 Robertson Quay, Singapore 238236. Admission is free.

      Scaled up: Bvlgari’s latest Serpenti collection has a slinky new bracelet
  </h1>, 'text': 'Animals are some of the most powerful sources of inspiration in fine jewellery – Cartier has its imposing and mysterious panther, while Bvlgari is synonymous with the seductive serpent that has slithered its way through many of the Italian jeweller’s iconic jewelled creations.\nThose who are familiar with Bvlgari’s well-loved Serpenti designs will know that the line doesn’t solely comprise jewellery – the sinuous form of the snake has also been wrapped elegantly around women’s wrists as some of the most exquisite and interesting watches we’ve seen.\nWhether fitted with a Tubogas bracelet, a Bvlgari signature that is made flexible via a special metal-coiling technique; or a slim leather strap, Serpenti watches share a couple of common characteristics\xa0– they all spiral beautifully up the wrist in double, triple or quadruple twirls, depending on your liking, and have a drop-shaped case that resembles the head of a snake.\nA classic yet modern fashion statement, the Serpenti watch has taken on distinctively different styles through the years while retaining its essential form. This year is no different, as Bvlgari unveils Serpenti Seduttori and opens a new chapter for the line of watches.\n\n\nThe timepieces were first seen at Baselworld earlier this year and then officially launched at London Fashion Week in September, with a celebration that had international celebrities in attendance at a party befitting the glam and bold style of Serpenti Seduttori.\nThese latest arrivals bear a drop-shaped case that, while similar to its predecessors is, however, slimmer than ever before. The most notable new feature they carry lies in the unique bracelet, which has a completely flexible structure composed of hexagonal links that are crafted to resemble snake scales.\nThis bracelet, unlike those that came before it, doesn’t spiral up the wrist and is secured by a folding buckle –\xa0perhaps a better way to appreciate the details on it. The scales also serve as a canvas for dazzling bling – on full-pave versions of the Serpenti Seduttori, each scale is set with diamonds to create an all-round luminosity.\nThe watches are available in diamond-set or full-pave variations in pink, white or yellow gold and also bi-coloured models that combine a stainless steel bracelet and case with a rose gold bezel, which means the Serpenti Seduttori can be an everyday watch or an opulent statement accessory reserved for glamorous occasions.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     jewellery ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Joanne Peh takes a stand: I found peace by loving even those who hurt me
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Joanne Peh presides over the set of Last Madame, you can be sure she doesn’t do it in a metaphorical way. As the owner, ringleader and chief seductress of the 1920s brothel in the risque Toggle Originals period drama, she leaves no one in any doubt about who’s running the show.\nIt comes as no surprise that in real life as well, CNA Luxury\'s November digital cover star is\xa0every bit the independent woman – and she relishes the freedom to define that on her own terms.\xa0“Sometimes, if we just take a step back and look at our own femininity, that could also be a strength on its own,” she said.\n“As women, our strength is also in the fact that we are softer and more feminine, rather than trying to be strong and on par with the men,"" said Joanne. ""In fact, I think, leave that to the men. They can’t be soft and sensual like we can be.""\n""I think we play a different role in society. That comes through in the show – you could say the women are seen as pleasure tools, but at the same time… women are using this softer side of them to be in a stronger position of power. That’s something we may forget in this modern time.”\nAnother thing she has in common with her character is that they both live by their own rules and principles.\xa0“I’m not afraid when people step on my turf and disagree with me,"" said the 36-year-old. ""I put them in their place.”\nFor example, when there was a furore earlier this year about the comments she had posted about the child actors she worked with in her directorial debut – the short film Under The Tree – she was firm about not having any malicious intent.\n“I’m not afraid when people step on my turf and disagree with me. I put them in their place.”\n“I really stood my ground about the fact that I wasn’t trying to put anyone down, and it was a very genuine reflection about what was happening. There’s no shame in it and, in fact, it gives everyone room to improve. I know my conscience is clear,” she said. “I don’t back down because a bunch of people are singing the same tune, knowing very well that this is not representative of what the majority thinks.”\nAs a mother of two young children with husband and fellow actor Qi Yuwu, she understands that not all kids are cut out for what they might be expected to do, and that’s okay. At the same time, being a mum has inspired her to be more courageous and adventurous.\n“One big thing I’ve learned\xa0from parenthood is the importance of leading by example,” she shared. “If I want my children to be brave, to be polite, to be non-fussy eaters, to be curious, I have to be that role model first. So I have, since becoming a mother, consciously stepped out of my comfort zone because I want to encourage my children to overcome their fears.""\n\xa0\n""Some of the things I’ve done include learning a new language, starting a business, writing a script and directing it, travelling alone, picking up a new skill, standing up for what I believe in – the list goes on.”\nOne of the pillars in her life is meditation, which helps her stay focused. She isn’t afraid to take time for herself, either. This August, for instance, she went on an Ayurvedic retreat in Kerala, India, where she practiced meditation and yoga on her own.\nMINDFUL LIVING\nYes, Ms Joanne Peh might be an irrepressible go-getter now. But it\'s taken time – and work – to get here.\nShe first got into meditation the year she won her second Best Actress trophy at the Star Awards, although she didn’t practice it regularly until later. “There was too much noise about why I shouldn’t have won, why someone else should have, and how I was avoiding the saga by running away because I was on a holiday with my family and couldn’t answer all the questions from the media – all of which were untrue and made great headlines. It was stressful and I was sad.”\n“I found peace through working on my ability to love even those who hurt me.""\nOn that vacation in Lijiang, China, “I found peace through working on my ability to love even those who hurt me – probably because of the exposure to Tibetan Buddhism in Shangri-La. And it was during that year that I first tried meditation.”\n\xa0\nShe continued, “Meditation has helped me feel much more in control of my emotions, allowed me to gain clarity on matters that used to bother me and expanded my heart’s capacity to love.”\nDuring her recent retreat in Kerala, “the Ayurvedic doctor said I have a lot of pitta (fire) which, when it manifests in one form, is what people commonly see as being a perfectionist,” she said.\n“I pay attention to details, and when I set my heart on something, I give it my all. For example, when I worked with new actors in my directorship, I stressed the importance of the cut of the outfits and accessories the characters wore in order to reflect their personality, even if they may not necessarily have had a close-up on screen. As an actress, I study acting, read and constantly explore ways to improve my craft. When I buy clothes, I’d look at the buttons, zips and stitches. And I like my clothes pressed even when I travel.”\nIT’S THE JOURNEY THAT COUNTS\nPerfectionism may well be the driving force behind her steady pursuit of excellence, whether it’s as an actress or as a person. After 17 years in the industry, and contributing to it in various ways, the biggest lesson she’s learned\xa0is to take every step fearlessly.\n“When we are doing something for the first time or when there are no precedents, it will be challenging, and there will be setbacks and discouragement along the way. We have two choices: One is to duck our heads low and follow in someone else’s footsteps. The second is to push through in the face of adversity.\xa0The former isn’t any safer, because all of us have a unique code – what works for someone else may not work for us. The only way to get any kind of feedback for ourselves is to do it and then learn from it. I think it is important to develop a growth mindset.”\n""We have two choices: One is to duck our heads low and follow in someone else’s footsteps. The second is to push through in the face of adversity.""\nAt this stage in her life, Joanne is actively seeking out\xa0challenges for personal development. ""I’m also extremely hungry for knowledge, curious about the world and fiercely protective over the people I love and care about.”\nIf she were to describe her state of mind now, she’d compare herself to a moving train, she said.\n\xa0\n“I feel like I’m a train making its maiden journey on this beautiful earth, travelling on tracks that are mostly smooth, occasionally stopping to refuel, and sometimes chugging along more slowly than usual when the weather, tracks or external circumstances are not so favourable. Many people hop on –\xa0some stay longer, some realise they’re on the wrong train, while others leave after a few stops. And then there are those who stick around for a long time.""\n“So, as I make my way around the world, beautiful memories are created with the people who remain, and these are the passengers who matter. Some day, they’ll all disembark and I’ll run out of steam, but for now, I’m enjoying this journey with gratitude.”\nStyle Editor: Serene Seow; Art Direction: Chern Ling, Jasper Loh; Photography: Aik Chen; Stylist: Lena Kamarudin;\xa0Makeup: Keith Bryant; Hair: Nigel Woo.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     celebrity ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      The 70-year-old biker-architect who’s literally shaping the luxury industry
  </h1>, 'text': 'Peter Marino’s first experience of shopping was as a child, tagging alongside his mother on their occasional trips to town from his home in Queens, New York. In the 1950s, the Manhattan department stores were dark and labyrinthine, designed to slow the senses and immerse the client in a vast cocoon of schmatta. Time would stop. The space would shrink. Marino loathed it.\nAn acute claustrophobic, who still rides a motorbike because he cannot stand being trapped in a car, the experience was awful. “You couldn’t breathe. All department stores had no light. They didn’t want the lady to realise she’d been there for two hours . . . and the light of day was changing. I found that so sinister. The more I learned about department-store thinking, the more I was repelled.”\n\n\n Giverny.

Happy to head the benefit committee for this champion of Baroque music, France’s leading exporter of classical music in the world. Swipe for more pics in Claude Monet’s garden. Link to @lepointfr article in bio. �� @luc_castel\nA post shared by  Peter Marino (@petermarinoarchitect) on Jul 2, 2019 at 12:14pm PDT\nMarino has spent the past 50 years eviscerating those notions of the upscale retail space. A lauded architect, and the man predominantly responsible for the look of every Chanel, Dior or Louis Vuitton store you may have seen, we have met on a scorching hot day in July at the Bristol hotel in Paris; the 70-year-old is dressed in his customary uniform of leather biker trousers, boots, leather biker cap and leather gilet. His look recalls the doorman at an underground fetish club but Marino’s claustrophobic leanings are untickled by the heat.\nMarino’s bizarro deportment is a deceptive guise. He’s actually quite conventional – long-term married to his wife Jane and daddy to 28-year-old daughter Isabelle. He graduated from Cornell University, and founded his architecture and design firm Peter Marino Architect, in New York, in 1978.\nThat same year, Andy Warhol hired him to create the third incarnation of his famous Factory. In 1985, he was commissioned by the Pressman family, then-owners of the US department store Barneys. He designed 17 of their shops. Further clients followed – Armani, Calvin Klein and Chanel among them. Today, he oversees some of the most expensive shop fits in the business, and quotes his projects as costing “in excess of US$1,000 (S$1,363) [per] foot”.\nHis latest work is the transformation of the Louis Vuitton flagship store on Bond Street in London. A 17,435 sq. ft. emporium of polished limestone, it features a double helix staircase, artwork by James Turrell, and lots of man-friendly sitting areas: Chaps favour a chair while waiting for their wives to shop, said Marino, because it makes them feel more comfortable.\n“They get nervous on a sofa because it’s sociable and somebody might talk to you.” The project has taken more than 14 months, and cost a multitude of millions, but its most spectacular feature is its epic use of light.\n“I want to breathe,” said Marino when asked of the unifying themes of his design. “The customers in the stores I do are intelligent enough to understand that if you look out of a window and see a tree, it’s not going to keep you from buying a dress. That’s old schmatta-land thinking: ‘Never get the customer distracted’. I’m a heavy believer in natural light,” he said. “Dark rooms are for sex; light rooms are for shopping.” He stops, and looks at me. “I didn’t say that.”\n\n\nARCHITECTURE IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET\nMarino’s career has coincided with the rise of the megabrand, and much else has changed. How far have internet shopping, global expansion and shifting consumer habits changed the thrust of his design?\n“There are trends, but there are also eternal truths,” said Marino. “I cut my teeth on Barneys in the 80s, doing the first women’s store, and there are a couple of things that still hold true.” Such as? “Things like nine out of 10 people enter a store and turn to the right, because nine out of ten people are right-handed” said Marino, before pointing out that men travel more distinctly anticlockwise while women tend to “zigzag” through a store.\n“The customers in the stores I do are intelligent enough to understand that if you look out of a window and see a tree, it’s not going to keep you from buying a dress.” – Peter Marino\n“So, as an architect, your most important look is not what’s directly in front of you, it’s to the right. And those are kind of eternal things with shopping. As much as the brands like to pretend the statistics have changed, they haven’t.”\nBut the concept of the store has changed as well. “The new trend is in pop-up shops, which are experimental and are supercool,” agreed Marino. “That’s a new phenomenon in retail. And they are so colourful, they’re off the charts. But they’re ephemeral, and you can be experimental, and this is a great new freedom. What I do, with the budgets of what I do, has to last for 10 years.”\nBut the Louis Vuitton store in London last got a revamp nine years ago – even that timeline is truncating. Marc Jacobs was then artistic director at large of Louis Vuitton. The whole creative team has since shifted, and the store must showcase a large and varied range of products, including Nicolas Ghesquiere’s womenswear, Virgil Abloh’s menswear and Francesca Amfitheatrof’s fine jewellery. Marino’s solution has been to create a gallery-like space with neutral backdrops against which a range of products are displayed.\n“I’m an architect paid out of advertising budget,” said Marino, who is soft-spoken, easy-going and funny. “So my work, like advertising, is built on the statistic that of the four people who enter the shop three will leave without having bought anything. The point of my doing a beautiful store is that, aspirationally, those three people will return and become one of the purchasers next time. But it’s not about pure materialism either, because it’s a sense of beauty, of art combining with fashion, and the hundreds of hours that go into these fashion collections. And people respond to it. They really do.”\n“My work, like advertising, is built on the statistic that of the four people who enter the shop three will leave without having bought anything. The point of my doing a beautiful store is that, aspirationally, those three people will return and become one of the purchasers next time.” – Peter Marino\nCAN LUXURY STORES BE ‘LESS INTIMIDATING’?\nIn a world obsessed with experience, Marino’s stores are big on feels. But ask him whether luxury stores have become more inclusive, and he bats away the question. “It’s funny, because I never think of a store as being exclusionary, except in the case of a jewellery store which has locks on it, which is a little bit intimidating. But I’ve studied dozens of surveys and, in the end, if you do surveys of 100 people, 70 would say they find luxury stores very intimidating. So what does that really mean?”\nIt means they can’t afford it.\n\n\n #tb completed in 2004, the 10 story building for @chanelofficial wrapped a cloak of light around the 3 level retail boutique, 4th floor concert and exhibition hall, floors of offices, restaurant Beige Alain Ducasse, and multifunction rooftop garden terrace. Lighting elements were combined with steel mesh and sandwiched between layers of glass to develop the chameleon like facade. #petermarinoarchitect #petermarino #chanel #beigealainducasse #petermarinofacades #architecture #design #ginza #tokyo #japan\nA post shared by  Peter Marino (@petermarinoarchitect) on Jun 20, 2019 at 9:02am PDT\n“Thank you,” Marino nodded. “Nothing has changed in this regard. Whether you’re exclusionary, or inclusionary. I could leave the door open . . . and it wouldn’t make any difference. All of the surveys keep saying you have to be less intimidating,” he rolled his eyes. “I usually just throw it back and say: You want to be less intimidating? Why not have a 50 per cent markdown sale. You’ll be amazed by how popular you’ll become.”\nEven so, his stores are pretty popular: Contributing in no small way to the brand’s “remarkable performance” cited by the LVMH group in its third-quarter revenue report. “The average time in a store is between 30 and 40 minutes,” said Marino, returning to the numbers. “If it’s a flagship it’s up to an hour-and-a-half. If you look at the Champs Elysees, it’s unbelievably inclusive. I was there Saturday, there were whole families with five, six kids. They had no intention of buying anything at Vuitton. They all had their little Zara shopping bags, they were just like, look, we’re at Vuitton, taking pictures, being tourists, looking at the art.”\nFor Marino, shopping will always be a sensual experience. Does he worry about being extinguished by T-Mall, or other internet innovations whereby people will only shop from the comfort of their own naturally lit living rooms?\n“Human reactions are very similar,” he said. “Women still stroke the walls in my Chanel store. It’s quilted leather and they’re supposed to touch it. They’re supposed to feel that this is a special experience. You’re not going to get that pressing a button of your computer.”\n“You know I don’t have a computer,” he added, when asked if he works in competition with the web, or alongside it. “I’m totally unaware of anything. I am the original Luddite. There’s only a few of us left,” he continued. “And I’m proud of it. I want to go to the grave telling people I’ve never had a computer.”\nSo, does he see the future of the store as inviolable? “For sure. Because they define the brands more than anything. The fashion show comes and goes. There’s so many of them, so much fashion being thrown at you that the only thing you can retain is the store. It’s still the thing that best reflects the total values of the brand.”\nAnd with that, he takes his leathers and heads out. Into the light.\n“Women still stroke the walls in my Chanel store. It’s quilted leather and they’re supposed to touch it. They’re supposed to feel that this is a special experience. You’re not going to get that pressing a button of your computer.” – Peter Marino\nBy Jo Ellison © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     design ', '     Profiles ']}"

      The environmental and human cost behind cheap clothes for your children
  </h1>, 'text': 'You know that cute dress or T-shirt you just bought for your kid? The one that costs as little as a fancy mug of mocha-soy frappe latte? You may think you’ve snagged a bargain, but have you stopped to ask who’s really paying the price for those clothes?\nWhile the world has become increasingly aware of the environmental and humanitarian costs of adult fashion, it’s easy to forget that the same rings true for children’s clothes. Like the little humans who wear them, the clothes are irresistibly adorable and so of-the-moment that we can’t help but want to take them home and show them off — only to discard them three wears later.\n“When you pay cheaply for a child’s garment, somebody else is paying the price,” said Samantha Thouret Livet, the co-founder of children’s fashion brand The Extra Smile.\n“For starters, we know that there are 152 million\xa0children involved in child labour around the world and a large fraction of that number work in the fashion industry.”\nAdd to that the environmental cost. The colours, prints and fabric finishes widely used on garments are largely achieved with toxic chemicals. According to a report in The Independent, textile dyeing is the second largest polluter of clean water globally, after agriculture.\n\n\n“These chemicals also impact your health because you’re wearing them on your body. When you wash your clothes, they leech into the water and into the oceans and land,” she told CNA Lifestyle.\nLivet was recently in town to launch The Extra Smile in Singapore at The Conscious Festival. Available in Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom since last year, it will also be rolled out later this year in Ireland.\nThe idea for the brand came about when she and her business partner Heleen Devos began shopping more thoughtfully for their six-year-old daughters. “We were looking for brands that made fashionable clothes for children and that are transparent about where and how the clothes are made,” Livet explained. “But there were so few.”\nSo began their quest to build a truly ethical, sustainable and transparent fashion business. Designed by a French duo based in both Seoul and Paris, garments from The Extra Smile are made from sustainable materials such as Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified cotton fabrics from India, cotton embroideries from Thailand, recycled polyester threads from Vietnam and upcycled sequins from the Sustainable Sequin Company in London.\nThe clothes, which are made for both boys and girls ages three to eight, are put together by fair workshops in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, namely Pour un Sourire d’Enfant Sewing Workshop and Fairsew, which guarantee safe working conditions and decent wages for their employees. The former, a non-government organisation, also provides education and training to its employees, while the latter offers strict manufacturing standards that it deems environmentally friendly.\n\n\nTo prevent overproduction and textile waste – in Singapore, for instance, textile waste output increased from 150,800 tonnes in 2017 to 219,800 tonnes in 2018\xa0– the company produces their collections in small batches. For a six-month period, they are producing a total of just 400 garments.\n“What we do takes a lot of time and effort, from finding the right partners and auditing the factories and suppliers,” said Livet. “That’s why we call it slow fashion. There are so many consequences that other people and the environment suffer when you buy a cheap garment, so our message is, buy less but choose better.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     sustainability ', '     children ']}"

      It’s all in the jeans: From faded to flares, how denim is dominating fashion
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Givenchy’s invitation to its Spring/Summer 2020 show arrived in hotel rooms across Paris, there was an element of surprise. Instead of the typical sleek, gold-embossed missive, there was a square of acid-washed denim with fringing. It seemed a little . . . casual.\nFast-forward to the Givenchy show, and designer Clare Waight Keller made denim a mainstay. There were loose, low-slung jeans with bleached-out patches or rips and holes at the knee; skirts with the back pockets at the front, and a coat dress with one side in a pale wash and the other a mid blue. Did this last piece tip too far towards the infamous 2001 image of Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake in matching, head-to-toe denim ensembles? Perhaps that look is ripe for fashion rehab.\n\n\nWaight Keller, who was wearing ripped jeans with a smart blue silk blouse before the show, explained that the material was all taken from 1990s jeans that were deconstructed and repurposed. “Even as a luxury fashion house we can take steps to be more sustainable,” she said, “and actually you can still wear something from the 1990s; you just have to reinterpret it.” Unless you are a disciple of Marie Kondo-style wardrobe clear-outs, you probably have similar looks in your life already.\nGivenchy was by no means the only label to offer high-end jeans. While there were a multitude of trends to come out of Paris, from puffed sleeves to shorts suits, denim stood out as the most likely theme to slot straight into wardrobes. Skinny jeans reigned supreme for almost two decades before losing their cachet several years ago, but no one style is yet to take their place. As we enter a new fashion decade, what did other designers have to say about how we will be doing denim in the 2020s?\n\n\nAt Balenciaga, Demna Gvasalia walked the high wire between ideas of good and bad taste with a normcore, boot-cut dad jean, which will require expert styling to look edgy. He also showed silky tops and trousers printed with trompe l’oeil denim jacket and jeans, which was witty, but again, not necessarily go-to weekend wear.\nStella McCartney suggested stonewashed jeans with obvious seams, as well as a split-front skirt. At Chanel, Virginie Viard offered high-waisted blue jeans with a pleated front and Isabel Marant showed all-American farmworker dungarees. At Saint Laurent, Anthony Vaccarello even proposed that denim could be eveningwear, pairing knee-length cut-offs with a velvet jacket.\n\n\nAt Celine, super long, faded mid-blue 1970s style flares, paired with a white blouse, navy blazer or paisley jacket, appeared on more than 30 per cent of looks (yes, I’ve done the math). Hedi Slimane is well known for setting the denim agenda – he was instrumental in popularising skinnies – so if he decrees that faded flares are de rigueur we are going to be seeing more of them.\nOr maybe we should all be seeking some self-determination with our denim. Lydia King, fashion and buying director at Harrods, said, “Denim has been devoid of a specific trend for some time, which means anything goes – reworked or clean, slim or wide.” She added, “the mood is downplayed and confident – it’s for the wearer to decide how it should be worn next season.”\nBy Carola Long © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     women ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

But you can easily click on ready-to-wear items, leather goods, shoes, accessories like watches and fine jewellery, luggage and fragrances\xa0to add to your cart.\nThe best thing about the service is that there is complimentary same-day, or next-day, delivery, from Mondays to Saturdays. For same-day deliveries, the caveat is that you must place your orders before 12pm. Your purchase will then be delivered between 4pm to 9pm. For next-day deliveries, orders must be placed before 5pm the day prior.\nSay Saturday rolls around and you need a new outfit for a night out on the town. Place your orders while you are at brunch and it can be dropped off in time for you to shimmy into a new ensemble.\nOr say you have forgotten your other half’s birthday and need a gift urgently. You can save yourself a whole lot of explaining, as long as you remember to order before noon. You can even customise the gift to make it extra special, and seem like you went the extra mile.\nThe French luxury brand\xa0is offering complimentary personalisation services: Hot stamping or engraving. With the former, you can stamp up to three letters on items like luggage tags, small leather goods or agendas. With the latter, you can engrave a set of initials or a date onto a Les Parfums bottle\xa0– handy when it comes to commemorating a special occasion.\nThis being Louis Vuitton, your friendly delivery guy will not be riding up on an e-scooter (which, in any case, is now banned from footpaths). Vuitton’s White Glove Service means he will be dapperly turned out in a suit. For the environmentally conscious, know that the deliveries are undertaken using 100 per cent electric vehicles.\n\n\nDeliveries are not available on Sundays and public holidays, though the Click and Collect option allows you to pick up your swag at the Ngee Ann City boutique (you will receive a notification once it is ready).\nOr you could sit back and Netflix.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     e-commerce ', '     Singapore ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      Big Bang’s G-Dragon reveals new sneakers collaboration with Nike
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s been only 10 days since Big Bang leader, G-Dragon, was discharged from his compulsory military training on Oct 26 and he’s already busy with his first official engagement. \xa0\nThe 31-year-old star, whose real name is Kwon Ji-yong, has announced a collaboration with Nike on a new pair of sneakers – the Nike Air Force 1 Para-Noise.\nHe said of the collaboration: ""Ever since I came across hip-hop as a kid, AF1 has had a meaning greater than just shoes. I couldn’t afford them, so I would always pass the Nike store and admire them with my eyes and heart only. For those who loved hip-hop culture, oversized clothes, hats and matching-coloured AF1s was the uniform.""\nAccording to Hypebeast, the shoes feature a premium leather upper painted over with a special black coating\xa0that wears away slowly to reveal hidden artwork created by the star himself.\nThe low-cut AF1 shoes will launch on Nov 23. You can get your hands on them\xa0locally at Dover Street Market Singapore for S$279.\n\n\nThe singer said in a separate statement: “I hope this will be the start of a revolutionary style that respects various perspectives, circumstances, and preferences, bringing together Nike’s Air Force 1, which has become a cultural icon across all generations, and my identity that has been shaped by many experiences.”\nG-Dragon recently completed almost two years of mandatory military service. He told fans who were gathered at the South Korean Army\'s Ground Operations Command in Yongin, southeast of Seoul upon his release: “I have returned after successfully wrapping up my mandatory military service and I want to thank you all for waiting for me, and also thank you for coming today. Now that I am no longer a soldier, I will return to my career as a singer and give my best efforts.”\nBig Bang was formed in 2006 with five original members. They are now a four-man band after Seungri left in March following several scandals over sexual and financial misconduct.\n', 'related_topics': ['     K-pop ', '     Trending ', '     Entertainment ', '     celebrity ', '     Music ', '     fashion ']}"

      Ladies, no need for too much flash: These are the best timepieces for daily use
  </h1>, 'text': 'There is no lack of grandiose high jewellery, high complication timepieces for women. Precious stones in every imaginable colour, exotic materials, technically impressive functions – there’s never been a better time for the modern woman to enjoy mechanical watchmaking.\nBut those million-dollar masterpieces aren’t exactly practical for everyday wear, so we’re here to highlight the watches that don’t need excessive flash to be feminine, and are perfect for any occasion.\n\n\nBVLGARI SERPENTI SEDUTTORI\nIt speaks to Bulgari’s creativity that its Serpenti collection is still able to evolve after countless interpretations of the brand’s iconic snake motif. There have been profoundly elaborate high jewellery pieces, but we’re partial to this year’s much more wearable Serpenti Seduttori. The collection focuses on gold – white, yellow and rose – and it works beautifully in showing off the hexagonal, scale-like bracelet links.\n\n\nBREGUET CLASSIQUE 9068\nWhen the blueprint is as clean and simple as Breguet’s Classique, details are everything. The Classique Ref. 9068 is more than just another round watch with diamonds. The fluted case middle, perfectly distanced lugs and the one-size-seems-to-fit-all 33.5mm diameter are a pleasure on the wrist, as is the moderately sized Roman numerals, blued steel hands and engine-turned guilloche dial. A more feminine mother of pearl dial version is also available, but all versions are set with 88 brilliant-cut diamonds.\nCARTIER BAIGNOIRE ALLONGEE\nAlways one to make a statement with daring shapes, Cartier has done it again with this year’s new Baignoire Allongee. The “elongated bathtub” case now features a dramatic three-tiered geometric texture that wraps around a sandblasted silver dial. It is available in yellow, white and rose gold, and in medium (47mm x 21mm) or extra large (52mm x 23mm). Those who just want the shape without the modern mood can opt for the more conventional diamond-bezelled versions.\n\n\nCHANEL PREMIERE ROCK INTENSE BLACK\nInspired by such timeless forms as the Place Vendome and the Chanel No. 5 bottle stopper, Chanel’s Premiere watches have never had trouble exuding dignity. Which is what makes the attitude-infused Premiere Rock Intense Black such a fun deviation. The black ADLC-coated triple chain interlaced with black calfskin and\xa0 smooth lacquer dial is thoroughly rock-chic, but not inappropriate for fancier ‘dos. Limited to 1,000 pieces.\n\n\nGIRARD-PERREGAUX CAT’S EYE MAJESTIC AVENTURINE\nAventurine’s natural golden spangles make it ideal for depicting the night sky in moon phase complications, but it seems a waste to restrict its sparkle to a tiny window. So we’re thrilled that Girard-Perregaux has been heavy handed with the glass in its 2019 Cat’s Eye models. We’re especially fond of the time-only Cat’s Eye Majestic Aventurine. Featuring a pink gold case and matching blue alligator strap, it’s like a miniature diamond-studded galaxy on the wrist.\nGRAND SEIKO ELEGANCE COLLECTION STGK013\nNot quite tonneau-shaped and lacking a bezel, the Grand Seiko STGK011 that join’s Grand Seiko’s women’s collection isn’t the most conventional design. Based on the similarly bezel-free 62GS from 1967, this timepiece has been recalibrated for femininity with an elongated and curved case in stainless steel flanked with diamonds. The deep purple of the mother of pearl dial is known as Koki-murasaki and the shade was considered a symbol of status in ancient Japan.\n\n\nJAQUET DROZ LADY 8 PETITE MALACHITE\nThough Jaquet Droz is always busy dreaming up new automaton watches to dazzle and impress, the watchmaker hasn’t forgotten the ladies. The Lady 8 Petite, a downsized version of the figure-eight-inspired women’s collection launched last year, welcomes a vibrant malachite dial – a material symbolically associated with abundance. Both the dial and the moving malachite bead that forms the top part of the case are encircled by 18K red gold set with 68 diamonds.\nJLC REVERSO ONE DUETTO \nHaving options is always a bonus. On top of the customisation choices available to Jaeger-LeCoultre’s famous Reverso watches, many have two faces with two completely different looks. The new Reverso One Duetto carries on the tradition with one side showing hours and minutes on a silver sun ray guilloche dial, while the other features a more glamorous glittering lacquer dial. On rose gold models, the second dial will be in burgundy while the stainless steel models will have blue dials. Both are decorated with 56 diamonds and come with leather straps to match.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     jewellery ', '     women ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      In the business of love, spontaneous marriage proposals are a regular affair 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Ah, to be in the business of love. And who better to create exquisite jewellery to celebrate the one emotion that inspires the most enchanting poetry and songs ever written, than a romantic at heart?\nCaroline Scheufele, Co-president and Artistic Director of Chopard, believes that the purchase of jewellery is often “an emotional decision.” Much more than, say, buying a car. “A car may also be a luxury product where you choose the brand, the colour, the leather… but at the end of the day, it’s still a means of transport.”\nScheufele, therefore, designs for the emotion it conjures.\n“Women are looking for more than just a beautiful gem; they’re looking for a story they can connect with emotionally,” she told CNA Luxury.\nIn its 159 years, the maison has mastered the art of storytelling through its extraordinary selection of creations, each expressing a creative narrative through high quality raw materials, peerless technical artistry, and, the occasional quirk.\nScheufele has spent three and a half decades understanding women and their desire for all things resplendent, ever since she designed the very first jewellery piece for Chopard in 1985.\nPreferences for jewels and gems may evolve with the trends but, for Scheufele, it always comes back to love.\n“Women are looking for more than just a beautiful gem; they’re looking for a story they can connect with emotionally.” – Caroline Scheufele\nFOR THE LOVE FOR BEAUTY\nLove was the central theme for the Red Carpet Collection 2019, which graced the Cannes Film Festival (Chopard has been its official partner since 1998). Several pieces in the collection were showcased at an exclusive private dinner held for ultra high net worth clients at The St Regis Singapore on Tuesday (Oct 29).\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Chopard Official (@chopard)\nThere were necklaces, bracelets, earrings, rings, brooches and jewellery watches; some embellished with classical white diamonds and others in full multi-coloured magnificence, ornamented with rare precious stones.\nAs the evening shimmered with cascades of Paraiba tourmalines, amethysts, emeralds, sapphires, opals, rubies and tanzanites, one majestic beauty stood apart in all its gasp-worthy glory: The Garden of Kalahari collection, created from a 342-carat diamond of perfect colour and absolute purity.\n“The Kalahari is a very special story that’s very close to my heart because I followed the Queen of Kalahari diamond from A to Z; from the 342-carat rough diamond in the mine – it was a woman who found it – to the cutting, the designing, and to the red carpet,” shared Sheufele.\nThe Queen of Kalahari diamond, which Mother Nature had birthed and nurtured underground more than a billion years ago, then gave rise to a set of 23 diamonds that combines the best D-colour with F-grade flawless clarity.\nAmong these 23 diamonds, five are over 20 carats, each beautifully rendered in the main cut-stone shapes – cushion, brilliant, heart, emerald and pear – under the care of Chopard’s atelier artisans, and further fashioned into extraordinary expressions of Scheufele’s creativity.\n“It’s like a family. I could’ve sold each one of them many times separately but I don’t want to separate the family. I’m not in a hurry (to sell them) so the Kalahari is with me,” she said. The set is reportedly worth US$75 million (S$102 million).\n\n\nA post shared by Chopard Official (@chopard)\nSTYLE AND SUSTAINABILITY\nScheufele welcomes us to her hotel suite dressed in a black laced gown sans sleeves. It’s a simple ensemble to allow her jewellery and accessories to shine, yet elegant enough for the soiree later that evening.\nExquisite emerald earrings dangle from her lobe, curiously matched with a cross and rosary around her neck. On her right wrist, multiple charm bracelets including one bearing the Turkish nazar believed to ward off the evil eye (“I’m very superstitious,” she disclosed) and a jade bangle fight for attention alongside Chopard’s new Alpine Eagle men’s watch.\n\n\n“[It’s] to support my brother”, she said, referring to her co-president, Karl-Friedrich, who presides over Chopard’s L.U.C collection of watches.\nThe new collection is crafted in lucent steel, said to be just as precious as gold, and is antiallergenic and therefore comparable in quality to surgical steel with a durable and incandescent quality unlike any other metal.\nIt’s also REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals)-certified and ethically-produced, in line with Chopard’s sustainability initiatives as part of the company’s Journey to Sustainable Luxury programme.\nThis includes a commitment to only use 100 per cent ethical gold in all its products beginning last year, defined as gold that comes from either artisanal small-scale mines that participate in the Swiss Better Gold Association’s Fairmined and Fairtrade programmes, or gold sourced with the Responsible Jewellery Council’s (RJC) Chain of Custody certification, through Chopard’s partnership with RJC-certified refineries.\nThe brand has even launched an ethical perfume collection, made with raw materials and ingredients that have been fair harvested.\n\n\n“It’s really time that everybody does what we can to save our planet. We have to be more conscious about what we do and how we do it,” Scheufele stressed.\nCould this translate to consuming less – even in the world of luxury?\n“Yes, I think the buying has changed,” she said. “Better quality is always a recommendation and less is more – whether it’s jewellery or fashion.”\nThis advice, unsurprisingly, works out pretty well for the high jewellery business, though it’s a segment that tends to be rooted in a culture of gifting.\n“I find that women are buying beautiful items for themselves more nowadays but it’s usually a timepiece or a designer dress. The high jewellery world was a step they didn’t take because it was more associated with gifting,” she observed.\nWhile she acknowledges that this is slowly changing, she believes some traditions ought to remain.\n“At the end of the day, if a guy comes to you with a beautiful box and you find a nice diamond inside… this will never change over generations,” said Scheufele, ever the romantic.\n“It’s really time that everybody does what we can to save our planet. We have to be more conscious about what we do and how we do it.” – Caroline Scheufele\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     jewellery ', '     Singapore ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     Profiles ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Want to look photo-ready on vacation? Here's how to pack for Instagram
  </h1>, 'text': 'Perhaps you know how to pack (edit ruthlessly, use packing cubes) and how to take vacation photos (remember to take advantage of the golden hour).\nBut which outfits both travel effortlessly and make for enviable posts on social media?\nThe answer combines colour coordination, personal style, destination mindfulness and knowing what pops on Instagram.\nYOUR SETTING INFORMS YOUR PALETTE\nPreparation is key to Insta-worthy travel photos, said the fashion stylist Rasaan Wyzard. “I think ahead about my environment when I travel,” he said, “where I am going, and what I’m going to wear.”\nColours matter, and a short cut to standout photos is to choose clothes that contrast with your destination’s colour scheme. For poolside photos, bright red, orange, white or hot pink are better choices for swimsuits or cover-ups than blue, to better stand out against the colour of the water. For settings with warmer tones, like the brown of the desert or beach, try jewel tones, deep blues and whites.\nDarker clothes will get lost in the lush greens and shadows of a forest. For a vacation in Bali, Mr Wyzard said he was planning on wearing neon or a bright, printed shirt on a hike, “like I could be an exotic flower amongst the greenery.”\nKNOW WHAT LOOKS BEST – ON YOU AND AT THE SITE\nReview your past travel photos to see which clothing or colours work best. If you’re not sure about some pieces, practice photos can show you how they translate to the small screen.\nCheck out what works at the site too, by following the destination’s hashtags.\nMarco Milani, a fashion stylist who specialises in celebrity dressing, says in a hectic cityscape, a timeless coat can add a note of quiet.\n“The city is already a busy place,” he said, don’t make it busier with what you’re wearing.\nSunglasses can be an important accessory, providing insurance against closed eyes, dark circles and the need for eye makeup. Bring a couple of pairs – one with a chic black frame and another brightly coloured pair for a playful vibe. Baseball caps and sun hats can look cute, but be careful that they do not shade your face.\nTravel photos can also be tongue in cheek, Mr Wyzard said. “Heels on the beach can work if they are worn ironically or humorously,” he said.\nDestinations have their own vibe. For travellers at South Korean airports, dressing up has become a trend.\n“K-pop stars show up at the Seoul airport in statement-making outfits,” said Courtney Lee, a Duke University student who travels to South Korea to visit family. Ms Lee joins the fun by wearing something fashionable for her departure travel photos there.\nREMEMBER TO LAYER\nA flowy full-length dress in a bright color or print, or a large colorful scarf can give your photos a sense of movement and more options for posing. But if you don’t want to traipse through the jungle or a dusty city in a billowy garment, throw a light crushable one in your bag to pop over T-shirt and shorts. Or tote around two or three different coloured scarves to don if you see an Insta-worthy opportunity.\nPacking clothes that “are all in the same palette or can mix and match” give you the most options, Mr Milani said. “It’s nice to have a lot of versatility without a lot of clothes.”\nIt’s harder to vary outerwear in colder weather while minimising your packing volume, but photographs in the same ski parka every day can get a bit monotonous. Layers of sweaters, compressible puffy vests and jackets with a couple of accent beanies and neck gear can offer more variety.\nINSTA FOR TWO\nGoing to a wedding with a plus one? Choose a palette like earth tones, neutrals, pastels or blues. A colour scheme allows you to coordinate without looking too matchy.\n“As a stylist I think how we will look in a photo together,” Mr Wyzard said. “Do we look like we are going to the same place?”\nBE MINDFUL\nIt’s easy to be consciously or subconsciously influenced by celebrities’ social media accounts and trends (see duck lips), so use those feeds and these guidelines in conjunction with your own style and personality, rather than as a replacement for it.\nBe mindful as well of the history of your location. Leave your bright frocks behind when visiting somber places like memorials. “Follow customs,” Mr Wyzard said. “Don’t go into a temple with a halter top.”\nAnd in every setting, consider what your sartorial choices and pose are saying about you. Are you trying to make yourself the centre focus of a place that has been home to pivotal historical events, or are you more of a wonderful and appreciative addition to it? The latter is, of course, more #grateful #blessed.\nBy Julie Weed © 2018 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Travel ', '     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Creative Capital: Designer Wykidd Song returns with new label for new generation
  </h1>, 'text': ""Two decades ago, for Singaporean fashionistas of a certain generation, the ultimate brand to have in one’s wardrobe wasn’t anything European. It was a dress by Song+Kelly.\nThis local brand, created by Wykidd Song and Ann Kelly, and eventually acquired by Christina Ong’s Club 21, was the symbol of local style and sophistication. To own one of Wykidd’s and Ann’s ethereal dresses was to tell everyone that you cared about local design, that you had taste and that you had your finger on the pulse of society.\nSong+Kelly seemed poised for global superstardom. They were showing at New York and London fashion weeks. Their clothes were carried by Harrods, Barneys and Selfridges.\nSadly, for a variety of reasons, Song+Kelly closed down in 2007 and Wykidd, always the quieter half of the duo, seemed to recede from the spotlight. He didn’t leave the industry, through. In 2009, he was asked to design shirts for APEC’s heads of states, including United States president Barack Obama. He had his own studio, working on a number of small projects. He worked for two years in Hong Kong. And he taught.\n\n\nBut now, 12 years after Song+Kelly shuttered, Wykidd is back. Properly back, with a new label, a truly beautiful collection of clothes and a fresh perspective on the industry he’s been a part of for over 20 years. AKINN is a collaboration between Song and digital marketing agency GERMS. Pieces are already available online (https://akinn.com/). If you want to see them in person first, we suggest heading over to Boutique Fairs from Nov 15 to 17, where Wykidd will be showcasing his new label.\nIn anticipation of AKINN’s success, I caught up with the 55-year-old designer and old friend.\nWYKIDD, CONGRATULATIONS ON AKINN! PLEASE TELL US MORE ABOUT YOUR NEW LABEL.\nAKINN is a fashion label that takes inspiration from the stories of individuals and the industry at large with every collection. By combining exceptional craftsmanship, timeless design and inspiring stories, AKINN aims to cultivate responsible consumption with apparel that goes beyond trends or seasons.\nLooking ahead, our vision is to build a collaborative design platform that goes beyond fashion. We hope to bring together Singapore-based creatives and craftsmen from other design disciplines to co-create exquisite pieces that befit the sophisticated tastes of design-savvy individuals.\nCAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY COLLABORATIONS, PLEASE? ANY OF THESE COLLABORATIONS ALREADY IN THE WORKS?\nThe idea of a collaborative design platform could take the form of AKINN working with or being inspired by a celebrated personality with a distinct style, or with a designer or artist I admire, creating products at the same level of sophistication that our customers expect.Yes, I have already started work on a capsule collection designed with a dear friend who is very much an inspiration to many. It is due out next year.\nWHEN DID YOU DECIDE YOU WANTED TO START ANOTHER LABEL? OR HAD THAT ALWAYS BEEN IN THE WORKS?\nEver since I left Club 21, it had always been in the back of my head to start another womenswear label. It was just a matter of time. I had to find the right partner to collaborate with, and to understand how we can give that point of difference in the market. It has always been important to me to work with people who can inspire, and who you’d also want to spend time with.\n\n\nHOW DID YOU FIRST GET INTO FASHION DESIGN?\nI’ve always loved drawing and as a kid, my homework was always full of doodles. I started being interested in fashion when my uncle introduced me to Esquire magazine. I think I was 16. So, I went from drawing action figures to fashion figures. But it wasn’t until after the army that I really pursued fashion as a career.\nHOW SHOULD SOMEONE BREAK INTO THE INDUSTRY? WHAT ARE THE RIGHT WAYS AND WHAT ARE THE WRONG WAYS?\nTo begin with, there has to be a commitment and an innate passion for fashion. It has to be there inside you to take you through the lean years, whether you’re working for someone or you’re working on your own label.\nIf you want to be a designer, going through a course, even if it’s just a local diploma or degree, will give you an idea what is in store for you in the industry. It will not be an easy ride, especially in Singapore. We’re a very small market that has almost every fashion brand in existence already. You don’t have to have a formal education in fashion but it does prepare you a bit for what’s to come. Every little bit of information helps.\nIf you still want to be a designer after you graduate, then get a job. Don’t think about starting your own label until you have some experience. You’ll only get to focus on designing if you’re hired as a designer, so you shouldn’t start your own thing if all you want to do is design.\nI READ AN ARTICLE RECENTLY THAT ALL BUT INSINUATED THAT ITS READERS WERE TOO YOUNG TO ACTUALLY REMEMBER SONG+KELLY. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’RE NOW A PIONEER IN THE INDUSTRY OR DOES HEARING SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST MAKE YOU FEEL OLD AND ANNOYED?\nWell it is a fact that many probably have not experienced Song+Kelly, but the ones that know the brand will always remember it as timeless and enduring.\nWith AKINN, I want to communicate the brand’s vision not as a shadow of a past brand but as a progressive and relevant one, talking to new customers who appreciate the same effortless style and attention to detail and quality. And no, I don’t get annoyed if people don’t remember my past accomplishments. Through AKINN, I hope I can take them on a new journey.\nHOW HAVE CONSUMER PREFERENCES CHANGED SINCE THE DAYS WHEN YOU LAUNCHED SONG+KELLY?\xa0AKINN’s target audience is similar to the Song+Kelly customer, the sophisticated ‘boss-lady’. This is the woman that has always inspired me and my designs. She dresses to the occasion. She is someone who commands attention when she walks into a room. Her confidence precedes her because she is prepared for her day. She knows what will look good on her and that it will look effortless.\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING DIFFERENTLY WITH AKINN FROM SONG+KELLY OR THE OTHER LABELS YOU’VE WORKED ON PREVIOUSLY?\nWe started Song+Kelly primarily as a wholesale channel, selling to department stores here as well as internationally. That is not our focus anymore. I wouldn’t say we will not do it but the focus is now connecting directly with the customer. That's why we don’t push out seasonal collections anymore.\nThroughout my career, it has always been about designing 50 to 80 designs per collection, four to five collections each year, six months ahead. It can become very wasteful and we end up chasing after big number targets, which can be very prosaic with time.\nWith AKINN, we are producing very focused, small capsule collections of six to eight styles each time.\nAKINN is also about creating designs with a different person and telling that person’s inspiring story. We have a story to tell in each presentation, whether it is about my wonderful factory lady or the lovely and creative friends we have lined up for future collaborations.\nHaving a great story is one thing, but bringing that story out to the consumer is another. That's also what I learnt from my days at Song+Kelly. AKINN is set up in partnership with the marketing consultancy firm GERMS. That helps so much. The wonderful, young and energetic team from GERMS is tasked to navigate our way through the digital landscape. This allows me to focus more on design and connecting with my customers. Their capabilities meant I could get AKINN off the ground in less than half the time I would have taken to do it by myself.\nHOW HAS THE FASHION SCENE IN GENERAL CHANGED OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CURRENT CROP OF DESIGNERS?\nThe landscape has changed dramatically since the 90s, when I started. Digital and mobile platforms have turned the industry upside down. That has totally democratised fashion. The fashion hierarchy and royalty now has to rewrite its front row list every year. The Barneys and Vogues of the world are slowly relinquishing their power seats to influencers. Brands don’t have to rely on the media to reach their customers. Through platforms like Instagram, brands can create their own front covers every other day. It is revolutionary, to say the least. A lot of our young designers who are digitally savvy know this so well. Because of this, you see more successful Singapore brands now than ever before. I believe this can only augur well for our industry as a whole.\nDO YOUNG DESIGNERS TODAY HAVE AN EASIER TIME GETTING STARTED THAN YOU DID?\nIn many ways, it is easier to get started than it was back in the 90s. There are templates for everything, from business plans to online shopfronts. You can sell to Scandinavia without leaving your Singapore studio. But still, there is no template or shortcut for originality, creativity and craft. So while it might be easier to get started, it is not easier trying to stay in.\nLOOKING BACK AT YOUR CAREER, CAN YOU PICK OUT THREE HIGHLIGHTS OR THREE MOMENTS THAT YOU ARE SUPER PROUD OF?\nOur 1997 Song+Kelly flagship store in Ngee Ann City, our partnership with Club21 and my designs for the 2009 APEC leaders’ outfits.\nHOW DO YOU STAY MOTIVATED? WHAT CONTINUES TO INSPIRE YOU AND DRIVE YOU FORWARD?\nThe need to learn and to create, the stories I want to tell, the people I want to work with, in an environment I strive for – any one of these factors pushes me forward.\nPEOPLE OFTEN SAY THAT THE BEST LESSONS ARE THOSE LEARNT AFTER MAKING MISTAKES OR FAILING. WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSON THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED AFTER A TOUGH EXPERIENCE OR A MISCALCULATION?\nStanding up for what I believe in.\nI READ SOMEWHERE THAT THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CURRENT CLIMATE CRISIS. HOW DO YOU CREATE NEW CLOTHES AND STAY RESPONSIBLE?\nActually, fashion as an industry is the second biggest polluter in the world, the first being the energy industry. The way we treat the earth and people concerns me, and it should concern everyone. AKINN will do its little part to educate and to affirm social and eco consciousness, present products that have a story behind them, solve a problem and help consume less, have less waste in our creative and production processes, and use less material for packaging. If we can achieve this and educate our followers, then we will be very proud of the little steps we are taking. My mantra has always been, “Buy smart, buy less”. I always believe a well-designed product improves lives and is timeless.\nIS BEING A CREATIVE IN SINGAPORE TOUGH?\nI find just as much inspiration in Singapore as I would in New York City, Hong Kong or London. You just have to be in the right place with the right people.\nWHAT’S THE BEST ADVICE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN?\n‘Just do it’, the famous Nike slogan coined by Dan Wieden. I love that.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Sparkling diamonds and heavenly bodies: How to let your inner star shine
  </h1>, 'text': 'But it was not just Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel who was obsessed with the stars. Countless women have shared her passion, thanks in large part to the many stunning creations from the\xa0Chanel Comete fine jewellery\xa0collection over the years. At the centre of this collection is a motif symbolic of Chanel’s universe – the five-point star with a sparkling trail that marks it as a precious piece from a dazzling meteor shower.\nThe beginnings of Comete can be traced all the way back to 1932 when Chanel put on display her very first\xa0high jewellery creations\xa0in Paris. The exhibition, titled\xa0Bijoux de\xa0Diamants\xa0and legendary for its extravagance and boundary-pushing creativity back then, was largely inspired by stars and comets.\n\n\nStars, of course, held a special meaning in Chanel’s heart and were a reminder of the Aubazine orphanage in France, where she spent six years of her formative adolescence. Every morning, she went to mass at the abbey, walking across a long corridor paved with polished pebbles arranged in geometric patterns.\nAmong these patterns were the stars that left evidence of their influence on Chanel, as seen in the many fashion creations she had produced in the subsequent chapters of her life. And it is also why she famously said: “I wanted to cover women with constellations. Stars! Stars of all sizes.”\xa0\nTo this day, stars continue to be a key theme in the maison’s fine jewellery lines and are highlighted alongside other important icons of the house such as the lion and the camellia. While the camellia may appeal to those who are drawn to all things feminine, and the lion is for those who have a taste for the bold and unusual, the star is undoubtedly for romantic dreamers who believe in wishing upon a shooting star.\n\n\nBut while it may remind one of secret fantasies, the Comete collection channels a distinctly modern vibe that shines through clearly in the latest additions to the line. This is particularly felt in the asymmetric earrings that pair together two different designs in a set, providing a refreshing and bold way of wearing fine jewellery.\nAlso prominent in the seven additions to the collection is the prevalent use of the chevron pattern, a graphic motif that was first used by Chanel in her Bijoux\xa0de\xa0Diamants high jewellery collection in 1932. Eagle-eyed Chanel buffs will recognise the pattern to be a prominent feature in some of its fashion items such as the Boy Chanel and flap bags.\n\n\nElsewhere among the new releases, interesting combinations of materials are also seen –we are struck by the alluring pieces that bring together white and yellow gold, as well as diamonds with pearls.\nThe single ear cuff has also caught our eye with its shooting star motif that gives it a slight punk appeal, while retaining its feminine aesthetics with its use of diamonds and pearls. As with the original Chanel Comete collection, the new additions are for individuals, who are not afraid to challenge style conventions and shine bright in their own ways. We are certain that you would wholeheartedly agree.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      Out at Robertson Quay? Cartier's pop-up has a cafe and personalised haikus
  </h1>, 'text': 'Singapore is a city of contrasts – East-meets-West, traditional but hyper-modern at the same time. So it’s perhaps fitting that Cartier is installing its Clash de Cartier Studio here, its first in Southeast Asia after debuting in Paris in April. Part-pretty, part-punk, and possibly bipolar, the Clash de Cartier collection is all about contradictions.\n\n\nEchoing the Paris launch, the pop-up at STPI from November 15 to 17, 2019 will feature similar themes of literature, music and art. And, being in Singapore, there will also be subtle local touches woven into the interactive displays and activities.\nOn entry, visitors must choose if they wish to begin their journey exploring literature – in the Bookstore – or music – in the Record Store. Red pill or blue pill? You decide.\nLit majors and bookworms who will inevitably gravitate towards the Bookstore will find a selection of tomes that explore contradictions in genres, content and themes. They can also take a simple personality test to determine their\xa0alter ego (fun!), which will be translated into a personalised Haiku poem crafted by Haiku poets stationed in the room (more fun!). These will then be typed out on a typewriter as a memento.\nAudiophiles and music lovers who find themselves in the Record Store can play around with sound showers installed in the room. These will pipe a playlist put together by sound designer Michel Gaubert, who produces fashion show soundtracks for Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Loewe, Valentino and others. In the spirit of the pop-up, the playlist will be suitably clashing, with classical scores juxtaposed alongside rock anthems, for example. If you like the playlist, you can scan the Spotify code and add it to your own account.\nPhew! All that exploring is exhausting. Well, take a break in the Cafe and enjoy your complimentary Clash pastry and drink. But you’ll have to decide where to sit: Go local in the stylish, contemporary kopitiam-inspired half of the cafe, or keep it sleek in the metallic-tinged, Euro-inspired other half. A DJ will be on the decks from 6pm to 9pm to get you pumped for a night out.\nClash de Cartier Studio\nWhere: STPI Creative Workshop & Gallery, 41 Robertson Quay, Singapore 238236\nWhen: November 15 to 17, 2019\nTime: 11am to 9pm (last entry at 8pm)\nAdmission: Free\nRegistration: clashdecartier.sg/register\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     jewellery ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ']}"

      Why did the CEO of Audemars Piguet send his staff for military training?
  </h1>, 'text': 'How many CEOs do you know send their staff to train under former US Navy SEALs? Thankfully, Francois-Henry Bennahmias did, before Audemars Piguet’s new Code 11.59 collection was unveiled at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) in January.\nIn preparation for its launch, the straight-talking CEO known for his dynamic and bold management style sent Audemars Piguet personnel to Oman where they were subjected to gruelling physical exercises in 45°C heat.\n\n\n“They were doing push-ups and sit-ups and once they were out of breath, the ex-SEALs would yell questions about Code 11.59 close to their face to see how would they would maintain their composure. If they made a mistake, they had to go back to push-ups,” said Bennahmias, himself not an ex-military man, but who professes to be “very organised”.\nIt appears the former pro golfer may have had a foreboding of the tempest in store the moment the world laid eyes on the then-new collection.\n“When we opened the first day of SIHH, we got bombarded with negative things on social media,” he recalled. “I wasn’t surprised that we got bad comments; I was surprised at how aggressive people were – but we were ready for it.”\n\n\nThe brand was swiftly and brutally vilified online, with calls for the 55-year-old CEO to even be removed from his post. Bloomberg, meanwhile, likened the new collection to “Chanel opening a pop-up store in a discount supermarket”.\nWhy so much hate?\nFor starters, critics accused of the brand of being unimaginative.\nAt a glance, Code 11.59 sits in a (mostly) round case, in contrast to the signature profile of an octagonal bezel on the Royal Oak, which, at the time of its launch in 1972, helped catapult Audemars Piguet into the pantheon of modern watchmaking, thus cementing its cult favourite status since.\n\n\nCode 11.59, however, does not quite embody the same kind of disruptive design DNA associated with a celebrated iconoclast.\nTo the untrained eye, it does feel a little… safe. And therefore somewhat ironic given that “Code” is an acronym said to evoke the brand’s mission to Challenge (the limits of craftsmanship) Own (its roots and legacy), Dare (to follow firm convictions) and Evolve (to never stand still).\nThat said, one could also consider the decision to deviate from the expected a brave gamble aligned with the abovementioned ethos.\nTo pacify brand loyalists, perhaps, the octagon makes a cameo – sandwiched in the middle of the case instead; a subtle inclusion that creates a more complex profile while offering the manufacture the opportunity to showcase its exceptional mastery of craftsmanship with a mix of brushed and polished finishes.\n\n\nA post shared by Audemars Piguet (@audemarspiguet)\n“People ask why we have to include something related to the Royal Oak. The answer is because you cannot achieve different types of finishes on a circle. You need angles and the angles allow us to show the depth and quality of our finishes. We didn’t play it easy,” Bennahmias insisted.\nCode 11.59 has been touted as one of the most important launches in the history of Audemars Piguet, not least of which to demonstrate that the company stands for more than just the Royal Oak.\nAnd it has, 13 times over, with as many references in its debut collection. These include six complications: date and time; chronograph; perpetual calendar; open-work and flying tourbillons; and supersonnerie minute repeater.\nTo further showcase its savoir-faire and technical prowess, the 144-year-old manufacture has also created three new self-winding calibres just for this collection: Calibre 4302 with date function; Calibre 4401 flyback chronograph with 70 hours of power reserve; and Calibre 2950, the company’s first automatic movement to incorporate a flying tourbillon and central rotor.\nAccording to Bennahmias, only 2,000 pieces of Code 11.59 (out of the brand’s total annual production capped at 40,000 for the past five years) will be produced for 2019, and that figure will double in 2020.\n“A lot of people came at us hard initially, and a lot of people defended us hard. In the end, the market is the judge,” he said.\nPutting things into perspective, he added: “If social media existed in 1972 when we launched the Royal Oak, good luck. People would have destroyed us at that time.”\n“If social media existed in 1972 when we launched the Royal Oak, good luck. People would have destroyed us at that time.” – Francois Bennahmias\nNOT YOUR TYPICAL CEO\nBennahmias is not your typical CEO. He has worked for Audemars Piguet for 25 years, the last seven of which spent in the CEO seat. And his quick wit and trademark sense of humour, bordering on the sardonic, is on display for much of the interview.\n“People expect the CEO of Audemars Piguet to be older or not as funny… I say, come on, life is about being celebrated,” he offered, in a rich baritone.\nYou won’t find him in the traditional suit-and-tie uniformed look of most CEOs of luxury brands, either. Rather, a leather jacket and matching sneakers carrying a Berluti label is more his style.\nIt’s a less formal look, which, Bennahmias believes, reflects the evolving demographic of today’s luxury customer.\n“We see a lot of young people – men and women – coming to the luxury world. We see that the codes of luxury are completely changing; you don’t always have to wear a three-piece suit and be so perfect to host an event. It’s more about how you’re gonna create an experience and make it fun for the customer,” he said.\n“We see a lot of young people – men and women – coming to the luxury world. We see that the codes of luxury are completely changing; you don’t always have to wear a three-piece suit and be so perfect to host an event.” – Francois Bennahmias\nAudemars Piguet, he says, is a very serious brand that doesn’t take itself so seriously.\n“When you reach a level of wealth that allows you entry into this world, you’re allowed to have fun. Just because it’s luxury doesn’t mean it has to be ostentatious or pretentious.”\nThis philosophy appears to be both on-point and personified in Code 11.59, as Bennahmias says the product has also been attracting a new and younger clientele to the brand.\n“About 50 per cent of the new customers we’re getting are of an average age between 25 and 35 years old,” he observed.\nAnother unexpected upside from the development of Code 11.59? The military-style preparations served to improved business operations all round.\n“It’s challenging the way we’ve been running the business, and everything we’ve done for 11.59 is teaching us lessons about how to do our job better for the Royal Oak, the Millenary, the Royal Oak Offshore collections. It brings additional experience and knowledge that we didn’t have before,” he explained.\nWhile Audemars Piguet will be noticeably missed at SIHH next year as the brand is pulling out for strategic reasons, it does intend to hold its own private events for retailers and customers in conjunction with the opening of its highly-anticipated museum next April.\nWe can’t help but wonder if Bennahmias will be redeploying those ex-Navy SEALs for another tour of duty before the night at the museum.\n“When you reach a level of wealth that allows you entry into this world, you’re allowed to have fun. Just because it’s luxury doesn’t mean it has to be ostentatious or pretentious.” – Francois Bennahmias\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     investment ', '     Singapore ', '     Men ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     Profiles ', '     Accessories ']}"

      The best men’s dress watches for business functions, black tie events and more
  </h1>, 'text': 'These days you could strap on a chunky sports watch with a tuxedo and still get away with looking rebel-chic, but there are just some occasions that require the refinement and dignity of a dressier timepiece. Conventional thinking often dictates these watches should be slim, keep additional functions to a minimum and generally not aim to overpower your outfit, but where’s the fun in that? Balance is key, as the year’s classiest novelties show.\nBEST FOR BUSINESS FUNCTIONS: H. MOSER VENTURER CONCEPT BLUE LAGOON\nH. Moser has been known to release some bizarre, tongue-in-cheek watches (this year it was the Nature Watch, adorned with real plants), but the brand’s true strength stems from pure and minimal designs. Which is why the Venturer Concept Blue Lagoon is what you’ll want when you’re heading into the boardroom.\nThe Concept line is defined by having very little on the dial – just the hour and minute hands in this case – but beautiful fume dials keep it from looking plain. It’s a smart, no-fuss watch, which is the attitude you want to see in a board meeting, and has the added benefit of not being so recognisable that your co-workers wonder how many zeroes are in your package instead of focusing on the task at hand. So yes, that means leaving your Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711 at home.\n\n\nBEST FOR BLACK TIE EVENTS: A. LANGE & SOHNE RICHARD LANGE JUMPING SECONDS\nThe trick to pulling off modern black tie is in sticking to the traditional rules that matter (keep most things black and restrained) while playing with the details (coloured cummerbunds, anyone?). This absolutely applies to your accessories as well, which is why we’ve chosen A. Lange & Sohne’s Richard Lange Jumping Seconds.\nThe regulator style dial is steeped in history and deliciously uncommon, but the third iteration of this watch brings it into the 21st century with a black dial and just the tiniest hint of red. The calibre L094.1, which combines the jumping seconds function with a constant-force remontoir d’egalite and zero-reset mechanism, is cased in white gold, so get the right cufflinks to match.\nBEST FOR WHITE TIE EVENTS: BOVET TOURBILLON AMADEO FLEURIER VIRTUOSO IX\nThe white tie dress code sits at the pinnacle of menswear formality and thus allows few deviations. A white shirt, white tie (obviously) and evening tailcoat are a must, but the jury’s still out on whether a wristwatch is acceptable. If you or your host are particularly finicky about 18th century dress codes, go with a pocket watch.\nBovet unveiled the stunning Tourbillon Amadeo Fleurier Virtuoso IX at its inaugural SIHH this year and its signature convertible system allows the reversible wristwatch to turn into a pocket watch (as well as a pendant watch or table clock). It also packs a lavish set of complications: Double-facing flying tourbillon, dual time zone, outsized date and a 10-day power reserve.\nBEST FOR WEARING ON HOLIDAY: BLANCPAIN VILLERET GMT DATE\nIt’s understandable that a function as useful and travel-friendly as a GMT tends to be found in sports watches that are brawny enough to take the traveller anywhere. But travel watches can be dressy too, as Blancpain proves with the addition of a GMT to its highly classic Villeret collection.\nThe Villeret GMT Date features a 24-hour scale that works with a red-tipped GMT hand, and an unobtrusive date window at 3 o’clock. The red gold model comes with an opaline dial while the stainless steel one has a white dial, but the designs and colour schemes are wonderfully graceful either way. Both models are available with an alligator or matching miolle mailles metal bracelet.\xa0 \xa0\nBEST FOR AN OFF-DUTY (BUT STILL CLASSY) LOOK: JAEGER-LECOULTRE REVERSO TRIBUTE DUOFACE FAGLIANO\nJaeger-LeCoultre’s Reverso Duoface makes an excellent traveller’s watch, it’s true, but the fact that it allows two looks in one snazzy Art Deco package should also make it a solid contender for a weekend ticker.\nThis year’s Reverso Tribute Duoface Fagliano Limited brings rose gold, blue and silver together with leather straps from renowned polo boot-maker Casa Fagliano. The main dial is a trendy blue with sun ray-brushed finish and small seconds sub dial, while its second face holds more old-fashioned appeal with its Clous de Paris guilloche and inverted figure-eight sections. The verso side also has an additional day/night indicator. Limited to 100 pieces.\nBEST FOR STARTING CONVERSATIONS: MB&F HM6 FINAL EDITION\nThere isn’t a single MB&F creation out there that won’t raise questions and eyebrows but some may argue the HM6, also known as the Space Pirate, might be the zaniest. In addition to its unusual but ingenious design, you can also talk about how the HM6 Final Edition will be the last of its kind to come from Maximilian Busser and his pals.\nInspired by a spaceship from the 1970s cartoon Captain Future, the horological machine tells time through two spheres on the bottom. The middle dome shows off the one-minute flying tourbillon, which can be hidden under a “shield” of six blades that can be opened and closed via the left crown. The top two domes house the turbines that help regulate the winding efficiency of the rotor. What distinguishes the Final Edition from its predecessors is its grooved, stainless steel case. Only eight pieces have been made.\nBEST FOR ATTENDING FUNDRAISERS: CARTIER SANTOS CHRONOGRAPH\nCharity events are a wardrobe wildcard since the activity will determine the attire. But whether you’re donating blood, running for a cause or sponsoring a table at a gala dinner in Versailles, you want to look good doing it.\nCartier’s Santos Chronograph will is ideal for this because of its staggering versatility. Its design, despite being updated last year, remains iconic and tasteful; its QuickSwitch system allows the wearer to switch between bracelets, rubber and leather straps with ease, and the fact that it has a well-thought out chronograph movement that places the start/stop pusher on the left side of the case for pleasing symmetry doesn’t hurt, either.\nBEST FOR WEARING TO A PARTY: BVLGARI OCTO ROMA GRANDE SONNERIE PERPETUAL CALENDAR DIAMONDS\nBulgari unveiled its most complicated watch, the Octo Roma Grande Sonnerie Perpetual Calendar, earlier this year to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Gerald Genta’s first grande sonnerie, making this a suitably over-the-top timepiece for a real blowout if it weren’t for the fact that it’s a piece unique.\nThankfully, an even more dazzling reference has been announced recently and Bulgari plans to roll out eight of them. The Bulgari Octo Roma Grande Sonnerie Perpetual Calendar Diamonds is exactly what its name promises – the exact same watch, but now with 6.57 carats worth of diamonds. With 1,180 movement parts contributing to the grande and petite sonnerie, minute repeater, tourbillon, perpetual calendar, moon phase, and power reserve indicators, this is a watch that begs to be seen and heard.\xa0 \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Lights! Camera! Action! These jewels are inspired by movie magic
  </h1>, 'text': 'Hollywood icon Elizabeth Taylor’s\xa0love for jewellery\xa0is well-documented – and it was no secret that she was particularly enamoured with Italian jeweller Bulgari. Even her fifth husband, Richard Burton, famously quipped: “The only word Elizabeth knows in Italian is Bulgari.” The Taylor-Burton union blossomed in 1962 when they filmed\xa0Cleopatra\xa0in Rome, also home to Bulgari, and they would make visits to the brand’s Via Condotti flagship boutique together.\nBulgari’s love affair with cinema flourished during the golden years of Dolce Vita in the 1950s and 1960s. During that time, the American film industry had descended upon Cinecitta in Rome, dubbed Hollywood on the Tiber (in reference to the river that runs through the city), and started producing movies and big-budget epics from there. Films such as\xa0Roman Holiday\xa0and\xa0La Dolce Vita\xa0captured the world’s imagination and cast a spotlight on the sights of the Eternal City such as the Spanish Steps and Trevi\xa0Fountain, both a stone’s throw from Bulgari’s flagship boutique.\nLeading ladies came to know – and love – Bulgari jewels both on and off the screen. Before long, the luxury house had solidified its status as the jeweller to the stars.\n\n\nTHE MAGIC OF CINEMA\nThe spirit of the Dolce Vita era is captured in Bulgari’s latest Cinemagia high jewellery collection. “There were a lot of stars who wore our jewels during the Dolce Vita period, and looking through our archives, they wore them for\xa0both formal and informal occasions, and with a kind of attitude. Right now, we want to create jewels that the ladies can also wear outside of a formal setting – in different layers, as a choker, with a chain, basically playing around with jewels,” jewellery creative director Lucia\xa0Silvestri enthused during the\xa0collection’s regional launch in July at the newly opened Six Senses Thimphu in\xa0Bhutan.\nPresenting the collection against a backdrop of\xa0majestic mountains and sacred monasteries in the Himalayan kingdom, a country synonymous with the concept of gross national happiness, was a deliberate decision. “It’s the kingdom of happiness and we want to share the same feeling with our clients, in the same way we want the Bulgari\xa0jewels\xa0to communicate joy and happiness, as well as\xa0our approach to living larger than life,” said high\xa0jewellery\xa0director Giampaolo della Croce.\nELIZABETH TAYLOR’S EMERALD AFFAIR\nAnd who better than Taylor truly embodied this spirit of joie\xa0de vivre? Burton would often lavish his lover with sparkling baubles. One of these was a sautoir with a 65-carat sugarloaf cabochon sapphire that he gifted her for her 40th birthday in 1972, and that is now part of the Bulgari Heritage Collection.\nBulgari returned Taylor’s affection by reimagining the necklace in a bold, geometric design anchored with a 24.46-carat octagonal step-cut emerald, calling it the Emerald Affair.\nWHAT’S IN THE PERFECT GEM?\nMuch like how an actress portrays a role in a film, Silvestri highlighted that unique gemstones define an entire creation.\nThe X-factor that she looks for in the perfect gem: “Colour is the most important; then clarity, size and cut. I also like stones with personality. They don’t have to be perfect, there can be some inclusions which means that the stones are alive. We’d then announce the beauty of the stone with our creativity, mixing it with other colours and stones.”\nOne only has to look at the combination of precious gems (emerald drops, rubies and diamonds) and coloured stones in unconventional cuts (vivid cabochon-cut spinels) in the Dolce Vita Colours necklace to understand.\n\n\nThere are plenty of cinematic references across the over 150-piece collection – from Cleopatra’s poncho necklace and Pinocchio’s mother-of-pearl collar, to Captain Hook’s Pirate Treasures collar necklace and Tinker Bell’s Fairy Wings earrings – but the Action! necklace is perhaps the most literal interpretation of the theme. Taking the form of a celluloid film, it is crafted from black-silver zirconium, a hyper-resistant metal the brand uses for the first time in high jewellery. Besides ensuring that it sits comfortably around the wearer’s neck, the necklace’s sinuous and flexible form hides a surprise mechanism – the round film, when rotated, reproduces the sound of old projectors.\nTHE JEWELS ARE DAZZLING DIVAS TOO\nWhile Bulgari may be the jeweller to the stars, its jewels are also divas in their own right, having starred in more than 40\xa0films, from\xa0The Visit\xa0with Ingrid Bergman to\xa0Casino\xa0with Sharon Stone. The latter film’s most epic scene, where Robert De Niro presented Stone with a trunk full of Bulgari jewels, is Silvestri’s favourite cinematic moment involving the brand. Della Croce concurred: “The scene represents the concept behind our jewels – it’s pure pleasure.” And just like a film-maker, Bulgari is a storyteller with a heart for beautiful things.\nHere’s a closer look at the stunning pieces.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      Breaking free from his shades of grey: The visually impaired make-up artist
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Five times out of six when Iskandar Ibrahim applied for a job in the cosmetics line, he was accepted. After all, he was an award-winning make-up artist who had a decade of experience at MAC.\nBut when he had to sign the contract or start work, he always hesitated. In his heart, he knew he was more than qualified — but each time, he questioned his ability, and whether his potential employers would really accept him.\nIn 2014, he was diagnosed with photoreceptor dysfunction, an eye condition in which the cells in the retinas degenerate prematurely. It means he cannot see in bright light, nor tell shades of colours apart.\n“I was afraid that they’d reject me because of my condition,” says the 44-year-old. “Perhaps it was a pride issue … But I felt like I was lying to myself and lying to them.\n“So every time it was time to sign the contract, I couldn’t.”\nIt has been five years full of longing, loss and trying to find his way back to his first love.\nIskandar, who prefers to be known as Shawn, still sees in shades of grey. But the excuses have stopped, and he is now giving himself a chance to bring colour to others as a make-up artist once again.\nHIS DREAM JOB\nBefore things went downhill for Shawn, he was living the dream with MAC, feeling as if he had it all: Glamorous fashion shows with top local designers, overseas trips with his team for conferences, and most of all, the prestige.\n“When you’re at MAC, you’re something,” he says. “Everybody knows.”\nIt was hard work, but he enjoyed it. Beyond the glamour, he loved the brand and what it represented: Creative, flamboyant and colourful — the same qualities he would ascribe to himself, and was known to be.\n“When I went to work, I dressed so stylishly, with boots and all,” recalls Shawn, who had been posted to the duty-free hall at Changi Airport. “And when everybody saw me, it was like, ‘Wah, celebrity come already!’”\nDressing to the nines every day meant polishing his boots, ironing his T-shirts and, of course, wearing make-up.\nHe favoured bold, dramatic lines: Thick, winged liner and sparkly eye shadow, with a deep red lip colour — Ruby Woo or Russian Red.\nIt was, he says with a smile, a hallmark of his style, which he had developed in his early 20s from making and dressing up in costumes and wigs to perform in drag at clubs.\nHe was known then as Shawn Flower. But to his friends, it was clear that drag was simply his hobby. His real love was MAC.\n“He shines at drag, but I think when he got his job as a make-up artist … you could see that it was different for him,” says Aidil Abdullah, who has been his friend for more than 20 years.\n“You could see how confident, how radiant he was, and he knew what he was talking about … He was in his prime when he was in MAC.”\nTHE MISTAKES BEGAN\nBut one day in 2012, he realised his eyesight was not what it used to be. There was a slight fuzziness, and at times, he saw black dots dancing in front of his eyes.\nIt seemed worse in places with bright lighting, such as the harsh sunlight of the early afternoon or on the shop floor of the cosmetics counter.\nThen there were the waves of giddiness and the migraines, which sometimes caused his eyes to water from the pain.\nHe realised he was having problems reading the codes on the products that came in. He started making mistakes: Stocks of make-up ended up in the wrong place, and he started giving customers the wrong products.\nHe began using a magnifying glass discreetly to read product codes. He began directing customers who had come for makeovers to sit in a chair with dim lighting, so he could do their make-up without straining his eyes.\nBut the mistakes kept happening. And customers started to complain. “My colleagues started asking me … Shawn, what happened to you?’” he recounts. “Normally, you don’t make any mistakes.\n“They asked me: ‘Are you okay? Is there something wrong with your eyes?’”\nBut he kept quiet.\n“I didn’t want to tell people because I didn’t want people to look at me as if I wasn’t normal,” he explains. “So I just tahan.”\nUntil he could no longer hide it. Growing increasingly concerned about his performance, Shawn’s managers urged him to see an eye specialist. And in early 2014, he was diagnosed with the condition.\nIn bright light, what he sees is a sea of white and vague black or grey shapes. In dim lighting, things are still a bit blurry. While he can see primary colours such as red or yellow, he cannot make out the different shades.\nWorking at MAC was his dream, but he was torn. With the mistakes mounting and his vision deteriorating, he was no longer sure he could do it.\nSo he left.\nWATCH: The visually impaired makeup artist (4:45)\nHIS LOWEST POINT\nIn his darkest days, there were times when Shawn admitted to himself that he had perhaps never wanted to acknowledge his condition. “Sometimes I just blamed myself,” he says.\nHe made excuses to avoid meeting his friends. Only one or two close pals knew about his situation.\nFor six months after he left his job, all he did was sit at home and cry. Paralysed with grief, he could not bring himself to apply for another job. It was the lowest point in his life.\nWhen he did have to go out, there were times midway through a journey when he came to a standstill and cried because could not see where he was going.\nHe was referred to the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH), which gave him special red-lensed glasses to reduce the glare of bright light so he could go out in the daytime.\nEven so, he estimates his visual improvement at 50 to 60 per cent at most.\nThings got worse for him when his ailing mother died in 2017 from pneumonia. He had always been close to her and had been planning to buy a new flat where she could live.\nThe day she was buried was the first time Shawn’s close friend Abdul Malik realised the depth of his problem.\n“We had to walk to the cemetery, and he couldn’t even move … He had to hug me to go through the graveyard,” he recalls. “I carried an umbrella to shade him, and he was wearing his sunglasses. But he couldn’t see.”\nHe pauses to offer a tissue to Shawn, whose tears are flowing down at the memory.\n“He couldn’t see his mother’s face for the very last time.”\nTHE TURNING POINT\nFor a time, Shawn lived off his savings. As his bank balance dwindled, his desperation grew. But he ended up in a quandary over his job applications.\nAt the end of last year, he received a phone call from his social worker at the SAVH. A fragrance company named Firmenich was looking to hire sensory panellists, who would smell and profile the fragrances the company produced.\nThough it was only part-time, the job gave him a steady income. It was also a turning point for him.\nAs he worked with others who were visually impaired, he realised that there were opportunities for people like him. “My friends who were totally blind could do so many other jobs,” he says. “So why not me?\n“They always told me … Shawn, if you get any job, just go for it,” he adds. “If we can do it … you can as well.”\nSeeing the way his Firmenich trainers, Siau Choon and Thibault, adapted the work practices to accommodate the panellists’ disabilities also made him more accepting of his condition.\nHe promised himself that should he apply for other jobs in future, he would declare his condition up front. “Whether I get (the job) or not, that’s another story,” he says.\nALLOWED TO BE HIMSELF\nAnother job that helped him regain his confidence, he says, is one that has allowed him to be himself, dress up flamboyantly again and, best of all, work at night — away from the glare of the daytime light.\nThis is now the sixth year he has participated in Universal Studios Singapore’s annual Halloween Horror Nights, first as a make-up artist and then as a part-time scare actor.\n“Whatever character they give me, I try my best to become that character,” he says. “This has made me want to try more things and do more things that I’ve never done before.”\nIn this year’s edition, he plays a victim in a Japanese-themed haunted house filled with eerie dolls. Dressed in a checked shirt and with fake blood and gore running down the side of his face, he certainly looked the part.\n“Help me!” he yells as people are ushered through a darkened passageway. “Yumi’s coming!”\nFrom his animated chats with the make-up artist in the holding area, to the gleam in his eye when he stretches out his hand towards a screaming visitor, it is clear that he enjoys every bit of the acting.\n“Today,” he says, making a dramatic gesture with his hands and flourishing his puppet Yumi, “I’m Mariah Scary!”\nHalloween Horror Nights has been an escape for him, says Aidil. “He always seems extra cheerful when he’s doing it.”\nBut the issue is that there is a limited run every year. Shawn has been approached to work at the theme park for its Christmas events, but as these were in the daytime, he had to decline.\n“I always ask them … do you have any night one?” he says. “If there is, I want to join.”\nWhen he puts on his costume, his demeanour changes. It offers a glimpse of what he could have been like years ago as a flamboyant performer in a blonde wig and a glittery dress.\nPINING FOR HIS FIRST LOVE\nToday, the remnants of Shawn’s drag days are packed away in boxes in his wardrobe. There is a leopard-print tunic with butterfly sleeves; a rainbow scarf; and a brown wig that he quips makes him look like supermodel Tyra Banks.\nBut he has long since closed the door on that part of his life. In his bedroom, his make-up collection takes pride of place. In a clear drawer under his mirror, there are eye shadows in every colour of the rainbow.\nAs he slings his make-up belt over one shoulder, he has the look of a dedicated professional, ready to showcase his skills on a model.\nAs far as he is concerned, he remains a professional. Despite his sight, he is able to do make-up in dim lighting. Besides the various part-time jobs he juggles, he also takes on freelance make-up assignments.\nAlthough he uses a magnifying glass to read the product codes, it is sometimes unnecessary; he knows MAC products so well that he is able to tell — from memory — what the colours look like and how the products behave.\n“Sometimes I can’t see,” he says as he sweeps a shimmery mineral eye shadow onto his friend’s eyelids. “But I know that mineral products always fall off because of the pigment, so I’ll take a brush and sweep it off.”\nHe makes minor adaptations to accommodate his condition, he says. Sometimes he gets his customer to help him read product codes or identify products. He also places a mirror in front of his customer and would ask from time to time if what he is doing works.\nIt does for the most part.\nToday, not only has he accepted his condition as a part of him and regained some confidence, he also accepts that the experience of losing part of his vision has made him a better person — humbler and nice to everybody.\n“Before, I was very proud,” he admits. “I’d always thought of myself as a make-up artist … so glamourous. But … everything changed.”\nIn his heart, however, he longs to return to his first love, MAC. With the bright lights, he knows it would be a challenge. But perhaps, he thinks aloud, he could work in a dimmer environment?\n“If there’s a chance for me to come back, I’d come back without hesitation,” he says. “Part-time also (I don’t) mind … I just want to be with the team.”\nHe feels wistful about what he has lost. But as he sweeps a bright pink blusher on his model and selects a bronze lipstick for her, it is clear that he can still add colour to people’s lives, as he did at the height of his career.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      'I say no to disrespect': Rebecca Lim won't let you push her around any longer
  </h1>, 'text': 'There are three things on Rebecca Lim’s mind. The first is her sense of self and personal growth. Rebecca 2.0\xa0is not the same as the fresh-faced ingenue you may have encountered when she first started in the industry 14 years ago – a point she made clear multiple times over the course of our conversation.\n“The Rebecca now is a little bit more difficult to get along with than the Rebecca when she was 19,” she said.\nOne never doubts a point made in the third person.\nThe third is the future. This 33-year-old is in it for the long haul – not as some famous pretty girl who takes a good picture (she didn’t always, in any case), but as an actor, thank you very much.\nShe may have her insecurities, she may have residual hang-ups about having been a “chubby kid”, and she may have auditioned three times for Crazy Rich Asians and lost the part to someone who’s now part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe – but it’s all good. Rebecca’s plan for career longevity is simple: Work hard, work on your craft, and work on being the best version of you.\nAnd if you have a problem with that, you can refer to Point 2. Why? That would be Point 1. How? Welcome back to Point 3.\nOh, and one more thing. Rebecca doesn’t think she looks good without her clothes on.\nNEVER THE BEAUTY QUEEN\nI first met Rebecca when she was fresh out of Junior College. She was looking to kill time before starting university, so she entered the Miss Universe Singapore pageant in 2005. She didn’t win. In fact, she barely got her name on the call sheet in the first place. Her brother had just passed his driving test and was eager to get behind the wheel for any occasion, including dragging his sister to her destiny.\n“I went totally unprepared. You were supposed to have prepared a portfolio. I didn’t have anything – I had my Junior College IC photo. For the swimsuit, I just went with a one-piece,” she admitted, giggling at the memory. “I was on eight months holiday. I thought, ‘After these eight months, I’m going to the UK to study medicine.’”\nBy the time every name was called and every cheek was air-kissed, Rebecca was crowned first runner-up. Part of her “prize” was to model Swatch watches alongside the winning queen for a sponsor-associated interview in 8 Days, where I spent two years as a disgruntled employee. My job was to squeeze some sort of story out of two fresh-off-the-boat pageant girls – and to help the photographer get one good picture of these kids who were terrified at the notion of doing their very first photo shoot with a magazine.\n“Oh, that was terrible… I was very scared,” said Rebecca, looking a little embarrassed when I told her I had in fact popped her photo cherry. “I was just basically listening to instructions and taking them very literally.”\nShe still remembers the photographer telling her to pout for the camera – she also still remembers proceeding to pout like a six-year-old in pigtails who has just been told she won’t be getting fish fingers for her teatime snack.\nI remember telling my colleagues about it.\nYears later, that photographer told her, “‘You are the first person in my career who did a literal pout,’” recalled Rebecca. “‘Not a model pout. But a literal, sad pout.’ I really didn’t know what was going on.”\nFourteen years later, the very same photographer was shooting Rebecca again for this\xa0piece, CNA Luxury\'s first digital cover story. But this time, she clearly knew what she was doing, drenched in the latest Chanel finery.\nSome celebrities suck up all the air in the room. They relish being the centre of attention, holding fort over the set, almost gratified by the flashing lights and gratuitous fawning courtesy of an inner court of sycophantic hairstylists, make-up artists, managers and other assorted handmaidens. Rebecca is different. She’s quiet because she’s listening to direction, thinking about how to make it work for her face and body. She’s focused on getting the job done well.\nIt’s a work ethic that applies to everything she does. Sometimes that quiet concentration on television shoots can be mistaken by colleagues for aloofness. Rebecca knows she can’t change people’s minds, so she lets her work do the talking. “If you don’t know who I am, I’m going to let my work show you who I am,” she said. “That’s why I place a lot of emphasis on my craft and my job, as opposed to me going out, hanging out after work and all that.”\nThis steely resolve is somewhat of a coping mechanism to survive the entertainment industry – an environment she never actually thought she’d be part of, what more rise to the A-list of. Experience, she said, has made all the difference. That and “full acceptance of yourself – the good and bad”.\n“Why is it that imperfections are not beautiful? Do we need to reach the stage where everybody looks the same?”\n“It was a process… Putting yourself out there, learning from scratch,” shared Rebecca.\xa0“I grew up in a very sheltered environment. I had a very loving family, I’m comfortable, I didn’t have to work… Just a very comfortable Singapore child. But when I was thrown into this industry, it wasn’t something I expected.""\nIt didn’t help that she started her career wearing a sash and a smile. “People come into this industry thinking that it’s very glamorous, and that [joining Miss Universe] is a shot to fame, that this pageant background is going to give you a huge stepping stone,” said Rebecca. “But, in fact, it was actually a stumbling block instead of a stepping stone because people already have this preconceived notion of who you are. ‘Oh, you are just a beauty pageant contestant.’”\nInteresting note: Rebecca mentioned her Miss Universe Singapore experience several times during our conversation – but she never used the words “beauty queen” to describe herself. “Contestant”, it seems, will do just fine.\n“Being in an environment where I’m not under the shelter of love… Being in an environment where I have to succumb to criticism – constructive or not. It’s a position where you don’t know what is going on and you have to learn along the way.”\n“Even now,” she continued. “I’m still learning every day.”\n\xa0\nSTICKS AND STONES AND REMEMBERING WHO YOU ARE\nIt’s a tough industry to navigate – one where anyone can say anything about you, sometimes to your face. “Most of the time to your face,” Rebecca corrected me, laughing.\n“When I came into this industry, people were like, ‘Why are you not wearing any make-up?’, ‘Why are you always in the same jeans?’, ‘Don’t you have any other clothes?’ But I’m like, “What’s wrong with that? They’ve been serving me well for the past 10 years!” she said, laughing.\nFor the record, she still has those jeans, which she recently had shortened to more stylish proportions. She still uses the Longchamp nylon bag her grandmother gave her when she was 18. She still owns the simple cross pendant her other grandmother gave her before she passed away. Part of it has to do with practicality – but Rebecca is also sentimental. She admitted to attaching meaning to things. She still prints out photographs and brings them along with her when she travels, “just to make it a little bit more like home”.\nThat’s the balance she’s trying to strike: Having to care about “things that you thought were not so important” but are essential to the career she’s chosen while holding on to who she is as a person. She’ll do what the job requires – but she’s increasingly defiant about having to “conform”.\n“Why is it that imperfections are not beautiful?” said Rebecca. “Do we need to reach the stage where everybody looks the same?”\nI think we’re already there, I offered. Swipe through the famous faces on social media and it’s pretty clear this train has arrived at Clone Station.\n“We’re almost there,” said Rebecca. “But why do we need to get there? For everybody to have the same cheekbones, for everybody to have the same eyes, for that to be beautiful. That’s something that took me a while to accept – to accept who I am, physically.”\nIt seems her perceived flaws about her body are key to both her insecurities and her determination to rise above it. “Even as a chubby kid, my mum would always tell me how beautiful I was,” said Rebecca. “She’d buy me miniskirts… I look back at all these pictures and I’m like, ‘Why did you even allow me to be in a miniskirt with these thunder thighs?’ And she’s like, ‘Because… you liked it.’”\n“I understand that because of who I am and my genes, unfortunately, my weight fluctuates quite a bit,” she said. “The first thing I have to tell myself is to not be too hard on myself. If I do balloon during a production, it’s fine. As long as I’m healthy.”\nIt might be self-preservation, she confessed, but it’s a healthier mindset to have than to force-fit herself into some templated celebrity mould for no other reason than “just because”.\n“Why must you always conform to what people expect of you?” she asked, rhetorically. “In this industry, there is always pressure to look picture-perfect all the time. And I’ve come to accept that at the end of the day, when the camera cuts and I go home, I’m a human being. I still have my life outside of work. It’s okay to be human.”\nYes, she understands she’s just a cog in the star-making machinery and cannot singlehandedly change the rules of the game, but she insists on playing her part to resist losing herself. “And it’s so easy to conform. Every day you feel pressure to conform,” said Rebecca. “But you have to be really solid and stand firm to say: ‘This is what I’m going to do. Like it or not.’”\nSWIPE LEFT ON BAD PEOPLE\nThe industry and the people in it were clearly on Rebecca’s mind. Even when the conversation made a detour to the sideroads of fashion and style (I get distracted by pretty things), she steered it right back to the topic of unpleasantness.\nWhat, I asked, was the secret to looking confident when it comes to style? Her answer surprised me.\n“The thing is, you can wear the most fashionable, expensive piece of clothing – but if you have a terrible heart and a terrible mind, I really believe that whatever you think and who you are as a person shows on your face. In Chinese there’s a cheng yu (idiom): Xiang you xing shen. Which means your face reflects whatever is in your heart.”\nShe asked if I understood that cheng yu. My level of proficiency in the language, however, is tied with a turnip’s understanding of string theory. “Roald Dahl said it as well,” offered Rebecca, referring to a passage from The Twits: A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.\n""Don’t be nice to someone just because you want a long career. It’s just basic respect for another human being. You don’t treat someone differently because this person is a CEO.""\nI pointed out that there seemed to be a theme running through our chat. “Mmm hmm,” she replied. Is it getting better for her, I asked. “Yes and no.” She said she’s learned to separate the noise from what’s real – and she’s learned that the hard way. “Through experience, getting hurt. Even by people who you thought were true friends, who you thought had your back.”\n“Certain incidences in and out of work life caused me to see that you may be doing something for this person, and you may expect that loyalty, or expect that reciprocation – but you cannot expect that of someone else. You do it out of your own will,” said Rebecca. “So when I do something for somebody… I don’t expect it back in return. That’s something that has helped me a lot.”\n“Sometimes people get very bitter,” she continued, albeit cryptically. “When people start to get bitter, they wallow in self-pity, and that’s not who I want to be. I think mental health is just as important – if not more important – than physical health.”\nFamous people, it seems, aren’t above getting sucked in by the same gossip us non-famous folk read about celebrities – even when it’s about them. Drama inevitably ensues. But if you read some gossip about you and another celebrity that you know isn’t true, I asked, wouldn’t you just text the other person and clear the air?\n“You’d have to ask them,” replied Rebecca. “If something inaccurate is said about me or someone else, I settle it privately. That has always been my style. If I’m involved in any drama whatsoever, I’ve never been the one who goes out to say, ‘I’m the victim.’”\n“I’m never one to make a big deal about small, trivial issues. Or want everything to turn out my way. Or want everybody to be on my side. I believe that people will take sides, naturally. And no matter how much you try to stay out of drama or be nice to people, there will be people who don’t like you. So, I accept that fully. I just move on with my life,” said Rebecca.\n“If you really want to put on a front, there’s only so long you can do that for before someone sees through all this fakeness. Because how long can you keep up the act for? Acting is a tiring job – how can you do it 24/7?”\n\xa0\nWhich brings us back to the point we started this story with: Rebecca 2.0\xa0is not the same little girl she was when she first started out – and she will not allow you to push her or anyone else around any longer.\n“I say no to disrespect. Disrespect for people on set,” said Rebecca. “I get very frustrated, especially when I see the younger generation [of artistes] being disrespectful. I get very angry. I’ll put my foot down and say, ‘Don’t speak to someone like that just because this person is of a “lower status”.’ Everybody is working together. And don’t be nice to someone just because you want a long career. It’s just basic respect for another human being. You don’t treat someone differently because this person is a CEO or a client.""\n“Just treat everyone with respect and do your job well.” No truer words have ever been spoken, in my opinion.\nThat, to me, is what makes Rebecca different from many starlets, influencers and precious wannabes in the industry: She knows what her job is.\nRebecca Lim is an actor who is famous – she does not chase being a celebrity who also happens to act. And that’s a major distinction. Focus on your craft, she said. “I feel that everything else comes naturally after.”\n""I want longevity. You don’t focus on climbing up the ladder. That can get you up there quickly, but how long can you last?""\nShe’s been exploring international productions, returning for a second season of HBO Asia’s The Bridge in early 2020, where she plays a weathered detective. She also auditioned for Crazy Rich Asians three times – and ultimately lost the role of Astrid Leong-Teo to Gemma Chan. Had Rebecca gotten the role, she would have played unhappy wife to fellow Mediacorp alum Pierre Png in his Hollywood debut.\n“I think I did really badly with the accent,” admitted Rebecca, laughing sheepishly. “They asked me to do an American accent… Maybe they wanted an accent that sounded posh. I probably sounded like the other extreme!”\nThat said, her goal isn’t to work on international projects per se – it’s to work on quality productions. “I want to explore everything. I’m not averse to any roles, except nudity and love scenes,” she said, explaining that she must keep her family’s feelings about risque roles in mind, before quipping: “Also, I’m not a pretty sight to see without clothes on.” Insecurities don’t vanish just because you want them to.\nRebecca’s focus is on an actor’s long game: Knowing it’s all about the work.\n“It could be a very good quality Singapore production – that could take you places as well.” When casting directors come to town and ask to see the best actors we have in the country, Rebecca wants her name to be “in the top five”. “I’m working towards that,"" she said. ""I want to be on that list.""\n“When it comes to my career, I want longevity. Longevity in your career ultimately [comes down to] your talent,” said Rebecca. “You don’t focus on climbing up the ladder. That can get you up there quickly, but how long can you last? I may take longer than others, but that’s fine.”\nShe’ll do it with grace, respect and hard work. As well as the cheekbones and eyes she was born with. And that’s beautiful.\nShot on location at Wallich Residence.

      How to pick out a suit that fits you perfectly – according to your body type
  </h1>, 'text': 'Think men have it easier than women when it comes to formal wear? You’d be surprised – a suit can be tough to get right, especially when men’s physiques come in so many different sizes and shapes.\nThere’s a good reason why gents’ tailors remain very much in demand – when your formal attire is limited to the same few garment styles that are worn by every other guy, it’s even more important that every component is ideal for your height and body type.\nGuys, you may not have curves like ladies do, but your figures can also be categorised into four distinct body types. Instead of apples, pears and hourglasses, we will look, instead, to geometric shapes. Want to know if you’re a triangle or oval? Read on to find out where you fit and how to find suiting that works better for your shape.\n\n\nYour figure is straight all the way from top to bottom, and that’s actually quite a good proportion to work with for men. Except for a little volume around the shoulders and chest, you should have few body-shape issues to address. If all that time spent at the gym isn’t doing much to help you acquire that athletic build, try these dressing tricks instead.\nShoulder pads in your blazer can lift and widen your frame and are particularly effective on those who are a skinny rectangle.\nShoulder pads in your blazer can lift and widen your frame and are particularly effective on those who are a skinny rectangle. But if you are thickset, ask your tailor to keep them thin or, if possible, avoid them. Apart from that, try layers if the occasion and weather allow for these – a vest worn with a suit will add bulk as well as a smarter look to your formal wear.\nPrints and colours, worn in the right way, can also help emphasise your upper body. Wear light colours and prints on shirts, while keeping your pants dark-toned and simple. Don’t forget the details – accessories like ties or pocket squares can be similarly used to create volume near your chest.\n\n\nBODY TYPE: OVAL OR ROUNDED\nMany guys develop this body shape as they approach their middle-aged years – you lose muscle mass around the chest, shoulders and upper arms, while the beginnings of a paunch are visible. This shape also applies to men who have sloping shoulders or are disproportionately wider around the hips or mid-section.\nYour aim is to play down the girth of your mid-section and build structure around your shoulders.\nYour aim is to play down the girth of your mid-section and build structure around your shoulders. Crisp shirts that hold their form well will help you achieve the latter – avoid shirt material that is soft or silky. Tailored blazers will also do the same but go strictly for single-breasted styles, which won’t further widen your mid-section like double-breasted jackets will.\nA light, vertical pinstripe can help elongate your figure and will be visually slimming. Horizontal lines are not a good idea – if you’d like to go for a check print, pick one that is smaller in scale and subtler in terms of colour combinations.\nBODY TYPE: MUSCULAR OR INVERTED TRIANGLE\nThe bulked-out weightlifter type has a highly disproportionate figure that is difficult to dress. While guys with a muscular build don’t need much help with definition, many of them have to deal with a massive chest and huge shoulders that look unbalanced in comparison to their narrow hips.\nShoulder padding should definitely be kept to a minimum, while a double-breasted style will broaden your torso and balance out your wide shoulders.\nKeep these pointers in mind when buying jackets and blazers, or getting them tailored: Shoulder padding should definitely be kept to a minimum, while a double-breasted style will broaden your torso and balance out your wide shoulders.\n\n\nAs for shirts, get them in a size that gives you enough room to move around the arms and shoulders. If you can’t find one that accommodates your bulk without fitting too loose elsewhere, consider getting your shirts tailored to your measurements – they will save you a lot of frustration and prove to be excellent investments.\nAvoid getting your pants in an overly tapered cut or tight fit, as doing so will only emphasise your top-heaviness. A straight cut is best for balancing out your inverted-triangle shape and concealing skinny legs.\nAnother important thing muscular men tend to overlook: Check if you need a wider tie or jacket lapels, because a standard width for both is likely to appear comically small on your build.\n\n\nBODY TYPE: ATHLETIC OR RHOMBOID\nLucky you if you have the much-coveted swimmer’s bod. You may have strong shoulders and slim hips, but your proportions are not extreme and your physique is lean, instead of burly. You shouldn’t have much difficulty finding off-the-rack suits that fit nicely, even if made-to-measure may bring out the best of your figure.\nThe one figure flaw that some of you are likely to have is a lack of height – in which case you should try out some of the dressing tips recommended for guys with an inverted triangle body shape. These will detract focus from your top half and, in turn, help to visually elongate the lower half of your body.\nA higher waistline will help conceal your figure imbalance.\nIf your legs are short, considered in proportion to your torso, pay attention to the waist and rise of your pants. A higher waistline will help conceal your figure imbalance – the waistband of your pants should fall on your natural waistline, which lies near your navel. Take care to find the right hem length, too: Aim for somewhere right below the ankle – the hems should barely rest on the top of your shoes.\nIf, however, you are tall and are well-balanced from top to toe, go forth and experiment with prints, colours and suits in modern cuts – if there’s anyone who can carry off a bold style, it’s you.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Men ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Always wanted a Nautilus or Royal Oak? Here’s their more affordable cousin
  </h1>, 'text': 'Is that a Nautilus? No, is it a Royal Oak? Wait, it’s a Bell & Ross! When the BR 05 was officially released worldwide on Sep 5, comparisons to other iconic watches came flying.\nLeading watch blog Hodinkee, for example, drew parallels with Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet’s respective flagships designed by the legendary Gerald Genta.\nA handsome instrument in its own right, the BR 05 has also been likened to several other signature designs: the Santos de Cartier, Panerai’s Luminor, and, of course, Hublot’s Classic Fusion, itself an inspired nod to the Royal Oak.\nThey say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and whether these brands agree, Bell & Ross CEO and co-founder Carlos-Antonio Rosillo told CNA Lifestyle he takes the comparisons as a “compliment”.\n\n\nThe market, meanwhile, has lapped up the BR 05 precisely, we suspect, for the opportunity to acquire a fine mechanical timepiece that ticks all the above mentioned boxes – but at a comparatively lower price starting from S$6,500.\nAN ICON IN THE MAKING? \nThe BR 05 bears all the hallmarks of an icon in the making: An aesthetically-pleasing silhouette with well-balanced proportions and key design features that, when combined, feel all too familiar.\nThere’s the round face fused in a 40mm square case, four screws on each corner of the bezel, and the integrated bracelet with no lugs.\nThere are, after all, only so many shapes and elements a watchmaker can play around with. And Rosillo assures that the BR 05 is a “natural evolution” of the brand’s DNA.\n“If the starting point of the BR 05 was another watch, I wouldn’t come to present this to you because I wouldn’t be proud; I couldn’t,” he insisted. “If the starting point of the BR 05 was another watch, how can all our dealers, which also represent all those fantastic brands, give us those beautiful window displays? Are they so driven by money or crazy that they would compromise a long-term relationship for something that is a knock-off?” he asked rhetorically.\nInstead, Rosillo explained that the inspiration for the BR 05 came from a need to fill a gap between Bell & Ross’\xa0round Vintage collection and its best-selling BR 03, also featuring a round dial in a square case.\xa0\nWhen you put these watches side by side, you do see the evolutionary process Rosillo speaks of.\n\n\nBut where the BR 03 is bold and rugged, the BR 05 is streamlined and refined. The square has been softened, and Bell & Ross has done away with lugs, replacing them with an integrated bracelet instead.\n“It’s a more sophisticated casing compared with the BR 03. BR 03 is for outdoor, BR 05 is for indoor. BR 03 is for more sporty activities, BR 05 is for the city lifestyle,” he elaborated.\xa0\nTHE POWER OF NUMEROLOGY\nThe Franco-Swiss watch brand, known for its tough, utilitarian watches professionally used by military organisations, also took a page from Apple’s book and skipped a 04 model by going straight to the 05.\n“We believe in the power of numerology,” Rosillo stated.\nReferencing the Vitruvian Man, he said: “In numerology, the number 5 symbolises the perfect harmony between the circle and square… Leonardo da Vinci drew the proportions of the perfect man in a circle within a square. So this held meaning for us.”\nBalance is an important theme for the brand. As is ergonomics. The bracelet, for instance, is attached to the case at a precise 50-degree angle.\n“My co-founder Bruno (Belamich) studied all the possible angles and, according to science, the 50-degree angle – not 45 or 55 – enables the watch to cover a wider range of wrists,” Rosillo explained.\nDesigned for the “urban hero”, the BR 05 is fitted with the BR-CAL.321 automatic movement and comes in steel or 18K rose gold cases, with matching bracelets or a rubber strap option. There is also a skeleton version (limited to 500 pieces) that allows you to glimpse its BR-CAL.322 automatic movement through the dial.\n\n\n“The BR 05 is a mix of all the ingredients that were in Bell & Ross; a summary of what we have been doing for 25 years. It’s a mature collection that is at the crossroads of all our creations,” he said.\nTHE FINAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE\xa0 \nWith its more sophisticated styling, the BR 05 also completes the Bell & Ross story.\n“It’s like when you’re making a puzzle; until you have the missing part, it’s an unfinished puzzle,” said Rosillo.\nBut the story is far from over, as he believes the journey is more important than the destination.\nIn 1996, French luxury group Chanel bought a minority stake in the Bell & Ross story and this relationship, Rosillo says, has reinforced Bell & Ross’\xa0belief in staying true to its roots.\n“We’re very proud that we are a brand that is very consistent,” he said.\nSo what does it say about the man – or woman – who chooses to wear a BR 05?\n“He or she enjoys inner strength. Because it’s powerful, but not showy.”\nIt also says that’s a confident person who doesn’t care about the contentious design; a self-assured individual who knows his or her own mind.\nSo was the uncanny resemblance intentional? Was it an oversight? It almost doesn’t matter. Because at the end of the day, the BR 05 is a fine creation that looks beautiful on any wrist.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Luxury brands face a dilemma as Hong Kong retail hits the skids
  </h1>, 'text': 'The Givenchy T-shirt cost more than US$500 (S$684), but the price tag was not the fashion faux pas that riled many Chinese consumers: It was the wording on the back that seemed to label Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries that prompted an outcry from China in August.\nThe French brand, owned by luxury conglomerate LVMH, publicly apologised and said it “firmly respects China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Other brands such as Versace and Coach have experienced similar run-ins.\nThe backlash underscores the pressure on global luxury houses to think carefully about how they present themselves to China, and its growing pool of luxury consumers, as political tension between Hong Kong citizens and China reaches new highs.\nBeijing has been swift to rein in any international retailers and other businesses that mistakenly identify the city as an independent country. The general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team recently provoked the ire of China when he tweeted his support for the Hong Kong protests.\n""The relevance of Hong Kong as a centre for luxury is being called into question like never before.""\nAlthough Daryl Morey quickly deleted the tweet, the subsequent outpouring of anger resulted in several commercial partners – including sportswear brand Li-Ning and tech group Tencent – suspending or cutting off business with the team.\nThe semi-autonomous territory under Chinese sovereignty has been rocked by violent protests since June, sparked by a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. The bill has since been withdrawn but the protests have morphed into a broader movement against Beijing and its grip on Hong Kong.\nThe unrest has already had a serious impact on the city’s retailers.\nAugust saw the fewest arrivals of mainland tourists – which make up a large portion of retail sales in the city thanks to tax-free shopping – since 2012, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board.\nBig brands know that the future of luxury is Chinese and largely millennial, said Karine Szegedi, a managing partner and head of fashion and luxury at Deloitte in Switzerland. “Hong Kong is a hot topic and (brands) are discussing what they should be doing… but the Chinese consumer remains the most important (for sales).”\nFigures show sales of jewellery, watches and other valuable gifts plunged by nearly half (47.4 per cent) in August compared with the same month in 2018, according to provisional data from Hong Kong’s Census and Statistics Department – the biggest drop on record for the city. That was on top of a 24 per cent year-on-year fall in July.\n“Brands can’t do much about it except lie low and rethink their strategy.""\n“The relevance of Hong Kong as a centre for luxury is being called into question like never before,” said Flavio Cereda-Parini, a luxury and brands analyst at Jefferies.\n“Brands can’t do much about it except lie low and rethink their strategy. If I am right, and a good portion of Hong Kong business from Chinese shoppers is lost for good, these companies need to rethink their retail footprint in the city.”\nThe consequences have been particularly harsh for many of the Swiss watch brands. The Asian financial centre is the biggest foreign market for Swiss timepieces and the value of exports fell more than 12 per cent in August compared with the previous year, according to Swiss watch federation data.\nIn their July trading updates, both Swiss luxury powerhouse Richemont and Swatch Group said the demonstrations had dented their local sales.\nBut stronger performances in other Asian countries have helped brands offset the weakness in Hong Kong, according to Jules Boudrand, director at Deloitte Switzerland.\nJapan experienced unprecedented growth in August, with Swiss watch exports up 34 per cent, the data show. And since the start of the year to August, China and Singapore jumped 14 and 12 per cent, respectively, compared with the same period last year.\n“Hong Kong has been really impacted (by the unrest) but overall the Asian market for Swiss watch exports is doing well,” Boudrand said.\nThe city’s retail pain, however, is not caused purely by the tense relations with the mainland. Chinese visitor numbers were already dwindling at the beginning of the year as a weakened renminbi dented shoppers’ purchasing power. Tax changes and lower custom duty rates have also kept Chinese buyers at home.\n“There was already a risk of Hong Kong losing its status (with Chinese buyers) due to the shrinking price differential,” said Cereda-Parini. “But that was previously a five-to-six-year concern for brands. The unrest has made it a one-to-three-year concern.”\nBy Mercedes Ruehl © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      How to repeat your clothes at work without anyone noticing
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s interesting how everyone tends to have some kind of personal “uniform” – a certain few silhouettes that one tends to stick to, either out of habit, for comfort or simply because of a personal preference for a specific style of clothing. If you observe what your co-workers wear to work over the course of a week or so, you’ll find this statement to be very true.\nThere’s nothing wrong with doing that, of course – after all, you know what works best for you. But while some manage to accomplish this without ever looking like they repeated a single outfit, others seem to be wearing the exact same clothes to work day after day.\nWhat is the secret that the stylish folks are privy to? Besides learning to switch up their daily ensemble with an occasional surprise or two, it’s really about playing it smart when shopping for clothes and creatively pairing the garments they already own.\nHere are some wise tips you can follow to put an end to your repetitive dress code, as well as additional advice from Debby Kwong, a personal stylist and home organising expert who offers her professional services in these aspects through her company, Sortorial. \xa0\n\n\nBUILD A CAPSULE WARDROBE\nWhat exactly makes a capsule wardrobe? While it essentially means a collection of versatile clothing that can be mixed and matched in endless combinations, and will thus form the building blocks of your wardrobe, what it comprises will vary from person to person, depending on individual dressing habits.\nYou don’t waste time thinking about what to wear, so it helps to have a tight edit of clothes that have complementary tones.\nRemember this when stocking up your capsule wardrobe: It should consist of items that don’t go out of fashion, which means they should be fairly basic, details-free and bought in neutral colours such as black, white, beige, navy, khaki and staple shades of denim. They can be separates or one-pieces that can be layered with other clothing; casual or formal (think blazers, shirts, work pants and dresses).\nHow will a capsule wardrobe help you repeat your clothing without anyone noticing it? Each piece can be paired with an indefinite number of other garments. For example, a printed top can look surprisingly different when worn with jeans on one day and black pants on another.\nKwong pointed out another benefit of having an effective capsule wardrobe: “You don’t waste time thinking about what to wear, so it helps to have a tight edit of clothes that have complementary tones.”\nBest of all, basics are virtually indistinguishable, stylistically speaking, which means that people tend not to notice or remember them. Yet, they can elevate your outfit in a subtle yet powerful way when bought in the right material and a flattering fit.\nPLAY WITH ACCESSORIES\nShoes, jewellery and bags are indispensable tools for those who aspire to be style chameleons. “You can switch up a look simply by wearing different accessories,” said Kwong. “A dress with metallic heels versus classic pumps projects a different vibe, while wearing a coloured scarf as a necklace or a simple pendant necklace makes the difference between artistic and classic.”\nDon’t shy away from interesting, statement-making styles or colours.\nIt helps to apply the same technique you use for building your capsule wardrobe on your accessories. The bulk of your collections should be made up of simple staples – in either silver or gold for jewellery; and neutral colours and sensible styles when it comes to bags and shoes.\nDon’t shy away from interesting, statement-making styles or colours though – these are likelier to be able to dramatically change up your look. However, it makes sense to keep these to about a quarter of your accessory collection, since these attention-getting pieces are not made for everyday wear – you’ll only want to show them off when you really want to make an impact.\n\n\nGET CREATIVE WITH STYLING\nHave you noticed that some garments can be worn in many different ways? Take a simple white shirt, for example – it can be tucked in or out, knotted at the waist, or worn over a camisole and left unbuttoned.\nEven with printed clothes, you can create different looks by colour-blocking or clashing patterns.\nLayering is another great way to create multiple looks with a limited number of garments, and there’s more than one way to accomplish it. The safe approach is to use outerwear like cardigans, jackets and blazers; or if you are adventurous and have a keen eye for fashion, experiment by wearing your garments in an atypical sequence such as a tank or T-shirt under a strappy dress, or wear a dress like a top by tucking it into a skirt.\nKwong said we don’t always have to stick with clean and minimalist pieces for the purpose of garment rotation. “Even with printed clothes, you can create different looks by colour-blocking or clashing patterns. If you wear a red top with fuchsia pants and primary-colour accessories, it’ll be totally different when you wear the same top with a black pencil skirt and gold jewellery. So, get creative with the material and colour combinations,” she explained.\nSPACE OUT YOUR OUTFITS\nIt’s common sense, of course – learn to rotate your outfits in a way that leaves enough days in between them so that you won’t be seen repeating looks too closely. Kwong added: “Try to space loud or bold pieces apart by a fortnight or so, and (take note of what you’re wearing) if you’re seeing a different group of friends or colleagues.”\nMost people (that you don’t see daily) won’t really notice or remember what you wore, unless it’s a particularly statement-making ensemble.\nYou might see certain friends on an infrequent basis – if so, try to make a mental note of what you wore the last time you met them so that you won’t wear the same ensemble again. Of course, most people (that you don’t see daily) won’t really notice or remember what you wore, unless it’s a particularly statement-making ensemble. In which case, you probably won’t have trouble remembering it.\nHow you wear your hair and makeup also plays a part in transforming a look, says Kwong. A strong red lip or smoky-eye look can completely change the vibes your outfit is channelling. The same applies to hairdos – wearing your hair up or in curls can create a polished or casual effect, depending on how you match your hairstyle to your outfit.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Career ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Could sharing and renting clothes be the new fashion norm in Singapore?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sustainability is gaining traction in the fashion world, and entrepreneur Raena Lim wants to help propel it forward with her company, Style Theory.\nAs the chief operating officer of the subscription‑based fashion rental start-up, which she co-founded with husband Christopher Halim in 2016, Lim hopes to change the way people consume fashion with a business model based on the sharing economy.\n\n\nSimilar to the concept of ride‑sharing with Grab and home‑sharing with Airbnb, Style Theory gives its customers in Singapore and Indonesia access to an “infinite wardrobe stored in the cloud” with over 30,000 items, including apparel and accessories, available for rental.\nAside from its online service, it also announced the opening of its first permanent retail store on Oct 18. Located at 313@Somerset, customers will be able to see and physical try and even rent over 300 apparel pieces and 30 designer bags ranging from casual pieces to formal and weekend wear and accessories.\n\n\nIt’s all in line with how Lim wants to shift people’s mindsets away from buying a new outfit every time they want to and towards the new norm of sharing and renting clothes.\nWhat’s the thinking behind this pursuit of a more responsible, eco‑conscious lifestyle? Lim shares a few of her thoughts.\nTHE IDEA FOR STYLE THEORY CAME THREE YEARS AGO\n""I realised how absurd it was to have a wardrobe full of clothes, but still feel like I had nothing to wear. This led me into a never-ending cycle of purchasing new clothes and still wanting more, and buying into an unsustainable consumer culture that so many of us have normalised.”\nIT’S A MODEL THAT COULD BE THE FUTURE OF FASHION\n“We’re confident it’s changing how people consume fashion, and bringing us closer to the end of today’s buy-and-throw-away culture. Essentially, we allow our customers to explore the latest trends without worrying about wardrobe clutter or the environmental waste that comes with fast fashion.""\nCONSTANT REMINDERS ARE NECESSARY\n""A quote that I live by is \'To know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded\' by American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson. So on difficult workdays, I eat chocolate ice cream and remind myself of the progress we’ve made over the past three years – we’ve built a great team, bettered many people’s lives, and helped to push society towards a better future.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      Eswari’s Deepavali tip: Put your phones away and enjoy time with loved ones
  </h1>, 'text': 'A year’s absence from television screens has only made viewers’ hearts grow fonder, Eswari Gunasagar is finding.\nAfter taking time away from acting to obtain a Masters degree in Mass Communications, the 29-year-old, known for her work in Vasantham productions as well as the Channel 5 drama Tanglin, will be making her return to showbiz with Thilaanaa, a spin-off from the drama Kalaba Kadhala in which her character takes centre stage.\n“I’m really looking forward to coming back to the media scene after a year,” Eswari told CNA Lifestyle. “Going back to school after eight years was definitely a challenge, but I’ve always liked the pressure, and the thirst for knowledge. If you asked me whether I would do it again – I really would. I think it was good also that I took a break from the media scene. I just needed to upgrade myself.”\nAt the same time, “I feel like I got a bit rusty this year, so I’m pretty excited to get back,” she said.\nMuch of her motivation comes from the encouragement she receives from her fans. “I think the most beautiful part of this whole media journey is definitely the people who have supported me – people I’ve never even seen before, but who send me messages telling me, ‘Oh, I miss you’; ‘I haven’t seen your face on TV for so long’; ‘When are you coming back?’; ‘Is everything okay with you?’. I think it’s their love and support that has kept me going for the past nine years,” she said.\nEven though it’s been a year since Tanglin, which marked her crossover into English-language productions, ended its run, people still call her Shruti. “And I still respond to it,” she said, with a laugh. “If I have a baby girl in future, I might name her Shruti!”\nAnd in spite of the fact that the Miss Vasantham 2011 finalist has been in the industry for almost a decade, “I still feel like I’m new to this whole thing,” she mused. That’s because she never lets herself get too comfortable, no matter what she may have achieved. “If I convince myself that I’m already there or I’m good enough, I will stop learning. I’ll stop putting in effort. And I don’t want that to happen. I just want to prove to myself that I can always be better,” she said. \xa0\nFOR A BETTER WORLD\nAs part of her quest to be better and to make a meaningful contribution to the world around her, Eswari has made it a point not to rest on her laurels. She recently launched a start-up business with fellow Tanglin actress Sherly Devonne Ng. Haus Of Green is a two-month-old distributor of eco-friendly grass straws.\nThe idea was hatched over a catch-up steamboat session, where Ng was using her own metal straw. “I was asking, ‘What are you planning to do?’” Eswari recounted. “I said, ‘I can’t imagine myself working for someone, in an eight-to-five desk job.’ I told her I wanted to do something, like a business of my own, but I wanted it to be meaningful. I don’t really feel passionate about fashion or selling clothes. She told me she had come across this article about a community in Vietnam using grass straws. You know how they say the best ideas come from the most normal conversations? It was exactly like that.”\nAfter meeting with producers in Vietnam, the duo are now marketing their product to F&B outlets. The straws are simply the hollow grass Lepironia Articulata that grows along the banks of the Mekong river, harvested and cut to a suitable length. They are a more eco-friendly and user-friendly solution than corn, rice, paper, bamboo or metal straws, Eswari shared, as they can be repurposed as fertiliser after use.\n“It’s not easy – price is always a concern for clients – but I hope we can break through,” she said, adding, “We’re giving part of the money we receive to the farmers’ community, which will help their kids go to school. We just want to make it meaningful.”\nThat’s not the only way in which Eswari hopes to make a positive impact. As she embarks on filming for Thilaanaa this month, in which she plays an Indian classical dancer who struggles with high-functioning depression, she hopes the role will encourage viewers who might have similar issues. “I’m very excited about it because this character is very close to my heart. I think high-functioning depression is something that is not really talked about. Through a drama, it might be more relatable,” she said.\nTo portray a dancer, she has been taking Bharatanatyam lessons for about two months. “I thought it would be easy. But it’s such an intricate dance. Every little thing counts – the way you stand, where you place your hands – everything is important. Every move, every sign, has a meaning,” she said.\nLIVING IN THE MOMENT\nDeepavali is one of Eswari’s favourite times of the year. There are outfits to be prepared, home improvements to be carried out and spring cleaning to be done.\nThat’s when the family comes together, said the second-youngest of four siblings. “We shop; we discuss what colour to paint the wall; what curtains to get. I’m pretty excited for this year because my brother has gotten married and moved out, and my sister just got married and will be moving out in December. So, I’m in charge now!”\nFamily traditions involve – needless to say – food, and the sharing of food. “Every Deepavali morning, my mother makes thosai, and there will always be mutton curry. After we have breakfast, we prepare kueh on a plate and give it to our neighbours. My younger sister and I always volunteer to go, because we get angpows in return! We’ve been doing it since we were young. And of course, at Chinese New Year or Hari Raya, we receive the same things. For example, my neighbour is Chinese and she always gives us loveletters and cartons of Mandarin oranges.”\nAs for her outfit, “Just yesterday, I went to Little India to get my blouse sewn. Shall I tell you what colour I’m going to wear this year? I’m going to wear grey. It’s a saree. I’m a very minimal person: I believe less is more.\n“Recently, I’ve grown fonder of sarees. I used to wear lehenga, when I was much younger, all the time. But now, saree is much more convenient because you can get ready-made saree – you don’t really have to tie it, you can just hook it on and you’re done in five minutes. Of course, it’s trendy to wear it with dhoti pants and other ways, but I think nothing beats the beauty of saree the way it is.”\nOn the day of the festival, “I tell myself every year that I should try to minimise the use of my phone. I managed to do it last year, so I didn’t really upload many pictures. I think at the end of the day, it’s all about enjoying the moment with your loved ones.”\nOne thing to be thankful for, she giggled, is that her relatives have promised not to nag her about getting married.\n“Recently, my sister got married. So my uncle was like, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not going to ask you when’s your turn.’ I was like, ‘Yes, please don’t!’ My dad is pretty chill. But my mum – you know, Indian mothers are concerned; they have relatives asking, ‘Why isn’t your daughter married yet? She’s getting old.’ And then my mum succumbs to that pressure. I know she’s probably praying now, like real hard! She even asked me, ‘Do you want me to see someone for you, like some arranged marriage thing?”But “I’m a hopeless romantic,” Eswari confessed. “I tell you, it’s Bollywood! Not me!”\nAnd anyway, this go-getter still has places to go. “I have things I want to do and achieve before I settle down. I think I shouldn’t rush into it,” she said. “I haven’t really met the right one yet, and I’m sure that when I do – when there are sparks and a connection – things will happen. But right now, I think my focus is my business, and of course the dramas that I do. Once the right person comes along, things will just happen.”\nCatch Thilaanaa starting Nov 4, Mondays to Thursdays at 9pm on Vasantham.

      Stay ahead of the curve with five of the hottest fashion trends for next year
  </h1>, 'text': ""In this day and age when individuality is a virtue celebrated on the catwalks, why do fashion trends still matter? After all, the idea of subscribing to, or dressing up according to what's dictated on the runways may seem a little outdated. But trends today have evolved beyond what's “in” or “out”. If anything, they represent fashion's continual refinement of concepts, messages and opinions that matter. There's still plenty to learn. Here are five agenda-setting trends to know for 2020.\n\n\nBRIEF ENCOUNTERHow do you make something as ubiquitous as a pair of shorts the talk of the season? By revving up its sex appeal even more – but of course! In-between preppy pleated shorts and bermudas paired with suit jackets, designers rolled out a desirable assortment of short shorts that showed plenty of toned gams. Try not to skip leg days at the gym henceforth.\nFANTASTIC DUOThere will be no shortage of pin-sharp suits to choose from come Spring/Summer 2020, but the ones that should go straight to the top of your wish list? Wildly colourful and richly patterned combinations that'll put a smile on everybody's faces. Whether Louis Vuitton's Belle Epoque interpretations or Marc Jacobs' dandy variations, these sprightly suits exude a joie de vivre spirit more than communicate a sense of power – a quality long associated with the masculine two-piece staple.\n\n\nINTO THE FOLD\nThe line separating the realms of haute couture and ready-to-wear has blurred at times, what with the high levels of skill and craftsmanship employed to create some of the most decadent pieces seen on the ready-to-wear runways. At the Spring/Summer 2020 shows, it wasn't the artful silhouettes or intricate embellishments that took our breaths away – instead, we couldn't get enough of the masterful drapes on equally divine dresses. A feast for the eyes, these delicate and couture-worthy layers were spotted at Versace, Mugler and Balmain.\n\n\nSPOT CHECK\nLike romantic florals and bold stripes, the polka dot motif is one that never really goes out of style. That said, designers never fail to cast it new light each time it is revived for the runways. At Moschino, for example, Jeremy Scott referenced Picasso and gave the spots an artistic makeover. Meanwhile, Celine's Hedi Slimane looked back to the sexually-charged nights of the 70s to reimagine the allure of polka dots for this millennium's league of club kids.\n\n\nURBAN LEGEND\nHas the athleisure movement run its course? Judging from the (non)action on the runways, perhaps so. However, that hasn't stopped designers from exploring how to seamlessly meld utility and functionality into a woman's wardrobe. For the upcoming season, they've perfected the balance and proposed a range of garments infused with minimalist leanings. Knitted one-shoulder dresses, form-fitting sweaters, and bralettes paired with leather skirts will be the new uniform for the contemporary city dweller.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Creative Capital: How this former optician started a Panama hat business in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'Bill Cain is a dapper man. With his white beard and ubiquitous Panama hat on his head, he reminds me of Ernest Hemingway. Like Hemingway, Bill is a long-time expatriate, having left his native Canada – because he hated the cold – back in 1981. He moved to Singapore in 1989 and has been here ever since.\nBill has always loved hats. Wearing one was something his father did, and something that became one of Bill’s own style signifiers when he came an adult. The Panama hat, being lightweight and cooling, is arguably the most sensible hat for the tropics. But try as he might, Bill could not find one regionally that met his standards.\nBill’s career was in the mobility and relocation businesses. That meant a lot of travel and as well as access to other businesses around the world. A decades-long hunt for the best possible Panama hat eventually led him to Ecuador. This then led to the establishment of Hat of Cain in 2012.\n\n\nThroughout the infancy stages of the brand, Bill focused on building a strong supply chain of distributors who sourced from the finest weavers in Ecuador. After six years, and confident that Hat of Cain was producing some of the very best hats on the market, Bill decided to retire from his day job and focus entirely on Hat of Cain.\nMobility wasn’t Bill’s first vocation actually. Before he left Canada, he was an optician. When we met, he told me one of the things he loves most about his current job actually harkens back to those days as an optician. He enjoys making people feel good and confident through their accessories. For him, seeing a customer beam when putting on the perfect hat is akin to helping someone discover the right spectacles that suit his or her face and personality.\nTo check out the collection, head over to Bill’s salon along Joo Chiat Road. You’ll most likely find him there savouring a fine whisky and cigar, planning his next collection of hats. \xa0\nOF ALL THE MANY THINGS IN THE WORLD, HOW DID YOU END UP WANTING TO OWN A HAT COMPANY?\nI was preparing to exit the corporate world after being in the moving industry for 30 years. Back in the day when I was an optician, I enjoyed making people look and feel good about themselves with great products that I fully believed in. I’ve always loved hats and not being able to buy a good quality hat in Asia prompted me to do something about it.\nWHAT WERE THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS’ REACTION TO YOU STARTING THE BUSINESS?\nMy wife, Charlotte, knew about my love for Panama hats and encouraged me to follow my passion. And to do something\xa0 about it. \xa0Over breakfast with the family one day in 2012, we put our thinking caps on and decided go for it. We set up a company and aptly named it Hat of Cain. From there, my daughter and son-in-law assisted with designing the logo and website. The business was up and running in no time, thanks to the great support from family and friends.\nPLEASE TELL ME MORE ABOUT PANAMA HATS? WHAT IS THEIR HISTORY AND ARE ALL PANAMA HATS FROM PANAMA?\nThe history of the iconic Panama hat should be fairly straight forward. Or so one would think. As far back as the 16th century, the making of Panama hats centered around a cottage industry within the coastal communities of Ecuador. In the 19th Century, the straw hats were traded through the Isthmus in Panama. That was the gateway to the eastern United States and Europe where their popularity grew thanks in part to visiting hat-makers. \xa0Well-dressed men and women in the USA and Europe were captivated by these finely woven hats. The hats were coined the “Panama hat” on account of their point of trade rather than their country of origin.\n\n\nWhen Theodore Roosevelt was photographed wearing a Panama hat whilst visiting the construction of the Panama Canal, he instantly elevated the image of the Panama hat with its signature black band across its circumference to iconic status. From then on, this became the epitome of elegance and sophistication amongst the social elite, part of their de rigueur attire in their pursuit for new world domains and territories. Its popularity grew and this trademark look found its way into popular media and culture through films as personified by the silver screen’s heroes and adventurers.\nWHAT SETS A HIGH QUALITY PANAMA HAT APART FROM OTHERS? HOW CAN A LAYPERSON TELL?\nThe best way to draw a comparison is to regard the Panama hats like fine carpets; the finer the weave the longer it takes to produce and the more valuable. On closer inspection, you can discern the subtle difference in texture and fineness of straw.\nThere are as many as fifteen people involved in the process of making a Panama hat. It begins with harvesting the shoots from the Carludovica (toquilla) palm which are grown on the coastal region of Ecuador. The shoots are cooked in boiling water as this process will cause the green shoots to lose their colour. They are then cured in sulphur before leaving them to dry out under the sun.\n\n\nThe straws are then handed over to the weavers. Depending on the fineness of the intended hat, the weavers will split the straw accordingly. Once the straws are fully woven, the hoods are then sold to exporters where the hats are blocked into shape. The hats are given finishing touches such as sewing of the sweatband and headband and therefore ready for export globally.\nIS SINGAPORE A HAT-WEARING COUNTRY?\nSingapore is most ideal to wear a Panama hat, with its perennial summer and being on the same latitude as Ecuador. Panama hats are great for sun protection. And they give you that extra bit of style. \xa0\nI’VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY JUST DON’T LOOK GOOD IN HATS. WHAT’S YOUR TAKE ON THIS?\nI think everyone can look good in a hat, given the right style and fit. People often say they don’t look good in a hat because they might have not gotten the right advice on what is suitable and the correct fit. There is a hat out there for everyone, it just takes a little more time to find that perfect hat.\nI usually say, “Well, let’s try on a few styles just for fun!” In most cases, we are able to find one that is just right!\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGE RUNNING HAT OF CAIN THAT YOU’VE HAD TO OVERCOME?\nIntroducing the Panama hat to Singapore and the regional markets before the social media wave. It was a lot of work to create and increase awareness of the hat’s history, culture and tradition and the artisanal efforts that go into making these beautiful products. In 2016, these artisans received their much deserved recognition when UNESCO inducted them into its\xa0list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. That helped a lot!\n\n\nAND WHAT HAS BEEN THE PROUDEST?\xa0\nHaving my own hat salon and the recognition of Hat of Cain as the go-to hat brand in Singapore. Reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, Google and other social media platforms. I am grateful for the social media exposure the brand has received from people wearing our hats and tagging us in their travel adventures.\nWHERE CAN PEOPLE FIND YOUR HATS? ARE YOU AVAILABLE GLOBALLY OR JUST HERE IN SINGAPORE FOR NOW?\nWe are stocked in several locations around Singapore such as selected Benjamin Barker outlets, the Raffles Hotel, Six Senses Maxwell, Metro Paragon and Tanjong Beach Club.\nOur hats are also available at Nihi Sumba Resort, Sanchaya, Nikoi and Cempadek islands in Indonesia and the Tavern in Denmark. We ship globally for those who can’t visit us in Singapore.\nWHO ARE YOUR CORE CUSTOMERS? HOW DO PEOPLE FIND YOU?\nOur customer base is a mix of locals, expats and tourists. Most people find us via social media, through word-of-mouth and Google.\nI NOTICED YOU OFFER BESPOKE SERVICES. IS THIS POPULAR? DO YOU GET EXTREME OR OUT-OF-THE-BOX REQUESTS?\nWe offer customisation across colours and grades; this usually takes up to four months. But our most popular customisation involves changing the headband to the customer’s favourite colour, debossing their initials and adding feathers. Fortunately, those things can be done within 20 minutes.\nWe do have customers who like one-of-a-kind hats and that gives me a chance to be creative. I torch hats, add nails, matches, cut and re-stitch them to give them that vintage look.\nYOU’VE BEEN HERE FOR THREE DECADES NOW. HOW HAS SINGAPORE CHANGED IN THE YEARS YOU’VE BEEN HERE?\xa0\nWhen I first visited Singapore in 1981, the only places you could go to enjoy a beer or Western cuisine were either the hotels or the membership clubs. Look at Singapore today, hosting Michelin-starred restaurants, world renowned rooftop bars... Singapore continues to set the bar for the best living standards not only in Asia but for the rest of the world when it comes to lifestyle, health and personal security, making Singapore a very desirable and cosmopolitan city to live in.\nDO YOU THINK SINGAPORE IS WELCOMING OF CREATIVE ENTREPRENEURS? IS IT HARD TO BUILD A BRAND FROM SCRATCH HERE?\nSingapore is a great place for entrepreneurs to be based in because of its effective business infrastructure and advanced e-commerce support. It has been very successful in attracting a lot of foreign talent to make Singapore their business headquarters. However, we fall behind our neighbouring countries when it comes to embracing and recognising our local, talented, creative entrepreneurs. The typical expectation of a career here is to excel in the corporate world and creative takes a back seat.\n\n\nIn my opinion, building a brand from scratch takes persistence and discipline. The key is to keep a healthy balance sheet and grow a community of like-minded people who will appreciate your business as they become your brand ambassadors.\nYOUR WIFE STARTED BOUTIQUE FAIRS BACK IN 2002, MAKING YOU BOTH BIG SUPPORTERS OF SMALL BUSINESSES HERE IN SINGAPORE. FROM BOTH YOUR PERSPECTIVES, WHAT’S YOUR TAKE ON THE LIFE CYCLE OF INDEPENDENT LIFESTYLE BRANDS?\xa0\nIndependent lifestyle brands can have longevity if they have the right product, a sound business model and the right positioning and branding that resonate with the right target audiences. There are increasingly more independent lifestyle brands than there were 10 years ago. E-commerce and pop-ups such as Boutique Fairs have been a boon to these up and coming independent brands as they give small businesses a head start while keeping overheads low yet giving them a platform to connect and interact with their customers.\nWHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE A YOUNG INDEPENDENT RETAIL BRAND SUCCESSFUL?\xa0\nIt takes vision and a solid business plan, you need to find the niche that will set your brand apart and have the drive and most of all healthy working capital.\nDOES YOUR FAMILY FEEL MORE SINGAPOREAN OR CANADIAN?\nWe have lived in Singapore over 30 years. Raising two daughters here and living here for most part of our lives has actually made this our home. \xa0Not Canada.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Wedding day hacks: What a bride needs to fix a fashion or beauty emergency
  </h1>, 'text': 'Every bride dreams of a perfect wedding, but reality is all too often filled with unexpected incidents that can sometimes threaten to spoil this once-in-a-lifetime occasion. Want your big day to go off without a hitch as far as possible? It’s important for you to prepare for potential situations of trouble.\nYou might not be able to control things like the weather, but you can certainly stop a fashion or beauty emergency from becoming a disaster. A kit of essential tools is what you need to deal with the following problems that might happen. Don’t underestimate the importance of these small items – some of them can make or break your enjoyment of your wedding day.\n\n\nMAKEUP BAG TO AVOID A MELTDOWN\nYour makeup bag is arguably the most important item in your bridal emergency kit. Touch-ups are absolutely necessary, especially in our heat and humidity. Even if your makeup artist has done all he or she can to ensure that your bridal look stays put, you’ll likely need lip-colour touch-ups, and to blot away oil that breaks through on your T-zone later in the day.\nHere are some essentials you need to have with you at all times: Your lip product of choice for the day, concealer, compact powder, facial blotters (or a makeup sponge for sopping up oil), face mist (in case your makeup gets cakey), makeup remover wipes and a basic neutral eyeshadow palette (as well as the relevant brushes required) in case inevitable tears mar your eye makeup look. On that note, it’s also a good idea to have anti-redness eye drops on hand.\nHAIRSPRAY FOR OUTDOOR WEDDINGS AND PARTIES\nHumidity causes straightened hair to frizz and curled hair to droop, and is bad news for voluminous up-dos. If you’re having an al fresco wedding party, hairspray is particularly important for keeping your coiffure the way your hairstylist intended it to be. Keep a travel-sized can by your side in case you need a quick patch-up job.\nOther items you might also need include invisible dry shampoo to keep your scalp feeling fresh and hair smelling great, as well as bobby pins to tuck in stray strands.\nSTYLING KIT FOR ACCIDENTAL RIPS\nStains, rips, loose buttons and broken zips are all potential problems that can happen to your pristine white dress on the big day. You might be extra\xa0cautious about what you do and how you move about while you’re in your gown, but the people around you might not be as careful.\nWhich is why you need the tools to rescue a spill or eliminate a sole mark on your immaculate train left by an errant foot. A little help from a stain-removing pen can go a very long way, while safety pins and a sewing kit that’s stocked with sufficient white thread can often save the day.\n\n\nBAND-AIDS AND FOOT BALM FOR SORE FEET\nIt’s crucial to break in your wedding heels before the big day because we all know that a pair of painful or ill-fitting shoes can thoroughly ruin a girl’s mood, and you definitely don’t want it happening on this occasion.\nTrying shoes out at the store doesn’t always give you an accurate indication of how they fit, since our feet will swell after we wear shoes for a while. You don’t have to actually wear your bridal heels out before your wedding day, of course – walk around in them at home for short periods of time to test if they fit properly or cause any discomfort. Get the necessary adjustments to make them wearable, whether it’s getting them professionally stretched by a cobbler or adding shoe inserts.\nStill, you’ll need to prep for blister emergencies on the actual day – pack Band-Aids, a tube of anti-chafing balm for feet (Vaseline or clear lip balm can also be used as a substitute), and more shoe inserts just in case you need them.\nMINTS OR CANDIES TO KEEP YOUR BREATH FRESH\nIt sure is tough being a bride: You might not be able to eat proper, full meals throughout the big day, and you’d probably be trying to drink as little water as you can manage to avoid having to go to the bathroom as far as possible.\nAnd when you don’t eat or drink enough water for a long period of time, bad breath is bound to occur. Pack mints or candies (that don’t leave coloured marks on your tongue, might we add) and convenient snacks for an instant energy boost and to keep your breath smelling fresh.\nDISPOSABLE WIPES FOR SWEATY SITUATIONS\nFor brides who are prone to breaking out in sweat, portable packs of disposable wipes are a godsend. Regular tissues and wet wipes, which can deal with a whole host of bridal emergencies are a must to pack, of course, and so are powder wipes that will leave skin feeling cool, dry, lightly scented and refreshed.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Beauty ']}"

      Film, fashion and fragrance: Actress Chloe Sevigny creates her first scent
  </h1>, 'text': 'Chloe Sevigny’s voicemail message – a four-second clip from HBO show Mad Men – is a deadpan but fitting one for the actress who has lived in the city since 1993. “This is ridiculous. If I’m going to die, I want to die in Manhattan.”\nShe is currently in Italy, filming Luca Guadagnino’s new HBO show We Are Who We Are. Speaking to me from a coastal town near Venice, she says the episode, which aired in 2010, struck a chord. The message “is like one million years old, I’ve had the same voicemail ever since then,” she said. “But I [too] hate being away from home. I get very homesick. Even if I’m in America, I don’t like to be away from New York.”\nShe will remain in Italy until November, when the eight-part drama written and directed by the Call Me By Your Name director finally wraps; she’s also recently shot Melina Matsoukas’ Queen & Slim. Sevigny spends so much time away from her apartment in SoHo that “being in New York feels like a vacation. But everybody’s gotta work right?” she laughed. “Unless you’ve got a rich husband. Which I don’t. So . . . ”\nSevigny shot to fame in 1995 following her debut in Larry Clark’s indie film Kids, which catapulted her to It Girl (and youth style icon) status; today, she keeps her finger in many creative pies. Aside from starring in a roster of high-profile, independent flicks, she has recently turned her hand to directing; she’s also designed an opticals collection with US eyewear label Warby Parker; walked in Simone Rocha’s Autumn/Winter 2019 runway show.\n\n\nAt 44, Sevigny retains the same sense of cool that has trailed her since the 90s. Back then, young girls the world over wanted to emulate her quirky wardrobe, sourced from thrift shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn. “I always wore second-hand clothes growing up, it was instilled by my parents,” she said. “I found comfort in it. The thrill of the hunt.” She was so ahead of the fashion curve that during a New Yorker interview in 1994, while perched at an outdoor table in the East Village, two teens asked Sevigny where her jelly shoes were from. She told them, then promptly took herself – and the journalist – to Chinatown to buy new shoes, lest everybody start wearing jellies.\n“I try and frequent independent stores for everything,” said the actress. Her Little Flower fragrance, naturally, follows a less familiar retail route than other celebrity scents to launch in the saturated perfume market. Rather than launching at a mainstream department store (or, as Kim Kardashian did, on Instagram), Sevigny’s perfume will debut exclusively at Dover Street Market (DSM) – the cult high-fashion shop founded in 2004 by Comme des Garcons’ Rei Kawakubo – in Los Angeles, London and, of course, New York. “The designers [DSM] carry have a real point of view,” she said. “It’s a place where people can go if they are looking for something unique and different from the mainstream, and the fragrances that they carry are complicated and offer a different experience.”\n\n\nA post shared by Chloë Sevigny (@chloessevigny) on Aug 23, 2019 at 7:45am PDT\n\n\n“I try and frequent independent stores for everything.” – Chloe Sevigny\nSevigny has always loved fragrance; growing up, she used to collect perfume bottles. “It was access to a more glamorous world for me when I was a little girl in Connecticut, I was obsessed with the different shapes and colours, the designs and fonts of the packaging,” she said. As a teenager, she wore Benetton Colors eau de toilette, which smelled of synthetic citrus and lavender. She’s since upgraded to natural ingredients and now exclusively wears Little Flower, for which she partnered with the LA-based artisan perfumer Regime des Fleurs – the scent has top notes of rose, blackcurrant and tea. It’s the brand’s first celebrity fragrance. “It’s owned by two friends of mine [Alia Raza and Ezra Woods] and it’s independent,” she said.\n\n\nRaza and Woods “collected around 20 different bottles of rose that I had used in the past, and we would smell it and they would identify the specific [notes] I liked in each of these fragrances,” she said, referring to Rose by Comme des Garcons and Rose Ikebana by Hermes. “They had the vernacular, and they guided me. It was like learning about wine.” Sevigny wore each sample concoction for days or weeks at a time to narrow the final scent down to her favourite. “Little Flower was the one I kept going back to, that people would comment on and say they loved the smell when I went out,” she said. Launching it in DSM was a strategic move. “I think the Dover Street customer is maybe more familiar with me, and familiar with Regime des Fleurs,” she said.\nWhile Sevigny still shops almost exclusively second hand – today preferring “gently worn high fashion from consignment stores” like The Real Real as opposed to thrifting through the Salvation Army’s racks which, she says, are “full of fast fashion” – she often goes to DSM to people watch too. “All the kids that work there look so wild, it’s fun to look at the customers and look at the employees and the insane outfits they put together,” she said. “That whole experience is unparalleled in shopping.” Back home, one of her favourite pastimes is to sit in Tompkins Square Park in New York to watch what people are wearing. It’s a somewhat playful reversal of the fashion gaze; Sevigny has been an enduring subject of style scrutiny and admiration since she was 18.\nIt’s a hobby she misses when on location; along with frequenting her favourite sandwich shop Olive’s for a smoked salmon bagel – “I eat there almost every day” – buying the local newspapers in print, visiting Union Square Market and her favourite Nolita-based florist to fill her apartment with “all kinds of weird stuff, like sweet potato vines, or really specific rose breeds.”\nUntil she lands back on her beloved island, however, she will have to make do with her own rosy scent. But it’s not all bad. “Little Flower smells like a rose garden, or like cutting a fresh rose,” she says. “Who doesn’t love perfume?”\n“Little Flower smells like a rose garden, or like cutting a fresh rose.

      Heads up: These are the clothes that you will be wearing in 2020 and beyond
  </h1>, 'text': ""What will you wear as we approach another decade of the 21st century? If the recently concluded Spring/Summer 2020 fashion month was any indication, designers made a strong case for clothes that'll bring back the joy of dressing up.\nBut these inspiring choices won't just fire up your mornings with vim and vigour, they're worthy closet companions that'll see you through another 10 years – and beyond. Here, our top 10 picks of the season.\nCHANEL\nVirginie Viard has had time to ease herself into the driver's seat at Chanel. There was a cruise collection which she presented in May, followed by an haute couture showing two months later. Both collections have shown her firm grasp of the House codes.\nSpring/Summer 2020 marked her ready-to-wear debut for the Parisian maison, and she's proven that all those years working alongside Karl Lagerfeld has made her the best person to steer Chanel forward.\nIn the tradition of Chanel shows, Viard had her team install a set modelled after the rooftops of Parisian houses, on which her troop of models slinked across like curious felines exploring the hidden corners of Paris.\nThe clothes had the same playful air to them: Tweed took the form of girlish playsuits, while shorts anchored the collection with youthful zest. Ruffled dresses and gowns in black and white combinations gave Viard's newest outing a hint of extravagance.\n\n\nDRIES VAN NOTEN X CHRISTIAN LACROIX\nBelgian designer Dries Van Noten began conceptualising his latest collection with exuberance and extravagance in his mind.\n“I was constantly drawn to the Eighties and Nineties... to couture, to beauty, to audacity, to joy,” recalled Van Noten in a post-show interview with AnOther magazine's Susannah Frankel.\nIt soon dawn on him that his mood board was filled with the works of Christian Lacroix, so Van Noten rang the couturier up to enquire about a possible partnership: “I was so happy when he immediately said yes.”\nWhat transpired after is the stuff of legend; the coming together of two brilliant minds that will surely be talked about in the years to come. How's that for the power of fashion?\nGIVENCHY\nEver since Clare Waight Keller took over the reins at Givenchy, she's brought with her a restrained sophistication to the brand – qualities that were on full display in her Spring/Summer 2020 collection.\nA belted jumpsuit in creamy beige, a sultry bra top-and-skirt combination, plus a voluminous dress dipped in the shade of rich chocolate were some of her key proposals for the new season.\nDitto denim: A perennial wardrobe favourite with humble beginnings, the workwear fabric went ultra luxe as part of Waight Keller's masterful fusion of 90s New York minimalism with old-world Parisian charm.\nJIL SANDER\nA brand synonymous with cutting-edge minimalism, Jil Sander has, up until recent seasons, struggled to find its footing since the departure of Raf Simons (the short-lived comeback of its eponymous founder in 2012 certainly didn't help its cause either).\nNot anymore. Now in the creative hands of husband-wife duo Luke and Lucie Meier, the brand is undergoing a period of rejuvenation and the results have been stellar.\nFor the new season, the Meiers engineered all sorts of beautiful garments (streamlined coats and flowy dresses were standouts), then put a crafty and homespun spin to the sublime clothes by adding raffia as finishing touches.\nLOUIS VUITTON\nNicolas Ghesquiere is a lauded designer who keeps an eye on the past to craft wardrobes for the future. It came as no surprise then, that history once more provided the impetus for Ghesquiere's latest Louis Vuitton collection.\nThe designer zeroed in on the Belle Epoque, a period marked by economic growth and the flourish of the arts. “We wanted to explore notions about what’s outdated and old-fashioned, and nostalgia for a time we can only dream about, and how to make it all relevant for today,” Ghesquiere said in a statement.\nWhat followed was a collection filled with dandy overtures: Wide-lapel suits worn over shirts with even wider collars, exaggerated shoulders on blouses with bell sleeves, and an assortment of colourful sweaters decorated with reimagined boutonnieres.\n\n\nMARC JACOBS\nThe anniversary of the September 11 attacks often lend a sombre tone to the proceedings at New York Fashion Week. American designers have been known to include tributes in their collections; every little gesture a stoic reminder of a world that once was and could've been.\nIt was the case for Marc Jacobs, whose Spring/Summer 2020 show notes also listed the fact that he'd held a star-studded runway show the night before the attacks. Eighteen years on, in the wake of another political and environmental turmoil, Jacobs is determined to lift spirits with his collection.\n“This show, like that show [Spring/Summer 2001] is a celebration of life, joy, equality, individuality, optimism, happiness, indulgence, dreams and a future unwritten as we continue to learn from our past and the history of fashion,” he explained.\nJacobs leafed through the oeuvres from the likes of the late Karl Lagerfeld, Doris Day, and Anita Pallenberg to concoct a collection filled with every hue from the rainbow (and then some), arresting prints and patterns, and irrepressible charm. Bravo.\nMUGLER\nBody, body, body. In a season where lingerie has emerged as an unexpected trend, Casey Cadwallader's creations at Mugler were frontrunners.\nOf course, this being a House famous for its sculptural tailoring, Cadwallader's versions skirted around the usual tropes of intimate wear. Cadwallader added aerodynamic jackets, sleek bodysuits and sexy draped dresses to the mix – modelled of course, on a diverse cast of personalities.\nPRADA\nSimplicity was the order of the day at Prada Spring/Summer 2020, a collection which saw Miuccia Prada dial back to celebrate the “power of women over clothing, and style over fashion.”\nStripped away of the extra layers and excessive embellishments that have become signature Prada stylistic touches, the clothes (think tailored jackets instilled with 70s elan and delicate dresses in muted tones) spoke volumes in their quiet elegance.\n\n\nRICHARD QUINN\nLike the gorgeous blooms on his creations, Richard Quinn's burgeoning career has blossomed with equal promise. Ever since he nabbed top honours at the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design last year, Quinn has quickly established himself as London's favourite maximalist.\nSpring/Summer 2020 saw Quinn tread familiar ground – except he's supersized the puffy sleeves, juxtaposed the romantic florals with wild leopard print, and dialled up the theatrics with dramatic shapes and volumes on his gowns.\nVALENTINO\nOf late, Pierpaolo Piccioli's works for Valentino have elicited tears, rapturous applause and standing ovations for their sheer beauty. Naturally, the bar is set higher and higher with each season, but Piccioli has managed to stay on top of the game each time.\nIt was business as usual for the Italian maestro this season, who continued his application of haute couture techniques in the ready-to-wear realm.\nThe proceedings began with a passage of immaculate white dresses (Piccoli referred to them as a study on “shape and volume” in post-show interviews), and those segued into exquisite confections bedecked with dazzling floral prints. The collection's high points came by way of acid neon hues, which gave ethereal gowns an urban and cosmopolitan contrast.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': ""Another fashion season has drawn to a close amidst increasing political and climate uncertainty. Paris, the epicentre of fashion and its creative apex, delivered collections that reiterated fashion's role in capturing the zeitgeist.\nIn light of the green movement sweeping across the world, brands from the French fashion capital took steps to mitigate their impact on the environment, be it by showing collections crafted from upcycled fabrics or designing runway sets that can be repurposed for greater use.\nThrough it all, beauty, magic and a sense of escapism prevailed. Here were some of the week's top moments.\nTHE FRENCH CONNECTION\nAnthony Vaccarello has mastered the art of staging blockbuster runway shows that coalesce his vision for Saint Laurent and the House's reputable standing in fashion's ecosystem. Saint Laurent is, after all, a beacon of Parisian style so greatly admired the world over.\xa0\nFor Spring/Summer 2020, Vaccarello rolled out a collection that demonstrated his firm grasp of the House codes while the Eiffel Tower – another symbol of France –loomed in the distance. It was as French as it got: Sequinned jackets, bohemian dresses, sensual shorts and slouchy boots that evoked the hedonistic 70s were illuminated by swirling columns of light rays that stretched into the vastness of the night sky.\nCAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?\nThe New York Times called it “the collaboration to end all collaborations” and we couldn't have said it better ourselves: Christian Lacroix and Dries van Noten's partnership is one for the history books. It was also Spring/Summer 2020's best-kept secret, what with news of the collaboration heavily guarded during the five months it took to produce the stunning array of voluminous skirts, jacquard suits and feathered dresses. A rare fashion moment that was pure in its intentions, divine in its execution, and exuberant in its mood. What’s not to love?\nGARDEN OF EDEN\xa0\nIn a season where sustainability was a topic on everyone's minds, how does one organise a runway extravaganza that doesn't detract from the ongoing conversation? Dior's Maria Grazia Chiuri turned to Coloco, a collective founded in 1999 that consists of botanists, gardeners, landscape designers and urban planners, to dream up a show space that doubled up as an inclusive garden.\xa0\nHorticulture is integral to the story of Dior – founder Christian Dior and his sister Catherine (she provided a starting point for Chiuri this season) were avid gardeners. The 164 potted trees that lined the Dior catwalk will be planted in projects and urban groves across Paris, further underscoring fashion's responsibility towards the environment.\n\n\nCOUNCIL MEETING\nWhether at Balenciaga or Vetements, Demna Gvasalia has never shied away from using his runway shows to make a statement. For Spring/Summer 2020, Gvasalia explored the notions of power dressing through a presentation rife with political undertones. First, there was the set: A sprawling, Congress-like space coloured in a shade of blue resembling the one found on the EU flag. The cast? An assembly of models and professionals from all walks of life who powered down the circular runway with urgency in their steps. Gvasalia outfitted them in his interpretations of retooled uniforms accordingly: There were austere suits, bold-shouldered dresses, and coats that ran the gamut, from long and lean to bulbous and exaggerated.\nDENIM... BUT MAKE IT HAUTE\nDelicate crochet; playful polka dots; dramatic puffy sleeves... these are some of the trends you'll be hearing about come Spring/Summer 2020. Paris, however, demonstrated once more the enduring appeal of the classics. At the centre of all the attention? Denim.\xa0\nAt Celine, immaculate bootcut jeans served as a backbone to Hedi Slimane's retelling of 70s chic. Over at Givenchy, Clare Waight Keller cut the hardworking fabric into all forms of accoutrements as part of her mediation between the French bourgeoise and New York's gritty energy in the 90s.\nWHO'S THAT GIRL?\nJust when we thought Paris Fashion Week would sail by with nary a viral moment in sight... Bam! The Internet lit up with clips of a woman clambering onto the Chanel runway to join the rest of the brand's leggy posse for their finale walk, before Gigi Hadid swooped in and stopped her in her tracks. The intruder has since been identified as Marie Benoliel, a comedian and YouTuber who also goes by the moniker Marie S'Infiltre. Guess she really did live up to her name...\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Paris ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Forever 21 files for bankruptcy, no plans to close Singapore store
  </h1>, 'text': 'LOS ANGELES: Fast-fashion retailer Forever 21 Inc filed for bankruptcy late on Sunday (Sep 29), joining a growing list of brick-and-mortar companies that have succumbed to the onslaught of online sellers such as Amazon.com Inc and ever-changing fashion trends.\nForever 21, which popularised trendy and inexpensive clothing, has fallen out of favour with shoppers due to strong competition from other retailers such as H&M and Zara.\nAdding to its problems, younger and more environmentally conscious shoppers are now choosing brands that ethically source garments instead of retailers that use cheap fabrics to make T-shirts that are snapped up for US$5.\n""The brand (Forever 21) has lost much of the excitement and oomph, which is critical to driving footfall and sales,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm GlobalData Retail.\n\n\nForever 21, which has 815 stores in 57 countries, said the restructuring will allow it to focus on the profitable core part of its operations and shut stores in some international locations.\nIt has requested approval to close up to 178 US\xa0stores, with decisions as to which outlets it will close still pending.\nForever 21 still expects a significant number of its stores in the United States to remain open and does not expect to exit any major markets in the country.\nFounded in 1984, the teen apparel retailer plans to close most of its stores in Asia and Europe but would continue operations in Mexico and Latin America, it said.\nThere are no plans to close its Singapore store, which is at 313@Somerset,\xa0the retailer told CNA.

      Meet the Insta-famous personal shopper you need to have on your speed dial
  </h1>, 'text': ""Fashion is in the thick of a revolution. The explosive rise of Instagram has disrupted its traditional model of operation, transferring power to the everyday person who owns a smartphone and is savvy enough to craft an engaging online persona.\xa0\nInfluencers boasting large numbers of followers are now fashionʼs new gatekeepers, while top accounts such as @diet_prada and @esteelaundry have gone from relative obscurity to becoming the fashion and beauty industries' biggest whistle-blowers.\n\n\nA post shared by GABRIEL WALLER (@gabwaller) on Jul 3, 2019 at 4:03am PDT\nWith one billion active users logged on to Instagram every month, the social media giant offers a myriad of possibilities. One person who has reaped the benefits of its unprecedented reach is Gabriel Waller. A personal shopper based in Sydney, Australia, the 25-year-old was already proving her worth at sourcing for high demand or sold out items when English actress-model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley enlisted her help to source for a Celine coat. Pleased with Wallerʼs efforts at successfully locating a piece, the famous English actress-model showed off her latest purchase on Instagram with Waller mentioned in it.\n\n\nA post shared by Rosie HW (@rosiehw) on Jan 17, 2019 at 10:21am PST\nIn that split second, Wallerʼs name went viral. Her phone lit up with client requests from all corners of the globe – a testament of Instagramʼs might. “Itʼs all down to the digital revolution that weʼre living in today. It has the ability to transform businesses overnight,” she told CNA Luxury about that pivotal moment that opened more doors for her. “That is huge.”\nCOVER GIRL \nNever one to blend into the crowd, a career in fashion has always been in the cards for Waller. “Growing up in a small town here in Australia, I have always put a lot of focus on being unique,” she recalled. Waller flew thousands of miles to Los Angeles and enrolled herself in a fashion buying course. In 2016, while dipping her toes into the world of personal shopping, Waller saw an increased demand for pieces that were not available in the Australian market. Armed with valuable contacts she made in America, Waller returned to Sydney and launched her business two years later.\nEven when she was setting up the framework for her brand, Wallerʼs penchant for taking the path less travelled never left her. “I never had the desire to follow, I wanted to move in my own lane,” Waller added. That desire to do things differently also explains why sheʼs always drawn to brands that are stepping outside of the box and blazing their own trails. On designers sheʼs keeping tabs on, Waller said: “The incredible designs of Rokh, Peter Do and Bevza are all on my radar currently. But in terms of brands that are creating quite the revival throughout social media, you can’t look past Bottega Veneta.” Waller lists the Pouch – a handy clutch created by the Italian marqueʼs new Creative Director Daniel Lee – as a hot favourite.\n\n\nA post shared by GABRIEL WALLER (@gabwaller) on Aug 29, 2019 at 1:05am PDT\nWallerʼs hunt for Huntington-Whiteleyʼs Celine coat may have been a career highlight, but if thereʼs another moment that has left an impression on Waller, it was when she travelled to Paris for the launch of Chanelʼs blockbuster spring/summer 2019 collection. “It was unlike anything I have experienced before. I knew that this particular collection would explode globally,” she recalls. The collection – Karl Lagerfeldʼs last for the Parisian fashion powerhouse before his passing – featured clothes that offered a tantalising glimpse of a sun-soaked summer. A crisp cropped shirt modelled by Kaia Gerber on the runway was an instant hit. “Iʼve never worked so hard and fast to get as many of those pieces that I did,” Waller said. “It was mind-blowing.”\n\n\nA post shared by GABRIEL WALLER (@gabwaller) on Mar 4, 2019 at 1:47am PST\nA MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE\nFashion is an act of self-expression; the clothes we throw on our backs communicate our identities. In Wallerʼs case, knowing when to put her preferences aside and step into the shoes of her clients has become an essential part of her job. Itʼs a fine balance, but Waller conceded that is what makes her job exciting and fulfilling: “Each sourcing request can be completely different. I can be searching for a vintage Chanel piece one moment and looking for a new season Bottega Veneta dress the next. It keeps me on my toes, knowing that each day I’m dealing with the unexpected and that little hint of mystery.”\n\n\nA post shared by GABRIEL WALLER (@gabwaller) on Dec 14, 2018 at 2:11pm PST\nTrust is a vital component in the relationship between personal shopper and client. But for those whoʼre looking to engage the services of one, Waller has this advice to share: “Make sure that who you are working with cares for you and your needs. No matter what, I always strive to put the ‘personal’ in personal shopping. I want to connect with my clients on a personal level, I want to know what is going on in their lives, and that is because I genuinely care.”\nUltimately, Wallerʼs services go beyond providing mere convenience. In this digital age we live in where everything happens at a breakneck speed, time has become the greatest luxury of all. “Time is – and will be – one of our most valuable assets as we move into the future, and that is something I can give to my clients by doing what I do,” she said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     shopping ', '     Instagram ', '     fashion ', '     Profiles ', ""     Women's Style "", ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      Queen Victoria’s watch and other horological treasures at Patek Philippe’s exhibition
  </h1>, 'text': ""Owning a Patek Philippe timepiece is a rare privilege reserved for an exclusive few. Rarer still, is the opportunity to get up close and personal with horological treasures from the 180-year-old Swiss watchmaker from Geneva.\nFrom Saturday (Sep 28), visitors to the Patek Philippe Watch Art Grand Exhibition at the Marina Bay Sands Theatre will be granted a unique, behind-the-scenes look into the last independent, family-owned watchmaking manufacturer and discover, first hand, why its timepieces are so highly prized by collectors the world over.\n\n\nSingapore is the fifth city to host this exhibition after Dubai, Munich, London and New York, and it is the largest at 1,800sqm; unsurprising given Singapore’s reputation for its relatively high concentration of watch connoisseurs.\nThe exhibition, which is open to public, runs till Oct 13. It is organised into 10 themed rooms, each meticulously curated to house models that best showcase Patek Philippe’s watchmaking expertise.\nThe most venerated of which, perhaps, are to be found in the Museum Room.\nThese exceptional rarities have been flown in from the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva, considered one of the world's foremost horology museums, and this is the first time that such a large number of timepieces have left their home on the Lake of Geneva to be showcased abroad.\n\n\nLike the museum, the room is divided into two sections: The Antique Collection, which traces the early days of watchmaking in Europe, and the Patek Philippe Collection, which showcases key pieces from the company’s founding year in 1839 to the present.\nAmong these historical artefacts is a fob watch presented to Queen Victoria in 1851, as well as the first Swiss wristwatch ever made, which was created for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary in 1868.\xa0\n“Patek Philippe invented the crown winding system in the 1840s and they changed the industry with this invention,” said Dr Peter Friess, curator of the Patek Philippe Museum, during the exhibition preview.\nPrior to this, a watch needed to be wound with a key and not only did it render the watch unusable if one were to lose the key, the probability of dirt accumulating in the keyhole would also threaten to damage the inner micro-mechanics.\xa0\n“They presented this invention nine years later at the Great Exhibition in London and the Queen stopped by Patek Philippe’s booth and she bought that piece. Soon, every royal in Europe had to have a Patek Philippe, including the Countess of Hungary,” shared Dr Friess.\xa0\xa0\n“This was the big breakthrough that catapulted Patek Philippe to the number one position right away and today, every mechanical watch has a crown to wind the watch and set the hands,” he added.\nIn the special Singapore 200th Anniversary Room, which is dedicated to celebrating the country’s bicentennial, there are timepieces that pay tribute to the city and the region. Some of these are on loan from museums and private collectors from around the world.\nLook out for a pocket watch depicting the port of Canton in miniature painting on enamel, illustrating Singapore’s role as a trade hub between the Far East and Western nations, which was commissioned for the Chinese market around 1830, as well as a dome table clock decorated with Thai ornamental motif in cloisonne enamel infused with silver spangles.\n\n\nThe marvels of the submarine cosmos can be admired in the latter, themed “Tropical Island”, while two of the Patek Philippe pocket watches on display once belonged to King Rama V of Siam (now Thailand). Then, there’s the dome table clock crafted in 2015 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Singapore’s independence featuring the Esplanade.\nSome of Patek Philippe’s artisans from Geneva will also be present for a “live” showcase of the various fine crafts, such as engraving and enamelling, that are involved in producing a Patek Philippe timepiece.\nFinally, the Napoleon Room recreates the plush environs of the company’s historical salon in Rue de Rhone in Geneva, complete with a panoramic ‘view’ of Lake Geneva, giving visitors a glimpse of the history, culture, art, and natural surroundings that inspire Patek Philippe’s watchmaking mastery.\nThe Watch Art Grand Exhibition runs from Sep 28 to Oct 13 at the Marina Bay Sands Theatre. Admission is free. \n"", 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     fashion ']}"

      How to dress to flatter your body when you’re not stick thin
  </h1>, 'text': ""Real women have curves, and some of us are endowed with more than our fair share of them. And while we should all be proud of our shape – no matter if it's plus-size, size zero or anywhere in between – it can really be tough to find clothing that fit\xa0and flatter a curvier figure in a fashion department with limited options.\nStill, it’s definitely possible for full-figured women to feel stylish and look good – you just have to put in more legwork when shopping for clothes. It also helps if you equip yourself with a little savvy in identifying the types of garments that will work better for your shape. These tips will tell you what to try and what to avoid, so that you can put forth your best image.\n\n\nPICK CLOTHES WITH STRUCTURE\nWhile skinny women should aim to create curves in their figures, curvy women need to build form and structure with their clothing. Stock up on garments that can create straight lines, such as tailored jackets, pencil or A-line skirts, fit-and-flare dresses and straight-cut pants and jeans.\nTailored, well-cut pieces will be your best friends. That’s not to say that it’s a must for you to have structure from top to toe – feel free to match them with softer shapes and try pairings such as a billowy shirt with a pair of tailored pants or a simple, well-fitted T-shirt tucked into an A-line skirt.\nCHOOSE FABRICS WISELY\nLet’s talk about fabric, which will largely determine a garment’s structure. To achieve straight lines, stiffer and thicker fabrics are typically required. You might want to show off some of your curves, but not the bulges you are uncomfortable with, such as the belly, upper arms and thighs. These fabrics will conceal them to a certain extent while making you look slimmer and pulled-together.\nIt makes sense, naturally, for you to avoid fabrics that cling to the skin, because they can be potentially unflattering – sometimes even on those who are slim.\nDON’T GO TOO TIGHT OR TOO LOOSE\nSkin-tight is never a good look, but going oversized may not always work for the full-figured, particularly those who have an ample chest. The perfect fit is one that skims your body, highlighting the best parts of your figure while concealing or disguising the parts you don’t want people to see.\n\n\nOPT FOR DESIGN ELEMENTS THAT FLATTER\nLearn to spot clothing with design elements that flatter your figure. Jeans, for example, are one garment that feature\xa0many of such ingenious design techniques – back pockets that are placed slightly higher or tilted at a slight angle can visually lift and minimise your tushy, while artful “shading” on strategic areas of the fabric can sometimes “slim” the legs quite dramatically.\nObviously, light denim will be harder to pull off than dark denim. However, that doesn’t mean you should never deviate from black and indigo jeans – venture out and try on as many denim shades as you want to. Don’t forget that many other factors affect how jeans look on you, such as the cut, thickness and stretch allowance of the fabric.\nLook out for T-shirts and tops that fit well around the shoulders and chest but don’t hug the belly, as well as bottoms in cuts and fabrics that don’t cling to your hips and thighs and create unflattering creases around the crotch.\nBEWARE OF LARGE PRINTS\nLarge and loud prints can be a minefield to navigate. Depending on their design and where they fall on your body, they may emphasise areas that you don’t want to highlight. If you must wear them, carefully study how they look on you in the fitting room – front and back – because this will save you from making a rash purchase.\nLines on garments, whether vertical or horizontal, may not always be as slimming as you think they are. Be careful about the fit of the item that they come on: If it’s too tight, the lines may appear warped – which only serves to highlight the bulges you’d want to play down. Thin lines are better than thick lines for curvy girls – the latter tends to create a similar effect to that of large prints.\nPICK HEELS AND ACCESSORIES THAT ARE RIGHT FOR YOUR SIZE\nEvery woman can benefit from the instantly height-boosting effects of a pair of heels, although curvy ladies will need to avoid certain types of high-heeled footwear, such as stilettos.\nConsider the thickness of your heels in proportion to your calves or legs. By wearing extremely skinny heels, you are, in fact, visually adding bulk to your frame. Instead, by choosing a thicker heel, you can minimise the contrast between the heels of your shoes and your calves, thus creating a slimming effect.\nKitten heels – because of how petite they look – are similarly not ideal for balancing out your body proportions. For the best results, go for a medium-thick tapered heel, stacked heel or an elegant wedge.\nThe same rule of proportions should also be applied to your jewellery and bags – here’s where you can afford to dial up the drama, in terms of size and design, if you have been keeping it away from your clothes.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Repairing the damage: How innovators are trying to make clothes sustainable
  </h1>, 'text': 'Florence Kelley had a good idea for pushing cruelty out of the clothing supply chain: A simple white tag that would go on any garment, letting consumers know that it had been made under humane conditions. When we make a purchase, she insisted, we are responsible for what went into it.\nIt is a shame her idea didn’t catch on. Kelly, a Chicago-based activist, proposed it in 1899. It might have saved the world a lot of misery over the intervening 120 years, as author Dana Thomas details in her engaging and thorough book Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion & The Future of Clothes.\n\n\nA post shared by Filipa (@shades.of.blues.1) on Sep 17, 2019 at 1:09am PDT\n\n\nFor people interested in clothes or working in the industry, this book will have two uses. It provides a history of the human and environmental damage done by the mass production of clothes, and it tells the stories of entrepreneurs and scientists who are trying to make clothes with less cruelty and filth.\nThe book has implications beyond cloth and thread. It could, in a sense, have been written about any class of consumer product – food, say, or consumer electronics. The story is globalisation, and in particular how it delivers cheap, high-quality goods by externalising the costs of production while concealing this manoeuvre from the end consumer. It is a pattern infinitely repeated, and it can’t go on.\nIt’s a timely narrative. There is increasing pressure on consumers to buy less clothing, especially one-season “disposable” pieces from fast-fashion outlets, which pause only briefly in our closets before heading to a landfill. In the UK, an Oxfam campaign asked consumers to abstain from buying new clothes for all of September.\n\n\nIt is the extreme labour intensity of cutting and stitching fabric, and the chemicals needed to colour and soften it, that have led to the industry’s particular troubles. Some of the awful history here is familiar, from the satanic mills of 19th-century Manchester to the Triangle shirtwaist fire in New York in the early 20th, to that disaster’s terrible repetitions in today’s Bangladesh, most notably the Tazreen Fashion factory in 2012, which killed at least 117 workers.\nSome of Thomas’ reporting was eye-opening for me, though – such as her description of the wasteful, dangerous and polluting process that is required to pre-wash and distress blue jeans. Each pair can generate several gallons of toxic wastewater, and workers often hand-sand jeans to create that weathered look, in rooms clogged with cotton dust.\n\n\nThomas joins Kelly in hoping that a better-informed consumer might make better choices, but the positive side of her book is primarily devoted to the notion that better technology can eliminate the worst jobs and limit the environmental impact. This means everything from modern, hyper-automated spinning mills to robot stitchers to leather and silk grown in test-tubes or vats. Thomas does a good job of describing each innovation from the point of view of the entrepreneur behind it.\nOne heartening example, well past the start-up stage, is Econyl, a recycled form of nylon made by the Italian manufacturer Aquafil. The company turns old fishing nets, carpets and the like – millions of pounds of them a year – into new Speedo swimsuits, Breitling watch straps, and Stella McCartney outerwear. Recycled nylon now accounts for almost half of Aquafil’s production.\n\n\nA nice feature of technological advancements is “rightshoring”, which brings jobs back to former manufacturing hubs in regions such as the American south or northern England. These hubs are close to the customer and to garment workers who can be rehired, often after years outside the industry.\nThe flip side to this is that those “bad” jobs using old technologies are a key part of economies in countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia. Thomas does not have a solution to this, but displacement by technology stumps everyone else, too, and it would be absurd to argue that destructive manufacturing processes should be preserved to protect employment in the emerging world.\nThomas’ emphasis on upstart innovators and entrepreneurs is part of what makes the book a pleasure to read. It has a downside, though. I would have liked to hear more about what the biggest brands – Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and so on – are doing to reform their supply chains. Most of us wear a lot of their clothes, they all make a lot of noise about their efforts, but it’s hard to assess the substance behind the claims.\nI didn’t come away from Fashionopolis much the wiser on this. Thomas urges us, rightly, not to buy disposable clothes and to choose high-quality goods that can be repaired. But the quality of the T-shirts or trousers I buy at Uniqlo is as remarkable as the low prices; I keep them for years. What I want to know is if they would be worthy of Florence Kelley’s white tag.\nBy Robert Armstrong © 2019 The Financial Times\nRobert Armstrong is the FT’s US finance editor\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      What we learnt from the Milan Fashion Week that just ended
  </h1>, 'text': ""Three cities down, one more to go. As fashion month gears up for its penultimate week in Paris this week, a look back at the weeks past has revealed more than just the trends that you'll be wearing next season. Climate change and sustainability issues continue to dominate the conversation, but there were other key takeaways, too.\nIn New York, for example, designers doubled down on their efforts to promote diversity and inclusivity on the runways. Across the Atlantic, their counterparts in London bravely showed collections that offered messages of hope and positivity in the face of Brexit.\nMeanwhile, it was back to the basics in Milan as designers trained the spotlight back on craft to conjure clothing pieces that offered plenty of mileage. It was a week of sensible and unfussy fashion, but that didn't mean Milan was without its standout moments. Here are some we can’t stop talking about.\n\n\nRAY OF LIGHT\nDaniel Lee's ongoing transformation of Bottega Veneta has earned him plenty of fans. His pouch-shaped clutches and square-toed sandals are popping up all over Instagram (most notably on @newbottega, an account that's part mood board, part visual archive of Lee's works for the brand), further fuelling the demand for his It accessories.\nSuch momentum is hard to come by in an industry that renews itself at a relentless speed, but Lee has managed to build on that tempo for his sophomore outing. This Spring/Summer 2020, the designer continued working his charm with the bags and shoes by contrasting their sleek edge with a touch of slouchiness.\nAs for the ready-to-wear, Lee introduced more sporty cut-out knits dipped in tones of black, chocolate and orange to Bottega Veneta's vernacular.\n\n\nA NEW DAWN\nSpring/summer 2020 marked the dawn of a new era at Fendi, what with Silvia Venturini Fendi now in sole stewardship of the Roman House after the passing of her co-designer, Karl Lagerfeld.\nThe Italian sunrise and sunset provided the perfect allegory for her state of mind, and she duly translated that optimism and beauty into a joyous collection bursting with textures, prints and colours.\nVenturini Fendi applied a copious amount of gingham and florals to her assortment of plush fur outerwear, then added a touch of lightness by utilising washed cottons, sheer sequins and woven rope details to craft the youthful-looking dresses, paper-bag shorts, and skirts.\n\n\nFUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS\nMiuccia Prada's collections are never quite linear in their inception and execution, so it must come as a surprise to those in attendance at her latest showing that she's released a collection of garments that were as straightforward as can be.\nTerms such as “reduction to an essence” and “an antidote to complexity” were tossed about in the show notes, and those ideals turned up as tailored jackets, body-hugging polo shirts, lightweight dresses and wrap skirts on the catwalk – some imbued with hints of the 20s, 70s and 90s.\nIt was a collection that nodded to the “power of women over clothing, and style over fashion”, and Prada found herself the perfect embodiment of that spirit when a picture of her and Anna Wintour at a bar – both dressed in her creations, no less – went viral on Instagram.\nJUNGLE FEVER\nJennifer Lopez brought the house down when she sauntered onto the Versace runway in an iteration of the iconic green dress she first wore to the Grammys in 2000. Now an important piece of pop culture iconography, the popularity of the dress even led Google to create Google Images.\nDefiantly sexy and timeless, it was only fitting that Donatella Versace & Co. would revive the dress once more for a collection that'd also\xa0coincide with the 20th anniversary of the milestone. Besides roping in the pop star, Versace also enlisted the tech giant to create the digital art projections seen throughout the show space.\n\n\nSTREET SMART\nAre the days of peacocking over, or are we witnessing a return to a time when people actually dressed for themselves instead of the roving camera? Regardless, a sense of utilitarianism coursed through the streets this season, witnessed in the ways the fashion cognoscenti turned up for shows in ensembles that elevated functionality to new sartorial heights.\nImpeccably tailored jumpsuits, classic shirts, sublime knits and sophisticated skirts were the order of the day, as was a colour palette that comprised soothing shades of greys, browns, olives and khakis accented with flourishes of gold.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Milan ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Dior Men’s Kim Jones: “I was going to be a zoologist before becoming a designer”
  </h1>, 'text': ""Kim Jones has wild animals on his mind. “Even though Singapore is a big city, there’s a lot of wildlife. People still talk about big pythons turning up in homes, there’s about 100 pangolins left in Singapore and there is a rare kind of langur that lives here,” said Jones during an interview with CNA Luxury while he was on a one-night stopover at the newly refurbished Raffles Hotel.\nThe global artistic director of Dior Men had just completed the Tiger Express trip by Belmond’s Eastern & Oriental Express train from Bangkok to Singapore as an ambassador for the global charity initiative Save Wild Tigers. For his whirlwind 24 hours in the little red dot, he had plans to pack his itinerary with as much animal-spotting as possible.\n“I’m going to the Singapore Zoo – I think they treat their animals very well and [the zoo’s programmes are] important for the breeding of certain species. Then we’re going to try to see the family of otters that live down by the river which are very popular, because it’s really nice to see animals in the wild,” he said.\nWhile he has garnered global acclaim as the visionary designer who has breathed new life into menswear by melding luxury with street style – during his tenure as men’s artistic director at Louis Vuitton, he spearheaded the brand’s blockbuster collaboration with Supreme – there is a lesser known soft side to him.\n\n\n“I actually do a lot of wildlife travelling and conservation work. I don’t really talk about it a lot, but this is something really important,” he said.\nHe attributes his affinity for animals to his childhood, which was spent in Ecuador and many parts of Africa including Botswana, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Kenya, because of his father’s work as a hydrogeologist. “You had all these massive animals around – leopards, cheetahs, lions, elephants, rhinos, giraffes – so I've always been interested in wildlife. I was going to be a zoologist before becoming a designer.”\n\n\nWhen Jones was approached by Simon Clinton, founder of Save Wild Tigers, to take a trip through historic tiger territories in Thailand and Malaysia to help raise awareness for the plight of tigers, who number just 3,800 in the wild, he jumped on board. As part of the campaign, British Chinese artist Jacky Tsai, who created Alexander McQueen’s famous floral skull motif, painted the external livery of two of the train’s carriages with a tiger-inspired design.\n“The Malayan tiger is incredibly rare; the Chinese one, there’s probably 20 or so left in the world; and they went extinct recently in Cambodia. What’s great about this campaign is that the artwork on the outside of the train allows people to think about the tiger a bit more,” said Jones, who saw his first tiger in the wild in Ranthambore, India, only in 2014.\nProfits from this campaign – £30,000 (S$51,600) was raised from the sale of a painting by Tsai – will go towards creating global awareness campaigns for the cause and funding targeted tiger conservation projects. Jones added, “As with any kind of good conservation, the programme aims to help people in the community live a better quality of life and also protect the ecosystem that they live in.”\n\n\nThe three-night journey on board the luxury train also allowed Jones the rare opportunity to savour a less hectic pace of travel. He said, “It was a real joy to be there. I spent most of my time daydreaming, looking out the window and seeing everything as we went along. And it's amazing, you know, just crossing the border from Thailand to Malaysia and Singapore and seeing the differences even though they are right next to each other.”\nEnjoying life in the slow, natural lane is something this prolific globetrotter gravitates towards whenever he can spare the time. “When I relax, it is to go to nature where I’m with people that I am close with and we’re on our own, just having a very nice time experiencing beautiful things like seeing amazing animals in the wild or a natural spot,” he said.\nWhere he lays his head matters too. He prefers destinations that focus on eco-tourism, such as the Singita luxury safari lodges in Africa.\n“I am a big Aman junkie, which I think everyone knows,” he said with a laugh. On his Instagram account @mrkimjones, which he personally manages, there are multiple posts about his stays at Aman resorts around the world.\n“I love them because they have a real balance between nature and luxury,” he said, listing Amanjiwo in Java; Amangiri and Amangani in the United States; and Aman-i-Khas\xa0in India where he saw his first tiger among his favourites. “Each one is a completely different experience but what's really good about it is the consistency of service is exceptional and you know everything you need is there.”\nSo, what’s next on this frequent flyer’s bucket list?\nHe said, “I'd love to go to Papua New Guinea or northern Australia because of the marsupials and the saltwater crocodiles and all the animals that you don't think about that live in those places. And the birds of paradise.”\nEditor’s note: To our knowledge, Dior has no official no-fur stance.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Travel ', '     sustainability ', '     Profiles ', '     Men ']}"

      The Chanel 19 bag is Karl Lagerfeld's last gift to the fashion world
  </h1>, 'text': ""What's in a name? Well, lots, if Chanel's newest arm candy is of any indication. Making its debut this fall/winter 2019 season is the Chanel 19, a chic shoulder bag that pays tribute to the Maison's heritage in more ways than one.\nFor starters, the number references more than just the year and season the bag was launched in. 19 is an important numeral for the House because it marks Mademoiselle Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel's birth date (she was born on August 19, 1883). This move to name the bag also mirrors that of another Chanel icon – the 2.55, which was christened as such when Chanel herself conceived it in February 1955.\nA practical companion imbued with elegance and sophistication, the bag bears all the hallmarks of a classic Chanel\xa0design. There's the unmistakable quilting pattern – this time executed in a bigger diamond shape for a fresh take on a House motif.\nAnother distinctive feature is the flap bag's metal chains, now adopting a sleek ombre finish that contrasts perfectly to the bag's supple, almost pillow-like shape. To elevate the appeal even further, the double-C closure has been reworked to give the bag a contemporary vigour.\nConceptualised by Karl Lagerfeld and Virginie Viard, the Chanel 19 was presented alongside a ready-to-wear collection that riffed on apres-ski dressing. A poignant showing that took place in the shadows of Lagerfeld's passing, the selection of tweed skirt-suits, wide-legged pants and sweeping coats attested to his ingenuity.\nSo did the Chanel 19 – held in the arms as a clutch or worn around the waist like a fanny pack, it marked both the birth, and the end of, a glorious era. Here are the emblematic Chanel bags created during Lagerfeld's revolutionary tenure.\n\n\nTHE BOY CHANEL\nLagerfeld was never known to be sentimental for the past. But at Chanel, he wove the founder's legacy into his endeavours with the seasoned hand of a storyteller. The Boy Chanel is one such example of his achievement. In 2011, Lagerfeld crafted the bag and built it around the love affair of Coco Chanel and Boy Capel, an English aristocrat widely considered to be her first true love.\nTHE CLASSIC\nIf there's a bag that brings together tradition and modernity, the Classic is it. An interpretation of the 2.55 by Lagerfeld, the bag boasts the same versatile rectangular shape and handy inner pockets that have made its predecessor an enduring hit. Released in the 80s, Lagerfeld wove leather into the chains and replaced the clasp with interlocking Cs to set the Classic apart. Today, it stands on its own as a veritable treasure.\n\n\nTHE GABRIELLE\nThe launch of the Gabrielle bag in 2017 marked Chanel's renewed efforts to introduce another icon into its vernacular. Lagerfeld took a different route with the Gabrielle by instilling the bag with a unisex appeal. To prove its gender-neutral qualities, the designer enlisted Pharrell Williams to front the campaign. Even G-Dragon got into the act as well – the chameleonic K-pop superstar often included the bag as part of his flamboyant persona.\nTHE NOVELTY BAG\nMuch has been said about Chanel's novelty bags, which often take on whimsical forms that play off the themes of the collections. From milk cartons to space rockets, the bags have been primed for an Instagram age. Some of these clutches have gone on to achieve cult collectible status, which only adds to their allure.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Gym bags that work for you: The best picks under S$150 for men on the go
  </h1>, 'text': 'Every guy needs a gym bag – whether you actually go to a gym or not. Whether it’s a carryall, a tote or a sling bag, it’s an essential, multi-purpose must-have.\nBut what should you be looking out for when shopping for one? A sturdy material, preferably water-resistant is a good bet to take all that rough handling. Softly structured or even unstructured makes packing odd-shaped items an easy fit. Pockets and compartments are also a must for keeping the soiled stuff from the clean. Additional features like a padded computer sleeve, no-slip active feature and a handsome exterior are also features to consider.\nHere are\xa0our picks of the best value-for-money bags that are stylish enough to carry around and be on top of your game.\n\n\nDRAWSTRING BACKPACK BY RAINS, €95 (S$145)\nDanish raincoat specialist Rains makes bags out of the same water-repelling fabric as their coats. Which means this backpack keeps your stuff bone-dry in wet weather or your sweaty post-session gear separate from your other clothes. And its handsome looks makes it easy to double up as a city bag for getting out and about.\nwww.rains.com\n\nU BLOCKTECH SHOULDER BAG BY UNIQLO, S$59.90\nDon’t let its canvas exterior fool you into thinking it is a low-tech sac. Its Blocktech technology – meaning windproof and waterproof – protects the contents from the elements. A hidden active strap ensures a secure fit, meaning the bag won’t move around even when you’re running or cycling through town. And as a bonus, we’ve got ex-Hermes creative director Christophe Lemaire to thank for all these extra touches.\n\n\nRETREAT BACKPACK BY HERSCHEL, S$148.22\nThe Canadian luggage purveyor has a knack for churning out utilitarian gear we all want. For example, this sand-coloured backpack – it is roomy enough for your change of gym wear, runners and grooming essentials. Plus, it has a built-in laptop sleeve and an internal media pocket. The bag’s magnetic closure keeps the\xa0contents right where they should be.\xa0\xa0\nwww.asos.com\n\nBRASILIA CONVERTIBLE DUFFLE BAG BACKPACK BY NIKE, S$62\nExercise doesn’t just mean hitting the gym. If you’d rather hike than get on a treadmill, you’ll appreciate the hands-free convenience of a backpack – and this two-in-one piece has got your, erm, back.\n\n\nBASE CAMP COATED-CANVAS DUFFLE BAG BY THE NORTH FACE, £92\xa0(S$140)\nThis duffle bag checks all the right boxes. It’s over-sized, so you have room to pack everything you need; light, because you really don’t want\xa0to lug all that extra weight; durable, to stand up against rough handling; and versatile enough to fold into a smaller mesh bag for easy storage.\nwww.mrporter.com\nBLACK HOLE\xa090L LOGO-PRINT\xa0RIPSTOP DUFFLE BAG BY PATAGONIA, £92\xa0(S$140)\nBlack duffle bags are always reliable – and this no-fuss, no-frills number from Patagonia is as understated as it is pragmatic.

      Victoria Beckham launches new makeup collection at London Fashion Week
  </h1>, 'text': 'Victoria Beckham has expanded into beauty with the launch of a new makeup collection at London Fashion Week that is targeted at the wellness market.\xa0\nThe brand will not use parabens or sulphates, with secondary packaging made from 100 per cent post-consumer waste.\xa0\nThe designer also presented\xa0a line for ""women in motion"" at her show on Sunday (Sep 15), choosing\xa0a light and fluid silhouette for the female wardrobe next spring.\nWith her husband David and their children watching from the front row, Beckham said the spring/summer 2020 collection highlighted her love of contrasts, mixing tailored suits with floaty dresses and pale neutrals with bold colours.\nThe former Spice Girl turned designer opened the show with sharp trouser suits in check, cream or light colours.\nThe outfits were layered: jackets or coats over large-collared shirts, which nodded to 1970s styles, with the latter on top of rollneck tops. Trousers were long, straight and high-waisted.\nDresses came in purple, yellow, green, bronze, black and softer colours, and were cut in various styles: from halterneck and asymmetric to low-cut and long-sleeved. Most had feminine ruffles on the neckline, shoulders or waist. Some had floral patterns.\n""Lightness, easiness, freedom. Those are the ideas I was thinking of for this collection. It\'s about dynamic women today, women in motion,"" Beckham said in show notes.\n""Controlled and free, living life, reality and believability. There is always a duality in women, moving between different ideas, different moods. I want clothes that move with a woman, that move with her life.""\nBeckham also had dabs of prints in the collection – floral or scribbled-like handwriting.\nSkirts were calf-length, pencil-shaped and slit at the front and sides, adding to the sense of fluidity. Beckham also put ruffles on shirts. Accessories included floral neckpieces, large brown sunglasses and colourful heels in purple, turquoise and other bold shades.\nAhead of the show, around 30 demonstrators from climate activist group Extinction Rebellion staged a protest outside the venue, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, seeking to draw attention to the fashion industry\'s impact on the environment.\nHolding banners reading ""Fashion shouldn\'t cost the Earth"" and ""The Ugly Truth About Fashion"", the protesters gave speeches chanted slogans like ""Fashion equals ecocide"" and ""Repair Rewear Rebel"".\nWhile walking to the venue, the protesters temporarily stopped traffic on the way while grouping on a main road for a few minutes at a time.\nExtinction Rebellion, which has staged protests in recent months calling for action to tackle climate change, had called on London Fashion Week organisers to cancel the five-day industry event where designers are unveiling their latest womenswear lines.\nAt the Friday opening, a small group of its activists glued themselves to a door of the main Fashion Week venue and poured out a ""bleeding"" red carpet.\nEarlier on Sunday, Japanese influences prevailed on the Preen by Thornton Bregazzi catwalk, where models wore tops with Manga comics prints and floral dresses.\nPreen designer duo Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi opened the show with black and white looks before presenting an array of pastel-coloured lace, silk and see-though ruffled frocks.\nDresses came in an array of lengths and styles - frilly, layered, floaty, with puffed up sleeves, slits or slim-fit and in bright colours or floral prints.\nLondon Fashion Week ends on Tuesday.\n(Source: Reuters)\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Beauty ', '     celebrity ']}"

      Uniqlo is cutting water usage by 99% so your jeans don't kill the planet
  </h1>, 'text': 'The dry, dusty and cactus-dotted scenery reminded me more of the Netflix show Narcos than of a state-of-the-art R&D facility where people make eco-friendly jeans.\xa0\nBut I was told that in this quiet and seemingly barren part of Los Angeles, one can find the technology to create the washed look and silky-soft feel of vintage jeans using less water than a cactus needs. I was intrigued.\nThe company behind this indigo revolution is Fast Retailing. The Tokyo-headquartered retail company may not ring a bell but some of its fashion brands might: Helmut Lang, J Brand, GU, Theory, PLST, Comptoir des Cotonniers, Princess tam.tam and the largest of all, Uniqlo.\n\n\nBut what is a Japanese jeans research centre doing in the middle of the California desert? “Jeans began in California and it has a history here,” explained Masaaki Matsubara, the chief operating officer of the Fast Retailing Jeans Innovation Centre (JIC).\nWhich makes it the perfect place to try something new – like reinventing the way jeans are made.\nHELPING TO REDUCE WASTAGE\nJeans are one of the world’s most ubiquitous piece of clothing – but it’s taking a toll on the planet.\nFor one, it takes at least 10,000 litres of water to produce just a kilo of raw cotton – enough to make only one pair of jeans, according to the United Nations.\xa0And that’s not counting the water usage in the wash process the denim goes through to create the soft texture of used jeans – and other repercussions\xa0we’ll get to later.\nWe never intended to reduce the water used for jeans washing by only 10 per cent or 20 per cent. Ultimately, we want to reduce water usage to zero.\nBeyond water wastage, there’s also the issue of producing too many clothes. According to a BBC report, the global garment production currently stands at more than 15 billion items a year – a number that has doubled in the past 15 years because clothes are worn less and thrown away faster.\nSingaporeans are guilty of this, too. A\xa0YouGov Omnibus research in 2017 revealed 73 per cent have thrown clothes away, with 25 per cent\xa0dumping more than 10 items of clothing.\nAnd, of course, Uniqlo itself is part of the system that contributes to the cycle. A spokesperson said that it produces 1.3 billion items of clothing across the world each year, with more than half (51 per cent, to be precise) of the brand’s sales coming from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.\nWhich is why Uniqlo’s parent company is trying to do something about it.\nTOUR OF TECHNOLOGY\nAccording to Fast Retailing’s sustainability director, Veronica Rochet: “Making clothes that are long lasting and functional” is the company’s way of helping to reduce global wastage.\xa0\nWhich brings us back to our tour of the JIC. Looking more like a high-tech lab than a factory, the well-lit and high-ceilinged JIC is unlike the dark, stuffy and sweaty place you’d imagine with piles of failed jeans experiments covering the floor. Instead, it looked like Marie Kondo had been there.\nI was tempted to run my finger over a ledge to check for dust but didn’t think that would spark joy in my host.\n\n\nThe centre was founded in 2016 by the Tokyo-born but LA-based Matsubara, who’s been totally focused on figuring out how to make sustainable jeans.\nHe explained the conventional process of making one. “Jeans still aren’t complete after sewing. They are the only garments that have to go through a wash process – and they are the only apparel that has to look old even though it’s new,” he said.\nThe wash process – which is stonewashing with pumice stones – softens the denim and eliminates its stiff, starchy texture. For the record, each pair of Uniqlo jeans uses an average of 100 litres of water to wash.\xa0\nThat’s actually just 43 litres shy of what the average Singaporean uses per day in 2017, according to the PUB.\nWhat becomes of the pumice stones is another waste issue altogether. A staff said that each wash cycle typically requires\xa0about 80kg of pumice stones. But after just one wash cycle, they’ll\xa0be reduced to half their size. “The stones turn into waste,” Matsubara explained. “They break down into tiny bits and when discharged, they pollute the water system.”\nEven creating the faded streaks (known as whiskers), rips and tears that add to the “vintage” appearance of the jeans comes at a price to the environment and workers. Chemicals such as potassium permanganate (if you paid attention in Chemistry class, it is toxic to aquatic animals and can burn skin) are applied and the process can take an hour per pair of jeans.\nI edged away when a staff demonstrated the old-school way of sanding down the jeans. Manual labour is again responsible for the aesthetically placed holes, rips and tears before the jeans are ready to hit the stores.\nREADY? LASER AND ACTION\nTo deal with all of these problems regarding chemicals and water, Uniqlo has turned to\xa0technology for eco-friendly solutions.\nA laser machine, for instance, is used for the laborious sanding process. This hulk of a grey metal frame can\xa0replicate the whiskers or fade patterns that result\xa0from the wearer’s repeated movements – after years of dedicated wear, as I thought back to my own jeans. But here, it was about to happen in an instant.\nThe platform had several pairs of\xa0jeans in various washes placed on it. An ominous yellow light started to flash and a sound that wasn’t too far off from a jumbo jet taking off deafened the room. Were the jeans going to catch fire? Would I see laser beams shooting out? Did anyone have a fire extinguisher on standby?\nIf you were anticipating a laser show like Marina Bay Sands’, no such luck. But the flash fires (yes, actual fire) that flared up as quickly as they died down wherever the invisible laser hit the denim were just as exciting – perhaps even more so. And just like that, you get a specifically placed frayed edge or rip.\nIn fact, the very same distressed design can be replicated with precision on other pairs of jeans many times over. A designer just has\xa0to create the pattern on the computer beforehand, and the laser system can\xa0churn out 60 pairs of jeans per hour, compared to the 10 per hour using manual labour. How’s that for efficiency and consistency?\nSAVING WATER\nAs for the wash processes, they’re doing away with pumice stones altogether. Matsubara walked up to one of the cupboard-sized industrial machines\xa0and fished out a fistful of seemingly ordinary rocks. “Instead of using pumice stones to wash the jeans, we’ve developed our own eco stones made of polymer,” he said. “They don’t break down and won’t pollute the water system.”\nAnd the biggest issue of water usage? A staff said that no water is added at all in the wash with the eco stones. The jeans are placed into the machine wet and that is all the moisture used. “The nanobubble technology turns water into moisture particles to cut down water usage by 99 per cent,” said Matsubara.\nBy 2020, 100 per cent of the processes that you see here today will be available in all our factories worldwide.\nTo remove the indigo stains, the JIC has\xa0another water- and bleach-free trick up its sleeves: Ozone gas cleansing.\xa0Indigo oxidises and fades in the presence of ozone, and when it is all done, the gas is released into the atmosphere where it becomes\xa0oxygen, or so we were told.\nWhatever little amount of water is used, the JIC is still working on getting it 100 per cent recycled.\xa0I thought the displayed water samples\xa0looked transparent and clean, like NEWater. But they aren’t quite there yet, said Matsubara. “We never intended to reduce the water used for jeans washing by only 10 per cent or 20 per cent,” he said. “Ultimately, we want to reduce water usage to zero.”\nENCOURAGING RESPONSIBLE CONSUMERISM\nIf you’re wondering how far Fast Retailing is from rolling out the technology seen at the JIC, it is already in use.\n“Around 60 per cent of our facilities at the moment have the technology at the moment,” said Matsubara. In fact, that pair of men’s regular fit jeans that you might have recently bought from Uniqlo could be made using the technology.\n“By 2020, 100 per cent of the processes that you see here today will be available in all our factories worldwide,” he said.\nBeyond the clothes, there are other ways the Japanese retail giant is also looking into other eco-friendly measures, such as reducing the use of plastic bags and packaging in stores. The target is to reduce the use of plastic by 85 per cent, which translates into “7,800 tonnes of plastic” by 2020, said Rochet.\nAs for Fast Retailing\'s next eco-conscious step, group senior vice president of sustainability Yukihiro Nitta\xa0said: ""We would like to look at raw materials for our next sustainability efforts, perhaps using recycled materials.""\nThe dusty\xa0landscape that surrounded\xa0the R&D centre might\xa0look devoid of water but it sounded like ideas to further revolutionise garment production\xa0have\xa0started flowing.\nCNA Lifestyle was in Los Angeles at the invitation of Uniqlo.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Bagging rights: The five cult bags every collector should seek out
  </h1>, 'text': ""There are trendy bags, seasonal designs crafted to pander to fickle tastes, and then there are bags that are institutions in their own right. Think: The Hermes Birkin or the Chanel 2.55 – heavyweight designs that have transcended fashion and time altogether.\nOccupying a middle ground between the two ends of this bag spectrum, however, are a class of bags that aren't exactly juggernauts, but are no less iconic. Released at various points during the last two decades, they were once It bags that dominated the pages of fashion magazines, but have since faded away from the limelight.\nNot for long, though. Fashion's cyclical nature means anything and everything can make a comeback. And with Instagram darlings such as Kim Kardashian and Bella Hadid spotted out and about with these era-defining bags on tow (Louis Vuitton is a clear favourite), we're guessing it won't be long before the demand for these pieces shoots through the roof once again. Whether you're hoping to score more likes on Instagram or simply expanding your own collection of highly sought-after bags, here's a shortlist of five collector's items to add to your radar.\n\n\nTHE CHANEL NO. 5 PERFUME BOTTLE CLUTCH\nA space rocket. A lifebuoy. A robot. A cable car. Was there anything the late Karl Lagerfeld hadn't turned into a novelty clutch at Chanel? One whimsical iteration remains particularly memorable: In 2013, Chanel remade its classic No. 5 perfume bottle into a plexiglass clutch. Replete with Chanel's signature chains, the clutch gave Lagerfeld's turnout of lace dresses and slouchy knit ensembles a playful and irreverent touch. More importantly, it was a genius move that sealed the perfume's prominence in fashion's vernacular.\n\n\nTHE DIOR SADDLE BAG BY JOHN GALLIANO \nSure, Maria Grazia Chiuri's interpretation rekindled interest in the Saddle, but what John Galliano achieved with the original will never be eclipsed. The bag was an instant hit when it was released in 2000 and became one of the icons of the designer bag craze that gripped the world. Galliano followed up on the bag's success with plenty of variations that attested to his talent: One version was decorated with a Christian Dior newsprint, while another boasted Rasta colours.\n\n\nTHE GUCCI BY TOM FORD DRAGON BAG\nTom Ford's reign at Gucci was unapologetically glamorous and sexy, so it was only natural that the accessories exemplified his bold – and at times, controversial – take on sexuality. A standout from Ford's stint, the Dragon shoulder bag is one part exotic, many parts audacious. Its most distinctive feature is, of course, an opulent clasp which features the mythical creature. We can't help but wonder if Alessandro Michele, Gucci's current Creative Director, had a part to play in its creation (Michele cut his teeth in Gucci's accessories department before working his way up). Or if the bag's instantly recognisable clasp inspired the one found on the Dionysus, one of Michele's most recent creations.\n\n\nTHE HERMES SO BLACK KELLY\nThe Birkin may be the flagship design at Hermes, but the Kelly is also a firm favourite among discerning consumers who prefer its boxier and more structured shape. Under the charge of Jean-Paul Gaultier, the luxury goods powerhouse gave connoisseurs another reason to include the Kelly in their collections when it released an all-black version of the bag in 2010. Part of a range aptly titled So Black, every component of the newfangled variant is coloured in the timeless shade, from the hardware to the box the bag arrives in. In short: Class and sophistication of the highest order.\n\n\nTHE LOUIS VUITTON X TAKASHI MURAKAMI BAG\nBefore Supreme's bold typeface was plastered all over Louis Vuitton's bags, there was Takahashi Murakami's colourful anime drawings that sparked a wave of frenzy among diehard fans. An ingenious project masterminded by Marc Jacobs, Murakami's game-changing partnership with the French Maison is widely considered as the textbook example of a successful fashion-meets-art collaboration.\nThe brand dropped the first collection in 2003 – a series which saw the Japanese artist transform Louis Vuitton's Monogram pattern into a multicoloured kaleidoscope. Over the next decade, Murakami treated Louis Vuitton's bags as if they were his personal canvases, painting kawaii cherry blossoms, cherries or camouflage motifs on them. Following the departure of Jacobs, the brand subsequently ended its partnership with the artist in 2016.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Dior pulls Johnny Depp perfume ad after claims of cultural appropriation
  </h1>, 'text': 'Johnny Depp and Dior are under fire after being criticised for cultural appropriation, with the luxury brand pulling out its new advertisement that used Native American culture to sell its Sauvage fragrance line.\nThe advert campaign titled We Are The Land, which briefly appeared on social media before it was removed on Friday (Aug 30), featured the actor playing a guitar in the desert while a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe performed a warrior dance in traditional wardrobe. It also starred Twilight actress Tanaya Beatty, whose mother is of Da’Naxda’xw Nation descent.\nBut social media critics were having none of it, claiming it was insensitive to feature Native American culture for a perfume with a French word for “savage” and that it promoted stereotypes.\nThe video, which said to have been done in collaboration with advocacy group Americans For Indian Opportunity, was filmed in the Canyonlands, the ancestral lands of the Apache, Navajo and Ute people.\nDepp is no stranger to this particular controversy – in 2012, he was made an honourary member of the Comanche tribe back and he has also mentioned having Native American ancestry. For the 2013 film The Lone Ranger, he also played the Native American sidekick Tonto.\nDior had explained that the creators had been in close contact with Native American consultants “in order to respect indigenous cultures, values and heritage.”\nBut it did little to calm people down online. “White ppl need to understand that it doesn’t matter if Native Americans participated in the ad. Dior is using our culture next to the word sauvage, profiting on our people and I guarantee you not a dime is going to us,” wrote one.\nAnother said: “Someone on the Dior creative team: Hey, since the fragrance is called Sauvage, let’s make it Indian-themed! Ya know cause Indians are wild and savage!’”\nAmerican Gods actress Kawennahere Devery Jacobs tweeted: “You’re telling me that @Dior is profiting off Indigenous culture/imagery, and hired JOHNNY DEPP to star in the ad for a perfume called SAUVAGE?! ...who thought this was okay?""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     celebrity ', '     fashion ']}"

An impressive bumper crop of stylish merchandise\xa0– and the presence of some homegrown stars.\nOuterwear giant Moncler and luxury leather goods purveyor Valextra unveiled their special 2 Moncler 1952 + Valextra collection on Wednesday (Aug 28), one day ahead of the global launch.\nThe event, which was held at the former’s boutique at Marina Bay Sands, also saw local personalities JJ Lin, Nathan Hartono, Fann Wong and Rebecca Lim dropping by.\nThe collection, which features menswear and womenswear pieces by Moncler designers Sergio Zambon and Veronica Leoni, definitely checked the boxes for youth culture with a twist of classicism, while Valextra newly imagined bag styles completed the set.\nThe collection taps into pop culture sensibilities – and there’s certainly a link between music and fashion, said JJ Lin. “Both fashion and music are very important parts of our lives. The music that we listen to, the clothes and colours that we wear show a lot about our inner self.”\nFashion can bridge the gap between generations\xa0– Actress Rebecca Lim\xa0\nMediacorp actress Rebecca Lim agreed: “I feel (music) really is part of everyday life, like fashion. You dress according to how you feel, you listen to music according to how you feel. They are very, very closely linked.”\nLim, who was wearing a vintage-esque print at the event, added: “Fashion can bridge the gap between generations like how we are wearing clothes inspired by my grandmother’s generation and how my grandmother’s generation inspired the future generation of clothing.”\nBut looking cool in winter garb isn’t the easiest to pull off, even for these A-listers.\n“It is very challenging to keep yourself warm yet look fashionable,” admitted actress Fann Wong – even as Lin seemed to have gotten the formula down pat. “I’ve always like bolder colours. It lets you be more adventurous” he said.\nI’m a geek who carries a lot of gadgets with me when I go out. \xa0– Singer JJ Lin\nThe celebrities also weighed in on their preferences when it comes to bags. “As a mother, I want something that’s light but yet hold lots of things. I love bags that look stylish but are not too big in size because I may end up putting a lot of things in them!” said Wong, with a laugh.\nWhat might one find in her bag? ""Wet tissue, dry tissue, sanitiser, hand phone, car keys, perfume and lip gloss.""\nLim, however, loves a great big bag. “To me, a great travel bag has to be of a good size and of a good weight – it has to be very light so I can store all my stuff and I have a lot of stuff.”\nMeanwhile, Hartono was more of a function over form kind of guy. “A bag is something to put my things in. I go for big practical bags because I travel a lot with them so it has to double up as a hand-carry luggage.” So what’s inside his bag at the moment? “My laptop is always with me. There’s also a microphone.""\n""And a towel,"" he said, ""because I sweat a lot.”\nFellow big bag lover Lin – who has over 30 – has his own practical reasons for opting for size over style. “I’m\xa0a geek who carries a lot of gadgets with me when I go out,” he said, adding that he’s carrying “everything from my iPad to a table, sometimes books, recording equipment, (charging) cables – I have a whole bag of charging cables for all my gadgets.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     JJ Lin ', '     Rebecca Lim ', '     celebrity ', '     fashion ']}"

Pure and untarnished, gold's brilliance conjures illusions of mysticism and grandeur. From majestic Greek temples to grand Roman churches, it has been employed to embellish mankind's past.\nToday, gold's decadent shine adorns more than just the walls of ancient monuments or antique scriptures. It boasts a magnetism so captivating and powerful, it has been utilised to decorate the body either as exquisite threads or opulent jewellery pieces.\nOnce the definition of social status and wealth, gold now signifies the ideals of grace, elegance and sophistication. Whether metal or colour, fashion's obsession with gold shows no signs of fading.

      How to remove stains from designer bags so you won’t have to throw them away
  </h1>, 'text': 'Stains are the bane of many a designer bag addict’s life – they are impossible to completely avoid unless the only reason you bought that pricey tote is to keep it in its dust bag at home.\nBesides giving your bag the initial protection pre-first-use (trust us, paying for a professional coating service will save you a lot of heartache down the road), what else can you do to help it stand up to accidental abuse?\nThese cleaning tips – some culled from fellow bag addicts and others from bag-cleaning professionals – will help you deal with some of the most common stains at home. Our experts also share what not to do and when you absolutely should send your bag straightaway to them.\nAll stains need to be dealt with immediately.\nSome golden rules to follow: All stains need to be dealt with immediately, and always test a stain-removal method on an inconspicuous spot of the bag to determine if it is good for the type of leather your bag is made from.\n\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bMAKEUP MARKS\nA lipstick cap coming loose spells one of the worst stain disasters that could occur within the interior of a bag. Here’s what to do: Carefully wipe off the marks with a dry cloth while trying not to spread the stain all around.\nDo not attempt to remove the stain with a cream or oil makeup remover – those are sure to leave oily marks on the lining of your bag.\nOnce you’ve removed most of the stain, go in with a soft cloth dampened with water that is mixed with a tiny bit of laundry detergent. Cecilia Tan, director of The Bag & Shoe Aesthetics, advised against using wet wipes on leather bags because they typically contain alcohol that may damage the leather, especially if you wipe it across an extensive area of the bag.\nDo not attempt to remove the stain with a cream or oil makeup remover – those are sure to leave oily marks on the lining of your bag. If it’s powder makeup that you’ve spilled in your bag, remember to tip out all the powder before going to work on the stains.\n\n\nINK STAINS\nMost minor ink stains can be lightened with a teensy bit of alcohol, but never use it directly on your bag. Dilute a few drops of rubbing alcohol with a large spoonful of water, dip a cotton swab into the mixture and lightly rub it over the ink stain with a circular motion.\nIf this doesn’t work, it’s time to call in the professionals.\xa0According to Gemma Gil, director of bag and shoe cleaning company ColorWash, ink stains can be tough to remove, even for a professional cleaner – if all else fails, the pen marks can still be concealed with a colour touch-up.\nDENIM TRANSFER MARKS\nIf you’ve ever made the mistake of using a light-coloured bag while wearing dark-indigo jeans, you’d be all too familiar with denim rub-off.\nIt’s impossible to lighten the stain once the dye penetrates the leather.\nRub leather cleaner, which can be bought at most supermarkets, shoe repair and DIY stores, into the stain with a soft cloth. It should take off most of the denim stain, depending on the kind of leather your bag is made of.\nActing quickly is the key, said Gil. It’s impossible to lighten the stain once the dye penetrates the leather. Once the latter has occurred, the only way to save your bag is to conceal the stain with a professional colour touch-up.\nThere’s also a little trick that has been making rounds on designer bag forums online: Apparently, a few rubs with a magic eraser (the white melamine foam sponges that can be found in the cleaning supplies aisle of the supermarket) – can effectively remove the dye stain.\nOf course, it’s not something the professionals would recommend. We’d suggest it only as a “last resort” to clean your bag. Because the sponge can be abrasive, it’s not suitable for use on very fine leathers or suede. If you decide to try it, begin with a very light hand.\n\n\nFOOD AND WINE SPILLS\nThe main problem with food on leather is that it usually leaves a grease stain. If this happens, wipe the oil off with a clean, dry cloth. Then blot the area with kitchen towels to remove most of the oil.\nWine stains – especially from red wine – are a whole other challenge and must be taken to a professional.\nYou’ve probably heard about using cornstarch or baby powder on grease stains. Gil said that while it’s true that these will absorb some of the oil, it also creates another problem because the fine powders might get caught in the leather grain or thread fibres.\nWine stains – especially from red wine – are a whole other challenge and must be taken to a professional. “We use organic chemicals and other in-house solutions that can potentially remove ultra-stubborn stains including wine, blood and even vomit to save the items instead of colouring them,” said Tan.\nWATER MARKS\nWater doesn’t technically leave a stain, but when it dries, it can leave obvious marks on leather, especially if your bag is light-coloured or made of suede.\nIf you should get rain or water on your bag, remember to act ASAP – remove most of the moisture with a highly absorbent cloth or kitchen towel.\nUnfortunately, there isn’t much that can be done to remove water marks from leather, so it truly pays to have your bag professionally waterproofed or DIY with a store-bought leather waterproofing spray.\nIt may not completely prevent water marks on your bag, but it will largely reduce the potential for damage. If you should get rain or water on your bag, remember to act ASAP – remove most of the moisture with a highly absorbent cloth or kitchen towel. While doing so, remember not to wipe but instead blot with a dabbing motion.\nGil suggested speed-drying the wet area with a hairdryer on cool setting. Then, apply leather conditioner to the bag to restore and protect the leather.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Want a pair of tickets to Giorgio Armani's next fashion show in Milan? Here's how
  </h1>, 'text': ""One's a reverential polymath whose paintings have had a profound impact on humanity; the other's an esteemed master tailor whose immaculate designs have influenced the way generations of men and women dress. Leonardo da Vinci and Giorgio Armani may be born more than four centuries apart, but the two men have more in common than you think.\n\n\nFor example, their professional beginnings can be traced back to Milan, a bustling city that is often regarded as a hotbed of creativity and innovation. According to the history books, da Vinci lived and worked in the Italian city during the later half of the 15th century and created some of his most well-known works then. The Last Supper, a monumental painting that adorns the walls of the Santa Maria delle Grazie, is one such masterpiece.\nHundreds of years later, a 23-year-old Armani sealed his fate when he landed the job of window dresser at La Rinascente, a Milanese shopping landmark known for its luxurious mix of high-end brands. It was here that the Italian designer learnt all the ropes of the trade that'd prove useful in the establishment of his empire.\nWith Milan being the common denominator linking da Vinci and Armani, it was only a matter of time before the Armani Hotel Milano rolled out two experiences that draw upon the pair’s ties to the metropolis.\nThe first is a guided tour that traces the footsteps of da Vinci, while the other is an exclusive invite to soak up the atmosphere at an Armani fashion show. How's that for glimpses of Milan unlike any other?\nHISTORY, REVISITED\nMuch has been discussed about the life of da Vinci, but perhaps none in such an interactive and immersive way: To mark the 500th anniversary of his death, Armani Hotel Milano is extending an opportunity to its guests to take part in a unique street tour that tells the life of da Vinci through the use of cutting-edge technology. The line between the past and present is blurred as participants are given a special VR viewer that lets them step back in time to the 16th century through a virtual re-creation of the city da Vinci called home.\nAccompanied by an experienced guide, participants begin the 90-minute journey of discovery from the historic Piazza della Scala, hitting important checkpoints such as the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Piazza del Duomo and Palazzo Reale. The tour ends back at the hotel, where guests are brought several floors up to the property's famed Bamboo Bar. Once there, they'll not only be treated to the sweeping views of Milan, they'll also get to toast to da Vinci's genius with the Acqua/Rose, a special cocktail inspired by one concocted by the artist in 1571.\nIT'S SHOWTIME\nThe advent of high-speed Internet connection has allowed fashion brands to livestream their runway shows and invite viewers from all over the world to witness the spectacle. However, the adrenaline from being physically present at a fashion show can never be replicated, which is why the hotel is treating guests who reserve a stay at its top-tier suites a pair of tickets to Armani's upcoming fashion show.\nYou'll have to work fast: Milan Fashion Week is happening from September 17 to 23 this year and the exclusive offer is only valid for guests who check into the Armani Presidential Suite or Armani Milano Suite during that period. The pay-offs are immeasurable if you're a fashion fiend: Not only will you get to witness the designer's sublime creations in action, you'll also live out your wildest fashion fantasies when you rub shoulders with A-list celebrities, Instagram darlings and the who's who of the industry.\nFor more information, visit armanihotelmilano.com or contact reservations.milan [at] armanihotels.com ()\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Milan ', '     Italy ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Destinations ']}"

      How to save time and money on your work wardrobe with just 6 key essentials
  </h1>, 'text': 'It’s already 8.30am on a weekday and you’re still standing in front of your closet, desperately looking for an outfit that will work for your busy day ahead in the office.\nIt’s a familiar situation for many women – how strange, isn’t it, that it’s impossible to find a single ensemble that matches and fits properly, despite having a closet so full that it’s bursting?\n\n\nGetting dressed for work seems straightforward enough a task, yet it can often go spectacularly awry. It’s not simply a problem that can be solved by forward planning – if the clothes that you are buying for work are wrong, planning ahead as far as a week won’t do much to ease these wardrobe crises.\nFor those who have a strict corporate dress code to adhere to, it’s even more crucial to build a functional, versatile and office-appropriate wardrobe. You don’t necessarily have to spend an exorbitant sum of money to achieve this – what you need are the key essentials that will pair effortlessly with each other, as well as with other clothing you may want to introduce for some variety.\xa0\nHere are the six must-haves to add to your work wardrobe.\nA WELL-CUT BLAZER\nThis is the single fashion item that can help you look pulled-together in an instant, regardless if you have a dress, jumpsuit or separates underneath it. It’s also what you should always have on standby in the workplace. Last-minute presentation, meeting with clients or evening work event? No problem – pop on your blazer and you’re set to go.\nA well-cut black blazer in suiting material is a must-have and works for days when you need to look your corporate best. But don’t stop there – acquire a few more in varying styles, colours and fabrics that can amp up your corporate style on casual Fridays or meeting-free days. Our suggestions: Beige, white, a check print or another black blazer in knit jersey perhaps?\n\n\nA BLACK DRESS\nWe don’t mean your party-ready LBD but its corporate counterpart. It needs to be well-fitted (though not skin-tight), structured in terms of cut and material, simple and frills-free, and have a work-appropriate neckline and length (nothing shorter than three fingers above the knees if you want to be taken seriously).\nIt’s what we call a “no-brainer” dress – you won’t have to spend time thinking about mixing and matching, as in the case of separates, since it’s a one-piece; plus, it’ll go with shoes and bags in just about any colour, as well as both gold and silver accessories.\nFind one in a figure-flattering cut – we suggest a sheath dress, straight-cut but slightly nipped in at the waist – and it’s going to be the piece you’ll reach most for on those days when you’re feeling bloated and the waistband on your pants and skirts is a little too tight for comfort.\n\n\nA PAIR OF TAPERED PANTS\nTailoured wide-legs can look stylish yet professional, provided if you have the height to carry them off, but pants with tapered legs are friendlier to a wider variety of figures. If you’re petite, get the hems cut near the ankle so that they’ll visually elongate your legs.\nBlack, grey or a subtle pinstripe are best for staples – they’ll anchor your outfit so that you can pair them with tops and blouses in other colours or prints.\nA WHITE BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT\nA white Oxford shirt is an office-wear essential for not just men but also women, although you won’t need as many as a guy does — one or two of a high-quality make will give you mileage for more than a few years.\nThe white shirt is an eternal classic and can be worn for an infinite variety of occasions, from casual to black tie even, while remaining perfectly professional for the office. They can be stylish too – try one in silk or chiffon instead of cotton, with a pussycat bow, or in a fit that’s slightly oversized or blousy.\n\n\nA PENCIL SKIRT\nA pencil or tapered skirt will help create that structured silhouette that is key to a smart and polished look. The material that it’s made out of is crucial, as it will directly influence the silhouette – even though this tailored bottom is designed to define your shape, it should do so by creating straight lines that angle slightly inwards at your waist and knees instead of hugging your curves.\nLook out for those in a thicker and stiffer material, which will also help conceal any bulges and make you look slimmer. Those that are made of soft, stretchy fabrics like Lycra or jersey are not office-appropriate.\nA PAIR OF NEUTRAL PUMPS AND FLATS\nBuy the right shoes and they’ll make dressing for work a breeze, which you will definitely appreciate on days when you have zero time to plan your outfit. Consider this: Many women own plenty of shoes but are only able to rely on just one or two pairs out of their entire collection for work. The reason why it’s happening is simple – they are buying shoes that aren’t versatile nor comfortable.\nIt’s wise to change your shoe-shopping habits if you are experiencing the same situation. While you indulge in beautiful though impractical heels, remember to always maintain a capsule collection of sensible, comfortable shoes that you can wear for work.\nEvery woman needs two types of pumps: Pointed and rounded, with a low or medium-height heel on them. Even if you are someone who can run around all day in super-high heels, do note that sky-high stilettos and platform heels are not appropriate for a corporate environment.\nFlats are absolutely essential, and will be your go-to footwear on days when your feet need a break from heels. Get these shoes in plain, sensible styles and versatile colours like black and another neutral but lighter colour such as grey or beige – these will go with every office ensemble in your closet.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Career ', '     office ']}"

      In the current climate, the biggest trend in fashion is compassion
  </h1>, 'text': 'The industry once famed for tooth-and-claw survivalism and weapons-grade bitching is being rehabilitated, and the biggest trend this season is – being nice.\n“Over a steaming cup of mint tea, we teased through how one can shine light in a world filled with seemingly daily darkness,” wrote the Duchess of Sussex with simpering charm of the themes that steered her guest editorship of the September issue of British Vogue. Was she agonising over hemlines? Or wondering whether cerulean blue has finally had its day? No. She just wanted an opportunity “to pivot from a perspective of frustration to one of optimism”.\nThe Forces of Change issue represents the culmination of that effort. Its cover features 15 people whom the Duchess has selected, in the “spirit of inclusivity”, to represent “women of varying age, colour, creed, nationality, life experience” and “unquestionable inspiration”. They include women she has met “and enlisted personally”, and those she has “admired from afar”. Among them are New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern, 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, inclusivity advocate and academic Sinead Burke, and the actress Salma Hayek, who is married to Francois-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of the Kering luxury group.\nThe Duchess demurred from appearing on the cover as she thought it too “boastful” to include herself among such company. But she has included a mirrored panel on the cover so that the reader might also “reflect” the change themselves. “The overall sentiment I hope you’ll find,” she concluded, “will be one of positivity, kindness, humour and inclusivity”.\nThe whole thing is as worthy as a bowl of quinoa salad. The cover stars wear sensible clothes – businesslike blouses, unbranded tops and tailored pants – and have been shot in tasteful black and white. At the Duchess’s request, the images have not been digitally altered – she wanted to “see the freckles”. Michelle Obama pops up in a white T-shirt and jeans to chat about empowerment, and the primatologist Jane Goodall tells Prince Harry not to have too many children in an effort to save the world from climate change. He agreed: “Two, max.”\nBut all this niceness cannot belie the fact the world is still a pretty horrid place. And the knives are out for Meghan. Already, the issue has been painted as a sly attack on her sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, who used her 2016 Vogue cover to promote Sloane Ranger-style hats and the joy of building bonfires. It has been castigated as too celebrity focused: Populist rightwing newspaper the Sun offered a whole range of nurses, servicewomen and, erm, Barbara Windsor, as the sort of people who should have made the cut. And the issue has been noted as a snub: The Queen is nowhere to be seen. But that’s the tragedy of compassion. You can hand out all the mirrors in the world, but some people will only ever see one’s flaws.\n“The overall sentiment I hope you’ll find will be one of positivity, kindness, humour and inclusivity”. – Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex\nNevertheless, to have dedicated the September edition, an issue typically associated with blockbuster new trends and the kerching of commercial obligation, to a subject as wholesome as kindness speaks volumes about where fashion is at right now. In recent years the industry has had to reconcile itself to some uncomfortable truths – such as the fact it’s horrifically polluting, or that it preys on young people’s vulnerabilities and low self-esteem, and that it can be elitist, and racist, and mean. Just as its sins have been made ever more apparent, so has its value as a social platform become more keen. The global fashion industry is worth some US$2.5 trillion (S$3.46 trillion). It has influence. And brands, editors, stylists and creatives are waking up to the fact that compassion can have commercial perks. In a climate in which we wear our hearts (and logos) on our sleeves, the brand that stands for “kindness” or “sustainability” has more power.\n\n\nAnd so an industry that once made its business being facile has undergone a Damascene conversion. Doing good is hot right now. US Vogue, British Vogue’s sister publication, is said to be devoting an upcoming issue to sustainability. Dior is all about feminism. And quick on Vogue’s heels, this month also saw Renee E Tirado become the first global head of diversity and inclusion at Gucci, charged with creating a “more inclusive and equitable workplace” at the house.\nAnd yes. It could be hokum. Cynics will say that these initiatives are mere lip service in an industry that still venerates 18-year-old body shapes and charges fortunes for clothes. But consider how Sinead Burke is feeling. Having been born with dwarfism, the Irish campaigner has spent her adult life trying to make fashion more inclusive. And now she’s on the most important fashion cover of the year.\n“In the current climate, social issues have become a debate”, she told me (via Instagram, of course) of being Vogue’s latest cover star. “People’s lives and their right to exist have been transformed into polarising rhetoric. This [Vogue] issue is important because it centres and validates diverse lived experiences. It cultivates empathy through a first-person narrative on disability, race, sustainability, immigration and gender. This is the first time that a little person has ever featured on any Vogue cover – how will that visibility shape the ambition of a younger generation? That matters to me!”\nFor a statement such as that, you’d almost forget the steaming herbal tea.\n“This [Vogue] issue is important because it centres and validates diverse lived experiences. It cultivates empathy through a first-person narrative on disability, race, sustainability, immigration and gender.” – Sinead Burke\nBy Jo Ellison © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      Fashion faux pas: Versace, Coach, Givenchy apologise for errors on T-shirts
  </h1>, 'text': 'Luxury fashion brands Versace, Coach\xa0and Givenchy have apologised for making perceived affronts to China\'s national sovereignty with T-shirts listing Hong Kong and Taiwan as separate countries.\nVersace was criticised on Sunday (Aug 11) for a T-shirt that implied Hong Kong and Macau – both semi-autonomous cities in China – were independent.\nHong Kong has become a particularly sensitive subject in mainland China as the Asian financial hub has been plunged into months of protests.\nOn Monday (Aug 12), images of a 2018 Coach T-shirt that said Taiwan – a self-ruled democratic island Beijing regards as its territory – and Hong Kong were not part of China again provoked anger online.\nGivenchy too was outed for a similar offence: a black T-shirt that listed Taiwan and Hong Kong separately from cities in mainland China.\nAll three companies have tried to minimise the damage over the mistakes that cost them their high-profile Chinese brand ambassadors.\nCoach said in a statement Monday that the clothes with the ""serious inaccuracy"" had been pulled, adding it was ""fully aware of the severity of this error and deeply regret it"".\nThe brand corrected its website as well, after Chinese users shared screenshots online showing Hong Kong in a ""find by country"" drop-down list.\nVersace has also apologised. ""We love China and resolutely respect China\'s territorial national sovereignty,"" the Italian brand wrote on its Twitter-like Weibo account on Sunday.\nThe controversial T-shirts were removed from its official sales channels and ""destroyed"" on Jul\xa024, the company explained.\nGivenchy\'s Weibo apology also reiterated its respect for China\'s sovereignty, and said the brand ""resolutely upholds the One China Principle.""\n""SACRED AND INVIOLABLE""\nChinese users online, however, were not mollified.\n""There should be no missing part of China – Versace get out of China!"" wrote one angry Weibo user Monday.\nVersace\'s representative in China, actress Yang Mi, said she would stop collaborating with the fashion house over the T-shirt incident, saying the brand was ""suspected of damaging our country\'s national sovereignty.""\nSimilarly Coach\'s ambassador, Chinese model Liu Wen, said she was terminating her work with the brand over its T-shirt blunder.\n""At all times, China\'s national sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and inviolable!"" she posted on her official Weibo account.\n""I love my motherland, and resolutely defend China\'s national sovereignty!"" she wrote.\nAnd Jackson Yee, a hugely popular singer in boyband TFBoys, also pulled the plug on collaborating with Givenchy.\nThe three luxury brands are the latest examples of foreign companies that have run afoul of the many political sensitivities that go with operating in China\'s gigantic market.\nChinese authorities and state media have lashed out particularly in recent weeks at firms that appear to back the Hong Kong demonstrations, with flagship airline Cathay Pacific facing demands that staff who supported the protests be prevented from working on flights passing through Chinese airspace.\nIn May 2018, US clothing retailer Gap apologised over a T-shirt showing a map of mainland China that omitted Taiwan, which Beijing considers a rebel province awaiting reunification.\nItaly\'s Dolce & Gabbana also apologised in November after its products were pulled from lucrative Chinese e-commerce platforms over an Instagram post seen in China as culturally offensive.\n', 'related_topics': ['     coach ', '     China ', '     Hong Kong ', '     Taiwan ', '     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      How Naomi Campbell exorcised her demons and became a charity advocate
  </h1>, 'text': 'Perhaps the most surprising thing about Come fly with me, a video charting Naomi Campbell’s airport routine released on her YouTube channel Naomi, is not the revelation that she is a bit of a germaphobe, who keeps disposable plastic gloves and antiseptic Dettol wipes in her hand luggage. Nor is it the array of face masks she travels with, because “everything is for hydration”, nor the brightly coloured blankets she tucks into the seat before take off and has handwashed in her hotel. Nor even is it the mask she wears throughout the flight, “no matter what plane you take, private or commercial”, to avoid being infected by the sneezes that commence with the descent.\nIt’s the fact she decided to make a video on board a plane at all.\nAs those with slightly longer memories will recall, the last time the supermodel was so publicly associated with a flight was in 2008, when she was charged with assaulting two police officers after a disturbance on a plane at London Heathrow’s Terminal 5. Then 37, she was escorted from her Los Angeles-bound flight after complaining that a bag had gone missing. Perhaps it was one containing her Dettol wipes?\nThis followed Campbell’s appearance in criminal court the previous year, charged with assault for hitting her maid with a mobile phone. After pleading guilty, she was given 200 hours’ community service.\nIn the early part of this century her public image was tied up with a reputation for volatility. She fell out with agents and was described as difficult on set. Following the 2008 case, in which she pleaded guilty, she had to serve another 200 hours of community service. Her last court appearance took place in 2010, when she was questioned as a witness at the war crimes trial of the former Liberian ruler Charles Taylor about a blood diamond gift she was presented with in 1997 – not a great look.\nBut recent years have seen a very different Naomi narrative emerging. It’s one that has highlighted her work to champion diversity in fashion, her numerous charitable causes, from breast cancer awareness to children’s welfare to disaster relief, and her role as an ambassador for maternal health and, ultimately, fashion. Her transformation will see her fully redeemed in December at the Fashion Awards, in London, when she will be crowned an Icon, in recognition of her efforts to use fashion for change.\n\n\n“I think I made the name anger management famous,” Campbell said in 2013 of her road to rehabilitation in an interview which also discussed her former drug addiction. Her recovery has been slow and hard-won. And fair play to her. She’s worked hard on exorcising her demons, and though she has clearly retained the mark of an obsessive – I urge you to watch her wiping down a first-class cabin in rubber gloves and a silk, monogrammed Burberry pyjama suit – it’s rather sweet to think that for a new generation, Campbell will not be associated with air rage and anger but with her aggressive use of antiseptic wipes. Rather than an icon, she appears blessedly human. It’s undoubtedly her most relatable incarnation yet.\nPublic forgiveness is fickle. Some must labour for years in the shadow of their reputations. Others seem to get a free pass. Perhaps it depends where your position on the moral high ground was to start with. The stand-up comedian Louis CK who, in 2017, publicly acknowledged various acts of sexual misconduct has been booking – and filling – seats on a summer comeback tour that has been quietly growing in momentum.\nLast month, in Massachusetts, prosecutors dropped a case accusing Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct. This was the only case to have been brought against one of the most high-profile actors to have been embroiled in the #MeToo movement. But for how long will his reputation remain tainted? Must Spacey now embark on a crusade of philanthropic causes? Will he work again? It will be fascinating to see how quickly Hollywood extends its favour to his future career.\n\n\nAnd what of Dolce & Gabbana? The Italian brand seems to have become a bellwether when it comes to reading the mood in fashion regarding social justice. Having had to abort a show in China last November following a public relations disaster during which the brand’s designer Stefano Gabbana was accused of making racist insults on Instagram (though he said he had been hacked), the brand was removed from several Asian e-commerce sites and was widely considered toxic. Ever since, wearing the brand has been considered something of a statement, but recently it has become more visible again.\nCatherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, wore a grass-green Dolce & Gabbana dress to watch the women’s final at Wimbledon. She first wore it in 2016, on the royal tour in Canada – and possibly has no clue as to the context of her clothes – but as a gesture of support for the designers, who have maintained an uncharacteristically low profile since the events of last year, it will have been significant. And the moment will have gone a long way to reshape their reputation in the west.\nAsian clients, however, might need more persuading. In China, where the market is particularly determined by vloggers and social media stars, and People of Influence (POIs) are instrumental in a brand’s success, Dolce & Gabbana has yet to be forgiven. According to various sources, sales have failed to rebound in Asia since the scandals, but more crucially the POIs aren’t wearing it in public. A Duchess can do so much. But until the POIs pick it up again, Dolce & Gabbana will remain PNG (persona non grata).\nBy Jo Ellison © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Profiles ', ""     Women's Life ""]}"

      Fashion how-to: Styling hacks that Kim Kardashian keeps under her corset 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Clothing –\xa0especially dressy clothing –\xa0should not simply be worn. It often requires alterations or DIY\xa0hacks to look as good as possible. And, crucially, garments should be cared for, especially when they are costly or beloved. Here are some things to consider.\nALTERATIONS\xa0\nIf you’ve purchased a piece that doesn’t fit quite like a glove, or you have a well-worn outfit that’s due for some fixes, you might want to visit a tailor or a dry cleaner who performs alterations ahead of your event. Before you just walk into the nearest shop, it’s worth asking friends for recommendations: Once the fabric is cut, it can’t really be restored. Wherever you go, make sure you drop off the garment at least 3 weeks before you need to wear it.\nSHAPEWEAR\xa0\nLet’s start by saying that everyone’s body is wonderful and nothing must be done to make it look good in a dress. But, if you would like your clothes to lay smooth and flat on your person, there are plenty of things you can buy. The folks at Spanx and Commando produce seamless undergarments that are virtually undetectable underneath even the slinkiest dresses.\n\n\nTAPE\xa0\nIf, after the alterations and shapewear, something about your outfit still feels precarious, there’s always good old tape. Kim Kardashian proudly uses it to secure her dresses and decolletage, and she says gaffer tape works best. There’s also fashion tape and toupee tape, which are really just two types of double-sided tape with fancy names.\nIRONING AND STEAMING\xa0\nCreases can put a wrinkle in anyone’s plans to look great, so before you go out, consider ironing or steaming your outfit and putting it on a hanger so that it retains its polished appearance. Our friends at Wirecutter, a reviews site owned by The New York Times, recommend Maytag’s M400 iron for those who are in the market. Handheld steamers are a great investment, too, as they travel well and work like a charm.\nACCESSORIES\xa0\nHave you thought about jewellery? What tie you’ll wear? How you’ll carry your necessities? Whether you’ll need a coat, and which one to wear? These questions are best addressed at least a week prior to the event, so you have time to shop or borrow from a friend if needed.\nBy Bonnie Wertheim © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Meet the Singaporean woman making men's shoes using a guy's name
  </h1>, 'text': 'Shoes maketh the\xa0man – it’s a statement that Teresa Chong, the founder of local artisanal men’s footwear brand, Jonathan Abel, believes in.

In contrast, there are only a handful of shoemakers (providing)\xa0good-quality, handmade shoes at affordable prices, so it made more sense to focus on quality footwear for men,”\xa0she said, explaining the focus of her business.\n“At the same time, the global womenswear market, although much larger, was only forecast to grow by one\xa0to two\xa0per cent.

It’s simply a name made up by Chong to reflect the kind of gentleman the brand wishes to serve – someone who appreciates craftsmanship, good quality and design.\n“Most people I work with were surprised to learn that there is no Mr Jonathan Abel – in fact, when I first met with my shoemakers, they thought I was Mr Abel’s\xa0secretary!” she said, laughing.\nJonathan Abel\xa0is a homegrown brand, but the shoes are produced in Europe by a three-generation shoemaking family from Portugal. At a price point below S$350 for a ready-to-wear model, Chong\'s footwear isn\'t exactly ""cheap"", but they are considerably less expensive than those from high-end European shoe brands.\nTo Chong, the customer gets what he pays for. ""The price will largely signal if the shoe is cemented (merely glued together), or if it is Goodyear-welted (stitched) or handmade. Most shoes below S$200 are unable to accommodate the hours of labour required for stitched shoes,"" she said.\xa0\n\n\n""Goodyear-welted shoes can also be resoled once the outer sole wears out – this means that one pair of shoes can last you a much longer time, resulting in less waste in the environment.""\n""Also, quality shoes are made of genuine leather. Genuine leather will soften and mould lightly to the shape of your feet over time, and that makes your footwear more comfortable the more you wear them. When they are cared for properly, genuine leather shoes can also last for a longer time.""\nJonathan Abel is currently stocked at the men’s department of Takashimaya, and serves an international clientele on its website. It also offers a bespoke service available only in Singapore on top of its ready-to-wear collections, joining a gradually growing group of local names that are also making customised footwear for gents.\nWHAT CHALLENGES DID YOU FACE IN STARTING THE BUSINESS?\nThe initial lack of shoemaking knowledge put me at a distinct disadvantage – I didn’t know the processes or how the shoes were meant to be designed. But after spending time with shoemakers and reading as much as I could, I realised that it wasn’t as daunting as I’d thought it would be.\n\n\nTo understand and learn more about the craftsmanship, I studied under a Japanese bespoke shoemaker and spent a lot of time in my factory, talking to the craftspeople there and experiencing what it was like to make my own pair of shoes.\nTELL US ABOUT THE PORTUGUESE FAMILY THAT MAKES YOUR SHOES. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO WORK WITH THEM?\nWe work with a three-generation Portuguese shoemaking family – I work most closely with the grandson, but the original founder (the grandfather) still visits the factory occasionally to check on the work done.\nPrior to working with them, we visited and sampled our designs with shoemakers around the world – from Vietnam, China and Spain. But we felt that our ethos of slow fashion and deliberate craftsmanship was shared most keenly by this Portuguese family, yet they did not eschew technology completely.\nFor example, shoe patterns are traditionally cut by hand but this gives rise to quite a bit of wastage as errors are easily made during this process. In order to minimise wastage, our shoemakers make use of a leather-cutting machine. This marriage of old-school artisanal knowledge and technology is something that we want to be known for.\xa0\xa0\nHOW DOES THE BRAND\'S BESPOKE SERVICE WORK, SINCE YOU DON\'T HAVE YOUR OWN RETAIL SPACE?\nWe’ve just moved into a new warehouse-cum-showroom, and we conduct fittings for our Create Your Style (CYS) made-to-order programme by appointment.\nCustomers who come in are fitted with their proper sizes. Our CYS programme allows for less common sizes such as 38 and 46, across three widths. Asian men tend to have wider feet, so some narrow widths made for Caucasian feet may not fit properly.\n\n\nWe provide customers with a style book from which they choose the main shoe style – they can then customise nearly everything from the leather type and colour, colour of the shoelaces, insoles and outsoles, and opt to have their names or initials printed on the inside. In all, we have over five million possible combinations.\nThe CYS programme starts from S$450; the final price tag depends on the customisations that the customer opts for. Each CYS commission takes about eight\xa0to 12 weeks to produce, and comes with a complimentary pair of shoe trees.\nAs with all Jonathan Abel shoes, we offer a resoling service for customers to replace outsoles that have been worn out. Our entire line – from the ready-to-wear and CYS programme – are handcrafted using Goodyear-welt construction.\nIf the instep or ball-of-the-feet area feels tight, it is worth trying different widths rather than merely sizing up.\nSOME PEOPLE STILL DON\'T LIKE\xa0THE IDEA OF BUYING SHOES OVER THE INTERNET. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?\nWhile the general trend is that people still like buying shoes in store, women are still more likely than men to “test” new brands by buying them online. We do get customers who try their shoes in a physical location, and later opt to buy them online.\nTo be honest, I don’t see much change in this trend as the younger generations – millennials and Gen Z – are tactile shoppers and like to touch and feel products before purchasing. I think the way forward for retail is in a seamless omni-channel approach that will marry offline experiences and online shopping.\nWHAT ARE SOME COMMON SHOE MISTAKES THAT MEN – OR WOMEN FOR THAT MATTER – MAKE?\nMost people buy shoes that are either too small or too big. They think socks, or the lack thereof, can compensate for the wrong size. We tend to only look at sizes that largely correspond to the length of the shoes and over-compensate for a tighter width by trying to size up. If the instep or ball-of-the-feet area feels tight, it is worth trying different widths rather than merely sizing up.\nA functional collection should always consist of at least three\xa0pairs of leather shoes – mainly because leather shoes are not meant to be worn daily.\nBESIDES SNEAKERS AND OTHER CASUAL FOOTWEAR, WHAT ELSE SHOULD THE MODERN GENT HAVE IN HIS SHOE COLLECTION?\nA functional collection should always consist of at least three\xa0pairs of leather shoes – mainly because leather shoes are not meant to be worn daily; they require a day of “rest” in between each wear.\nYou can never go wrong with the classics, such as a black Oxford that is formal enough for any work situation. I’d also pick a loafer for the weekend or casual events – it can be worn with jeans or slacks.\nFor something fun and unexpected, I’d suggest (something in an interesting colour\xa0such as)\xa0our Matthew double monks in bordeaux – the double monks are able to pull double duty both in formal and casual situations, and bordeaux is a great alternative to blacks and browns.\nHOW DO SINGAPORE MEN FARE IN TERMS OF FOOTWEAR STYLE?\nMost local men buy shoes in black, black\xa0and more black. As office dress codes become more casual, I think men can afford to explore different colours – we introduced our museum calf collection for this very reason. At the same time, I think men need not wear one single pair of shoes for every occasion. It’s perfectly fine to own more than one!\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     Men ', ""     Women's Life "", ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      In the age of social media, luxury is an experience that must be felt
  </h1>, 'text': ""What is luxury in this day and age of smartphones and Instagram? Is it an ideal meant to be photographed, liked and savoured over the high-tech shine of a phone screen? For Loro Piana, the Italian purveyor of some of the world's most sought-after cashmere and wool products, luxury is something that cannot be seen. Instead, it must be felt. Luxury is an evocative experience as simple as a soft caress on the skin.\nFounded in 1924 by Pietro Loro Piana in the commune of Quarona, Italy, Loro Piana is synonymous with tradition and ingenuity. From an understated cashmere sweater to a refined wool coat, every piece in its inventory has been carefully produced using the finest materials and sophisticated know-how that combines time-honoured techniques with cutting-edge technology. Every aspect of Loro Piana's business is committed to innovation, tradition and nature, and it's especially evident in its top-of-the-line The Gift of Kings range.\nThe Gift of Kings is the quality par excellence of Merino wool, touted by Loro Piana as nature's noble gift to the world. It couldn't have been a more apt description. Harnessed from a specific breed of Merino sheep, this rarefied form of wool was bestowed its regal title when pairs of the animal was presented as treasures to the royal families of France, Britain and Holland by the King of Spain during the 18th century.\nFast forward three centuries years later, and the precious wool became intertwined with Loro Piana's own history when third-generation scion Pier Luigi Loro Piana travelled to various sheep farms in Australia and New Zealand to seek out rare versions of Merino wool. His quest eventually led the brand to establish The Record Bale in 1997, an annual award that not only recognises the finest bales of Merino wool supplied each year, but also encourages the preservation of skills and processes that go into its production.\nSince its inception, The Record Bale has become the benchmark for excellence. In order to make the grade, breeders have their work cut out for them. According to statistics provided by Loro Piana, only 0.0006 percent of the Merino wool produced is worthy enough to be considered The Gift of Kings. The wool fibres average 12 microns (a unit of measurement used to determine microscopic thickness), making them thinner than human hair. They are so fine that one kilogram of the finished yarn stretches for an astonishing 130km when unwound. The yarn also undergoes eight rounds of stringent checks to ensure their utmost quality.\nAt its core, Loro Piana's The Gift of Kings is a respectful tribute to the wonders of the natural world, be it the crystal clear waters that nourishes the land or the undulating pastures that is home to the herds of grazing sheep. It is a vital link to the chain, which is why Loro Piana has pledged to protect and preserve the fertile environment that gives birth to these sartorial gems. The brand is also committed to ensure that the naturally-occurring, biodegradable wool is obtained through sustainable practices.\nUltimately, The Gift of Kings represents Loro Piana's ongoing retelling of a story that began with a journey for perfection. It weaves together nature's beauty, the art of craft, and the passion of man into one sumptuous fabric, to become sweaters, blazers, scarves and bombers. How luxurious is that?\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Italy ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      Gentlemen, understated style is what you want with shoes – here's where to get it
  </h1>, 'text': ""In the women's footwear universe, few things are as instantly recognisable and iconic as the red soles on a pair of Christian Louboutin heels. Even how it came to be has become the stuff of legend: In 1993, the famed shoe designer was working on a design inspired by Andy Warhol's Flowers artwork, when he grabbed an assistant's red nail polish and painted the sole of the prototype to bring it to life. In the years since, this stroke of genius has come to signify elegance and sensuality – all it takes is a flash of red to leave an impression.\nWhen it comes to men's shoes however, things are a little less obvious. Even though we've seen a range of fashion-forward styles such as the chunky dad sneaker solidify their presence on the runways, subtlety is still very much key for the discerning gentleman on the street. Be it a stitch or an embossed detail, men's brands are exuding class and sophistication in the most understated ways. And if you're on the search for luxurious footwear that do exactly just that, here are seven brands to consider.\nBERLUTI\nFounded in 1895 by Alessandro Berluti, this Paris-based, Italian leather goods brand crafts shoes that are in a class of their own. Now helmed by Kris Van Assche, Berluti's claim to fame include handsome Derbies and Oxfords coloured in an unmistakable patina. The beautiful ombre effect is achieved by hand by Berluti’s artisans and gives the shoes a refined appearance. Berluti is also noted for its “Scritto” engraving, an understated calligraphy borrowed from an 18th century letter that is inscribed into some of its shoes as an exquisite pattern.\nJOHN LOBB\nMaybe it’s the way the shoe envelops the foot. Or maybe it's the way the leather catches the light – John Lobb's creations exhibit an air of elegance that solidifies the brand's reputation as one of the finest men's shoemakers. Throughout the course of its 150-year history, John Lobb's designs have shod the feet of royals, as well as business and political figures. And with the sleek lines of the shoes achieved using techniques passed down from one generation to another, it’s no wonder men of all ages and walks of life are drawn to the footwear. Each pair reportedly takes 190 steps and hundreds of hours to complete. If this isn't dedication to craft, we don't know what is.\nCHURCH'S\nWhen Englishman Thomas Church first set up a small workshop along Northampton's Maple Street in 1873, little did he know that his eponymous brand will go on to become synonymous with high quality dress shoes that meld timeless design with top-notch craftsmanship. Today, the brand boasts an international network of boutiques. From St Moritz to Singapore, style-conscious men are stepping out in its shoes. Its Oxford brogue shoes, for example, are perennial crowd pleasers. Perfect for formal occasions, the shoes lend themselves well to a tweed suit.\nMAISON MARGIELA\nPerhaps no other shoe in fashion has achieved true cult status like the Tabi has. Based on centuries-old Japanese socks and modelled after the Japanese worker's shoe jika-tabi, the footwear made its fashion debut in 1988, when the rule-breaking Martin Margiela presented it as part of his debut collection. Put within fashion's context, the Tabi's split-toe design immediately became a peculiar wonder that elicited either curious stares or an unspoken acknowledgement. Three decades since its induction into fashion's Hall of Fame, the Tabi continues to be one of those rare pieces that will incite conversation no matter the era it is in.\nGUIDI\nGuidi was established in 1896 as a tannery but it only began producing shoes in 2004 after Ruggero Guidi (he runs the family business) began crafting versions of beat-up worker's shoes and hiking boots he'd collected. His hobby eventually metamorphosised into a shoemaking business that eschews mass production techniques to focus on tradition and craftsmanship. A rugged boot with a front zip detail is easily the star product in Guidi's line-up of well-crafted leather footwear.\nCOMMON PROJECTS\nThe brainchild of former magazine art director Peter Poopat and brand consultant Flavio Girolami, Common Projects is an American brand renowned for its minimalist sneakers. The understated and fuss-free designs reference popular styles such as the Converse Chuck Taylor and the Adidas Stan Smith, but elevated through the use of top-quality materials such as Italian nappa leather. In lieu of a logo, a discreet series of gold numbers stamped above the sole has become the brand's most distinctive feature.\nMOONSTAR\nMoonStar's half-canvas, half-rubber sneakers embody the pride the Japanese have for their craft. The brand operates out of Kurume, a city on Japan's Kyushu Island, and employs a trial-and-tested procedure to manufacture the vulcanised rubber outsoles that give the shoes their unique look. The sneakers don't just look good, they're functional too. Thanks to their waterproof quality, they're touted as an all-weather essential perfect for your off-duty style.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      Is Donatella ready for a successor to take over creative control of Versace?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Donatella Versace said she hasn’t seen a movie since A Star Is Born last year. She’s hooked on the HBO series Big Little Lies, devoured Netflix’s The Society and has a new favourite book: The Mueller Report.\nVersace had trouble understanding parts of the conclusions and findings of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. She keeps underlining things, wondering (as she often does) whether her English is getting in the way.\nBut, she said of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, “There’s something about lawmen I find fascinating. You look at him and know he’s telling the truth.”\nAnd, she admitted, “he is good-looking.”\n“Ugh,” she added. “Don’t print this. I’ll lose my visa.”\nLast year, she sold her company to Michael Kors for a reported US$2.2 billion (S$2.99 billion), but she got to New York via Emirates airline. “Commercial,” said Versace, who remains the chief creative officer of her label. “Always commercial. If there aren’t 12 rows of windows, I don’t get on.”\n\n\nIt was a Thursday afternoon, and Versace was perched on a sofa in the gilded Versace-esque Midtown Manhattan hotel suite. On Sunday evening, Versace “of course” had plans to see Madonna perform at the Pier Dance.\n\n\nA post shared by Donatella Versace (@donatella_versace)\nMadonna has history with the company. She first appeared in a Versace campaign in 1995, when Steven Meisel photographed her looking just like Donatella.\nBack then, Versace’s brother Gianni was Versace’s chief designer. His baby sister was the party girl/front row fixture who marshalled celebrities to fashion shows and helped conceive Versus, the company’s bridge line. She had hair down to her waist, wore slinky metallic gowns and showed off her cleavage. So that’s how Madonna was styled.\nIn 2015, 18 years after Gianni’s death, Madonna returned for another campaign. This time she paid tribute to boardroom Donatella, licking envelopes and putting her feet up on the desk as she tapped away at an Apple computer.\n\n\nWhat is true power in fashion if not the ability to hire one of the world’s biggest celebrities to impersonate you?\nAnyway, other people do it for free.\nVersace can barely step outside without having a drag queen approach to thank her for providing them with inspiration. Versace attributes this in part to her “acceptance” of other people, who know instinctually they can walk up to her and that she’ll be nice. “I say, ‘Hi, I’m Donatella,’ and they go, ‘Aaaah!’” she said.\nBut it’s her appearance, too. “The hair and make up and clothes,” she said. “I do not blend.”\nGianni was the one who set her on the path.\nWhen she was 11, he told her two important things: That he was gay and that she needed to become a blonde. Once she acquiesced to his wishes, their history together was secured. After it became clear that being gay was an impediment to having a life in Calabria, Italy, he moved to Milan. She followed him there.\nIn the 1980s, fashion was a business in which gay men could work with a fair amount of acceptance. But living life openly still wasn’t easy. “Our father was a very distant man,” Versace said.\nSo Gianni never came out to him.\nWhen Gianni was alive, he and Donatella went to gay nights at big clubs. “Palladium, and what’s the one in the church?” Versace said, referring to Limelight.\nAfter his death in 1997, Donatella Versace took over the company and became the unapologetic maven of Italian opulence.\nMaya Rudolph impersonated her to great effect on Saturday Night Live, and Versace rolled with it. They stood on stage with each another at the 2002 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards, wearing nearly identical sequined gowns, basically competing to show the world which one of them was the most Donatella – the real or the fake.\nLady Gaga later did a tribute song to her. The lyrics went: “I am so fab. Check out: I’m blond, I’m skinny, I’m rich, and I’m a little bit of a bitch.”\nVersace put her in a campaign.\n\n\nEven in rehab, where Versace went in 2004 to deal with a cocaine problem, her biggest complaint was about wardrobe. “I said, ‘The only thing I miss are my high heels,’” said Versace, sober ever since.\nShe didn’t love that Ryan Murphy chose last year to revisit the past in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. So she hasn’t seen Penelope Cruz play her. Versace said there are some “errors” in the show but offered no specifics as to what they were.\n“I know what happened,” she said. (The show, a limited series for FX, won seven Emmys and two Golden Globes.)\nIn person these days, Versace’s act is considerably toned down.\nThe tan has gotten less pronounced, and her famous hair goes just about to her shoulders. Even the cigarettes are gone. “Two packs of Marlboros a day,” she said.\nVersace quit five years ago, after seeing a doctor in New York who told her not only that she was going to die from them, but also that he wasn’t going to see her again for checkups unless she stopped.\nVersace was terrified at the certainty with which he spoke to her. But there was also something appealing about someone with the nerve to say no to her. “No one else did,” she said.\nVersace still misses the feeling of nicotine hitting her throat. She still thinks cigarettes look great and misses having her trademark Medusa lighter. “I want to go back,” she said, laughing.\nBut she didn’t seem to mean it. The recent deaths of two close friends who had cancer have made Versace more contemplative. She is aware that nothing is forever.\nThe first was Ingrid Sischy, the longtime editor of Interview Magazine, who died in 2015. The second was Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue.\nThey were the ones Versace called for advice. “Any time I had a problem,” she said.\nVersace, 64, doesn’t know how much longer she’ll run her own company.\nIn 2015, she starred in an ad campaign for Givenchy, whose designer Riccardo Tisci was an obvious steward to carry the Versace brand into the social media age. After his resignation from Givenchy, Versace and Tisci had what many believed was a long negotiation about him taking over her company. It seemed a fait accompli.\nWhat happened?\n“Nothing,” Versace said. “I stayed where I am, and he went somewhere else.” (Tisci is now the designer of Burberry.)\n\n\nShe doesn’t want to remain in her job for life, as Karl Lagerfeld, who worked all the way to his death this year at the age of 85, did. “At some point, you understand you need help,” she said. “But at the moment, I feel totally full of life.”\nBy Jacob Bernstein © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Italy ', '     fashion ', '     Profiles ', ""     Women's Life ""]}"

      The most stylish sandals for traipsing around town or hitting the beach
  </h1>, 'text': ""Call the humble sandal one of fashion's greatest marvels if you will – the oldest known pair, unearthed in Fort Rock Cave in the United States, is at least 10,000 years old. Seen on age-old Greek statues and Egyptian hieroglyphics, the sandal has survived the passage of time and witnessed the history of mankind.\nNot bad for a type of footwear whose design has remained largely the same since it appeared in various ancient civilisations around the world. Today, the sandal is a perennial warm-weather favourite, conjuring images of glorious blue skies and golden rays of sunshine. No tropical escapade is also complete without it, so check out these cool pairs to hit the beach in.\n\n\nNEW AND IMPROVED\nThere was a time when the sandal suffered a bad rep in the style front too, no thanks to its association with fuddy-duddy tourist types. Fortunately for the rest of us, the sandal has cleaned up its act, courtesy of astute designers who introduced a slew of improvements such as sleeker lines and the use of luxurious materials.\nTip\nStep out in a pair of impeccably tailored shorts to accentuate the appeal of the sandal. \nON HIGHER GROUND\nSandals are made for adventures too, evident in the ways designers have added functional buckles, handy fastenings and hardy rubber trim details to the footwear. Neoprene finishing and chunky soles, meanwhile, immediately inject a fashion-forward attitude to the sandal.\nTip\nTake great sartorial strides when you wear the sandals with brightly coloured socks.\n\n\nDOUBLE THE IMPACT\nInstantly recognisable by their sand-coloured, contoured footbed, Birkenstock sandals are back in fashion's spotlight. It is the subject of several high-profile collaborations: From Rick Owens to Valentino's Pierpaolo Piccioli, designers are elevating the Birkenstock's charm with high-fashion sensibilities.\nTip\nDress up the sandals with a louche suit. \nBIG SPLASH\nAn off-shoot of the sandal, the pool slide is gaining popularity among style-conscious consumers who want to add a fuss-free alternative to their summer shoe rotation. As a result, notable brands such as Balenciaga, Off-White and Gucci have all come up with their own interpretations, upping the luxe factor of the slides.\nTip\nThe slides work well in urban settings too – simply wear them with cool streetwear pieces.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ']}"

      Burberry undergoes makeover with new logo-style branding and twists on classics
  </h1>, 'text': 'It has a hotshot new designer known for dressing Beyonce and is experimenting with monthly product launches on social media.\nNow Burberry is moving past its famed camel check prints with new logo-style branding meant to give its handbags and other wares the kind of covetable cachet top luxury rivals like LVMH\'s Louis Vuitton have long enjoyed.\nIt\'s a gamble as fans of the British label digest the unfamiliar monogram – a motif of interlocking ""Ts"" and ""Bs"" in a nod to founder Thomas Burberry – splashed onto everything from hoodies to high heels.\nBut the makeover, part of a bid to revive stagnant sales, also reflects a growing battle among high-end brands to lure young shoppers in markets like Asia, including with instantly recognisable items they can flaunt – leading to a recent proliferation of logo-driven launches by Burberry rivals too.\nBurberry\'s revamped image is set to get its first real test on Tuesday (Jul 16), with first quarter sales that should reflect the higher proportion of designs by former Givenchy star Riccardo Tisci gradually making their way into stores.\nAfter unveiling his first take on the label last September – including twists on Burberry classics, like trench coats lined with punky rings, more than a third of items in stores should now carry Tisci\'s stamp, analysts estimate.\nSome are optimistic that comparable revenue growth will improve as a result, from an underwhelming 1 per cent in the previous three months to 3 per cent according to JP Morgan.\nBurberry\'s new monogram products, which it began pushing in May in a special collection that included US$690 bum bags and US$400 baseball caps, will likely only account for a tiny part of that.\nBut the bet is that heightened buzz around the brand linked to the launch – with campaigns featuring model-of-the-moment Gigi Hadid – should have helped spur demand for other items too.\nSTRONG REACTIONS\nThat\'s despite a mixed reaction to the design so far, including among Chinese consumers, the luxury industry\'s biggest client base, at a time when the Burberry\'s growth rates in mainland China have been lagging behind those of some peers.\n""It\'s a reversal to the trend of designing to appeal to younger people, the monogram looks just old,"" said 22-year-old Kexin Fan, from central China\'s Zhengzhou city, who said she tended to buy scarves from Burberry every year.\nFor others, however, the print – with versions in bolder, orange tones or greens and browns – was younger-looking and jazzier than the traditional camel, black and red check.\n""I now go to Burberry more, rather than just going there to shop for parents during Chinese New Year in the old days,"" said Shanghai-based Jing Han, 26.\nAt one of Burberry\'s New York stores, interspersed with monogrammed products, shop assistants said the collection had been selling well.\n""Strong reactions of any kind are usually a good thing,"" one added.\nUsing trademarks is a minefield for luxury labels, with the risk of damaging or cheapening their image by overdoing it.\nBurberry, which under CEO Marco Gobbetti is looking to go more upmarket, had only recently managed to rehabilitate its check print, so widely copied and worn in the early 2000s its sales suffered.\nBut brands have major incentives to follow this route too, as consumer tastes shift towards more casual clothes – creating a need for trademarks setting apart luxury cotton T-shirts from standard ones.\n""There\'s great value from a margins standpoint from logos for a brand, the price ratio on a product goes up with a logo on it,"" said luxury goods consultant Robert Burke.\nItaly\'s Salvatore Ferragamo, which is also looking to reignite sales growth, is using a new monogram of little C-shaped hooks, or ""gancini"" in Italian, that feature in metal form on its loafers.\nLOGOMANIA\nFerragamo and Burberry may benefit in the short term from a monogram fad, as a revival of shoutier, plain logos over the past three years – sparked by the likes of Kering\'s Gucci and Balenciaga as a tongue-in-cheek 1990s throwback – starts to peak.\nAccording to fashion trend forecasting firm WGSN, UK online luxury retailers increased their offer of single-logo items by 15 per cent in the first quarter of 2019, down from 48 per cent growth a year earlier.\n""Customers (are) responding well to brands who have started to use logos as a design feature, incorporating them into prints,"" said Celenie Seidel, senior womenswear editor at retailer Farfetch.\nIn the longer run, Burberry is banking on the patterned print to help improve its performance in high-margin leather goods, which make up 38 per cent of its sales, less than the roughly 60 per cent and 75 per cent at sector champions Gucci and Vuitton. Both have developed recognisable monograms over several decades.\nIts bet is that the monogram could be declined into different shades more easily than the camel check, while remaining identifiable.\n(Reporting by Sarah White, Additional reporting by Pei Li in Beijing and Melissa Fares in New York; Editing by Mark Potter)\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      Stella McCartney ties up with LVMH and ignites fashion rivalry
  </h1>, 'text': 'French luxury goods group LVMH on Monday (Jul 15) announced a tie-up with Stella McCartney, just months after the British designer known for her animal-friendly ethics ended a long-term partnership with the conglomerate\'s arch-rival Kering.\nLVMH, which owns fashion labels including Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, gave no financial details, though it said Stella McCartney would have majority ownership of her namesake label and stay on as creative chief.\nLike industry rivals, LVMH has been increasingly vaunting its environmental credentials at a time when young shoppers in particular have shown a penchant for ""greener"" fashion and an interest in issues such as brands\' use of animal fur.\nMcCartney has long been known as a trailblazer in this area, relying on imitation leather for her handbags or participating in initiatives to promote the second-hand luxury market.\n""A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on,"" LVMH\'s billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said of the deal in a statement. The designer will advise LVMH\'s executive committee on these matters, the group added.\nBut LVMH\'s swoop also ramps up the competition with Kering.\nThe group – run by another French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault – is still a lot smaller than LVMH, which also owns champagne labels. But its crown jewel is Gucci, a brand long coveted by LVMH, and Kering had helped McCartney develop her brand over a 17-year joint venture.\nThat only ended when she fully bought back her 50 per cent stake this March.\nThe designer was coy about her reasons for leaving, telling Reuters before the split was finalised: ""Having control of the company is important when your name is above the door and I think if you have that option it\'s rude not to.""\nOn Monday McCartney said in a statement that she had received interest from other investors.\n""While these approaches were interesting none could match the conversation I had with Bernard Arnault and his son Antoine,"" McCartney said, adding the group wanted to ""accelerate the full potential of the brand.""\nThe label has never broken out its full results, but was one of Kering\'s smaller brands, dwarfed by others like Saint Laurent and Balenciaga.\nLondon-born Stella McCartney, daughter of the Beatles\' Paul McCartney, first made her mark at Richemont-owned fashion label Chloe. She launched her eponymous label in partnership with the Gucci Group, formerly a division of what is now Kering, in 2001.\n(Reporting by Sarah White and Pascale Denis; Editing by Geert De Clercq and David Evans)\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      Is that bikini unflattering? How to choose the right swimwear for your body type
  </h1>, 'text': 'Wearing a swimsuit for everyone to see can be daunting, unless you are blessed with a well-proportioned body. Rarely does wearing a garment require so much consideration, shopping around and prep work – some go so far as to incorporate body scrubs, self-tanners, waxing sessions and a flab-reducing exercise routine into their pre-beach vacay regimen.\nBut of course, besides all these, the most important factor in a woman’s level of beach- or poolside confidence is the actual swimwear in question. These come in a\xa0variety of styles and designs, and how they are cut can significantly affect the way they clad your body despite, well, the lack of fabric.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nDecorative elements have a key role to play, too. A well-placed print, flounce or cut-out can do wonders to slim or even out your figure, provided you know how to identify what works for your body type. Read on for advice on how to find\xa0that magical swimsuit that will boost your confidence to new heights.\n\n\nIF YOU’RE LARGE-CHESTED\nYou’ve got the assets and you want to flaunt them. But take care not to go for plunging necklines or overly skimpy styles that reveal too much cleavage – you want admiring glances and not leers from men.\nThe problem with a large chest is that it’s also got heft. Look out for swimsuits that provide adequate support and lift to give you a youthful-looking silhouette. Your best bet (especially for a D cup and above) is a bra-top style that comes with underwire to keep sagging in check.\nDon’t bother with tube-top and bandeau styles – they won’t give you ample coverage and will threaten to slip off your chest with every move you make. Bikinis are okay but find a top with thicker straps or in a halter-neck style that will fit you more securely than a string bikini can.\nIf you are, instead, more concerned with concealing your ample chest than showing it off, a high-neck swimsuit that is cut in at the shoulders is a figure-flattering style that will help you accomplish that.\nIF YOU’VE GOT SMALL BREASTS\nLess endowed in terms of chest size? Don’t let that get you down\xa0because you\xa0have more options in the swimsuit department than the curvier ladies.\nBecause you’re likely to be skinny or lean, you can get away with just about every swimsuit style out there. Go ahead and try what you like, be it a string bikini, tankini, one-piece, toga or bandeau.\nThe qualities you should be looking out for when shopping for a swimsuit are design elements that can add oomph to your figure. Besides push-up padding, prints and details like ruffles or gathers are interesting ways to visually add a couple of inches to the areas where you need them most.\n\n\nFOR THOSE WITH ‘TUMMY ISSUES’\nBelly bulge, cellulite, post-birth sag – these are the common complaints that keep women away from midriff-baring swimsuit designs. You might not feel confident enough to work a bikini, but you can definitely wear a tankini, especially one with a high-rise bottom that will keep your belly covered.\nFor a sleeker silhouette, try swimwear that features tummy-control fabric – they’ll hold in your belly, while some will lift and smoothen out the bum area too. Look out for one-piece styles with a design or colour panels that are positioned in such a way that they can visually play down your tummy. These are harder to come by and if you can find one, we’d strongly suggest buying a spare piece to keep.\nFOR THE PEAR-SHAPED FIGURE\nThe pear-shaped figure is the most predominant body type among women, albeit existing in varying degrees. While it can be easily hidden under your regular clothes with smart styling tricks, it’s harder to conceal in swimwear, which is skin-tight and leaves much of your body exposed.\nPlay with visual contrast when wearing a two-piece swimsuit: Add volume to your torso with prints, bright and light colours or design accents, and play down your hips with plain bottoms in solid dark colours.\nAvoid bottoms with a boy-leg cut as they will widen your hips and draw attention to your lower body. A high-cut leg will suit you better, no matter on a one-piece or two-piece swimsuit, as they will de-emphasise the width of your hips.\nIF YOU’RE THE ATHLETIC TYPE\nThe athletic body shape tends to be straight from top to bottom and is quite muscular, so your aim will be to find swimwear that can define your waist and create some curves.\nTwo-piece suits that\xa0break up the straight lines of your figure will give you\xa0a curvier shape. Alternatively, one-piece styles with cut-outs around the waist can help to visually nip in the waist.\nIf you’re small-chested and have an athletic build at the same time, avoid string bikinis and ultra-sexy styles with plunging necklines as they can potentially make your figure look manlier by contrast. Why not work to your advantage with swimsuits in sportier designs like crop tops? You already have the bod to match them.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Technical mastery and flashes of magic seen at Couture Week in Paris
  </h1>, 'text': 'Positioned at the most exclusive end of the business, couture clothes have only a few hundred clients and the one-of-a-kind, bespoke pieces cost many thousands of pounds. But while the week represents fashion at its most aspirational, the shows are instrumental in driving sales – of fragrance for the most part. Couture must therefore inform the mood that then percolates through the brand – it’s the purest expression of a creative point of view.\nAnd that point of view has shifted. Virginie Viard, who was appointed creative director at Chanel following the death of Karl Lagerfeld in February, now finds herself among a triumvirate of women leading three of the most influential labels in the industry (including Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy). Her role cannot be underestimated: In June, Chanel announced 2018 revenues of more than US$11bn (S$14.97bn). In this time of creative transition, she must now be a safe pair of hands.\nViard was first appointed to Chanel in 1997. For more than two decades, she was Lagerfeld’s most trusted lieutenant, but her first couture collection for the house announced a pivot away from her predecessor’s vision. The collection was spare and pared back. The silhouette was cleaner, and the accessories were kept to a minimum – a single pearl earring rather than the strings of gewgaws that might have been before.\nStaged at the Grand Palais in a multi-tiered library set that recalled the reading room at the British Museum, Viard’s models walked among the literary works – French classics, faux covers – in patent flats and spectacles, with their hair tied in prim ponytails. The looks were trimmed of fat: Long-line tweed coat dresses with an ivory silk lining; bourgeois skirt suits and wide-legged trousers in the same Thirties style worn by the house’s founder Gabrielle Chanel.\nIn channelling the spirit of the house’s fabled “Coco”, Viard introduced a new rigour at Chanel. The clothes looked more chic, though perhaps not as fun, or as fabulous, as the typical Chanel client may favour. Viard was merely tweaking the mood at a house whose codes are as tightly bound as its logo’s entwined “C”s, but it promised much for the future.\nNo student of subtlety, Maria Grazia Chiuri’s message at Dior has as often as not been broadcast all over a T-shirt. Her very first show for the house, SS17, took its cue from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s 2014 essay We Should All Be Feminists, and her endeavours to empower the narrative at Dior were rewarded this week when the Rome-born designer was presented with the Legion d’Honneur. As a sign of acceptance in the autocratic world of French fashion it made for a lovely moment. Chiuri hasn’t always seduced the press with her wearable, comfortable clothing, despite the fact it sells by the truck load (she has been the most commercially successful womenswear designer at Dior in decades), and this acknowledgment, of her talent and political activism was a timely pat on the back.\nHer autumn/winter couture show announced another slogan – “are clothes modern?” – and the collection was designed to be a dialogue with the essayist Bernard Rudofsky who first asked the question in 1944 for a show about contemporary apparel at MOMA. He thought fashion too ephemeral to be significant. Chiuri thinks otherwise. Her collection was a series of designs to “house” the body (quite literally in fact: One look was a gold-coloured recreation of the Dior headquarters on Avenue Montaigne) and a reaffirmation of the couturier’s skills. Almost all the looks were black – a personal choice for the designer who wears it near exclusively herself – and the set was decorated with images of women who looked a bit like the corpse of Twin Peaks’ Laura Palmer.\nThe dialogue was commendable, if a little confusing. And the clothes were exquisitely produced. But for a show about modernity, I found the New Look silhouettes, beret hats with net veils, and endless mono palette a little dated. By far the most modish garments were the “toga” gowns that opened and closed the show. The clothes of antiquity have long fired Chiuri’s imagination (as they did Christian Dior himself) and here they looked modern and new.\nThere were more architectural influences at Givenchy, where Clare Waight Keller had imagined her muse within the faded grandeur of an aristocratic house, replete with exotic birds – her models had their hair whipped into cockatoo ruffs. The clothes were designed with a domestic space in mind – a jacquard carpet dress, lampshade crinolines, a sherbet pink ballgown that might have started life as a wall-hanging. It sounds eccentric, and at moments it was (I have no desire to wear a dress that looks like it might have once been a curtain) but Waight Keller keeps a steady hand on the tiller, and this collection was coolly controlled despite its flights of fancy.\nMonochrome colours, strict silhouettes, the season had a schoolmarmish sobriety about it. The first 20 looks at Armani Prive were also lean and clean – long black velvet coat dresses, some with white shawl collars, suggested a Puritan rigour. The following 20, in shades of baby pink and pistachio, made the case for the sugar-plum fairy. Nonetheless, even the most saccharine looks here were painstakingly put together. But so much control can leave one cold. After bold shows of blacks and greys and artisanal technique, I craved colour, flamboyance – and chaos.\nAt Maison Margiela, John Galliano trusted his instincts to deliver a bravura collection of men’s and women’s clothes designed via “the heart not the head”. It’s an intuitive thinking process he learnt while doing equine therapy in Arizona, part of his rehabilitation from drug addiction, and now uses creatively to stunning effect. His “nomadic” trouser dresses, cut from oversized zoot suit pants and then reconstructed to create gowns with a Watteau neckline were technically brilliant. Better still his collection, with its “gesture of couture”, bullet-hole laces, “filtrage” effect photoprints and wartime sailor collars, had real drama without being too scripted.\nFor pure joyously, saturated, technicolour pleasure however, it was once again Pierpaolo Piccioli’s moment. In recent seasons, the creative director of Valentino has ascended into some sort of super firmament of fashion, creating clothes so dazzling and delicious that his catwalks (and especially his couture collections) have taken on a kind of magic. “You want colour,” he asked as he brushed past a huge silk faille gown in a lime so acidic it would near take your eye out . . . “Here it is.”\nAnd here it was. Piccioli’s moodboard featured Berber hats, Irving Penn portraits, Renaissance paintings, Guy Bourdin’s beauty pictures and Diana Vreeland’s maxim that the “eye has to travel”. His only constraint was that no look should look like another, and that no look be inspired by a single thing. “I wanted total freedom,” he said of the collection that juxtaposed the most perfect of column dresses in cashmere with vast lace confections embroidered in a leopard-print of sequins, or lemon yellow dresses fashioned with a body of flowers and a skirt tiered with tufts of raw wool. Looks were vast and opulent, monastically minimal and nowhere in between. “I’m not really a fan of the half gesture,” he said.\nNeither does he care to talk about technique. But he is passionate about the staff of the atelier with whom he works and was quick to celebrate their efforts: one of the petites mains explained how she had worked out the impossible geometry of a pink square dress using 4,000 pieces of fabric, a pen and paper. The work had taken three-and-half months. At the show’s end, Piccioli took his applause alongside the staff. There was an ovation. And weeping.\nFor all the mastery on show this week, this nourished the soul. Piccioli’s genius is in illuminating the wonder of the workroom while creating clothes packed with personality and emotion. His work resonates, whether it’s on the runway, the red carpet, or on our social media feeds. And at couture in particular, he shows beautiful clothes that just make people feel happy.\nDoes it matter that we’ll never afford them? “I don’t go to a museum and expect to buy a Picasso,” shrugged Piccioli. He should put that on a T-shirt.\nBy Jo Ellison © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Paris ', '     women ', '     Men ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Boys will be boys: Menswear returns to an age of innocence
  </h1>, 'text': 'If the recently concluded fashion month was of any indication, streetwear is losing its dominance in menswear. Instead, we witnessed the pendulum swing away from the oversized hoodies and chunky dad sneakers that have proliferated the menswear catwalks in recent seasons, to a vibrant display of masculinity that draws on the charm of boyhood.\nFashion is a sign of the times, too. And with gender issues the topic of hot debate, the industry is re-examining what it means to dress like a man (or woman) today. For spring/summer 2020, designers proposed many ideas to rewrite the codes of masculinity. Whether delicate pastels or princely tunics, these are the key trends and takeaways from the men’s spring/summer 2020 shows you must know.\nLIGHT YEARS\nEver the visionary designer whose collections somehow manage to capture the essence of every season, Miuccia Prada kicked things off by staging a special men’s show in Shanghai. Inside the vast halls of Minsheng Wharf, the influential designer showed plenty of pastel hues on crisp shirting and oversized polo tees. Call it coincidence if you will, but the soothing colour palette soon turned up throughout the rest of the collections. From Berluti to Kenzo, Paul Smith to Salvatore Ferragamo, the shades lent a tenderness to the clothes. But make no mistake – when worn head-to-toe, pastels still pack a punch.\nSOFT FOCUS\nAccompanying the season’s spectrum of Paddlepop hues is tailoring, now making a comeback in more ways than one. Designers such as Ermenegildo Zegna’s Alessandro Sartori and Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh loosened things up a little by rolling out suits that boast a roomier fit. Kim Jones, who has explored using couture techniques to craft his collections over at Dior’s men’s side of the business, attached a satin sash to his reinterpretation, instantaneously adding an air elegance to the menswear classic.\n\n\nLONG AND SHORT OF IT\nLike the humble sandal, the tunic has been associated with some of the world’s oldest civilisations. In ancient Rome, the long garment was worn by both men and women. It’s a unisex piece of clothing with a time-honoured appeal, which explains why some designers have based their gender conversation around the elongated top for the new season. To blur gender lines even further, designers stretched the tunic to new lengths (those at Loewe and Lanvin ended mid-calf), along the way extending the appeal of this shirt-dress hybrid.\nBOLD AND BEAUTIFUL\nFollowing the footsteps of boundary-pushing dandies such as David Bowie, Prince and Mick Jagger before him, the modern daredevil will take to spring/summer 2020’s turnout of bold patterns and prints with equal parts finesse and ease. From wild animal prints to romantic florals, psychedelic tie-dyes to bright graphics, no combination’s too outre for this debonair who breaks every single rule to thrilling effect.\nGOOD HARVEST\nFarm-to-table? More like farm-to-closet! Led by Silvia Venturini Fendi, whose own showing for Fendi in Milan’s Villa Reale played up the gardening theme to great results, designers and their fertile imagination gave utilitarian garments a green slant. A fine crop of cargo pants, jumpsuits, handy vests and bucket hats flourished under their care. During such troubled times when conservation efforts have become more crucial than ever before, designers seem to be saying: Why flex muscles when you can work your green fingers instead?\n', 'related_topics': ['     Men ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Being a menswear retailer is no bed of roses, says entrepreneur Jonathan Chiang
  </h1>, 'text': 'Blame it on the preponderance of street style blogs, Pinterest and Instagram, but any impressionable, sartorially-inclined lad would imagine the universe of menswear retail to be an impossibly glamorous.\nThere’s a certain measure of truth to that perception, of course: Networking with the who’s who of men’s fashion at international trade shows like Pitti Uomo. Uncovering new cult labels and learning about craftsmanship and how it’s evolving with the times. Being photographed in Milan or Florence by lensmen commissioned by menswear bibles.\nIt’s a universe that Jonathan Chiang, founder and owner of L.C Via., is well-acquainted with. In January this year, he was photographed by British GQ in a street style shot. His menswear showroom in Nassim Hill – which is by-appointment only – retails clothing and accessories from 14 artisanal brands from Europe (mainly Italy), Hong Kong and Japan.\n\n\nChiang is their exclusive distributor – “distributor” being a term that would suggest a volume business. In reality, he functions much like the curator of an art gallery, representing solo artists and their works. Indeed, given the amount of time it takes for a suit to be produced – 10 months, for bespoke tailor Sartoria Yuki Inoue, who’s a one-man show – he might as well be a gallerist.\nBut three years into the business, Chiang, 34, admits that it’s still a struggle to convince customers to pay top dollar for well-made, but not as well-known, brands. “I still see glassy eyes when I share stories [of craftsmanship]. And these are clients who have tried everybody, locally and internationally,” he said, referring to their patronage of big name designer labels.\nChiang started L.C Via. with a partner, Nathan Luisvia, who left because his family relocated. “Being a small business owner, it’s difficult to steer people to see beyond the price point, even if they are well-travelled and well-exposed. The majority still feel that if they pay ‘X’ amount of money, they should be able to show off the value.\n“If they bought Gucci, and spent S$1,000 or S$2,000, it shows that they’ve got some dough to spend. If they spent S$5,000 on a plain blue suit, any Tom, Dick or Harry would not be able to tell the difference, so they’re not able to show off their status.\n“My clients know that my tie-maker is one of the best in the industry, but they aren’t willing to pay the price. But the minute it goes on a slight discount, they go for the kill,” said Chiang, adding that only a few brands go on sale, and even then, the items are a few seasons old.\nHis handmade ties come from Florentine tie-maker Sevenfold, one of the top names in the industry. They range in price from S$300 to S$330. In the whitewashed, 200 sqm pre-war apartment that functions as his showroom, they are draped casually over coat racks, artworks and a lamp mounted on a full-length mirror.\nCustom-built racks showcase fitting shirts from Borriello Napoli, a second-generation shirtmaker from Naples. These go for S$350 and up, depending on the choice of fabrics. Handmade, hand-finished Sartoria Yuki Inoue suits by the eponymous, Milan-based Japanese tailor are priced from S$5,000 onwards; made-to-measure Igarashi Trousers start from S$680, while bespoke is “double that”.\n“[Singaporeans],” Chiang concluded, “Are driven by status, from our schools and where we stay to our jobs and the cars we drive. All these condition us to want to show off where we are in society.”\nSARTORIAL SHIFT\nChiang’s entry into the menswear universe wasn’t by coincidence. In 2014, he established Leong T, to provide a contemporary front to the tailoring business that his granduncle Chow Leong Choy, owned. At that time, Chow’s shop, Leong Tailors, had been around for over four decades, but suffered from dwindling traffic and increasing overheads.\nIt wasn’t a path he chose initially – trained in media and finance, he spent five years in the manufacturing sector in Shanghai, working with big-league clients the likes of Apple, Blackberry, Motorola, Nike and P&G. But pride and passion brought him back to Singapore in 2013. For one, he didn’t want the family business to go bust; for another, his love of “beautiful things” made the tailoring trade a natural fit.\nImpeccably dressed in a Sartoria Yuki Inoue double-breasted suit, Borriello Napoli shirt, Sevenfold tie and Norman Vilalta tasselled loafers for our interview, Chiang shared that the seeds of L.C Via. were sown very early on. “I was [a year-and-a-half] into Leong T when I started buying my first brands,” he said, meaning accessories like lapel pins, shoes and sunglasses. “Leong T started to wind down when Chow [who was in his 80s] passed away in 2016 and my uncles were all retiring.\n\n\n“But truth be told, their style and construction did not change. They couldn’t understand the Italian silhouette, or softer construction,” he added, explaining that Choy and his team were more accustomed to the more formal rigours of British tailoring. “I can’t teach old dogs new tricks, because I’m not a maker myself. That’s how I went looking for people who were making it.”\nChiang’s ardour for menswear and craftsmanship knows no bounds. He shares that enthusiasm with his customers every chance he gets, but he admits that it doesn’t rub off easily. “As much as I try to share, the conversion is tough. But I guess no one said that doing this would be a bed of roses, right?”\nIs his business profitable, then?\n“Barely. I get by. It pays the bills and allows me to restock to buy new things. Sometimes I’d have to empty my bank account to buy whatever stock I need. I don’t take a salary – the money that I would have used to pay myself is used to buy stock. For me, a salary is three meals a day. For my artisans, it’s a livelihood to support their families.”\nHis wife of two years, Low Ming Li, who works in accounting, provides emotional support. “When days are bad, she’s there.” His family – his dad is a retired architect; his mum is in wealth management – don’t provide financial support, except the occasional “pocket money” to cover his travel expenses. His siblings – his sister works in art therapy while his brother works in a ride-sharing company – might chip in to sponsor a plane ticket or meals overseas.\n“My parents did hint that maybe I should give myself a timeline. But they’ve never bluntly said that I should stop this ‘stupid’ dream of mine. That would break my heart.\n“Of course my parents wanted me to have a ‘safe’ job. And I did give it a shot – in Shanghai. For five years.” His savings from that time were pumped in to start Leong T. Now, he feels like he’s beyond the point of asking for a lifeline. “At this age, I wouldn’t want to ask them for help. I’d rather take a loan, secretly.”\nHe remains hopeful that an investor would swoop in to fund his enterprise.\n“I have clients who’ve asked me if I’d close down. I told them I can’t, because these are people who have entrusted me, and no matter how tough things are here, I can’t let them down.”\nWIDENING THE NET\nTo cast the net beyond Singapore, Chiang holds regular trunk shows in Bangkok, Jakarta and Shanghai. He travels to those markets roughly every quarter, and has about 60 regulars/VIPs who support him across the four cities. “These guys come to almost every trunk show.”\nFor Chiang, their support has been “encouraging”, but nevertheless the venture has been an uphill battle. “I’m entering markets that are totally new to this, [markets that are] still very immersed in their brands. For me, a nobody, to come into their country and share about a suit that costs ‘X’ amount without a brand or a logo, people might think I’m selling snake oil!”\nIn each city, the response is different. “In Shanghai, people do buy, but they don’t understand what they’re buying. That’s good for business, but bad because I want them to know what they’re getting, and take pride in it.\n“In Bangkok, people love to [learn about craftsmanship]. That’s probably because there’s a local industry of designers and makers, so they enjoy and understand the stories. But [regarding] the price points, they’re not ready yet.\n“Jakarta is [very different]. You get people who love all aspects of [menswear]: The stories, the quality. Price is not an issue; they don’t just get one item at a time, they get a dozen. Shirts, suits, trousers, ties, shoes. I stop them, because if they get too many at once, they don’t get to enjoy each piece. The market there is such that almost no such shops exist; the only tailors are those that work with batik. People who wear suits do so for weddings or [business] meetings.”\nIf things go well, Chiang is hoping to expand into Myanmar and India in the future.\n\n\nIn the meantime, the ACS alumnus – along with co-founders and fellow ACS alumni Jason Ho and Bryan Zhao – has set up a network of business owners, ACS Business Owners Network (ABON), for mutual support and to spread awareness of each others’ enterprises.\nElsewhere, Chiang also focused on coordinating a two-day symposium with his artisans that will be open to the public. It’s likely to be held in August or September at the Straits Clan, where he’s a member.\n“After Hong Kong, Singapore ranks second in terms of the number of international trunk shows. But I realised that with every shop, their artisans are only able to meet their own clientele. I’ve seen a lot of younger chaps who love classic menswear, who are learning about classic menswear. Thanks to social media. If I were a young chap who wanted to meet this artisan, I might not be able to afford [his wares]. How then?”\nThe symposium, then, is Chiang’s way of giving back to this community of menswear enthusiasts. And, crucially, it will be a means of clearing up misconceptions about his business, and the industry at large.\n“Locally, there’s a misconception that if I charge S$5,000 for a suit, I’m making a S$4,999 profit. If that were the case, everyone would be opening a shop because the profit margins are so high. But that’s not the case. So I want people to hear why certain products are priced the way they are. And when you hear the stories of the making process, the sacrifices made, the hours they work, their increasing cost prices, the taxes they have to pay etc.\n“[For example], Yuki Inoue works from 5am to 10pm, Monday to Sunday, stitch by stitch, chalk by chalk, drawing lines, ironing, washing etc. He’s a one-man show. It’s crazy. But he takes pride. He could shortchange you, give [the suit] to a factory, get it done three-quarters of the way, stitch a few buttonholes and say, ‘yeah, it’s done by me’. Who can tell the difference? But no. Then again, who knows what he does? That’s what the symposium is for.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     Profiles ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      Buy less, save money: Practical ways to make your clothes last longer
  </h1>, 'text': 'We may be living in the age of disposable fashion, but no one wants a closet full of clothes that do not last beyond one season. Trends and quality aren’t the only factors that determine how long you hold onto a garment – the level of care you give them is also important, especially when it comes to pieces that you’d want to wear forever, if possible.\nHand-wash your delicates, use laundry bags and tackle stains as soon as they occur – these are the basics of garment maintenance. But there’s a lot more you can do to help your fashion purchases go the distance – follow these tips and learn how to wash and store your best clothes like an expert.\nREAD THE CARE LABEL\n\n\nA post shared by Richie Madden (@richieboo) on Mar 26, 2019 at 12:37pm PDT\nIt’s worth taking a minute to study the washing instructions, especially if you don’t want to risk damaging an expensive garment by washing it the wrong way. Doing that might also save you some money – for example, some silk or cashmere items can actually be hand-washed and do not necessarily need to be dry-cleaned. Such garments are usually marked “dry clean” instead of “dry clean only”.\nDRY-CLEAN ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY\nDry-cleaning is done with chemical solvents, which may shorten the lifespan of certain fabrics when used too often. You can’t not clean clothes when they get dirty – so what can you do about it? Try to wear your dry-clean-only clothes on an even rotation and, as far as possible, wear them a second time (or more, for jackets) before you send them to the dry cleaners.\nTAKE OFF THE PLASTIC\nAlways remove the plastic cover from your dry-cleaned garments and air them for a bit before keeping them in your closet, sans the covers. This releases the residual dry-cleaning chemicals trapped underneath the plastic, which can damage the fibres of fabric.\nPlastic vacuum bags and boxes are also not a good choice for storing winter clothes, despite what most people think. Natural fibres, such as wool, need to breathe – store your sweaters and down jackets in cotton dust bags or canvas boxes instead, if you want your outerwear to last.\xa0To ensure that humidity is kept to a minimum, put charcoal packs inside to the bags or boxes.\n\n\nTURN CLOTHES INSIDE OUT\nProtect items that have a transfer or embellishments on them by turning them inside out before putting them into the washing machine. The same should also be done for jeans with dark washes – this will prevent the dye from fading prematurely.\nDO UP ALL THE FASTENINGS\nMake this a habit before loading your washing machine with laundry – button up all your shirts and zip up pants and skirts, so that they won’t snag the other items in there. Doing so will also prevent them from stretching out during spin cycles.\nPUT A SPIN ON IT\nSweaters tend to shrink if you tumble-dry them in the washing machine, but leaving them out to dry could take days, sometimes. Here’s an ingenious way to get a sweater to dry faster without destroying it – throw it into a salad spinner and get to work on it. You’ll find that the whizzing motion will already remove most of the moisture.\n\n\nUSE THE RIGHT HANGERS\nHangers come in many shapes, sizes and materials – using the right ones will preserve the shape of your clothes. The\xa0best you can go for are velvet hangers with rounded corners – these provide grip so that garments won’t slip off and won’t cause unsightly “shoulder bumps” to form on clothes.\nSome other types of hangers you may require in fewer numbers: Thick, wooden hangers that are good for retaining the form of structured garments such as coats, jackets and blazers; and clamp hangers for pants and skirts, which won’t leave pinch marks on your clothes like clip hangers typically will.\nSHAVE, IF NEEDED\nSome fabrics are especially prone to pilling, which can make a garment look like it has seen better days even though you’ve worn it just a couple of times. There’s not much that can be done to prevent pilling, but there definitely are ways to deal with it.\nYou can easily remove the balls of fibre with a fabric shaver, or if you can’t get your hands on one, simply use a disposable razor (but not those with a lubricating gel strip). Cashmere sweaters, however, should be handled more carefully and always de-pilled with a cashmere comb.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Why billionaire Bernard Arnault, the world’s third-richest man, likes being number one
  </h1>, 'text': 'They say in Paris that all roads lead to Arnault. That’s Bernard Arnault, whose ruthless approach to acquisitions has earned him the nickname “the wolf in cashmere” and helped him recently to overtake Warren Buffett as the world’s third-richest man. His empire permeates Paris. Just the other day his luxury group LVMH launched a new maison with pop star Rihanna; when a fire devastated Notre-Dame, the Arnault family was on hand with a €200m (S$307m) donation to fund its reconstruction.\n\n\nBut the man himself is deeply private. Our lunch is almost 18 months in the making. Not one to waste any time – I’m told Arnault’s usual business lunches in LVMH’s private dining room often last only half an hour – he picks as our venue Le Frank, the restaurant at his own Fondation Louis Vuitton. A Frank Gehry-designed cultural centre in the west of Paris, it reflects the Medici-like influence the Arnault family has steadily acquired.\nI’m waiting for its patriarch at a discreet table, gazing out over the water that surrounds the building, which is reminiscent of a sailboat opening up in the wind. Arnault glides into the restaurant, largely unnoticed by its other patrons. He stoops slightly when he walks, speaks softly, and has a piercing blue gaze. Expansive when it suits, he can shut down an avenue of conversation with a terse sentence.\nArnault looks trim in his trademark Christian Dior suit; his physique is honed on the tennis court, where he has even played a set with Roger Federer. “Obviously I lost 6-0,” he said, “but I won a point.” This year, he added, “my goal . . . is to gain two points against Roger Federer.”\nAge has clearly not mellowed his desire to win. The 70-year-old has a compulsion to possess beautiful brands and transform their creativity into profits. He has over the past four decades built LVMH from a near-bankrupt French textile company to a global group with €46.8bn sales in 2018, whose 70 brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, Veuve Clicquot and Dom Perignon. Bloomberg estimates his fortune at US$100.4bn (S$135.9bn).\n“I always liked being number one,” Arnault said simply. “I did not succeed at the piano, I did not succeed at tennis. I consider that success is to arrive at a point where all my teams, the group is the number one in the world.” He added, without irony: “We are still small. We’re just getting started. This is very fun. We are number one, but we can go further.”\n“I always liked being number one. I consider that success is to arrive at a point where all my teams, the group is the number one in the world.” – Bernard Arnault\nLe Frank’s menu is classic French cuisine inspired by the Mediterranean. “Everything is good here,” said Arnault (it’s his restaurant, after all). On his recommendation I order the petits pois veloute, followed by salmon tartare. He opts for the salmon tartare and then sea bass on crushed potatoes. He orders two glasses of Chablis. When they arrive, minutes later, Arnault toasts our health and takes a sip; his glass of wine remains untouched for the rest of the meal.\nLVMH may be synonymous with glamour, but Arnault’s own background is in real estate. Born in Roubaix, an industrial city in the north of France, after completing the Ecole Polytechnique, one of France’s prestigious grandes ecoles, in 1971 he joined the family construction business. It was around then that he visited the US for the first time and spotted the power a luxury brand could have. He asked a New York taxi driver what he knew of France. “He could not name the president but he knew Dior,” Arnault often recounts.\nThe story stuck in his mind. Years later, in 1984, he lobbied the French government to let him take control of a near-bankrupt textile company, Boussac. It owned a jewel that he wanted: Christian Dior. Arnault bought Boussac for a symbolic one franc, having assured the government that jobs would be preserved. Within five years he had sold off most of its assets, keeping Dior. The government looked on, powerless, as he fired around 8,000 workers, bringing a new Anglo-Saxon ruthlessness to the genteel world of 1980s French business.\nA lunchtime rush of people has arrived, seeking sustenance after a morning of exhibitions, and taking their seats beneath Frank Gehry’s fish-lamp sculptures that hang from the ceiling. Arnault settles back and recalls his first advance into the luxury world. His mother had a “fascination for Dior” and wore its Diorissimo scent, he said. Her son would use the brand as the cornerstone of his global luxury group.\n“I told my team we will build the first luxury group in the world,” he said. “Obviously it was very ambitious, but it galvanised the team and we started to build.” His vision was to create a structure where individual brands enjoyed creative freedom while having the financial backing and synergies of a big group behind them. “The biggest advantage is that it allows you to hire the best people,” he added.\nIt was Arnault’s takeover of LVMH in 1989 that confirmed his course. He engineered a majority stake in the group – itself the product of a merger between fashion house Louis Vuitton and champagne and cognac producer Moet Hennessy – and then ousted the Louis Vuitton president Henry Racamier from his family company. Arnault would deploy the same playbook of ousting founders, dividing families or driving a wedge between business partners with other acquisitions such as Givenchy, Chateau d’Yquem and Duty Free Shoppers. Only rarely has this strategy failed, most notably at luxury brands Gucci and Hermes (although Arnault still made hundreds of millions of euros from each attempt). The Dumas family, owners of Hermes, successfully went to court to prevent LVMH from mounting a takeover. I suggest to Arnault that some would call him a predator.\n“I do not know,” he said, nonchalantly. (He’s clearly well aware of his reputation.) “You do not expect them to say nice things if they are competitors.”\nFor a man who thought nothing of splashing €3.7bn on high-end jeweller Bulgari or US$3.2bn on travel and hospitality group Belmond, there was one “luxury” acquisition that was a stretch too far: The Financial Times. Arnault admits he looked at buying the FT back in 2015 (in the end it was sold by Pearson to Nikkei for £844m; S$1.45bn). He decided against making an offer, he said, because it was “too expensive”.\nAnd if you had bought the FT it would have been complicated for us to write about you, I respond. “We could not do this lunch,” said Arnault, laughing. “That would have not worked.”\nMy pea veloute is fresh and light. Over the starters, conversation turns to the future of the €260bn luxury goods industry. Arnault led the charge to consolidate the market from a fragmented cottage industry into a slick corporate machine. Critics say that this has led to a democratisation of luxury which has enriched the tycoons behind the multi-brand conglomerates while killing off true craftsmanship. Profits come not from haute couture but from perfume, make-up and accessories lines that allow ordinary people to buy into the dream for as little as US$20 a lipstick.\n“What you call true luxury is a relative concept for each individual,” said Arnault. He believes that LVMH’s role is to “produce products and experiences that convey an authentic sense of value to our customers.’’ This idea of experiential luxury is what LVMH wants to develop with its recent acquisition of Belmond, which owns the Hotel Cipriani in Venice and the Orient Express.\nBut even the king of luxury seems a little tired of it. “The word luxury is a little hackneyed,” he went on. “I prefer the expression ‘product of high quality’. What matters most is that in 10 years’ time our brands are as desirable as they are today. Profit is a consequence of what we do well; it should never become a goal.”\n“The word luxury is a little hackneyed. I prefer ‘product of high quality’. What matters most is that in 10 years’ time our brands are as desirable as today.” – Bernard Arnault\nThe key to LVMH’s success has been its “first mover” advantage, notably in China, where Arnault is given a head of state’s welcome when he visits, spirited through the traffic in a motorcade. In 1992, as China was starting to open up under Deng Xiaoping’s market-economy reforms, Louis Vuitton opened a store in Beijing, its first in mainland China, in the basement of the Palace Hotel (now the Peninsula Beijing). There was no hot water in the hotel and bicycles on the roads, rather than cars, Arnault recalls, as our starters are whisked away. But he took the view that “it’s good to start.” He added: “We are the first, but eventually there will be a market.”\nThe bet paid off. Since then, China has driven luxury spending, with LVMH one of the main beneficiaries. Arnault strikes a conciliatory note on the recent Sino-American trade tensions. Despite “problems in the short term”, he believes China and the US “will eventually find an agreement.” Chinese consumers are showing no signs of slowing down and are repatriating spending to the mainland, he says. In the longer term, Arnault said he’s “optimistic” that the same trends that explain the success of the past 30 years, such as emerging economies and rising living standards, will continue to bring opportunities for luxury goods brands, and open up new markets such as Africa.\nBack home in Paris, where LVMH stores dominate the glitzy streets in the city centre, the group has faced the ire of the anti-government gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement. At their peak this winter, the weekly protests forced many LVMH brands to close their shop fronts.\nAs we begin our main courses, Arnault expounds on the gilets jaunes. It’s true there are inequalities in France, he said, but if you compare it with other European countries, “France is very well placed, because [it] redistributes a lot.”\n“France is the country that is the champion of taxes,” he continued. But many of the complaints from the gilets jaunes are “totally contradictory” because they say “we pay too much tax, but we must increase state spending”.\nIs Emmanuel Macron’s presidency the last chance to reform France before a possible election of Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National? Arnault does not believe populists can come to power because he says the majority still reject them and “their theories are an economic disaster”. Unsurprisingly he welcomes the atmosphere fostered by Macron, that “the wealth of a country is made by the success of its companies” – not by state-backed jobs or public spending.\nHow hard was it to build the world’s third-largest fortune in a country where wealth isn’t always celebrated? Arnault bats the question aside.\n“What is my wealth?” he asked. “It is the LVMH shares . . . the result of what we built with the LVMH group.” He reeled off figures: Under his tenure the group has grown from around 12,000 to 156,000 people, hiring between 12,000 and 15,000 people each year. “And we are the group that pays the most taxes in France.”\n“What is my wealth? It is the LVMH shares . . . the result of what we built with the LVMH group.” – Bernard Arnault\nArnault moved to the US for a few years in the early 1980s to avoid a hostile business environment and wealth tax under Francois Mitterrand. I remind him that in 2012, under socialist president Francois Hollande, he applied – unsuccessfully – for Belgian nationality. He says somewhat unconvincingly the move was intended to help him establish a private foundation to prevent his five children from selling LVMH shares if he were to die.\n“I was never resident in Belgium,” he said. “I always paid my taxes in France.”\nThe time has come to broach another of Arnault’s least favourite topics: Succession. LVMH’s top management say it’s a “taboo” subject internally, despite the fact that almost all of Arnault’s children are in the family business. Of the two children from his first marriage, Delphine, 44, is executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s profit engine, while Antoine, 42, runs menswear brand Berluti and is LVMH’s head of communications. Of the three sons from Arnault’s second marriage to concert pianist Helene Mercier, only the youngest, Jean, 21, is yet to take up an official role at LVMH.\nThe other two are starting to make their mark. Alexandre, 27, is chief executive of Rimowa, the German luxury suitcase maker that LVMH acquired in 2016 at his suggestion. Frederic, 24, is strategy and digital director of watch brand Tag Heuer and the only one of the five children who studied at Arnault’s alma mater. He does “extraordinary things” on the piano, Arnault senior tells me admiringly. Arnault too is a concert-level pianist and wooed Helene by playing to her on one of their early dates.\nHanding over the company to the next generation will be done “according to their will, their abilities, their skills,” said Arnault. We eschew dessert and order two espressos. Which of your children is most like you, I asked. Arnault will only say that “they all have something of me.” When pressed, he said impatiently, “it’s not for me to explain to you the personalities of my children.”\nThe maitre d’ comes to check on us. As he does with LVMH’s Paris store managers most Saturdays, Arnault quizzes him on how busy the restaurant has been. I reflect that it has been almost 20 years since Arnault’s biggest defeat: When Francois Pinault emerged victorious against him in a long-running and acrimonious battle for control of Gucci. Does the missed acquisition opportunity still grate, especially given how successful Gucci has been under the Pinault family’s ownership?\n“I hate the past,” said Arnault, deadpan. “What interests me is the future. Have a chocolate.”\nWhen the Pinault family announced in April a €100m donation to help rebuild Notre-Dame after the fire, I was not the only one in Paris who waited for Arnault to trump it. Sure enough, hours later, the Arnault family announced a €200m donation. Arnault doesn’t flinch when I point out that his rivalry with the Pinaults appears to extend even to charitable donations. Relations with Pinault are “absolutely fine,” he said.\nLunch has stretched to an hour and a half, and Arnault is looking anxious to return to work. Checking it’s really true that the FT pays for lunch, he reluctantly asks for the bill “for madame”. It’s the first time he’s had lunch with a woman and let her pay, he said, but consoles himself that “I did not choose a three [Michelin] star restaurant.”\nDays later, someone bids US$4.6m for a private lunch with Buffett. At a mere €169 for lunch a deux with Arnault, I think the FT’s expenses department has got off lightly.\nHarriet Agnew is the FT’s Paris correspondent\nBy Harriet Agnew © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     LVMH ', '     luxury ', '     Profiles ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Gentlemen, these are the vacation essentials you'll need this holiday season
  </h1>, 'text': ""We've said it before and we'll say it again – in the menswear universe, every detail counts. And when it comes to nailing that perfect resort look, no detail's too small to make a difference. From the tint of the lenses on your sunglasses to the length of your shorts, it pays to spare a little more thought to your sartorial choices. If you think it's a lot to think about, fret not – here’s our handy guide of what to include in your packing list. Forget the philosophical saying that the journey matters more than the destination – these must-haves will announce you've arrived in more ways than one.\n\n\nTHE POLO SHIRT\nEven though this staple has its roots in tennis (Rene Lacoste, a formidable tennis player, designed and popularised the polo tee, subsequently launching a fashion empire with it), it has made the crossover to mainstream fashion and become an indispensable classic. Think of the polo shirt as the trend-proof alternative to the Hawaiian shirt, which has seen an exponential rise in popularity in recent years. Fit is, of course, the most essential when it comes to pulling off the polo shirt. A snug version shows off the body you spent months sculpting for the beach, while an oversized number tells everyone you're gung-ho enough to try new silhouettes.\nTHE SHORTS\nItsy-bitsy floral numbers at Prada; impeccably tailored versions at Dior Men; fashion-meets-art iterations at Dries van Noten... be spoilt for choice as designers pulled out all the stops this season, transforming the school boy connotations of our favourite summer essential into something cooler and more grown-up. Stay ahead of the style curve by slipping on a pair with graphic zest.\nTHE BAG\nIt's understandable that you'll want a roomy tote bag to cart your belongings when you're out and about at the beach. But since a holiday is also about recalibrating, why not take the opportunity to downsize and go hands free with a belt bag? Make it a reflection of your state of mind – besides allowing you to travel light, it's also a good excuse to declutter and leave what you don't need behind.\nTHE ACCESSORIES\nFrom well-appointed sunglasses that lend a debonair air to beaded bracelets you can stack alongside metal cuffs, consider these little touches your outfit can't do without. For something a little more statement-inducing, bring along your own plush Hermes towel to the pool – your impeccable taste will stand out even more in a sea of run-of-the-mill white or blue towels.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     holiday ', '     Travel ', '     Men ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      How to dress better: 5 very simple style rules for the modern gentleman
  </h1>, 'text': 'You know their type – the men who look put together no matter what they wear, even if they are in a T-shirt and slacks. While a good height and build, admittedly, does give a guy an advantage when it comes to carrying off clothes with panache, it doesn’t mean that those with lesser bods can’t do the same.\n\n\nIn fact, if you were to carefully observe this breed of well-dressed men, you’d realise that some of them aren’t really as tall, slim or buff as they appear to be. But they do possess something that other men might not have – a knack for finding clothes that suit and fit them impeccably, as well as an air of confidence that comes from knowing they are always putting forward their best image.\nAre they simply born with a sense of style? That may be true in part, while the rest of the credit is actually due to these smart dressing rules, which will definitely benefit those who’d like to emulate their flair.\nGET THE FIT RIGHT\nFit is everything, particularly when it concerns men’s dress clothes. The sartorially savvy man recognises the worth of investing in a couple of made-to-measure pieces, but he also knows how to make off-the-rack clothing work – with some clever adjustments.\nA few minor alterations by a seamstress could make a world of difference. Study the cut of your most flattering bespoke suits and get the seamstress to try and recreate their fit. For example, get the waist width of the jacket right (skimming, not swimming).\nINVEST IN GOOD SHOES\xa0 \xa0\nIf you can splurge on just one fashion item, we’d suggest you spend that money on a good pair of dress shoes. Well-dressed men know where quality counts most – a smart pair of Oxfords, brogues or loafers in fine leather will offer mileage that’s worth far more than their cost.\nShoes are one of the first things on men that people notice, since the typical guy isn’t likely to wear much else in terms of accessories. They can also make or break an ensemble – choose wisely and they will upgrade your look.\n\n\nPAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS\nFinesse is expressed in the details, the finer points of dress that people see on you only when they are up-close. Not everyone will immediately notice these things about you, but when they do, the impact made can be huge.\nWhat, then, are these details that set a sophisticated man apart from the regular guys? It’s in the way they knot their tie, how they cuff their jeans and roll their sleeves, the make of their cufflinks and watch, right down to how long they leave their fingernails – never too long nor too short.\nGET\xa0THE BASICS RIGHT\nWhether you are one for making fashion statements or not, a good selection of basics should be the foundation of your wardrobe. A man doesn’t need a lot of them too – simple, detail-free items such as shirts and T-shirts in understated colours, jeans, chinos, jumpers, a denim jacket, a casual suit and a formal suit are the essential building blocks for creating an array of looks.\nDRESS FOR YOUR PERSONALITY\xa0–\xa0NOT FOR TRENDS\nWhile simplicity is the key to timeless style, there’s definitely room for the occasional print, pop of bright colour or accessories like hats, shades or trending sneakers of the season. It’s how style-savvy men imbue personality into their dressing, and what they do when the occasion calls for a look that’s a little more experimental than their usual choice of attire.\nOne thing they never do, though, is take on more fashion statements or accents than their personality can handle – because a guy will never look good if he feels self-conscious in his clothes.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Appropriating the time of our lives: The enduring appeal of 80s fashion
  </h1>, 'text': 'Shoulder pads! Blazers! High waisted jeans! T-shirts tucked in! Big white sneakers! All that’s missing is the permed hair and spandex onesies, but who’s to say they won’t be trendy in 2020?\nThe 80s – the glorious, glittering, golden era of excess, when greed was good. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\n“The 80s was the most fabulous time in fashion because people were proud of being vulgar,” declared Daniel Boey, fashion producer and author. “Shoulder pads, dayglo aerobics fashion, punk, glitter makeup.\n""What made the 80s really unique was the whole ecosystem: You had new wave bands like Duran Duran, and they became your role models. You had the start of the supermodel era: Versace made celebrities of Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford. It worked then because ‘supes’ were less accessible – people aspired to be like them. Whatever they wore, people wanted to be a part of that.”\nBoey postulates that what is happening now is a reaction to the rabid accessibility of modern-day models and stars. “This generation feels they have access to the celebrities – they just have to follow Gigi Hadid and all on Instagram,” he noted. The return to the 80s could signal a longing for a time when there was still mystery surrounding celebrities and models – it’s always more fun when one’s object of desire plays hard to get.\nThe 80s revival isn’t a single-season movement – what were “Mom jeans” in 2015 have crept, since 2017, into every teenage girl’s wardrobe. Young people are wearing T-shirts of 80s musicians, like Run DMC and\xa0Blondie, and they haven’t the slightest who these people are.\nAnd look at Olivier Rousteing’s Balmain dresses over the last five years – wouldn’t they look a dream on Linda Evans and Joan Collins if Dynasty was still running today?\n“The 80s was the most fabulous time in fashion because people were proud of being vulgar.” – Daniel Boey\nThis love affair with the 80s is really the appropriation of a whole culture. Netflix series Stranger Things, which debuted in July 2016, is set in the 80s and captures all that is adorable about the era: The music, the big hair (both boys and girls – take a bow, Steve Harrington!), the teenage movie culture of young thugs sitting on car bonnets and beating up the nerds, the arcade games and an endless number of other cultural references.\nSince Stranger Things there has been a spate of me-too 80s shows, including the groundbreaking interactive Black Mirror TV movie, Bandersnatch, set in 1980s London, offering myriad possible paths and endings to the story. The intense culture of 2D gaming was well captured and augmented by the nostalgic soundtrack resembling Now That’s What I Call Music Vol 2.\nPulling an 80s vibe in one’s fashion choices right now still looks fresh. Teen labels like Brandy Melville have successfully resurrected the 80s cropped T-shirt, while Off-White’s collab with Nike, “The Ten” has seen the return of 80s street cred must-haves, the Air Max and the Air Jordan. Even iconic 80s sneaker brand Reebok is enjoying stratospheric success with collaborations with Gigi Hadid and Demna Gvasalia’s Vetements.\nSo, the long and the short of it is: 2019 is not the year the 80s obsession ends. “Now that there’s a revival,” said Boey, “the key to wearing the old trend is not to copy it wholesale. You don’t do satin and sequins and legwarmers in one outfit. You take one element and you contemporise it.”\nTake shoulder pads – the original 80s look were stiff shoulder pads that gave women a don’t-mess-with-me look for the office. Balenciaga’s Spring 2019 giant shoulder pads, on the other hands, are softer, 3D printed extensions that create a futuristic effect.\nThe 80s shorts-with-jacket look returns, only now, in this age of luxury athleisure wear, it’s bike shorts paired with everything from parkas and jackets to blouses. Soft, billowy leopard print dresses at Roberto Cavalli Spring 2019 pay tribute to the animal prints that adorned jackets and long dresses back in the day.\nScarf prints. Clashing prints. Primary colours. Minis. Satin. It’s all come back in one way, shape or form – the elements of excess, looking fresh.\nPerhaps the most appealing vision that came from the Spring 2019 runway is that of Kaia Gerber, daughter of 80s supermodel Cindy Crawford, walking Chanel’s Spring 2019 show. The sight of her, wearing a retro Chanel chain belt against a classic black and white ensemble, evokes both a sense of deep nostalgia and an excitement for the future of fashion. Not only has 80s fashion come full circle this time, but it speaks to the hearts of women, generations apart.\xa0\nStarring: Sheila Sim. Styling by Jeremy Tan, hair by Dexter Ng, makeup by Clarence Lee using Chanel colours, photography by\xa0Two Lefthands.\n“Now that there’s a revival, the key to wearing the old trend is not to copy it wholesale.

      Virgil Abloh’s installation with Vitra is a look into the future of furniture design
  </h1>, 'text': 'Architect, DJ, engineer, university lecturer, artist, entrepreneur, and\xa0artistic director at Louis Vuitton,\xa0Virgil Abloh\xa0will soon be adding furniture designer to his list of credentials – and we’re not talking about his upcoming collaboration with Ikea, which launches in November.\nIn a collaboration with Vitra, the multi-hyphenate has curated\xa0Twentythirtyfive, an installation that focuses on the interaction between an adolescent and his home surroundings. Showing until the end of July in\xa0Zaha Hadid’s Fire Station on the Vitra Campus,\xa0Twentythirtyfive\xa0is a “residential biography of a fictitious teenager from the year 2019, accompanying him into the year 2035”.\n\n\n“It’s arguable whether we will even have a need for furniture by 2035,” Abloh suggested.\nThe first section of\xa0Twentythirtyfive, Past/Present offers an introspective look into this fictitious adolescent’s room, decorated with a seemingly arbitrary collection of furniture and objects that may strike a familiar chord – the Petite Potence lamp and Antony armchair by Jean Prouve and designs by Charles and Ray Eames, for example, are pieces that can be easily found in a modern teenager’s home, collected by their parents. These displays are viewed through a filter to evoke a dream sequence that transcends the physical space.\nThe next section, Tomorrow, is a look into the future – the year 2035, to be precise – as the protagonist enters adulthood and owns his first home. The premise is much more futuristic but still relatable, as living and working spaces converge. The Gen Z individual has come into his own distinct identity, but bridges to his past can still be spotted in the form of familiar objects that have been adopted or redesigned, such as Abloh’s recreation of the Antony armchair and Petite Potence, as well as a ceramic block.\n\n\nLike the designer’s most recent\xa0capsule collection\xa0for Louis Vuitton, the three spin-off products are\xa0outfitted in orange, and also branded with unique numbers which indicate their exclusivity – there are only 999 ceramic blocks, 300 Petite Potence lamps, and 100 Antony armchairs produced. They can be purchased on site or\xa0online\xa0in Europe.\nTwentythirtyfive is open to the public until July 31 at the Fire Station on the Vitra Campus.

      The man championing natural perfumes before it became a buzzword
  </h1>, 'text': 'When a fragrance-industry veteran pointed out that Douglas Little’s belief in a big future for natural perfumery will never be anything more than the work of heretics, he promptly trademarked the word “heretic” as the name for his new fragrance company. “The term means someone who has an opinion that’s different from those of others, and this is so appropriate not only for myself, but also for the company,” said Little.\n\n\nThat was in 2010, when Heretic Parfum began as an indie brand that produced small-batch natural fragrances – a time when such a product pretty much did not exist on the market. Now, the company has remained very much the same, eschewing commercial expansion for niche distribution channels that allowed customers to connect with the brand and its products more intimately.\nLittle, 42, is not new to the fragrance business when he started Heretic Parfum. The Los Angeles-based perfumer has had a fascination with scents since his early childhood, and even sold a line of fragrance oils – which he concocted himself – to his mother’s friends at the tender age of 12.\nAfter graduating from design school, he went on to do marketing for a large cosmetics firm, but subsequently followed his heart to Grasse in France, where he attended courses on perfumery. In 2003, he started his first fragrance company, D.L. & Co, which swiftly became a big success for its scented candles with an edgy Gothic sensibility. By 2009, he left and took a break before embarking on the next phase of his fragrance journey.\nCOMING CLEAN\nAt a pop-up fragrance atelier by Heretic Parfum in Siri House at Dempsey, where its scent collection has also recently been launched, CNA Luxury spoke to the man who had foreseen the emergence of the clean beauty movement a good decade ago.\nClean beauty has, of course, grown into a huge movement in recent years – if you haven’t noticed yet, “paraben-free”, “organic” and “all-natural” have become the new buzzwords in the industry, while awareness of toxic ingredients such as parabens and phthalates has become common knowledge for consumers.\nClean skincare and beauty products may have proliferated but natural perfumes are much less heard of and are still hard to come by. The reason for it is obvious: All fragrances contain a lot of alcohol – in fact, more than half of your perfume is alcohol and that proportion could be significantly higher depending on whether it is an eau de parfum, eau de toilette or cologne.\nAccording to Little, as much as 99.9 per cent of all fragrance companies use SD40 alcohol, which is a denatured alcohol. “Denaturing means that they add a chemical to the alcohol so that you can’t drink it – it’s poisonous. But the problem with denaturing is that the chemical used to do it is very toxic to your body,” he explained.\n“The alcohol was a huge thing for me. It didn’t make sense to put these extraordinary, quality perfume oils into a cheap synthetic alcohol. So that’s when I started to look for something else,” said Little.\nThe answer to this problem was sugarcane alcohol, which Little had to procure via an unusual chain. “It was challenging to acquire because it’s non-denatured and the government thinks I’m buying it to sell to people to drink. In the end, I had to work with a factory that makes beverages – they were already buying this alcohol to make their product,” he shared.\nInterestingly, there were other benefits to be reaped from using sugarcane alcohol in his perfumes. “It has a slightly sweet aroma to it, so what’s nice about this is that I’m starting with an aroma profile from the alcohol, then I start to build on that and create. It’s working with nature in a very unusual manner – creating fragrances that are incredibly complex and dynamic, which you can never do by going the traditional way,” he said.\nALL THINGS CONSIDERED\nIt’s not just alcohol – there are plenty of other synthetic compounds in a typical perfume. You might not be aware of their existence though, because perfume companies are not required by law to disclose everything that goes into their product. Benzene, aldehydes, synthetic musks… the list runs long and may not be included in the ingredient list printed on the perfume packaging.\nLittle illustrates why synthetic materials are generally preferred by the vast majority of the fragrance industry: “With synthetic materials, which are made out of petrol, I can create some of the most beautiful fragrances – there’s no limit. With naturals, there are limits. For example, it’s very hard to achieve that beautiful, velvety white musk. Unfortunately, synthetic versions of musk are very dangerous – they are some of the most dangerous materials to work with. The natural version of musks don’t quite have the same softness – they don’t have the same allure; they have a natural edge to them.”\n“When you put on perfume, you tend to place it on your pulse points where your lymph nodes are located – it’s something that most people forget about. You must know that synthetic fragrances are not only in perfume but also hand soap, body lotion, detergents, room fragrances and such. Of course, if you only put on perfume once a day, it might not be such a big problem, but if you take into consideration these other things, it’s really not good for our health,” he added.\nKeen to try out a Heretic Parfum scent? Here’s what you should know about how they differ from mass-produced synthetic perfumes. First of all, they are made in small batches – they are a little like wines in that each batch is unique from harvest to harvest, which makes them very unusual and individual.\nSecondly, their aromatic profiles have a little edge to them. Little uses the word “dirty” to describe his contemporary scents – they smell a little wild in comparison to other fragrances. If you’re a fan of complex scents and are tired of mass-market perfumes that can be found on every other person on the street, you’ll surely find something to love from Douglas Little’s collection of heretical perfumes.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Profiles ', '     fashion ']}"

The celebration explored his personal passions like tango, literature and music, and highlighted anecdotes from those who knew him well.\nLagerfeld created iconoclastic, spectacle-driven fashion. In this Lagerfeldian world, to be boring was a cardinal sin.\nHe also brought Chanel back from death\'s door, reinvigorating the wilting couture house with the modern moxie that has since kept Chanel a lucrative and industry-defining fashion house, a job that required constant reinvention.\n""It\'s up to us to adjust to our times,"" Lagerfeld said in one video.

      Ready for a dip? Here are the hottest swimsuits to flaunt your beach bod
  </h1>, 'text': ""With sustainability and mindful consumerism a hot topic in fashion these days, it's more important than ever before to make every purchase or sartorial decision count. As we head into the warmer months, why not put words into action... beginning with your choice of swimwear? No gesture's too small – besides investing in swimsuits made from recycled materials, you can extend the longevity of your favourite swimsuit through novel ways to wear them. And thankfully, brands are coming up with a host of designs that function swimmingly well as everyday-wear options, too. The transition from pool to pavement has become much more seamless, so what are you waiting for? Dive right in.\n\n\nDOUBLE IMPACT\nIn the summer of 1960, an American singer named Bryan Hyland released a catchy ditty about a shy girl who wore an “itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini” to the beach. Since then, women have stepped out in all sorts of designs that proudly declare their confidence in being in their own skin. To take things up a notch this summer, why not follow the lead of Joseph Altuzarra? The American designer matched floral bikinis with cropped cardigans and skirts with high slits at his namesake brand, along the way giving the beachwear classic a high-fashion touch.\n\n\nSOLO ADVENTURE\nThe versatility of the humble one-piece swimsuit means it's no longer just limited to the confines of the pool – you can even take it out for a spin as a practical daywear option. Whether you pair it with comfortable culottes or wear it underneath a well-appointed suit, it has become a great layering option with infinite potential. Our tip? Add focus by sticking to a solid colour for the swimsuit and work the rest of your ensemble around it.\n\n\nTRACK RECORD\nIf it's good enough for an Olympian, then it's certainly good enough for you. Get competitive when you transform the appeal of sporty swimsuits with accoutrements every #hypebae would approve of. Think: Streetwear pieces imbued with an urban attitude. From statement eyewear to ultra cool track pants, they're guaranteed to give you a solid head start over the rest of your competitors.\nHEY PUSSYCAT\nThere's a reason why the leopard print will always occupy a special spot (sorry) in fashion – enigmatic, primal and sexy, it conveys a powerful message of sensuality that transcends the fickleness of time. Load up on this weapon of seduction by way of a swimsuit covered in the print and further embellish its wild factor with chunky bangles and decadent touches of gold. Throw on a billowing caftan for that extra dash of extravagance.\nGLOW UP\nThe 60s was a pivotal decade in fashion and its influence continues to reverberate throughout the catwalks today. After all, it was the era that gave us Twiggy, mini skirts and iconic art works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. Why not pay homage with your swimsuit choice? Play up the eclecticism of the 60s with bright candy hues, or go bold with glossy acrylic accents.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     women ', '     fashion ', '     style ', '     holiday ']}"

Cotton and lightly knitted jerseys are great alternatives.\nDon’t mistake lightness\xa0for breathability.\nBut don’t mistake lightness\xa0for breathability though – lightweight materials like polyester and nylon can actually trap heat.

What’s more, it doesn’t react well to moisture and crinkles easily at the slightest contact with sweat, showing up in obvious patches.\nSportswear made of performance fabrics that wick sweat are helpful on casual days, while other high-tech materials, such as Uniqlo’s AIRism, make good inner wear if you need to layer under work wear – the AIRism fabric is thin, light, breathable, helps release trapped moisture and is also anti-odour and anti-bacterial.\nWHITE IS COOLER\nHere’s a useful bit of science: Black “attracts” more heat than other colours because it absorbs all wavelengths of light and converts them into heat, while white does the opposite and reflects all wavelengths of light.\xa0\nWhite will keep you cool more so than any other hue in the colour spectrum.\nNo prizes, then, for guessing which colour you should wear during these hot months – white will keep you cool more so than any other hue in the colour spectrum, especially on days when you’d be spending more time out in the sun.\nColourful dressers will be glad to know that light and bright colours reflect light wavelengths the way white does, albeit in lesser degrees, depending on the shade concerned. Generally, the darker the colour, the more heat it will tend to create.\n\n\nSWEAT STAIN ALERT\nSweat marks on clothes are never a good look. No matter how much anti-perspirant you use, sometimes, breaking into a sweat is inevitable – but you can certainly alleviate the issue by picking clothes in the right hues. \xa0\nBeige and grey, however, are to be avoided as far as possible, as these two colours display sweat marks like black paint on a white canvas.\nWhite and black are your best options if sweat marks are your main peeve, as opposed to heat (see pointer above). When it comes to other colours between these two extremities though, the mid-range hues tend to be troublesome as moisture tends to show up clearly on them. The solution? Try to pick the lightest or darkest shades of the colour of your preference.\nBeige and grey, however, are to be avoided as far as possible, as these two colours display sweat marks like black paint on a white canvas – save these for the cooler months near the end of the year.\nAlternatively, you can try using underarm sweat shields, which are disposable pads that stick to your skin or your clothes and absorb sweat so that it doesn’t leave embarrassing marks on the fabric.\nLESS COVERAGE\nTanks and shorts may be summer-appropriate but unfortunately aren’t acceptable in most workplaces or, for that matter, many other public environments or social situations.\nLayers can work well even in hot weather.\nUnless you’re heading out to Bali or going biking or picnicking during the weekend, you really can’t use the heat as an excuse to put that much skin on display. If you must wear them, build a balanced look by pairing them with separates that offer more coverage so that you won’t look like you’re permanently on a beach vacay.\nLayers can work well even in hot weather. A light jacket will come in useful when entering spaces with sub-zero air-conditioning and can be whipped off easily when you’re heading back out into the heat.\nThe fit of your clothes is crucial when it comes to comfort in soaring temperatures. A looser fit, particularly around the shoulders, underarms and torso, allows better ventilation and won’t trap sweat against your skin and cause irritation. More importantly, better airflow underneath your clothes will prevent odours from building.\nGo for open and wide necklines as far as possible – keeping your collarbone and the back of the neck exposed will help bring down your body temperature. Sleeveless styles are excellent but make sure the armholes are wide enough to offer ventilation.\nGo for open\xa0and wide necklines as far as possible – keeping your collarbone and the back of the neck exposed will help bring down your body temperature.\nSkin-tight jeans are nearly impossible to wear this time of year – we applaud you if you can even put them on in our highly humid conditions. For men who are used to wearing their work shirts quite fitted, going a size up is a good idea. Doing that will also help keep sweat marks at bay.\nALL IN THE FEET\nYour feet have a big impact on your body temperature and is where your body offloads heat when required to. This could explain why you're feeling hot even if you're already keeping it light in terms of clothing – your shoes could be preventing the heat regulation from happening.\nYour shoes could be preventing the heat regulation from happening.\nSandals and lightweight, breathable shoes are naturally your best choices of footwear when it's hot out. Women have it easier when it comes to professional-looking shoes for work – swap out your pumps for peep-toed shoes or strappy heels. Men who work in a corporate environment might not have much choice in this area, but can opt for socks that are thinner and made out of cotton.\n\n\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The luxury customer is getting younger, so this bag maker is changing his DNA
  </h1>, 'text': 'When handbag designer Ethan Koh visited the immersive multimedia exhibition Future World at Marina Bay Sands’ ArtScience Museum, he knew it would be the ideal venue for the global launch of his much anticipated new collection, Mystical Landscapes.\nBut there was a catch: The museum does not typically host events within this gallery.\n\n\nFeaturing over 20 new bag designs inspired by the breathtaking surroundings he has experienced on his myriad travels, the 32-year-old designer felt the fantasy digital projections of nature within the space of the entire gallery would create the perfect dreamscape to complement this collection.\xa0\nNot one to let a little hiccup get in the way of fulfilling his creative vision, Koh engaged event planner extraordinaire Olga Iserlis to smooth the way. Needless to say, Koh got his dream venue and the Ethan K night at the museum played host to the toast of society.\nKoh’s bags are stocked in some of the world’s best stores, including Harrods in London, L’Eclaireur in Paris, Tsum in Moscow and Singapore’s own Malmaison by Hourglass. One of the reasons this collection has been hotly anticipated is that it has been 18 months in the making – an unusually long time for a designer in today’s fast fashion world.\nBut the Singapore-born, London-based designer is not one to rush his process.\n""The terms ‘luxury’ and ‘bespoke’ are overused – I wouldn’t call my brand that anymore.""\n“Ethan K is different from other luxury brands. I come up with collections only when I am ready,” he said, dressed in a forest green brushed linen jacket and croc shoes of his own design at his launch party.\xa0\n“The terms ‘luxury’ and ‘bespoke’ are overused – I wouldn’t call my brand that anymore. Instead, Ethan K is about joie de vivre and the creation of fantasy experiences,” said the Central St Martins trained Koh.\nWhile he may chafe at being called a luxury designer, his signature handbags, made with crocodile skin, certainly embody all the elements of this term. Like a couturier, Koh personally consults with his clients to incorporate individual touches to their orders. He even creates one-of-a-kind designs for those with specific requests such as dog carriers and oversized bags.\xa0\nWhile he remains tight lipped about who these clients are specifically, his designs have been spotted on celebrities like Carina Lau and Hailey Bieber, as well as royalty like Sarah, Duchess of York, and her daughters, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\n\nThis may sound emblematic of old school elegance, but Koh certainly is not one to shy away from modern trends. In fact, he is happily leaning into the more relaxed and casual aesthetic that millennials have embraced. British socialite Hum Fleming was photographed carrying one of his designs while wearing a casual denim get-up.\n“There is a change in the air – a new spirit of fashion. The luxury customer is getting younger,” he said.\nKoh designed Mystical Landscapes with this young clientele in mind, to stand apart from his other collections which typically feature classic silhouettes like minaudieres or totes. Here, he mixes materials such as crocodile with calfskin (and rattan, in one case) for a trendier look, and creates contemporary shapes such as a cuboid wristlet and bucket bags.\n“Over the years, our DNA has been changing. We are not just an exotic skin brand but a more design-focused brand,” said Koh. “Millennials want statement bags to complete their looks.”\nWhile it is likely that exotic skins will always be a hallmark of an Ethan K bag – his family runs Heng Long Leather, an exotic leather tannery that was acquired by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 2011 – he has no qualms using other materials in his designs. He even commissioned by a collector in Hong Kong to create a Duchess bag in regular leather for her daughter.\nThe Ethan K exclusivity, however, remains firmly in place. In fact, the brand produces just 1,200 pieces annually and does not intend to ramp up production anytime soon.\n\n\nThis does not mean Koh will be taking it easy any time soon. Over the past year, he has been selectively taking on collaborations with brands including Maison Assouline and the Ritz Paris to showcase his craftsmanship. He created a Niloticus crocodile book trunk for publishing house Maison Assouline’s limited edition Lee Radziwill book series, and a bespoke collection for The Ritz Paris’ concept store, inspired by the famous Ritz Blue hue.\n“My business is built for the next 20 years.”\nLast year, he also launched a pop-up store designed by renowned interior designer Juan Pablo Molyneux called Space of Dreams at Galeries Lafayette in Paris. It ends its year-long run this month, but a new incarnation is set to pop up somewhere in Asia next, he revealed.\nWith a smile, Koh declined to give more details, preferring to let anticipation build, just like how his clients patiently wait for months to receive an order. This slow fashion formula has worked for him and he intends to keep it that way.\n“My business ,” he said, “is built for the next 20 years.”\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Profiles ', '     Opinions ']}"

      Up your style game: The biggest trends in men's casual footwear right now
  </h1>, 'text': 'Classic brogues or Oxfords are perennial essentials, but what if a guy’s looking to incorporate a trend or two into his shoe collection or widen his casual footwear options?\nYou won’t be surprised to know that sneakers are still a key trend for Spring/Summer, along with chunky soles and dad sneaker styles that were all the rage last year. If you haven’t quite caught on to the trend yet, perhaps it’s time to try a pair – you’ll find an even wider variety of options available this season.\nYes, the athleisure game is strong this Spring/Summer, as you’ll see from this list of footwear must-haves that are geared for the mood and lightness of the season. With shorts being a big trend on the runways too, you’ll also want some casual slip-ons or sandals to work a breezier look.\nCHUNKY SNEAKERS\nLike it or not, the chunky sneaker trend will be hanging around for quite a while. Dad sneakers are still enjoying a moment, although you don’t necessarily have to go down that route – trainers and the ""sock""\xa0sneaker are equally au courant too.\nBrands are playing with all sorts of textural and colour combinations on these sporty shoes and you should experiment with them too. But if there’s one hue you absolutely need in your sneaker collection for Spring/Summer (which, really, will work for years from now too), it’s white – classic, fresh and as much a statement-making shade as red, green, yellow or blue.\n""TOURIST""\xa0SANDALS\nThose who have always mocked the Teva-sandal-with-socks pairing worn by many an unfashionable tourist will now have to eat their words. The sports sandal is one of the most prominent shoe trends on the runways this season – for both men and women.\nMen, however, will find them easier to pull off than women – make them your go-to with casual slacks and a hoodie, or a coordinated beach get-up. Bonus: They’re great for sweaty feet and don’t look as sloppy as flip-flops do. Don’t ever attempt adding socks to the equation though, unless you’ve got enough ’tude to fill every space you walk into.\n\n\nHIKING BOOTS\nOff the mountain trail and onto the runway – hiking boot-inspired shoes are yet another new athleisure fashion fave. It doesn’t matter whether you buy them from a sports gear store or Dior – this season, these sturdy boots are meant to be worn with everything (and not just your hiking gear), or as a stand-in for your sneakers on days when you feel like spiffing up a casual ensemble.\nLEATHER ESPADRILLES\nThis casual slip-on shoe gets an upgrade this season with luxe materials, such as suede and leather, and interesting details. Of course, it’s the perfect footwear for your next holiday, but don’t forget that the luxury version can take you to more places too – casual Fridays in the office or even dining in finer establishments. Think of it as the new velvet loafer – they’ll fill the gap between formal and casual without much trouble.\nLUXE SLIDES\nAre Teva sandals too ""street""\xa0for your fashion sensibilities? Make slides your essential weekend footwear\xa0instead. Ditch the Adidas pool slides and find a pair that’s fit for vacationing at the likes of Capri or the French Riviera – think leather, light colours, and little to zero details.\nAlternatively, with logo mania still going on strong, you can head in the opposite direction – consider investing in a designer pair with a brand name or monogram splashed across the strap – these will definitely not go unnoticed.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      Sun, sea and sandals: The most stylish casual footwear of the season
  </h1>, 'text': ""So you've booked your tickets for that dream resort getaway, planned your itinerary and sorted out all your #OOTDs. All that's left is choosing the right footwear to pack in your bag. The good news? Designers and brands have pushed out a mind-boggling array of styles, which means there's something for everyone. What's even better? The season's top footwear options are also the best-performing workhorses. Their job doesn't end at the beach – from the office to brunch with the girls, you can take them everywhere with you.\n\n\nPLOT TWIST\nSun, sand, sea and sandals – this casual option is as synonymous with beach holidays as florals are to spring. It's hardly groundbreaking stuff, but you can still switch things up by looking out for the details that'll make all the difference.\nFor example, a strappy pair from Marni effortlessly evokes the magic of summer afternoons spent on a yacht; the colourful ombre soles on a Chloe pair signal a sense of quirky eclecticism. Prada's sporty versions have enough legs to put you leagues ahead of the competition while letting you stay on theme.\nTIP: Spice things up with accents of gold – it’s a trick that works every time.\nGO NATURAL\nA well-deserved break away from the hustle and bustle of city life allows your spirit to heal. You'll want your footwear to reflect that renewed vigour, too. Our suggestion? Choose from a variety of footwear that incorporates earthy elements into their designs.\nSalvatore Ferragamo worked sculptural cork soles to its platform sandals, while Jil Sander proposed a minimalist pair that recalled the serenity of a Japanese Zen garden. Elsewhere, Stella McCartney crafted slip-ons using environmentally-conscious materials. Now that's a cause we can all get behind.\nTIP: Stick to a neutral palette and watch how the look falls into place.\nARCHITECTURAL DIGEST\nNot all heels are created the same and these are a step above the rest because of their artistic inclinations. Think of them like sculptures – they make great collectibles that'll also bring any look of yours to the next level.\nDecorated with an interesting array of prints, pattern and textures, Fendi's interpretation toes the line between fun and sultry; Saint Laurent's bold heel will lend a Pop Art elegance to your bearing; while Balmain's clear contoured version recalls the Space Age furniture movement of the 60s.\nTIP: Take things one step further and opt for metallic or iridescent tones for your nails.\nFOOT LOCKER\nIn between sunbathing at the beach and having dinner at a fancy restaurant, you'll want to explore the various facets of island life in a comfortable option that doesn't compromise on style.\nEnter the sneaker – a ubiquitous footwear option that has managed to integrate with all aspects of fashion thanks to its unparalleled versatility. From Tory Burch's sensible, duo-toned versions to Versace's chunky statement makers, trust us when we say there's now a pair to suit every occasion and need.\nTIP: Pull up your socks – literally.

      Don't want to splurge on your wedding gown? These options cost less than S$700

A custom Dior gown runs in the regions of hundreds of thousands of dollars, head designer Maria Grazia Chiuri’s involvement not included.\nBut if you’re not planning a royal wedding and don’t relish making a giant dent in the wedding budget, there are a host of alternatives that won’t cost an arm and a leg.\nRental is one way to go.

Decide on a budget and stick to it – don’t get tempted to “upgrade” the budget just because of extra\xa0bells and whistles.\nPick a dress that fits your budget and style. If you’ve planned a beach wedding, a short dress might be a good idea – this way, there’s less fabric for sand to latch onto.

      The best resort wear trends to raise your style game this vacation season
  </h1>, 'text': ""There's something about spending time by the beach that does wonders for the mind, body and soul. Could it be the melody of lapping waves soothing frazzled souls? Or the magnificent sunrises lifting spirits? As summer goes into full swing, our wanderlust also kicks into gear. And on the top of everyone's mind: A sweet escape to the most picturesque beach resort in some undiscovered corner of the world.\nBut before you hop on the next flight out, check out our summer-ready mood board of the hottest runway inspirations, plus the best pieces to pack for your vacation. You may be taking some downtime, but that doesn't mean your style should.\n\n\nTHE DRESS\nSundresses are foolproof options to have in your luggage, but what's fashion without a little risk-taking?\nYour best bet this season are dresses instilled with a funky, nomadic attitude. Brands such as 3.1 Phillip Lim, Chloe, Loewe and Marni have all released covetable interpretations of dresses that are not only great to spend hot summer days in, but also feed our voracious desire to see the world.\nElsewhere, Simon Porte Jacquemus continued his winning streak with figure-hugging or billowing maxi numbers that sun worshippers would approve of.\nTip:\xa0Look out for homespun details such as crochet, embroidery and fringe to add textural depth to your ensemble.\nTHE HAWAIIAN SHIRT\nThe humble Hawaiian shirt is no longer associated with fuddy-duddy types, thanks to its induction into fashion's Hall of Fame in recent years.\nSince then, there have been no shortage of fashionable options on the market, but its popularity soared to even greater heights when Miuccia Prada brought back some of her famous prints and transferred them onto the shirts (she duly matched these with bucket hats and equally graphic skirts).\nPrada's interpretations naturally sparked a buying frenzy, but the shirts also stood out because of their unisex appeal – you can always steal one from your partner's closet.\nTip:\xa0Tailoring is key when it comes to the Hawaiian shirt. When cut well, it lends a subtle touch of structure to your ensemble.\n\n\nTHE SWIMWEAR\nThis season, designers doubled the mileage of the pool essential by cleverly reworking swimwear for daywear.\nAt Hermes, Nadege Vanhee-Cybulski paired aerodynamic bodysuits with exquisite leather pieces. The late Karl Lagerfeld matched a graphic monochrome interpretation with classic denims at Chanel, thus ensuring a seamless transition from poolside to sidewalk.\xa0\nMeanwhile, Saint Laurent's Anthony Vaccarello turned up the heat with sensual leopard print numbers full of bite.\nTip:\xa0Dress up the swimsuit by going ultra luxe – match it with statement earrings, chunky necklaces or gold cuffs.\nTHE ACCESSORIES\nThe whole may be greater than the sum of its parts, but that doesn't mean you should overlook the details that'll give your resort outfit its panache. From statement shoulder-dusters to graphic sunglasses, every finishing touch matters.\nYour bag, for example, should either take the form of a handy belt bag that brings emphasis to the waist, or trendy woven iterations that attest to the skill of the human hand.\nFor the discerning woman, a casual pair of flip-flops will not make the cut – look towards this season's multitude of feathered sandals to add points to your bearing.\nTop things off with an interesting piece of headgear: A wide-brimmed straw hat does the trick just fine, but you can always seal the deal with an embellished headband – it’s a look that's girly and grown-up at the same time.\nTip:\xa0When it comes to accessorising, have a theme and stick with it. This ensures an overall sense of unity and cohesion.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     holiday ', '     Travel ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

The resulting line comprises a limited-edition range of sportswear and three unisex takes on Adidas’ Ultra Boost Clima running shoe in Missoni’s trademark knits – all of which make for some of the most sophisticated and stylish sports gear we’ve ever seen. Available on the local Adidas website.\nPUMA X SOPHIA WEBSTER\nThis Spring/Summer season sees Puma dropping not one but two outstanding sneaker collabs alongside some of fashion’s well-celebrated names. First, a series of girlish and fun takes on the sports brand’s Suede, Muse, Cali and Thunder sneakers for women and kids, all bearing Brit shoe and accessory designer Sophia Webster’s trademark touch of whimsy.\nPUMA X\xa0KARL LAGERFELD\nThe second is a release of two special-edition sneakers – a unisex Roma and a Roma Armor for women – with the late Karl Lagerfeld’s eponymous label. Both reflect Lagerfeld’s penchant for black and white via their youthful polka-dotted designs that are crafted in leather.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The Singaporean bespoke shoemaker who dreams of stepping onto the world stage
  </h1>, 'text': 'For most men interested in fashion, owning a pair of bespoke shoes is one of several aspirational grails, the kind of thing you treat yourself to only when money is no object – especially in a country like Singapore, whose humid climate pretty much turns any shoe cabinet into a mould incubator.\n\nBetween the potential for mould, the rain and the chances of someone accidentally scuffing your shoe, an investment in bespoke shoes is something you can only do if you neither sweat the small stuff nor need to worry about the expense.\n\nFor those who do fit into this category, in the past, commissioning a pair of bespoke footwear would have required a trip to Europe or Japan. And no, those cheap “custom” shoes you had made on holiday in Hoi An are definitely not what any self-respecting shoe lover would consider bespoke, let alone worth wearing in public.\n\n\n\nEnter Josh Leong, who has been making a name for himself ever since he started offering bespoke shoe services in 2015. Fine dress shoes are offered under the brand “Josh Leong” while “Heirloom by Josh Leong” focuses on casual footwear like sneakers and driving loafers. In 2016, Josh partnered with Jeremiah Ang from The J.Myers Company to found the brand Palola, which features women’s ballet flats and loafers. And in 2017, Josh partnered with Lusso Tailors and local shoe enthusiast Winston Liang to form Seamless Bespoke, a unique “boutique and atelier” concept that produces bespoke clothing and shoes made in-house by their team of artisans.\n\n\nHI, JOSH. DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ARTIST, A CRAFTSMAN, AN ENTREPRENEUR, OR ALL OF THESE?\nI think when you\'re running a small, craft-based business like a bespoke shoemaking brand, it\'s important to recognise that you need to have the ability to adapt and wear different hats when the situation calls for it. For example, when I\'m designing for my sneaker collection or when I\'m designing a client\'s bespoke dress shoes, I need to pull out my artist hat and get into designing mode. Likewise, when I\'m in the process of making a pair of shoes, precision and an eye for the tiniest details are probably two of the most important aspects when it comes to crafting a well-made pair of shoes. In my opinion, the most difficult of the three roles is actually the entrepreneurship role, as very often, the very core of a handcrafted business or product runs contrary to the main objective of any business – which is to make as much money as possible. The very nature of a handcrafted business is that it is very difficult to scale, and that as a business, it\'s always going to be difficult to juggle how profitable the business can be, versus offering customers products that are made to the highest standards in terms of materials and workmanship.\nHOW DID YOU FIRST DISCOVER YOUR LOVE FOR SHOES AND THEN SHOEMAKING?\nAs a teenager, I was always saving my pocket money to get a new pair of sneakers, and my personal collection of shoes was always larger than my entire family\'s collection combined!\nShoemaking was actually something that I stumbled into more than something that I had always wanted to pursue. It all started with a love for leather, which led me to dabble in leather-crafting as a hobby. When I decided to turn this hobby of mine into a career, I moved to Florence, Italy, to enrol at a trade school that taught both bag-making and shoemaking courses. As soon as I started learning how to make shoes, I was hooked. It was one of those life-changing moments when I realised that the shoemaking industry was where I wanted to be for the rest of my career. The thing that I love about shoemaking is that it is the perfect combination of the arts, in terms of the lines and the designs, and science, how we calculate certain measurements that affect the fit and function of the shoes. Every single one of the more than 100 steps in the shoemaking process has a compounding effect on the next step, and an accomplished shoemaker is one who is able to execute as many of these different steps as cleanly and precisely as possible.\nTELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE OF TRAINING IN ITALY. HOW LONG WAS IT? WHAT WAS EACH DAY LIKE?\nThe one year that I spent in Italy making shoes was probably one of the happiest years of my life! I have the fondest memories of making shoes with my fellow students and apprentices, learning from my masters, visiting the suppliers and factories around Florence, sourcing for the best materials and components for shoemaking. A typical day as a bespoke shoemaking apprentice starts at 8am in the morning, and usually lasts until 7pm at night. While the craft of shoemaking is physically very demanding, there is a somewhat therapeutic, calming effect that washes over me when I\'m in the workshop. The sounds inside a shoemaking workshop are what I remember and treasure the most – hammering, rasping, the sound of knives being sharpened and the sound of threads being pulled through the welts and soles as we stitched each pair of shoes by hand.\nWHAT DID YOU DO PREVIOUSLY? WHAT WAS YOUR PROFESSION AND DID YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU DID?\nI\'ve been a competitive tennis player since the age of nine, so tennis has always been a huge part of my life. After I graduated from Anglo-Chinese Junior College, I started coaching my juniors in the school team as a fun way to earn a little extra pocket money. I soon realised that I enjoyed coaching, and I continued to do it on a part-time basis throughout my university days. Upon graduating from Singapore Management University, I worked in advertising sales for a year, but left to pursue a full-time career as a tennis coach, coaching both ACJC\'s competitive tennis team as well as my own private students. I did enjoy my time as a tennis coach, but decided that it wasn\'t something that I wanted to do for the rest of my career, hence, the decision to jump into leather crafting and subsequently, shoemaking.\nIS SINGAPORE A TOUGH PLACE TO BE A CREATIVE?\nYes and no. If you\'re referring to the very abstract, super ""out of this world"", free-flowing type of creativity that you see most commonly in modern art, then I think Singapore is a tough place for that kind of creativity and expression. My opinion of Singaporeans is that they generally prefer to play it safe and typically don\'t venture off the beaten track too often, so finding an audience that is able to appreciate very abstract expressions of creativity is tough in Singapore. However, I think that there are many varying degrees of creativity and creative expression, and if you\'re smart and bold enough to find your creative niche, the local market and the accompanying spending power are able to support these local ventures.\nHOW DO YOU FIND YOUR CUSTOMERS?\nBespoke shoes are an ultra niche product. The vast majority of my customers are referred by existing customers or people who have heard my story and seen my work. I\'ve been very fortunate to have had my story picked up by numerous media channels, especially during the early days when I was first starting out, so that helped to accelerate the growth of my brands.\nWHAT SHOULD CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND ABOUT BESPOKE SHOES? WHY SHOULD THEY CONSIDER THIS AS OPPOSED TO OFF THE SHELF?\nThe first and most important thing that customers need to understand about bespoke shoes is that it is all about the process. The final pair of shoes is really just the end product, but the main beauty of bespoke is derived from the relationship that is formed between the shoemaker and customer. Too often, customers who are new to bespoke place too much emphasis on the finished product, instead of enjoying the process. The more a shoemaker understands the customer, the better the bespoke shoes will turn out. Needless to say, one of the biggest differences between bespoke shoes versus off-the-shelf shoes is that the fit should be just as, if not even more important, than the final aesthetic design of the shoe. I\'ve always likened finding the right bespoke shoemaker similar to finding the right barber, or the right tailor. Once you find the right shoemaker who understands what your feet need, that is what makes all the difference.\n\n\nDO YOU EVER HAVE THOSE ""WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING"" MOMENTS?\nAll the time! When you\'re running any kind of small business and you\'ve only got a small team working for you, it\'s inevitable that you will come across tasks or problems that you and your team have never encountered before, and you will need to embrace the uncertainty or else it will consume you. When I was first starting out, I used to be overwhelmed when faced with the many challenges that were all a part of running a small business. However, as you overcome each of these obstacles, you add each experience to your ""bag of tricks"", and your confidence grows. These days, you learn to expect that there will always be problems along the way, and that it\'s all part of the journey as an entrepreneur. I\'ve also learnt that even though you may be the business owner, you don\'t always need to know how to do everything when running the business - it\'s more important for you to find and manage a team that has the experience and knowledge to help you to achieve your goals, and it\'s perfectly all right to sometimes have absolutely no idea what you\'re doing. The sooner you accept this, the sooner you learn to trust the team that\'s around you, instead of always micro-managing everything and everyone!\nWHAT\'S BEEN THE TOUGHEST CREATIVE CHALLENGE YOU\'VE FACED SO FAR?\nThe toughest creative challenge so far has definitely been designing the various collections of women\'s shoes under my women\'s brand Palola. I remember when my business partner Jeremiah and I first started designing the first-ever collection of Palola shoes, we showed the designs and colours that we\'d selected to some of our female friends. Their first response to the initial prototypes was that the shoes looked like they had been designed by ""two straight men"" – basically implying that we had chosen colours and designed silhouettes that were nothing at all like what women would like to wear. We took the criticism to heart, and went back to the drawing boards and completely redesigned the entire collection, selecting leathers and colours based on the feedback from our female friends.\nARE YOU THE ONLY ONE IN SINGAPORE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING?\nI\'m definitely not the only one in Singapore starting his own shoe brands, but I\'m quite sure that I\'m the only one in Singapore who makes men\'s bespoke shoes in traditional hand-welted construction.\nWHO IS YOUR DESIGN OR CREATIVE HERO?\nTom Ford is a designer I really look up to. Aside from the amazing clothes and shoes that he designs, I admire his work ethic, as well as his incredible attention to detail and his almost OCD-like sense of perfection. He\'s also incredibly poised, elegant and eloquent - all traits that I admire greatly. I think if you want to excel in any type of creative or design role, you need to have an obsessive-type personality. You have to feel uneasy or uncomfortable when something isn\'t perfect. That\'s what drives you and motivates you to always be better.\nTELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS I WOULD NEVER EXPECT.\nI\'m not a natural, gifted designer who is able to draw up something on a piece of paper from scratch. However, my gift is that I\'m able to identify what looks nice and what doesn\'t. In other words, I would like to think that I generally have good taste when it comes to identifying and understanding why some things look nicer than others.\nWhenever I start designing a new collection of shoes, I sit down and I scroll through thousands upon thousands of shoes from all sorts of brands, shortlisting those that I feel look nice or have that special X-factor. I pick out the bits of the shoes that I like, and I use all these different elements and combine them together to form my initial design prototype. I never draw or sketch out my first prototype on a piece of paper - I prefer to go straight into drawing the lines and the design directly on the actual shoe last that I will be using to make the prototype shoe. I find that the 3D form of the last gives me a better visual understanding of what the final product will look like, compared to a 2D drawing on a piece of paper.\nWHAT’S THE DREAM?\nThe dream is for my brands to be recognised on a global stage – the market in Singapore is a very, very small market for a product that is as niche as mine, and the only way for my businesses to really scale up is to look beyond our shores at other markets. I\'ve always wanted to leave a business or a legacy of sorts as well for my future children to inherit if they choose to.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Here’s why Rihanna’s new Fenty fashion line is a godsend for curvy women
  </h1>, 'text': '“I am my own muse,” Robyn Rihanna Fenty purred of her new luxury fashion label\xa0Fenty, created with the LVMH group, unveiled on Wednesday (May 22) and now on sale at a pop-up store in Paris. It will be available online from May 29. “It’s badass, it’s daring,” she continued. “It pushes the envelope. It’s confident. It has a strong silhouette. I want everyone to wear it. But I’ve got to make it right for me.”\nWe have met in Paris, in a nondescript building, down a narrow street in the Marais. The building has been designated to launch her first “release”, named 5-19, and is clad in a dazzling Fenty-azure blue, but the only clue as to its current\xa0occupant is the phalanx of rock-faced heavies who stand around in suits.\xa0\nThis collection, the first under the auspices of LVMH, but actually the fifth if one factors in the four Fenty collections she did when the brand was part of the then Kering-owned Puma, is what she feels like wearing “now”. And it’s unexpectedly smart.\n“It’s badass, it’s daring. It pushes the envelope. It’s confident. It has a strong silhouette. I want everyone to wear it. But I’ve got to make it right for me.” – Rihanna\nWhere her previous collections cited “Marie Antoinette at the gym” or vivid moto-leathers, here are tailored blazers in taupe or pink cotton with bumbag belts attached; a boned shirt has a sculptural, romantic sleeve; Japanese denim jackets and shirt dresses are either designed to cinch the waist and short short short, or voluminous and oversized; a cotton bodysuit has a bustier neckline and a saucy sensibility. The accessories include stilettos with barely-there straps, chunky gold\xa0hoops, and massive metallic visor-style sunglasses.\nIt’s a wardrobe for someone who wants to be taken seriously, but still wants to feel their vibe. According to Fenty, fashion was only ever a second interest after music. Her passion for clothes was fed by her mother Monica, whose style she has always admired. But, this segue into fashion is merely another platform from which to sell her “sound”.\xa0\nExcluding the footwear and jewellery – there are as yet no bags – this first release amounts to about 36 different shapes, and items range from about €200 (S$308) for a corset T-shirt to €1,100 for a reversible coat, price points that are lower than at many LVMH labels but still highly aspirational for the consumers one would imagine sit in her target demographic. Then again, it is size inclusive: Clothes run to a French size 46, but the cuts are so generous that they actually run far bigger. “I’m a curvy girl,” she said of the label’s proportions. “And if I can’t wear it, it’s not going to work.”\xa0\nWatching Rihanna it’s clear to see how the author of eight albums (a ninth is in the works), with a personal fortune estimated to be about US$260 million (S$358 million), persuaded Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH and the fourth-richest man in the world, to do her bidding.\nWearing a Fenty mini shirt-dress in white cotton poplin, she gazes out from under a black bouffant of hair like a Ronette remade for the millennial age. Her scarlet-painted talons trace a Barbados-shaped pendant at her neck, one of many references to her birthplace, and strung among a trove of amulets.\nBut it’s the eyes – catlike, hazel-coloured, lids smeared with an iridescent glow – that hold you. She has an unnervingly direct gaze, which, combined with her easy candour, and that crazy Cupid’s bow, has a hypnotic effect.\n“I’m a control freak,” she said, lightly squeezing my shoulder for emphasis, as she describes a fitting session in the studio. When asked if LVMH were comfortable with the new flexibility she has brought to the maison, she smouldered: “Mr Arnault isn’t stupid.” She may epitomise the laid-back humour of the Caribbean island on which she grew up, but don’t confuse that with complacency. Rihanna works to no one’s schedule but her own.\xa0\nActually, the collection is pretty good. For starters, it’s blessedly absent of logos. It’s grown up and womanly, with a femininity undercut with tougher, more masculine looks (later, British Vogue editor Edward Enninful becomes her first male client when he buys a reversible parka in beige and oily black). But whether or not this Fenty finds commercial favour is less important. This is just the first release.\n“I’m designing what I want to wear, for when I want to wear it,” she said of the brand’s roll out, which will see clothes distributed in “drops”, like a cult streetwear brand, and sold direct via the website.\nThere will be no shows. Not unlike singles on an album, each release will represent completely different attitudes. Today, Riri wants a shirt dress. But next month, she might want a string vest, such as she might wear on holiday. Or an omelette gown, like the spectacular Guo Pei number she wore to the Met Gala in 2015.\nIf a brand is built on its DNA, Fenty’s defining characteristic will be its changing aesthetic. It will be as mercurial and unexpected as Rihanna is herself. “I don’t want to go to a show and then wait for six months to buy a look in a shop,” she said of dispensing with the business model on which most brands under LVMH have traditionally been dependent. “With Fenty, you see it, you wear it. I’m too greedy to wait.”\n“I’m designing what I want to wear, for when I want to wear it. I don’t want to go to a show and then wait for six months to buy a look in a shop. With Fenty, you see it, you wear it.” – Rihanna\nNow 31, with more than\xa071 million Instagram followers to her name,\xa0Rihanna\xa0became one of fashion’s most powerful influencers the day she invited us to stand under her umbrella in 2008. But while some celebrities know how to work – and sell – a dress, her arrival at LVMH has the potential for real disruption.\nShe first worked with the group when she starred in a campaign for Dior, for whom she later designed a capsule of eyewear. When Kering sold Puma, she brought the label to Arnault. In 2017, she launched\xa0Fenty Beauty, an inclusive cosmetic line that now offers make up for 46 shades of skin tone. That generated more than US$500 million in retail sales in its first year.\xa0\nThis latest venture combines a further set of firsts. She’s the first woman of colour to front an LVMH fashion label – “I am an immigrant, of mixed race, and I bring that perspective with me,” she said of her racial identity, which includes black, white and Latin American heritage. She’s leading the first fashion house LVMH has built from scratch since 1987, not only creatively but in the role of chief executive alongside her managing director, Veronique Gebel, and LVMH chief of strategy Jean Baptiste Voisin.\xa0\nShe’s also the first celebrity to have been given a label at a luxury group that has typically banked on the skills of the couturier. LVMH have invested €30 million in Fenty – and the singer is reciprocating with a similar investment in her time. Voisin attests that she’s putting in the hours, and that her work ethic is ferocious, but when one of the biggest, most prestigious and successful luxury groups is now putting their money on a singer and not a star designer one wonders if the fate of fashion now rests in the hands of a celebrity?\xa0\nSidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Fashion, who is not directly responsible for Fenty but worked with her at Dior, said that Rihanna is simply an exception.\xa0\n“She’s not just a celebrity designer,” he said. “[LVMH] know her. We met her years ago at Dior and you could see even then she was above celebrity. She’s super smart. Even at our first meeting she really impressed me. Rihanna is not couture, but she has the talent.”\n\n\nEven so, having a major global celebrity in the house does offer family Arnault the cachet of modern cool. And a\xa0soupcon of mystique. Certainly, the clandestine nature of this first launch has been epic. While the deal was done two years ago, Voisin was so secretive about the label that until very recently only three of his five-member strategy team even knew of the brand’s existence. Those in on the secret referred to the project as “M”, which stands for “Mademoiselle”. (Riri fans will note that early incarnations of the Fenty Beauty line were named “mattemoiselle”.)\nOf course, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel was the first “Mademoiselle”. And according to Voisin, the two share much in common. “Both women with a strong vision,” he said. “Both very smart. Both hard workers. Both powerfully charismatic.”\nIs Riri the 21st century’s equivalent of Coco? The singer has already far exceeded the Chanel founder’s global reach, but the comparison draws some handy parallels. During her career, Chanel transformed traditional modes of business, designed to suit her own sartorial needs, revolutionised the female wardrobe and made a fortune flogging scent. More importantly, she marched to no one else’s tune.\xa0\nRihanna brings the similarly disruptive point of view, a bold assurance and the calm authority of a woman in absolute control. Even better, she’s devised a creative environment in which she can U-turn any time. If something’s not working, she can just change her mind. And release something else. As a business proposition – it’s LVMH’s most badass move yet.\xa0\nBy Jo Ellison © 2019 The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     LVMH ', '     Luxury Looks ', ""     Women's Style "", '     Beauty ']}"

      Rihanna launches new fashion brand with LVMH in Paris
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Barbadian singer Rihanna has unveiled her new fashion brand with Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, a rare move by the French group to set up a label from scratch as it taps into soaring demand for celebrity collaborations in the luxury world.\nFenty – after the Umbrella\xa0hitmaker\'s full name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty – will build on the singer\'s existing joint venture in cosmetics with LVMH, with a full range of clothing, shoes and accessories.\n""My fashion will be different and non-traditional, because I do not come from this industry,"" the singer told a news conference Wednesday (May 22) evening, saying she hoped to bring a ""new vision of fashion"".\nPresented in a store in Paris\' trendy Marais district, the clothes offer structured lines, white or beige jackets with wide shoulders or blazer dresses wrapping the body.\nThe collection is also for men with large denim jackets and parka coats.\nThe French group has increasingly exploited collaborations with celebrities as well as streetwear designers to attract young customers of luxury goods.\nBut most ventures of the sort have been restricted to limited editions, and LVMH is looking to steal a march on peers by taking its pairing with 31-year-old Rihanna to another level.\nIt will be able to rely on Rihanna\'s social media credentials – the singer has amassed 70.5 million followers under her Instagram handle ""badgalriri"".\nKnown for her bold fashion statements at red carpet events, Rihanna is followed almost as much for her style as her music, and had already worked with other labels including sportswear brand Puma on collections under the Fenty name.\nIn contrast to other LVMH brands, Fenty products will be sold at significantly lower prices.\xa0Prices range from 600 euros (S$925) to 800 euros for a dress, 500 euros for sandals and 300 euros for costume jewellery.\nThe brand will be essentially an e-commerce-only venture, supported with temporary ""pop-up"" events rather than a store network.\nThe first ""pop-up"" store, Paris, will open on Friday (May 24) for two weeks and the website on May 29.

      Why e-commerce will never completely replace brick-and-mortar shopping
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Simon Naga first moved from Dubai to Singapore in 2017 to become Managing Director of Inditex brands – which includes fast fashion favourites like Zara, Pull&Bear and Massimo Dutti – the very first thing he did was to instruct his team not to let anyone know he had arrived. The very next thing he did, was to go shopping. For three whole weeks.\n“I wanted to check out all our stores personally, without anyone knowing who I was yet,” said Naga, who has 18 years’ experience in fashion retail. “And I wanted to see what our competitors were up to.”\nIn January this year, he was appointed VP of Al-Futtaim Asia (Retail), overseeing not just Inditex, but also department stores Marks & Spencer and Robinsons; multi-brand retailers like Royal Sporting House; as well as fashion, lifestyle and sports labels such as Aape, Coast, Karl Lagerfeld, Nautica, Oasis, Reebok and Ted Baker, among others.\n\n\nThis essentially made him the head honcho of Singapore’s largest fashion retail distributor, whose job involves getting inside the head of the Singapore shopper.\n“The Singapore shopper is very fashion-forward, and very demanding,” he said. “For example, recently, I noticed that there was a bestselling collection from a certain brand (not under Al-Futtaim), which sold very well everywhere, except in Singapore.”\nAccording to Naga, Singaporean shoppers are less likely to buy an entire trend top-to-toe, unlike, say, shoppers in Thailand.\n“Singaporeans like to mix and match, and they prefer summery items that can be worn throughout the year while still referencing the latest seasonal trends,” he noted. “It’s almost impossible as most brands cater to four seasons, but we work around it by speaking directly to the brands we distribute about the specific needs of this market, which serves as the fashion hub for all of Southeast Asia. We ask our brands to specifically design and produce items suited for Singapore, even if it’s in smaller quantities that their factories are used to producing.”\nAnd while Singaporeans are a tech-savvy lot who shop online frequently, they also like the brick-and-mortar experience.\n“After all, Singaporeans love going out to meet friends and have fun; they like eating out, and if they’re headed to a restaurant, chances are, they’ll take the opportunity to shop too,” said Naga, who admitted that he does not shop online.\n“The Singapore shopper is very fashion-forward, and very demanding. Singaporeans like to mix and match, and they prefer summery items that can be worn throughout the year while still referencing the latest seasonal trends.” – Simon Naga, Al-Futtaim Asia\n“To me, nothing beats the pleasure of heading out to the stores, and seeing, touching and trying before I buy. And I know for sure that there are many, many other shoppers like me. That’s why I believe offline shopping isn’t going to disappear anytime soon; rather, I see online and offline shopping as completing each other, rather than competing with each other.”\nAccording to Naga, online sales account for only 5 per cent of Al-Futtaim’s Singapore revenue. As such, his focus remains on drawing customers into his stores, “by creating a great offline experience, in terms of innovative store concepts, attractive visual merchandising, excellent customer service, special shopping privileges for loyal shoppers, and so on”.\nReferring to stalwart shopping destination Robinsons, which has established a firm reputation for its customer service, he asks rhetorically: “Your typical department store here carries between 800 to 1,000 brands, many of which are available at other department stores. What makes shoppers come to us, over our competitors, when we are all essentially selling the same items and brands?”\nThe answer might just lie in how he engages external consultants to produce regular detailed Mystery Shopper reports that cover anything and everything from whether the windows were spotless, whether sales staff were polite, knowledgeable and pro-active in cross-selling, whether the fitting rooms were well-staffed and pleasantly outfitted, if the cashier bade customers goodbye, and so on.\n“These days, the main trends in retail is ‘anything but basic’ and ‘making customers feel good’,” he explained. “It’s about the experience. Maybe 20 years ago shoppers loved the idea of stores stocking lots of products. These days, it’s more about how you put things together; it’s about selling ideas. You always have to think of ways to explain retail to the new generation, in ways they pay attention to. So of course, these days we’re big on social media and influencers as marketing channels, rather than just relying on newspapers and magazines and in-store fashion shows.”\nAsked to recount some of his favourite recent examples of innovative marketing executed by the brands under his care, Naga cites a Zara campaign last year that made use of Augmented Reality that was employed across outlets 313@Somerset, Ion Orchard, Marina Bay Sands and Ngee Ann City stores over a period of four weeks.\n“To me, nothing beats the pleasure of heading out to the stores, and seeing, touching and trying before I buy. And I know for sure that there are many, many other shoppers like me.” – Simon Naga, Al-Futtaim Asia\nThe Spanish fast fashion brand’s store windows appeared completely empty, save signs encouraging shoppers to download and use the Zara AR app, and train their smartphones on a QR code – upon which holographs of models Lea Julian and Fran Summers pose, move around and even speak while dressed in the SS18 Zara Studio collection. Shoppers could also take and send photos alongside the holograms.\xa0The clothes and accessories could be purchased instantly through the app, as well as in store. Online shoppers also received their goods in boxes bearing the same code, which, when activated, would cause a miniature hologram model to walk around the box.\nMore recently, in conjunction with the opening of Spanish loungewear and lingerie brand Oysho’s concept store ( a recent addition to Al-Futtaim’s portfolio) at Jewel Changi Airport, 70 customers were treated, over three sessions, to a yoga class conducted within Jewel’s lush indoor landscaping, before a VIP store visit.\nBut Naga says that one thing that hasn’t changed, despite technological innovations and evolving tastes of consumers, and despite the fact that Al-Futtaim’s brands carry products “for customers aged one month and above”, is that “ultimately, women still form the bulk of our shoppers. The same goes for retail, as it does at home: If you don’t make the woman happy, you’re in for a hard time.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     shopping ', '     e-commerce ', '     retail ', '     Profiles ', '     fashion ']}"

      High street Hari Raya fashion you can wear long after the festivities are over

However, you don't need to stick to traditional clothes when mass-market retailers now also offer modest pieces that you can wear long after the kuih has run out.\xa0\nHow do we know that modest fashion is a booming market? Luxury e-tailer The Modist caters specifically to women who prefer covering up. Net-a-Porter has a dedicated section for modest dressing. Even Nike stocks a hijab line for athletes while Uniqlo has teamed up with British-Japanese Muslim fashion designer Hana Tajima to push conservative collaborations. \xa0\nCNA Lifestyle roped in radio DJ Fiza O to show how these everyday pieces can be amped up for the occasion.\nCUE THE COAT \nCovering up is central to modest dressing. “I think the trick to polishing up modest dressing lies in mixing trend-driven pieces with classics,” says Fiza who is no stranger to getting her glam game on.\nBut instead of dwelling on the trendy pieces, a style trick that fashion stylists love is to turn the attention to\xa0the classics. That casual round-neck tee is what you’ll want to reach for to play down a trendy kaftan\xa0while a high-neck top has the ability to\xa0dress up a relaxed linen\xa0blazer.\nWHITE NOISE\n“Less is more is my definition of sophistication,” says Fiza who professes to be a fan of tonal dressing. “It's easy to pull an all-beige, all-black, all-blue look. My favourite is definitely an all-white look. There’s something about white that just makes you look effortlessly stylish.” \xa0\n\n\nREUSE AND RESTYLE \nSays who that the baju kurung can only be worn during festive occasions? Take a cue from Fiza.\xa0“I love to pair my pretty everyday blouses with my batik skirt or wear my good old black kebaya top with jeans and statement earrings.”\nTHESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKING\nLove that midi skirt but don’t want to flash your ankles? Enter booties to save the day. Patent leather for a bit of flash while a rugged pair of workman boots instantly toughens up a girlie getup. \xa0\nSIZE MATTERS\nHow to add more flash?

      The Singapore ad man who quit his job to play with leather at 51
  </h1>, 'text': ""When it comes to watches, I have a small obsession – I’m a watch guy who loves to wear these on bund straps.\nFor those who don’t know, bund straps are leather cuff watch straps that were famously worn by German fighter pilots and, later on, by the likes of Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.\nAbout two years ago, while hunting to commission a new strap for one of my favourite watches, I came across some beautifully designed pieces in sumptuous colours on a website called Eatsleeplay. I was surprised and thrilled to discover it was a Singaporean brand.\nSince then, I have been obsessively stalking leather artisan Eric Siow’s Instagram feed. Every time he posts a new image, I think to myself, “I really need another strap”. His gorgeous wallets and iPhone sleeves are very tempting, too.\n\n\nThe 51-year-old Siow ran his own ad shop for nearly a decade before calling it quits to start his one-man leather craft company. Today, Eatsleeplay keeps this active artisan happy and satisfied, while also engaging the creative energies that served him well in his previous career.\nHere, in CNA Lifestyle's series, where we speak with creatives making their mark in Singapore, Eric discusses being a creative and overcoming Singapore's supposed limitations.\nWHERE DID THE NAME COME FROM? IT’S NOT WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM A HIGH-END LEATHER BRAND.\nI know, right? One morning, we were cracking our heads, brainstorming for a catchy name with my initial E and S in it. Then my wife and I saw our pet dog BoBo chilling out in the sun after her breakfast and boom, it just hits us that her kind of lifestyle was what we aspired for.\nWHAT WAS THE TRANSITION LIKE FINANCIALLY AND IN TERMS OF CREATIVITY?\nTurning this leather craft hobby into a full-time gig has to be one of the best things I have ever done. As a creative person at heart, the practice of leather crafting came quite naturally to me. Having said that, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Even though it was my own business that I had left to do this, I was still, really, just a salaryman. I believe that, for many salarymen, leaving a job to start something new may create certain financial stress, but luckily that passed quickly for me. It wasn’t anything that I wasn’t able to resolve by tightening one’s belt.\nWHAT CONVINCED YOU TO MAKE A GO FOR IT? WAS IT CUSTOMER DEMAND OR JUST AN ITCH YOU HAD TO SCRATCH?\nDuring those years of running the ad shop, there was no work-life balance. Not even close. It was a decision that my wife and I both made – we needed to take life with a slower pace. Leather craft was, at that point, my hobby and passion. But it fit naturally within our plan moving forward – it was something I could do from home, while managing my time and leading a more balanced life. It’s still a hobby first and a business second.\n\n\nWHAT’S BEEN YOUR HERO PRODUCT SO FAR?\nMy bestseller would have to be the 019 FullBund strap. It was inspired by a version by Tudor. I have since made a few variants in numerous configurations to fit different watches. I’m also hoping to make bigger items, especially bags. I’d like to work on weekenders, totes and backpacks, products still within the men’s accessories market.\nDO YOU DO MORE BESPOKE PIECES OR DO CUSTOMERS JUST ORDER EXISTING DESIGNS?\nIt’s more of the former. Then again, quite often bespoke requests are also inspired by an original design that I have, tweaking little design cues or colour combinations for a more personalised touch.\nWHERE ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS COMING FROM – SINGAPORE OR OVERSEAS?\nMore globally. But I have gotten a significant number of orders locally in the past two years. I guess with the rapid growth of social channels, more locals are buying into the made-by-hand culture and have started to be more supportive of the local craft scene. Instagram has been my main platform, through which I constantly showcase my works. I believe most of my customers found me through that. I am, of course, also thankful to referrals from both customers and other local leather crafters, too.\n\n\nWHAT’S THE HARDEST THING ABOUT RUNNING YOUR OWN SMALL CREATIVE BUSINESS?\nNothing really major. If I have to list them, it’s just sourcing for materials and courier services. Even in this day and age, finding the right material at the right cost and getting them delivered sometimes takes way too long. As for the latter, finding the right courier at the right freight cost with the right level of service isn’t easy either. As I mentioned, a lot of my customers are global, so too high a shipping cost will affect sales eventually. Probably the more important factor is that I only have one pair of hands – there’s only that much I can do at a time. Thankfully, most of my customers do understand that it takes time for a piece of handmade craft.\nDID YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE ‘WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING?’ MOMENTS?\nPossibly on the very first day that I didn’t have to go into the office to work anymore. After all, leaving something you have been doing your whole adult life can be quite unnerving. But that thought was very quickly dismissed.\nAND WHAT’S BEEN THE MOST REWARDING MOMENT?\nI love the little notes my customers leave behind after receiving their orders. I also love getting repeat customers. Knowing that someone appreciates a good piece of craft makes me feel that all the time and effort that I’ve spent making my products for him or her has been well worth it.\nIS SINGAPORE A TOUGH PLACE TO BE A CREATIVE?\nThat’s a tough question. I have seen good examples of creatives doing well. Singapore is a small nation and it has an even smaller pool of people who understands and appreciates creatives.\xa0Unfortunately, from what I have experienced, one really needs to stand\xa0out for people to buy into his or her thinking and celebrate his or her work.\n\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE HARDEST CREATIVE CHALLENGE YOU’VE HAD SO FAR?\nTo date, I guess my duffel bag would have to have been the toughest thing to make. I wanted to keep the lines and curves classic while decorating it with contemporary details at the same time. It was quite a challenge to place these details together yet ensure the design was holistic.\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT INSPIRE YOU?\nJust about everything actually, which is a habit I have had since my advertising days. Before the Internet, I used to love heading to book stands – the magazine section of a bookstore to be precise. Anything from home decor to automobiles and travel to catwalk runways are my sources of inspirations. Lifestyles intrigue me the greatly. One of my most inspiring moments was also meeting the master crafter Hajime San of Niwa Leather\xa0in person. I visited him at his atelier when I was in Tokyo three years back. Being able to touch and feel his work and interacting with the master himself was both a humbling and inspiring experience.\nTELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS I WOULD NEVER EXPECT.\nRunning! A heavy intake of oxygen helps to clear my mind. During a run, I have few distractions around me – no work, no smart devices, it’s just me and the long path ahead. That said, I have my earbuds plugged in. I like how music provides a rhythm for my pace. I try to run at least once a week, twice if I’m stuck with creative or technical processes.\nWHAT’S NEXT FOR EATSLEEPLAY?\nI’m lucky that at my age, I can still enjoy my passion and doing what I love. I’m keeping Eatsleeplay simple. I’d like more opportunities to do unusual creative pieces – and opportunities to collaborate with an artist would be nice, too. I have so many designs in drafts and in my head that I really should set aside time to make them.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ']}"

      Chanel chugs into the future with a look back at Karl Lagerfeld
  </h1>, 'text': 'Chanel is moving forward. Or at least trying to. How else to view the fact that for the first Chanel resort show since the death in February of Karl Lagerfeld, its longtime designer, the house had reimagined a Parisian railway station?\n“You have to move, to travel, to surprise,” Lagerfeld once said. “Traveling informs youth, and what’s so fun is the energy.” So said a man who built an airport terminal, a cruise ship and even a rocket launchpad as sets for his Chanel runway shows, the better to transport guests from one fantastical destination to the next.\nAnd so with a strict departure time of 9am\xa0on Friday (May 3), guests arrived to find that a string of lavish custom-built dining cars had pulled into the upper salons of the Grand Palais, Lagerfeld’s long-favored show site, transformed for the moment into a beaux-arts terminal, complete with platforms and an elegant cafe.\nIt should be noted here that fashion has always loved a train, including the Diorient Express\xa0that opened John Galliano’s fall couture show for Christian Dior at Gare d’Austerlitz in 1998 and Marc Jacobs’ Louis Vuitton Express\xa0that chugged its way into Paris Fashion Week in 2012.\nFor the Chanel 2006 cruise show in New York, Lagerfeld took over a restaurant in Grand Central Terminal. But 13 years later, back on home turf and under the artistic direction of Virginie Viard, Lagerfeld’s former right hand, Chanel decided to up the spectacle ante to mark the start of its next chapter.\nFirst, editors, buyers and clients took their seats at white-clothed tables, feasting on the scene of golden age glamour (as well as hearty silver-service breakfasts of summer berries, croissants, scrambled eggs and orange juice).\xa0\nNext, their journey took them down ornately arched iron staircases scattered with palm trees to a vast concrete concourse, where they were directed by station porters in navy caps to the life-size platforms that ran alongside railroad tracks. Each bore slatted benches and a station sign for a sunny destination in an exotic clime: Venice, Rome, Istanbul and Saint-Tropez.\nThen, with a loud strike of the station clock and a sharp blow of the station master’s whistle, a procession of 80 models steamed onto the runway, unveiling a collection that crossed multiple historical and geographical boundaries, with one common value: Comfort. See, for example, waxed jackets with pockets and flared pants inspired by vintage workmen’s uniforms, and hooded trench coats paired with white Victoriana blouses or bows.\nThere were plenty of signature Chanel tweeds on display, atop chiffon vests embroidered with flowers or sequin bustiers (and occasionally some rather dubious flared leather shorts). To close, there was a series of breezy evening sheath dresses in graphic pastel prints or delicate lace.\nIt was a pretty show, with some new lightness, though predominantly a loyal continuation of legacy. When Viard appeared to take her bow, her eyes were filled with tears. Sometimes, even when one is determined to look to the future, it can be hard to resist a fleeting glance back.\n(Text by\xa0Elizabeth Paton c.2019 New York Times)\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Second-hand luxury: The shift to vintage and pre-loved is now in full swing
  </h1>, 'text': 'The word luxury comes from the Latin for excess. That is appropriate for an industry which depends on replacing clothes, shoes and bags before they have worn out. But thrift is emerging. The second-hand market for personal luxury goods has grown nine per cent per year since 2015, says consultancy Bain. It now accounts for eight per cent of a €260 billion (almost S$400 billion) luxury market. That creates opportunities, as well as threats.\n\n\nFirst, the risks. The growth of a second-hand market can cannibalise sales of new goods. It also makes them less exclusive, eroding their desirability. There are concerns about cheap knock-offs. French luxury company Chanel has launched lawsuits against online platforms it says are selling counterfeit handbags. The growth of the resale market poses a particular challenge to makers of watches. With jewellery, it makes up about 80 per cent of the global luxury resale market.\nBut taking control of pre-owned platforms can help brands protect their reputation. Last June Richemont of Switzerland bought Watchfinder, a UK online marketplace for luxury watches. As with cars and even bonds, a thriving second-hand market can reassure buyers that an expensive purchase will maintain much of its value.\n\n\nIt can also excite collectors. Take the US$1 billion (S$1.36 billion) trainer or sneaker resale market. In February, US sporting goods retailer Foot Locker spent US$100 million on a minority stake in GOAT, a sports shoe marketplace. Another resale business Stadium Goods was bought by online fashion retailer Farfetch in December for US$250 million.\nGrowing second-hand sales may help assuage environmental concerns. Stella McCartney, a pioneer of “sustainable” fashion, and online reseller RealReal offer shoppers US$100 to spend on a new item when they trade in an old one. Funnelling money back to brands is good for business, as well as curbing the industry’s wasteful ways.\n© The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      How to have fun with traditional attire using modern prints and colours
  </h1>, 'text': 'Haslinah Hasim is the very picture of a modern Muslim woman: Confident and strong.\nA senior manager in an events and exhibitions company, Lynn, as her friends call her, came back several months ago after being based in the Middle East for seven years, working in Dubai and Bahrain.\nOne of the many perks she enjoyed while working in Dubai, she recalled, was “the luxury of having my own transportation – my car was my walking wardrobe! I had abayas, heels, safety boots and what-not in there to get from one setting to another.”\nThese days, Lynn’s re-adjusting to the Singapore way of life – and its ultra humid and hot weather. Which means she’s also finding out that she needs to be more flexible and mobile when it comes to choosing her outfits for work.\nWhile Lynn still enjoys wearing her abayas and skirts, she’s also looking for a new look that affords her the freedom of movement and flexibility, while being easy-care.\n“I usually have to run after the bus in the mornings but running in abayas is not proper,” she said. “I have to be demure. To me, when you wear an abaya, it makes you feel like a woman, it makes you feel elegant, be it for just a normal social context or a formal setting. Once you put it on, the brain goes like, ‘Okay, you need to be demure and elegant’.”\nHer job easily takes her from meetings to an exhibition construction site in a day. “I’m more dressed up when it comes to meetings,” she said, adding that she favours simple outfits in dark colours. “If I’m onsite, I wear mostly sportswear, which is less of a hassle because I need to put on a hard hat, safety boots and a vest.""\nHer go-to outfits comprise A-cut long skirts and flared tops and bottoms, worn with a tudung. Though black is her preferred colour for work, she wears some blues and greens during the weekend.\nIt was her friend Andy who convinced her to sign up for the Style Switch makeover because, “he got bored with me wearing black and jeans most of the time in Dubai,” she said. “He felt I needed to learn new hijab styles and change my wardrobe to suit local trends more,” she said.\nAt the same time, she’s personally keen to learn more about styling to fend off the fashion police. “I’ve always been a black, blue, brown kind of person, so I’d like to learn how to mix colours and prints. I’d like to have more colour in my life,” she added.\nEnter style expert Yang Derong, who plans to give Lynn a more modern Muslim wardrobe.\n“I want it to look not so traditional, yet still conforming to Lynn’s religion and tradition,” he said, adding: “She’s truly a modern Muslim girl and willing to try new things. And she’s in event management, which is a perfect job for you to wear what you want.”\nDerong first dressed Lynn in a sporty ensemble, pairing stretchy pants with a lightweight parka. He also picked out a lively blue and white patterned headscarf to complete the look.\n“This is a great outfit, especially for times when I need to just grab and go,” said Lynn. “It works well for onsite inspections which require me to be in personal protective equipment (PPE), meaning I need to be wearing my hard hat, safety vest and safety shoes. This look really fits nicely into the on-site activity I need to do.”\n\n\nLynn’s favourite outfit is a long shirt-dress of clashing black and white prints, which she wears over a long black T-shirt and leggings. Derong then pushed the envelope with a striking red turban in place of a headscarf, matched with a shiny red handbag.\n“This outfit really teaches me how to mix prints, which is something that I have never done in my whole life. The turban is also something I’ve never tried.”\nThe shirt-dress was a big hit with her. “It’s very comfortable because of the baggy cut – it’s perfect for the office as well as a night out with friends,” she said, adding that she enjoyed how red was used for a touch of boldness.\nFor the final outfit, Derong offered a departure from Lynn’s usual silhouette: A black polka-dot dress with a waistline, worn over tights and classy pumps. “It’s tailored, not her usual kaftan-type dress or baju,” he said of the dress.\nThis choice wasn’t as much of a natural fit for Lynn, though. “I love the fact that the bottom of this reminds me of my abaya days in Dubai. However, the material is a bit thick so it doesn’t really suit my daily routine,” she explained. “It could be something I wear to attend a function in a hotel.”\nThe capsule collection of prints and colours, as well as different styles of headscarves, was a way of rethinking Muslim dressing, said Derong.\nWhile Muslim women must be covered up, there\'s a lot of room for creativity and style when one plays with prints, he said. “Lynn has good dress sense. She says that people tell her not to wear prints, but I say wear it! She looks confident and happy in the outfits we picked for her – they work well on her.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The high-tech Singapore tailor who'll drive their 3D body scanner to your car park
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’re looking to update your office wardrobe but aren’t in the mood to step out of the house, a tailor is usually a phone call away.\nNot every tailor, however, can bring their store to you – especially if it’s in a bus that has been kitted with a walk-in wardrobe, flashing LED lights and some Tony Stark-level 3D scanning technology.\nLast month, the Singapore mobile tailor company A Gentleman’s Tale unveiled its mobile showroom bus, a customised Mercedes Sprinter van that doubles up as an actual fitting room.\nIt’s the latest innovation from a company that’s been continuously taking its mobile tailoring services to the next level since it began in 2015.\n“We started using public transport four years ago – we’d carry our backpacks and luggage into MRTs or buses, and squeeze among commuters going around Singapore,” recalled Kenneth Chia, who co-founded the company with Lyn Chan.\nA year later, the couple bought a small van and customised it with a pop-up changing room, some shelving units and a place to do a bit of office work. A container van office for those who were fine with travelling to their River Valley office followed soon after. But these weren’t enough – they wanted something bigger.\n“It started with crazy idea – why don’t we get a bus where someone is able to stand inside and we can do measurements and fittings like how we do it in a shop?” said Chia, 35, adding that around that time, they also chanced upon a company that was bringing in some 3D scanners and they signed up to get one.\n3D BODY SCANNING EXPLAINED\nSo how does it work? Customers make an appointment and they’ll drive over to your place, where they’ll talk you through the choices of fabrics and the designs of the outfit. After which comes the fun part: 3D body scanning.\nThe service is located at the back of the bus. Male and female customers up to a height of 1.85m stand in the middle as they’re scanned using infrared light from sensors located at the corners of the space. The scanner measures 127 points of the body, which is then translated into a computer rendering that can be instantly seen on an iPad. The entire process takes all of two seconds.\nAccording to Chia, accuracy is at 98 per cent. “But it’s based on wearing as little clothes as possible – if you’re wearing baggy clothes, the scanner will scan that, so you’ll need to wear form-fitting clothes,” he said. Stripping to your undies will produce the best results – and don’t worry, the space has curtains to provide privacy.\n3D scanning helps to immediately see things invisible to the naked eye, they said, and is much faster and accurate. That said, Chan also pointed out that there are also advantages to having your measurements done by an actual person.\n“With a tailor’s experience, we can give some allowance suitable for one’s body shape and lifestyle – say a teacher who moves his or her arms a lot when they talk or young ones who work out and want something fitted,” she said.\nBut, let’s face it, feeling like you’re Iron Man getting suited up sounds more fun. “Most people do get thrilled by the idea of standing in front of a 3D scanner!” said Chan, 40.\nCheap thrills aside, the technology also addresses the issue of being measured by the opposite sex. “A female client might not be comfortable with me measuring her crotch area if Lyn is not around, so 3D scanning takes care of that,” said Chia.\nNEXT-LEVEL MOBILE TAILORING\nAll in all, the entire process from measurement to getting one’s suit, shirt, skirt or pants takes a total of 21 days, which includes a couple of trips for fittings.\xa0\nPrices start at S$600 for an entry-level suit or around S$130\xa0for a shirt or pants. For more expensive branded fabrics, be prepared to shell out S$1,000 for a suit or S$250 and S$350 for a shirt and pants, respectively. And as of now, the prices are the same whether you request for a bus house call or you drop by their premises.\nSince it’s still fairly new, the bus hasn’t been making its rounds apart from trial runs with friends. But Chan said they’ve signed an agreement with a company that manages around 35 condominiums, which will enable them to drop by these for starters. There are also plans of participating in pop-up events. “As long as the place has a loading bay or an open air car park, this bus can go,” added Chia.\nWhile it’s fairly new – they pointed out that their bus was the only one of its kind until one from China popped up last week – their high-tech approach to mobile tailoring is something they hope will eventually catch on.\nAccording to the co-founders, A Gentleman’s Tale’s majority of clients are working professionals between their late 20s to late 40s. A huge majority are men but more women are cottoning on to the idea (they’ve also got a sub-label called A Lady’s Tale).\n“It’s really about providing clients with a sense of convenience, so they don’t have to travel. And we do notice that four years ago, there weren’t that many mobile tailors around. But these days there are a lot – even if they don’t use a van or bus fitted for the actual purpose,” said Chan.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Why selling your unused fashion items can be good for the environment
  </h1>, 'text': ""Take a long hard look at your wardrobe and ask yourself this: When was the last time you felt like you had absolutely nothing to wear even though the overflowing racks of clothing and surplus of shoes and bags tell you otherwise?\nInspired by modern day buying behaviours and a keen interest in re-joining the fashion industry after the birth of her children, Moizant banded together with five friends of hers to create a company that provided a sustainable way to consume fashion. While there’s been an encouraging growth in attitudes towards sustainability of late (both from brands as well as customers),\xa0Vestiaire Collective\xa0has been championing this movement for a decade since their inception in 2009. And with a\xa0recent report in March 2019\xa0from retail analytics firm\xa0GlobalData\xa0predicting that the second-hand economy – valued at US$24 billion (S$32.7 billion) as of 2018 – will surpass fast fashion retailers by 1.5 times within the next 10 years, it seems like Moizant was on the right track all long.\n\n\nIn town to launch the site’s VIP Concierge Service in Singapore, we speak to Moizant on the challenges of the luxury resale market as well as consumer’s changing attitudes towards sustainability in fashion. \xa0\nWHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO START VESTAIRE COLLECTIVE?About 10 years ago, I came across an article in the French press about the “Recessionistas”, a group of women who were trying to resell their pre-loved items in the heart of the recession on their blogs. I thought this was an interesting phenomenon and had actually wanted to buy from them but it was very inefficient. You had to be the first to email them, reserve an item, and then send a cheque in the mail – I just didn’t have time for that. I thought it was a cool idea and the future of shopping, but because it was so inconvenient it was never going to take off. I was inspired to do something similar but on a wider scale and platform.\nAS THE SECOND-HAND MARKET WAS ALREADY PRETTY PREVALENT IN PARIS, HOW DID YOU TRY TO SET YOURSELF APART FROM THOSE BUSINESSES?We didn’t invent the second-hand market but we disrupted it. We brought trust because we were able to authenticate the items. Back then if you bought something from a site like Ebay there was no way of verifying its authenticity. If you went to a second-hand store, sometimes the items are not in the best condition. The shops were also very local to the market, and if you don’t live in the area you’re less likely to shop there.\xa0We wanted to elevate the way people shopped and help globalise the market.\n“We didn’t invent the second-hand market but we disrupted it.” – Fanny Moizant\nHOW DO YOU UPKEEP THE QUALITY CONTROL OF THE ITEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE SELLING?\nAuthentication is the pillar of the brand, and we have always put a lot of emphasis on this. In 2012, we signed a charter with the French government and luxury houses to ensure that we work behind the scenes with the brands to receive the proper training [on how to authenticate luxury goods] and have our questions answered. This charter is all about fighting counterfeits. The brands know it's\xa0a problem and that it's better to partner with companies like us to control what we put online, rather than people who don’t care and offload tons of counterfeit products.\xa0We are very\xa0committed to this cause.\xa0\n\n\nDOES EVERYONE IN THE COMPANY GO THROUGH RIGOROUS TRAINING?Yes. We have the Vestiaire Academy where we document all of our knowledge. Our new experts are trained at the Academy followed by a partnership with a senior expert for at least six months before they are allowed to work autonomously.\xa0But even before this extensive training, we ensure the people we hire have the right background and experience. They’ve either worked in luxury brands or are experts in the field. One of our authenticators even came from an auction house. These people all have some form of exposure already and we elevate them to the next level.\nYOU LAUNCHED THE VIP CONCIERGE SERVICE IN APRIL 2019, COULD YOU ELABORATE MORE ON THIS AND HOW TO QUALIFY FOR THE SERVICE?We opened the service last year in Hong Kong and the demand was so high that we now have a waiting list there. It is very popular because of the convenience. The VIP team will facilitate our customers by personally attending to them and handling all manners of the sale from collection, photography, listing and shipping.\nTo qualify for the service, you'll need to have a very desirable wardrobe with a minimum of 10 items – each with a retail value of at least US$500. As our VIP team for Asia is based in Hong Kong, they will fly into Singapore every other month to attend to our customers.\n“Unlike our parents' and grandparents' time, we don’t possess things for a lifetime anymore. We keep them for a short while and then move on to something new.” – Fanny Moizant\nAS OF 2018, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE RESALE MARKET IS PROJECTED TO GROW MUCH FASTER THAN THE FAST FASHION MARKET. WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT CUSTOMERS’ MINDSETS TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY?It tells us that the customer has definitely changed. The mindset is leaning towards buying quality stuff and the end of ownership as we know it. Unlike our parents' and grandparents' time, we don’t possess things for a lifetime anymore. We keep them for a short while and then move on to something new.\nWith social media, it’s fuelled the industry into producing things much faster. When I was younger, there used to be only two seasons per year. Now there’s drops in between seasons, resort/cruise and capsule collections. I think the consumer is drawn by novelties and would buy things for just one specific event and then never wear it again.\nThis is not super sustainable, but a business like us exists because of that type of behaviour so it’s about learning how to give a longer lifetime to your product and to embrace more sustainable fashion consumption.\nWAS SUSTAINABILITY A CORE VALUE OF YOUR COMPANY WHEN YOU STARTED?The core of our business is about how we can prevent waste in fashion. We grew up with parents telling us not to be wasteful, to conserve energy when possible, and naturally, I applied it to fashion. We didn’t want to push it in people’s faces that we are all about sustainability especially when people weren’t ready for it yet.\xa0Now that the mentality has changed, people are more receptive. It’s not going to change the world but it does help your carbon footprint and the massive pollution problem in the fashion industry.\nIS THE GROWING RECEPTION TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY SOMETHING YOU FORESAW WHEN YOU STARTED THE COMPANY?Yes, because when you see the shopping patterns, it’s a trend that’s very fascinating. In the past 10 years, fashion consumers are buying twice as more products and yet we are using 40 per cent less of what we buy. This is by essence not sustainable, so at some point it was going to come crashing down. We had the belief that we had to do something early to change the system for the better.\nVestiaire Collective recently launched a “Buy, Sell, Share, Care” guide on sustainable 'circular fashion'.

      Wasted money on clothes that don't fit once you're home? Here's why that happens
  </h1>, 'text': ""To most people, trying on clothes is a simple, straightforward task – and it should be, provided you know exactly how to check a garment’s fit to ensure your money's not being squandered.\nThere’s nothing wrong if your main aim is to get in and out of the fitting room in five minutes flat but it certainly pays to do a few more essential checks while you’re in there.\nDon’t just assess the fit of the clothes while you’re standing still, because, well, we don’t stand still all day long. All too often, we forget that our clothing needs to accommodate our movements so that they’re functional and comfortable while being able to fulfil our aesthetic requirements too. You don't want your shirt button to pop when you sit down, do you?\nHere are a few moves you can use to get the most accurate feel of the fit a garment will give you.\nWALK AROUND\nTwist around and walk about (go outside the room if you need more space) –\xa0this will give you a better idea of how the clothes will fit and move as you’re going about your day.\nYou'll also get to use the mirrors out there in the aisle, which are likely to be bigger and will provide you with a clearer view. Doing that allows you to check out how the outfit looks in a different lighting, too.\nWhile you’re at it, look out for another clothing peeve: Fabrics that make a lot of noise when they rub together as you’re walking. Nobody needs to hear you before they see you.\nSIT DOWN\nThe stool in the fitting room isn’t just meant for your bags – it comes in useful for checking how clothing fits too. Many types of garments seem to fit okay while you are standing but suddenly feel like a boa constrictor around your torso the moment you take a seat.\nSit down to properly check the fit of clothes like high-waist pants and skirts (if the high waist moves any higher), tight skirts (to see how high it rides up), fitted button-down shirts (check if the fabric puckering isn’t borderline indecent) and figure-hugging dresses (if anything is spilling out – arm pits, back fat and muffin top).\xa0\nBEND OVER\nRemember when Lululemon recalled its too-sheer yoga pants some time ago? Well, we’ve seen women wearing (unknowingly, we hope) translucent workout tights by other brands too. Give yoga pants the bend-over test\xa0in the fitting room – touch your toes, do some squats – and see if your bum or underwear is showing through.\nHUG YOURSELF\nDon’t ever buy a fitted jacket or shirt without doing this classic test for a good shoulder fit. You might like how a snug fit looks on you while you are standing still, but move your arms about and you could risk bursting a seam.\nBlazers and shirts are typically made out of fabrics with not much give – so if you can wrap your arms around yourself while wearing them, they should\xa0provide enough room for you to move about comfortably.\n\n\nLEAN FORWARD\nWhen trying on a bra, that is. Make sure the underwire is properly under the boobs and flat against your torso, then lean forward so that the girls are fully settled in the cups. This allows for the most accurate fit since all the bits around your bust (flesh around the back and under the arms) that can affect your bra size are accounted for within the cups.\nWear a lightweight top over the bra to check for a seamless fit. If the bra puckers or shows through the blouse then you’re better off without it.\nWhile we're at it, always remember to road-testing a\xa0low-cut neckline by bending forward and then peering down at yourself. If everything is out on display and doesn’t pass the decency test then it probably isn’t a good idea.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Tom Ford: Portrait of a perfectionist, anal-retentive, painfully shy vegan designer
  </h1>, 'text': 'Tom Ford has come early to rearrange the furniture. He thinks that the already stylish room in the hottest new private club in town, the San Vicente Bungalows, could be even more captivating. So a team of eight club staff members gets busy under his direction, pulling a potted plant from the terrace for one corner and setting up two dozen glowing amber votive candles.\nFord himself redoes the white flowers, plucking out the roses and leaving in the ranunculus, because he doesn’t like mixed blooms. The Murphy bed he can do nothing about.\nAs I enter, the designer is lost in thought, still fantasising about redoing the room in his own preferred palette, draping chocolate brown velvet on the walls.\nEverything in life can always be more sensual and beautiful, if you think about it. And Ford is always thinking about it. From the time he was big enough to push furniture, at six years old, he was rearranging it in his house. And giving his mother critiques on her hair and shoes.\nBeing Tom Ford is awful, in a way. He always sees what’s wrong. And you can’t help but feel bad for him because you know his flawless flaw detector is always on. “I am a hyper-hyper Virgo,” he said. “Perfectionist, anal-retentive, supposedly. Seemingly uptight, seemingly aloof. We’re definitely homebodies also. We love the home.” (Or in his case, six.)\n\n\nFord has been known to go to a movie in the middle of the day wearing a suit, and to make hospital corners with other people’s slipcovers. “He’s not afraid to say you need to cut three inches off your hair or lose weight,” said actress Rita Wilson, a friend. Even on vacations in the tropics or river rafting, she added, Ford looks eerily perfect. He used to tailor white T-shirts he bought at La Rinascente in Milan, but now he wears his own brand. “The cut of the sleeve has to be just right if you want your biceps to look right,” he said. In 2003, as the creative director of Gucci, he shaved a “G” in a model’s pubic hair for an ad, adding definition with an eyebrow pencil.\nLisa Eisner, who has done jewellery collaborations with Ford and inspired the Alessia character in his 2016 film, Nocturnal Animals, said he didn’t expect everyone to be as persnickety as he is. “At Graydon Carter’s wedding, I drank way too much and ran out to go to the bathroom and got sick on his shoes – really good Tom Ford shoes,” she recalled. “He just laughed and wiped it off.”\nAnd his friends praise his fierce loyalty. Wilson recalled that after her breast cancer diagnosis in 2015, when she had to present at the Tonys feeling vulnerable because “you have had part of your body removed,” Ford designed her a beautiful dress to wear that “made my shape look like a normal shape – and he did it with such sensitivity, generosity and love.”\n“I am a hyper-hyper Virgo. Perfectionist, anal-retentive, supposedly.” – Tom Ford\nFord did not check his phone during the three hours we spent together. He has perfect posture and lovely Southern manners and stands up when you return to the table from the bathroom. His voice, as one fan wrote in a YouTube comment, sounds like what melted chocolate tastes like.\nAdmiring the votives’ golden aura, I confessed that I’m obsessed with lighting and have been known to unscrew bulbs in restaurant booths or flip switches at parties. “Oh, I do that,” Ford said. “At Tower Bar, if you go to my table, the corner table at the back, there are these overhead spots and on mine it’s blacked out, because I told them, ‘You have to get rid of that spot or I’m not going to come here.’”\n‘PAINFULLY SHY’\nFord cloaks himself in black, planted a black garden in London of black tulips and black calla lilies, contemplates death constantly and plans on designing a black sarcophagus. He is 57 but for decades has not seemed to get any older. And he’s wearing Beau de Jour (one of 39 Tom Ford fragrances), a scent meant to evoke the allure of Cary Grant’s neck. I told him that all this makes him a member of my favourite cult: Sexy vampires.\nHis face lit up. “A vampire cape was one of the first things I got when I could tell my mother to make something for me, and it was black satin on the outside and red satin on the inside,” he said. “And I had the vampire teeth, and I had the LP with the music from Dark Shadows. I was obsessed, and I wanted to be a vampire because vampires are sexy. They don’t age. Talk about seductive. I’m not talking about Nosferatu, you know. But vampires were usually rich, they lived in a fabulous house or castle. Wore black. Vampires are great.”\nEisner demurred: “Tom smells too good to be a vampire.” She said that those who know Ford simply through the famous shots of him with naked models and actresses probably think he’s “a sex pervert, someone who thinks about sex 24/7. Nope, he’s not that guy at all. Very married.”\nRichard Buckley, Ford’s husband since 2013, a longtime fashion journalist with whom he had a coup de foudre during an elevator ride 32 years ago, confirmed that the facade of gleaming black lacquer is deceiving. “The one misconception I think most people have of Tom is that he is some kind of press whore who loves to have his picture taken,” he said. “He is, and always has been, painfully shy. He did acting when he was in his early 20s, so he is able to ‘turn on’ for interviews.”\nThe designer takes their six-year-old son Jack – who already prefers black despite drawers filled with colourful clothes – every day to school, where “the mothers have to see Tom Ford looking great at eight in the morning while they look like hell,” an amused Eisner noted.\nBuckley, 70, said dryly that their lives are not “all Champagne and caviar,” opening up about his nightmarish struggle with the after-effects of radiation for throat cancer for which he had surgery in 1989, three years after the men became involved.\n“Tom has seen me through so much, from throat cancer to my brother and mother dying 48 hours apart, to more bouts of pneumonia than I can count,” Buckley said. Ford made his husband grey merino wool turtleneck dickeys with keyhole slits for his tracheotomy tube, and, for formal events, a black silk scarf with slits. “Tom is actually quite good at sewing,” Buckley said. (These days, a designer need not be.)\n“The one misconception I think most people have of Tom is that he is some kind of press whore who loves to have his picture taken. He is, and always has been, painfully shy.” – Richard Buckley\nRecently, it was announced that Ford will succeed von Furstenberg as the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, a job he was persuaded to take by her and Anna Wintour.\n“He’s a cross between a Rolls-Royce and the Marlboro Man,” von Furstenberg told me. At a time when Donald Trump’s America is turning away from the rest of the world, Ford, who has spent half his life working and studying in Europe, says he will reach out because “if American fashion is going to flourish, it has got to drop the idea that it’s American fashion and become global.”\n“It’s a turbulent time in some ways for fashion, which has been rightly criticised for its lack of inclusivity, for not having enough women in CEO positions,” Wintour said. “These are things Tom cares about.” Indeed, back in the Gucci days, Ford was one of the first designers to prominently feature African-American and Asian models on the runway and in ad campaigns.\nVirgil Abloh, creator of Off-White and artistic director of menswear at Louis Vuitton, said that, at the CFDA, Ford will not be “just a puppet of the industry going with the flow. He has rigour in his work and his personality, and he will bring challenging ideas.” Abloh added that Ford’s provocative Gucci ads inspired him when he was a teenager in Illinois, into skateboarding, hip-hop and normcore. “I was an outsider,” he said, “and he made me believe in fashion.”\n\n\nWARHOL NIGHTS\nWomen’s Wear Daily sleuthed out the news that Ford was the buyer, for US$18 million (S$24.5 million), of the Paul Rudolph modernist four-story town house on 63rd Street in New York City where Halston once lived, hosting some of the wildest parties of the 1970s (Ford’s favourite decade) for glitterati like Truman Capote, Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Liza Minnelli.\nIn Los Angeles, Ford lives in a US$39 million Holmby Hills mansion that is a study in black and white, complete with a Scottish butler named Angus. He also has property in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where his family moved when he was 11, including a US$75 million ranch, which he’s selling, that includes a Western movie town used to shoot Cowboys and Aliens and All the Pretty Horses. But “I’ve kind of lived in that house in my mind for many years,” Ford said of the Rudolph place. “It has dark brown glass, it has a garage, it has a legal curb cut.” There are 32-foot-high (9.75m) ceilings, skylights galore and a roof garden. And while he loves Los Angeles, he said, “I do want Jack to know how to put on a jacket, go to a restaurant, go to a museum, walk on the street, go to a play.”\nFord recalled the night when he was studying art history in his freshman dorm room at New York University, feeling disoriented. “I just said, ‘Oh my God, please, please, please let something happen to me.’ Knock, knock, knock. I went to the door, and there was Ian Falconer, this guy from art history class, in a little blue blazer, and he said, ‘Do you want to go to Studio?’ And I said, ‘Are you kidding me, Studio 54?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I’m going with some friends.’”\nOne was Andy Warhol, who picked them up in a Cadillac limousine. “It was literally like a movie; everyone got pushed aside, and we walked right in the door. ‘Oh my God, here I am, Studio 54 for the very first time’ and I drank a lot.”\nEven back then, he always visualised the sort of cinematic life he has now, with several Warhols on the wall, including a triptych of vulvas and a “Big Electric Chair.” He has sold a fright-wig self-portrait of the artist at Sotheby’s for US$32.6 million to pay for his stores in China.\nThat night at Studio 54 was the first night he ended up with a man, and it “freaked” him out. “And I said to him, ‘This was great. but this isn’t really what I do or who I am,’ and I went back to my dorm room. I suppose I struggled with it for maybe six months. Maybe it was coming from my family background in Texas where, you know, guys are guys. I was nervous about telling my parents, but they’re liberal Democrats who met at the University of Texas, and it was pre-AIDS, and they were totally cool with it.” (His parents were real estate agents.)\n“And I learned later on that it was a plus because people thought if you weren’t gay, you couldn’t possibly be a good designer.”\n‘I NEED MY ARMOUR’\nTom Ford is elegantly dressed, naturally, all in Tom Ford: A black double 002 watch with a removable woven leather band; a white cotton French cuff shirt (“because it’s one of the only things a man can have, a pair of cuff links”); trousers, plain-weave; the black velvet peak lapel jacket favoured by Hollywood moguls; and a pair of black cap-toe Chelsea boots.\n“I don’t feel secure in a slip-on or a tennis shoe,” he said. “I think it’s the Texan in me. I could never go to a business meeting in a tennis shoe. You feel soft, bouncy, not in control. I don’t feel good in sweaters either, when I’m out. I feel soft and mushy and vulnerable. I need my armour.”\nWhat about that time in St Barts when he was nude on the beach and Wintour happened to walk by? A talented mimic, Ford described the awkward moment: “‘Hi, Richard. Hi, Tom.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, hi, Anna!’ Oh, I’m naked! It was a wake-up call.”\n(When I asked Wintour about it, she answered breezily: “Everyone was naked in St Barts in those days. And if it happened, I’m sure Tom looked as perfect as he always does.”)\n“I don’t feel secure in a slip-on or a tennis shoe. I think it’s the Texan in me. I could never go to a business meeting in a tennis shoe. You feel soft, bouncy, not in control. I don’t feel good in sweaters either, when I’m out. I feel soft and mushy and vulnerable. I need my armour.” – Tom Ford\nHe was drinking a Coke with his grilled artichoke and cauliflower steak, having become vegan, allowing himself the occasional piece of salmon, after watching the documentary What the Health. He cheats with baked goods, jelly beans, Starbursts and Skittles. “Sugar is my weakness,” he said. He weighs himself daily, holding at 165 pounds (74.8kg), and hasn’t had a drink for 10 years.\n“For several years leading up to stopping drinking – because I drank a lot – on the mornings after, I would have to send flowers to this one and flowers to that one and, ‘Oh, I can’t believe I did that’ and ‘I can’t believe I said that,’ and I told Richard for at least a year, ‘Oh my God, I wish I could just not drink at all.’\nWhen Ford moved to the land of green juice and kind bud, culture shock ensued. “I was at an afternoon party at a friend’s house, and Martin Short said to me, ‘Do you think you might have a drinking problem?’ Because it was lunch and I was just kicking back the vodka tonics, and I didn’t think anything of it. It was the first indication I had that, ‘Oh, maybe this isn’t normal.’” He worked with a therapist for a year, tapered off and then one weekend just stopped.\n‘AN UNSUSTAINABLE THING’\nFord said he feels enormous empathy for women who get frightened about their looks fading. “There’s nothing more powerful in our culture than a beautiful woman.” But “it’s an unsustainable thing. One day it stops. And I have lived through it with so many female friends, and part of my job is to imagine myself, the female version of myself, would I want to wear that? Where would I go in it? How would I feel in it?”\nHe confessed that his hair “is a little more salt and pepper than it looks. I mean, Diana Vreeland stayed with black hair all the way until the end. And I’ve been open about using Botox and fillers, although I can move. You have to be very careful with it. I do it about once every eight months. When I go to the dermatologist, I get a hand mirror, I take a white pencil, and I say, ‘Right there.’ If I could do it myself, I would.”\nNow that he is a parent (and no longer walking naked around the house, as he once did), does he feel the need to tone down the sexuality of his fashion ads?\n“Oh, yes, absolutely,” he said, adding that it may also be because of “the hyper-politically correct culture. I mean, you can’t say anything anymore. I was shooting an ad campaign last week, and the guy came up behind the girl and was kissing her on the neck, and he was holding her wrists from the back and I said, ‘No, no, we have to change that. Put his hand in her hand.’ I don’t know that any of us will survive this scrutiny.”\nHis friend and collaborator, photographer Terry Richardson, was banned from Conde Nast and several fashion houses as part of a wave of #MeToo accusations. “Ugh! I love Terry,” he said. “And I have to say that I never in my entire life saw any of that with Terry. One of my assistants went out with Terry for two years, and he was the kindest, gentlest person in the relationship.”\nI wondered about the fracases over cultural appropriation. “Two shows ago, I showed the girls with scarves on their head, which were not durags, and that was not where that idea came from,” he said, adding that it came from the 70s, which I know to be true, because I wore them in college. “And a couple of people wrote that it was durags and appropriation. Well, first of all, if you’re appropriating something, why isn’t that great? You’re celebrating it.”\nAfter we split a lemon meringue pie, the designer dropped me at my hotel in his chauffeured Range Rover. The next day I flew home. On the plane, I saw a picture of Priyanka Chopra on Page Six, the gossip section of The New York Post. She was wearing the same Tom Ford red ruched tulle dress that I wore for the interview. With horror, I realised that I had been wearing my velvet corset belt backward all night, with the hooks behind and laces in front.\nFord was too polite to mention it.\nBy Maureen Dowd © The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ', '     Profiles ', '     Men ']}"

      Taking this creative mind out of T-shirts and slippers to match his career
  </h1>, 'text': 'The first thing anyone notices when they catch sight of Visakan Veerasamy is his height. He stands at a towering 1.95m. The next thing – before the makeover – is his substantial facial scruff.\nVisa, as he likes to be called, is a man of many talents: Entrepreneur and consultant, writer, T-shirt maker… Basically, a bundle of non-stop creative energy.\n“I want an image that gets up to speed with my career,” said Visa. “I want my look to represent my identity – I feel dressed down all the time, and I’d like to be more proactive in managing my image. People say they’re used to me not dressing up.”\nVisa got into the habit of wearing Bermuda and T-shirts with slippers everywhere because of his previous job at a tech startup.\n“It was super liberal; super anything goes. So I would basically dress in T-shirt, shorts and slippers all the time,” he explained. “It came to the point where there would be nothing else in my wardrobe.”\n“I had some shirts and pants and shoes… from 2012 maybe, and by 2015, I would fly into a panic if I had to attend wedding. Of the three shirts I owned, two would fit horribly, and I’d be forced to wear the third.”\n“I also found that sometimes when the occasion called for dressing up, I’d feel a bit out of place, a bit disappointed. When you don’t have clothes to wear for certain kinds of occasions, you subconsciously avoid those occasions.”\n“I’m tired of that – I want to feel like I can just go for anything and be anywhere, but I feel like my current wardrobe doesn’t adequately empower me to do that.”\nVisa shared having problems finding off-the-rack shirts that fit him properly – when the sleeves fit, the body would be too baggy; when it fits across his chest, the shirt length would be too short.\nSimilarly for pants: He only has one pair of jeans. “I think it’s fair to say I have never in my life worn a shirt and pants that fit me properly. It’s pretty sad, but it’s true. It’s a life of a misfit – literally.""\n\n\n“I never had an option to blend in,” he added. “With my height, I was prominent. Plus I was the class clown as a kid, and I was good – still am – at public speaking. Whether I’m in a classroom or I’m at work or just hanging out, people are going to see me differently from everybody else, so I feel like there’s not much point trying to be understated.\nHe said: ‘If people are going to look at you, you might as well give them something to look at. So, I want to do more bold prints and colours, partly for me to feel like I’m confident and comfortable in the way I present myself.”\nStylist Yang Derong saw Visa’s height as a great asset. “Enjoy your height and your personality!” he said. “You are part of the hip set – dress cool and happy.”\nPants are not a problem, according to Derong. “It’s fine for Visa to wear pants that are shorter, that end above the ankle,” he said. “He can even roll up the pants and wear boots, or long socks with shoes or trainers.”\nDerong updated Visa’s “uniform” with a pair of black and white checkered pants that end above the ankle, pairing them with boots and a striped T-shirt. Rolling up the cuffs of the pants as well as the sleeves of the T-shirt give him a rebel feel, he explained.\n“For meetings, he can just throw a jacket over it. It doesn’t have to be a tailored jacket – a tailored hoodie looks good on him and adds a pop of colour.”\nVisa was surprised and pleased at the choice of outfits – cleverly styled, they worked beautifully on his frame.\n“I really like the prints. I feel like it’s really bold and it feels very assertive, very strong and artistic. I would never have thought to wear pants like these – it’s actually nice, comfortable, it doesn’t feel too formal nor informal. I like it a lot.”\nThe grooming team also got to work on him. Visa was clear from the start that he was very attached to his facial hair and wanted to keep it. “We spruced and tightened him up,” said Derong. “We trimmed him down, both hair and beard. He was totally cool with it.”\nDerong admitted that for guys like Visa, who are extraordinarily tall, “it’s not the easiest thing in the world for them to find clothes to wear.""\n""But when they find something that they like and the length is not quite right or the sleeves are too long or the collar fits but the rest of the body doesn’t fit – that is where we have to go in and do some stylistic adjustment,"" he said. ""Look for things you can roll up, things you can tuck away, things you cheat with a little and get away with looking really good!”\n\n\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Leggings in a post-#MeToo world: Are they symbols of seduction or freedom?
  </h1>, 'text': 'When did leggings make the leap from garment to cultural lightning rod? For what are essentially stretchy footless tights in a seemingly endless array of patterns and colours, they have been an unexpected source of controversy.\nRecently in Indiana, the US, Maryann White, the mother of four sons, wrote a letter to The Observer, the school newspaper for both the University of Notre Dame and the nearby women’s college St. Mary’s, asking female students to ignore fashion and stop wearing leggings. It was for their own as well as the greater good, she suggested, in part because leggings made it hard for men to control themselves.\nThe you-wear-it/you’re-asking-for-it implication of the letter, not to mention the sheer idea of censoring clothing, set off the predictable firestorm of protest, both on campus and off. For two days students wore leggings in a show of group defiance, there was a #leggingsdayND hashtag on Twitter, and assorted men and women posted pictures of themselves in solidarity with leggings wearers.\nBy the end of the week, The Observer had another piece, this one from the editors in response to the furore. It said: “Having received over 35 letters to The Observer, in addition to the countless verbal comments, tweets, memes and class discussions about Monday’s letter, we have been astonished by the conversations the leggings piece has sparked.” Meanwhile, those wider conversation continued over the weekend.\nThis follows a 2017 United Airlines incident when two teenagers who were “pass travellers” (a category that includes relatives of airline employees) were prevented from flying because they were wearing leggings. Observers complained, social media got up in arms, and the makers of leggings had a field day; Puma, for example, jumped into the fray and burnished its image by offering a 20 percent discount on leggings to anyone presenting a United ticket.\nAnd that in turn punctuated the endless debate among parents and schools and students that can be summed up as “leggings-are-not-pants/yes-they-are.”\nIn general this existential interrogation of the soul of a garment (because, really, that’s what it is) centres on women, women’s bodies and the general discomfort with seeing too much of them, or believing you are.\nThat’s certainly where White was going with her letter, and it’s generally the political offence used by those who are on the pro-leggings side: How dare you accuse me of dressing to seduce (an argument that has particular resonance in the era after #MeToo).\nBut leggings began their rise to wardrobe domination with the advent of comfort culture: The post-casual Friday turn-of-the-millennium move away from formality that picked up steam with the rise of fleece-wearing hedge funders, the fall of Old Wall Street and the fetishisation of Silicon Valley’s hoodies- and Teva-clad geniuses, and became even more pronounced under the influence of the Wellness movement.\nThe post-casual Friday turn-of-the-millennium move away from formality that picked up steam with the rise of fleece-wearing hedge funders, the fall of Old Wall Street and the fetishisation of Silicon Valley’s hoodies- and Teva-clad geniuses, and became even more pronounced under the influence of the Wellness movement.\nLeggings also function differently for different age groups: For Gen Y, they tend to be lifestyle signifiers that have more to do with health and activity than, say, everyday workwear; for Gen Z-ers, who largely reject uniformity and traditional labels, they are simply a basic, the equivalent of jeans. They are something you put on without thought.\nWhich is to say, leggings are about a lot of things, and sex may be the least of them – if sex plays any role at all.\nOne thing that was striking about the Notre Dame protest was the rejection of what they saw as the traditional gender assumptions involved. Leggings are not the sole province of the siren female was the idea.\nIn their editorial, The Observer’s writers asked, “Why has the legging controversy generated a larger impact than other controversial topics? Students and community members have spent hours debating the merits and faults of a popular clothing choice. But where is the willingness to speak up about other issues with substantial policy implications, legally and on campus?”\nThe truth is, it’s possible leggings may be simply standing in for those other issues. One of the great gotchas of fashion is that what may appear superficial or unimportant (leggings!) is, in fact, representative of a more complicated, harder to express reality (identity). This is what gives clothes their power.\nAs a result, what the leggings uproar may have exposed is not so much anyone’s physique per se but rather a cultural fault line that runs through generations. This historical pattern includes miniskirts and jeans, Mary Quant and James Dean, and garments that seemed egregious and inexplicable to what is generally referred to as the establishment but play a key and highly visual role in upending norms to make way for the next.\nSure, it’s possible that is overstating the matter. It’s possible they are just stretchy footless tights that are easy to wear.\nBut judging by Lululemon’s recent results, which saw net revenue rise 21 percent in the third quarter of 2018, and the fact that part of Levi’s much-heralded IPO was attributed to the “stretch” now included in jeans to cater to the leggings market, this “popular clothing choice” (as The Observer labelled it) is not going away any time soon. All this suggests that the Notre Dame uproar may not be a fluke but a harbinger.\nFor Gen Y, leggings tend to be lifestyle signifiers that have more to do with health and activity than, say, everyday workwear; for Gen Z-ers, who largely reject uniformity and traditional labels, they are simply a basic, the equivalent of jeans.\nBy Vanessa Friedman © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     women ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Loosen up and go soft: Menswear heads in a decidedly slinky direction
  </h1>, 'text': 'With role models such as rappers, DJs, start-up upstarts, celebrity chefs, hipster mixologists, YouTubers and digital nomads leading the pack, the modern male no longer needs to – or perhaps wants to – be a neck-tied, office-bound cubicle beaver gnawing his way towards the C-Suite.\nCorrespondingly, the idea of what constitutes a well-dressed male has moved beyond the corporate raider in a sharp suit, to the louche lad who appears to conduct his daily business anywhere and everywhere – except in the boardroom.\n\n\nThat’s probably why, according to market research firm Euromonitor, sales of men’s suits fell by S$953 million between 2012 and 2017 in western Europe. At the same time, men’s fashion is expected to outperform women’s between 2017 and 2022, with demand mainly coming from more casual clothing.\nYes, it seems traditional, stiff suiting fabrics are out of favour. In their place, something altogether, well, nontraditional.\nButtery soft, paper-thin leather, sheer fabric such as organza, sensuously slinky silk, and light-as-air knits. In pales or brights diametrically opposed to the old-school sober menswear palette of grey-navy-black, and even prints such as florals, and treatments such as embroidery, that are more associated with womenswear.\n\n\nIt’s been several years since Alessandro Michele took over the reins at Gucci and sent boys down the runway in chiffon, silk, lace, and floral prints, while Jonathon Anderson opted for silky tunics worn over matching pants, and blouses with scarf-like ties at the neckline.\nThis SS2019 season, it seems that top designers are gunning for more men to go soft – in the wardrobe department, that is.\nDIOR MEN \nFor his debut collection as Dior Men’s artistic director, Brit designer Kim Jones translated key elements from the house’s history in haute couture into menswear, choosing to describe it as “romantic”, rather than “feminine”.\nAs such, shades of rose pink and grey, long associated with the brand, appeared on soft suits; small feathered blooms inspired by brand founder Christian Dior’s patterned dinner plates appeared on jackets; toile de Jouy patterns akin to those that used to line the walls of the first Dior boutique, which opened \xa0in 1947, featured on sports jackets and baseball caps.\nA sports blouson and trouser combo came in sheer grey-and-white striped organza, while a weekend short in soft grey jacquard was paired with a sheer white burnout tee and an ethereal-looking organza bomber in off-white.\nWhile the eye-catching floral plastic trench and shirt might be a little hard to pull off, the trench would be well paired with a grey marl tee and dark jeans, lending a whimsical, visual pop of colour.\nJones has kept to a clean, sporty silhouette for the entire collection, making it easy to wear entire head-to-toe looks, or to incorporate individual pieces into your existing wardrobe staples of say, black joggers, blue jeans and so on.\nHERMES\nAlways sublimely understated, and in unexpectedly sublime colour combos, standout items included a tissue-thin suede tee in various shades of grey, a blue-black tracksuit in\xa0etriviere\xa0lambskin, and long-sleeved zippered polo tees with colour blocking.\nA button-down knit cardi featuring panels of snakeskin down the front also made an showing, aling with draw-string cotton trousers with zippered cuff hems, and boat-necked “man-blouses” with a zipper on one shoulder for baring some skin.\nGUCCI\nAlessandro Michele has championed a gender-bending time warp fashion aesthetic at Gucci since he became the Italian house’s creative director in 2015, and this collection is no different. Perhaps it’s why he decided leather codpieces were a necessity to accompany some of the male looks in case, you know, people mistook them for womenswear.\nFrom kimono jackets lavishly embroidered with flowers, paired with slouchy velvet joggers, to an undeniably dandy-looking velvet and lurex dinner suit emblazoned with oversized, sequinned interlocking-G monograms, to a checked shirt as soft and slouchy as a woman’s blouse, and a slinky silk brocade jumpsuit in salmon and pink hues, worn under a green-and-white tweed gilet, Gucci is not for the faint-hearted male dipping his toes into this trend.\nEither proceed with extreme caution, or with complete abandon.\nLOUIS VUITTON\nLuxe streetwear label Off-White founder Virgil Abloh’s first collection for Louis Vuitton, in his new role as the French maison’s menswear creative director, sees him take inspiration from the classic movie, The Wizard Of Oz.\nAbloh interprets motifs that appear in the movie, such as rainbows and poppies, by sending a series of white outfits down the runway that segue into beiges, greys and eventually, multi-colour extravaganzas.\nPants are cut loose and slouchy like trackpants; streetwear-inspired hoodies feature heavily, while sheer white mesh tees, tie-dyed paper-thin leather pants, and a vibrant poppy-print hoodie in the softest velour, caress the body like hugs and kisses from Auntie Em.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Men ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      The chic octogenarian behind Barbie's best looks lives surrounded by dolls
  </h1>, 'text': 'Carol Spencer, 86, may be the most influential fashion designer you’ve never heard of.\nIn the mid-1960s, she made a red pencil skirt with a white sleeveless blouse that had red stitching and three red buttons down the front. Short white gloves came with it. Thousands sold.\nIn the 1970s, well aware that the counterculture’s loosening dress code and mores had made it to the mainstream, Spencer designed a red bandanna halter maxi-dress and a matching leisure shirt for men. Those designs were popular, too.\nIn the Nancy Reagan 1980s, Spencer aimed for high-end appeal, making a one-shouldered ballgown in blue jacquard with an organza flower at the nipped-in waist and a cape. One of Reagan’s go-to couturiers personally approved the gown to be sold under his name: “Oscar de la Renta for Barbie.”\nSpencer has made wedding dresses, saris, go-go boots and caftans. All in miniature. From 1963 to 1999, she was Barbie’s fashion designer, a career celebrated in her new book, Dressing Barbie (HarperDesign).\nSpencer also made her own clothes, and had an easy time working with the doll’s famously unusual proportions, she said, because they weren’t so far from her own. “I have shrunk but in those days, I was tall and skinny,” she said. “I had a 16-inch waist and something on top, too, I sure did, but Barbie’s legs were better than mine.”\nShe was sitting in her dining room, wearing a blouse in a shade that can only be described as Barbie pink, with a Barbie brooch and a Barbie digital watch that legions of girls probably begged to get for Christmas in the 1990s.\nIt was a different body part that was most important for her job, Spencer said: “I have small hands.” She set down the Barbie teacup filled with lemonade she had been clasping to show her fingers. They are small and jut out at angles from the joint, a disfiguration likely caused by years of grasping little needles and bottles of glue.\nIn creating a wardrobe for Barbie and the entourage (Skipper, Ken, Midge, Big Jim, Baby Sister Kelly, Cara, Stacey, Christie, PJ, Steffie and Miss America), Spencer was part of a team that has inspired the work of designers including Bob Mackie, Nicole Miller, Jeremy Scott and Jason Wu, who once said he played with Barbie dolls when he was a child.\nSAVING THE DUNE BUGGY\nEven since her retirement, Spencer has devoted her time to Barbie. Inducted in 2017 into the Women in Toys, Licensing & Entertainment Hall of Fame, she has spent her golden years attending Barbie collectors events, doing research and amassing artifacts.\nFor years she has worked on Dressing Barbie, which is sized for a coffee table and subtitled “A Celebration of the Clothes That Made America’s Favorite Fashion Doll, and the Incredible Woman Behind Them.” Laurie Brookins, a writer and stylist, helped Spencer with the project.\nThe book combines styled vintage fashion photography with memoir. Born in 1932 and raised in Minneapolis, Spencer rejected the wife-and-mother path that prevailed in the American midcentury and instead made a career for herself. “I truly fell in love with Barbie the first moment I created her clothes and accessories,” she writes in the book.\nBarbie has been a go-to emblem of all that has ill-served girls and young women in American culture. Living in a world that is almost exclusively white, the doll has breasts that are disproportionately large compared with her hips, and her feet are contorted into a permanent “floint” (short for flexing your toes back as you point the rest of your foot).\nHer hair seems to be bleached blond, never with dark (or gray) roots. At times she dressed the part of a doctor or politician but has seemed unable to hold down a job. And there’s the place in Malibu. Does it come from a trust fund or Ken?\nBut Spencer would like to counterpunch the Barbie bashing. She points out the doll’s humble origins, with her proportions modelled after paper dolls cut from newspapers. She also defends Barbie as a healthy alternative to video games; an engine of imagination for girls and boys, who can project onto a Barbie doll whoever they may wish to become.\n“It’s wholesome play,” she said, as she pulled from a case one of the many hundreds of dolls in her home.\nSpencer is a scavenger for treasures in a toss-everything world. One day at the Mattel offices, then located in Hawthorne, California, she noticed someone was about to throw away an important piece of Barbie memorabilia.\n“It was the prototype for Barbie’s dune buggy,” she said. “They were tossing it, and I said, ‘Would you toss it my way?’”\nShe learned thrift as a child. “During World War II, things were scarce, and I remember the family would get the Sunday paper,” Spencer said. “When they’d get through with it, they’d hand me the comic pages so that I could cut out the paper dolls.”\nShe began to create paper fashion for these paper dolls. Soon she was making her own clothes. But being a fashion designer didn’t seem like a realistic goal in those days, she recalled. “You could be a teacher, nurse, secretary or clerk,” she said. “But wife and mother were the big ones.”\nShe was engaged to a medical student, but when she realised she was expected to work to help pay for education before quitting to be a “doctor’s wife,” she broke the engagement. Then she enrolled at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, where she got a bachelor’s degree in fine arts with a focus on fashion design.\nIn late 1962, Spencer spotted an advertisement in Women’s Wear Daily. “A national manufacturer who leads its industry with annual sales in excess of US$50 million (S$68 million) seeks a cost-conscious fashion designer-stylist for its suburban Los Angeles facility.”\nShe sent a resume and heard nothing back. Still, sensing this mysterious job was her destiny, she and her aunt packed up their 1959 Ford Fairlane and drove across the country to California.\nIn April 1963, she saw an ad in the California Apparel News for the same job, and this time her application got a response. It was from Mattel, the toymaker already known for the postwar bombshell: Barbie.\nSpencer went to the company headquarters for an interview and was asked to make a suite of outfits for this creature. She made a halter-top-and-boy-short bikini, a one-piece in the same shade of orange-pink. There was a cover-up and a wrap skirt. She got the job.\nPINK PILLS NIXED\nAt that time, Mattel made about 125 different outfits a year for Barbie, and the fashion department, run by Charlotte Johnson, could be cutthroat.\n“Charlotte had a theory,” Spencer said. “If you have four designers, you put them in four corners. And it was always competitive, and you were pitching your product. Sometimes the competition was kind of dirty.”\nHow so? She wouldn’t say. “I’m out of it, I’m retired, I’m enjoying life, I’ll put it that way,” she said, and she took a sip of lemonade from her Barbie teacup.\nSome of her early successes, all of which she has catalogued, included Country Club Dance (a white and gold striped gown), From Nine to Five (a midcalf blue dress with an embroidered vest and hair scarf) and Debutante Ball (an aqua satin gown with a fur stole).\nSpencer took her cue from the culture around her. As the Jane Fonda aerobics craze of the 1980s took off, Barbie got a purple leotard and leg warmers. When NASA’s space shuttle exploration was in full tilt, Barbie became an astronaut (albeit one in thigh-high boots and silver capes).\nAnd there was inspiration from her own life as well. When she needed a biopsy on her breast, Spencer was transfixed by the white coats doctors wore. The biopsy was negative, but the fashion was positive. Guess who became, however briefly, a surgeon?\nThere were missteps too, like when she gave Dr Barbie a case of pink pills without knowing that at that time pink pills were known to be methamphetamines. “Let me tell you, that caused quite a stir,” she said. (Her faux pas was caught before Meth-Head Barbie made its way to children’s dollhouses.)\nThere are hundreds and hundreds of designs that are Carol Spencer originals, with only a small portion bearing her name. Until the mid-1990s, Mattel didn’t put designer names on Barbie’s packaging.\nBut Spencer remembers each of her creations, and many of them are in her home, which her sister, Margaret, 88, will be moving into soon. But even though Spencer gets out less these days, and relies on a walker to take more than a few steps, she said she feels surrounded by good company.\n“You’re never alone when you have dinner at my house,” she said. “Barbie is always with you.”\nBy Katherine Rosman\xa0© The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ']}"

      Every woman owns a few black bags – but they don't have to be basic and boring
  </h1>, 'text': ""Karl Lagerfeld famously\xa0said, “One is never over-dressed or under-dressed with a Little Black Dress.” The same could be said about\xa0a black bag. The right black bag (think Chanel flap bag, Dior Saddle bag or Fendi Baguette bag) has the magical ability to pull together even the most nonchalant getup.\xa0\nCan we put a number\xa0on how many\xa0black bags a girl needs?\nWell,\xa0just like you wouldn't\xa0have just\xa0one Little Black Dress, you probably have an entire wardrobe full of them. After all, there's no one-size-fits-all bag for every different occasion.\nCNA Lifestyle helps you build an enviable wardrobe\xa0of black bags – one for every occasion, and maybe a spare or two for special ones. Who's counting, right?\nBELT BAG\nEveryone has gotten in on the belt bag game. So how you wear yours will make all the difference.\xa0Take a very fancy cue from Alexander Wang and strap on multiples\xa0– especially useful for when you need to bring that extra lippie, foundie, liner, office mobile, note pad, banana clip…\xa0\nWear them in the same colour or material to mimic the capacity of a giant tote or pile them on in varying shades for a colourblock effect. And yes, you can skip the belt.\n\n\nBOX BAG\nAh, the classic box bag. A shape\xa0that has endured the test of time. Resurrected from the shadowy archives of French fashion house Celine, Phoebe Philo dusted off the cobwebs and gave it a modern spin with minimalist hardware in 2011.\nThis season, fashion houses are tripping over themselves to offer updated interpretations. The shape of the bag remains – we did say it is a classic – but what’s different are the accents: House initials, a longer/shorter strap, stitching and size. Whichever way you go, this\xa0bag is a worthy investment that will go on and on.\nDOUBLE BAG\nGood things come in pairs, they say. And more importantly, why stop at one when you can wear two bags? This is music to the ears of the fashion pack who just can’t wrap their mind around Marie Kondo’s mantra of decluttering everything that doesn’t spark joy. Now you get twice as much room to lug your ‘absolute’ necessities around. The harness style of wearing the bags across the body puts the wearer in the same extraordinary league of Lara Croft and GI Jane. Military garb never looked this chic.\nMINI DRAWSTRING BAG\nMarie Kondo devotees, this one is for you. Because you only need the barest minimum at all times. Some coins and a house key. Done.\nOh, you can leave the credit card at home because the month-end statement definitely won’t spark joy. \xa0\n\n\nTHE MINAUDIERE \nLikened to a jewellery piece, minaudieres or evening bags often come in shapes that are perfect conversation starters. Judith Lieber, Anya Hindmarch and Kate Spade have turned everything from cupcakes, cameras and cockatoos into delightful minaudieres. Though small in size, they always pack a mean punch because of their unusual shapes and detailing. Go ahead, think quirky and live out your fashion fantasy with the cutest minaudiere you can find.\nMACRAME TOTE\xa0 \xa0\nEven carefree hippies need an off day. Stop with flower power and flashes of bright colours. Truth be told, an all-black macrame tote wears best with all the loud colours and prints associated with the beatnik.\xa0 The black hue\xa0adds an extra dose of mysticism to the free spirit.\nOrganise the contents with bag organisers and/or pouches. This way, you\xa0know where everything is instead of reaching into a seeming black hole and fishing mindlessly. Coloured organisers are recommended – makeup is\xa0the red pouch, work notes are in the orange organiser and miscellaneous bits and bobs are in the emerald zipper bag. \xa0\n\n\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      What shopping in New York City’s latest retail temple, Hudson Yards, is like
  </h1>, 'text': 'One recent afternoon, I took a cab down to Hudson Yards from the Upper West Side. With little prompting, the driver lamented how the development had taken away two things he’d held sacred: The relative calm of the neighbourhood before development started and the view eastward of the Midtown skyline, now obscured.\nAfter a rueful few seconds, he mumbled, “I feel choked.”\nCertainly, there is a falsity to the Hudson Yards complex, which sits atop an active train yard and shoots up to the sky impressively but generally thoughtlessly. But to be fair, the whole of 11th Avenue is a zoo of gauche intrusions, from the residential developments in the 60s to the car dealerships in the 50s all the way down to the renovated industrial buildings in the 20s. There’s never been a true neighbourhood along it. Why start now?\nAnxiety of that sort is why, so often in recent weeks, you’ve heard that Hudson Yards is New York City’s Dubai.\nThat’s a grave insult to Dubai, where there are indoor surfing waves and artificial islands shaped like all the countries of the globe.\nMore accurately, Hudson Yards is Midtown’s Battery Park City, both less insidious and more mundane than how it has been advertised. Up top, it’s gleaming, but at ground level, it’s deeply unromantic.\nWhen you come up the escalator from the 7 train station, what you see first aren’t artisanal food trucks, but regular coffee and hot dog carts. From the front, the building that houses the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards is shiny but unremarkable; look up and you’re greeted by the posteriors of Lululemon mannequins.\nThe Hudson Yards shopping complex is two malls in one, really. The first is at the top and bottom: The fifth floor (and above) has the first New York outposts of two Dallas multibrand retail forces – Neiman Marcus, the 110-plus-year and 40-plus-store luxury specialist, and Forty Five Ten, a forward-looking emporium just beginning to develop a national presence. The ground level features stand-alone storefronts for Fendi, Coach, Tory Burch, Dunhill and others, as well as Rolex, Cartier and Piaget.\nAnd then there’s everything in between, largely of spick-and-span versions of chain stores available at dozens of other places in the city.\nThe result has the feel of one of New York’s 80/20 buildings, where a certain percentage of apartments in new construction are given over to affordable housing as a make-good for a whole heap of market-rate chicanery. I would not be surprised to learn that there is a secret elevator that goes straight from a private car entrance to the fifth floor.\nUp on 5, the diversity of rich people on three recent visits was staggering: People with US$300 (S$406) sneakers, and also with US$1,200 sneakers; art-gallery-owner chic, and Upper East Side matriarch chic; people who DJ for bottle service clubs, and people who buy bottle service; young people with designer fanny packs who looked like Jerrika Karlae, or Jimin, or Davido, or Anuel AA and Karol G.\nBy contrast, on the third floor, a smiling kid wearing a hoodie from Anuel AA and Karol G’s tour was going up and down the escalators, having a great time.\nNeiman Marcus and Forty Five Ten together make for a worthy addition to the city’s retail landscape. Forty Five Ten is broken into four distinct storefronts, making the fifth floor feel like a theme park. There is a well-stocked women’s designer section, a cluster of emerging designers, some vintage and a men’s section.\nThe Forty Five Ten in Dallas is so effective because it has the most forward-looking brand mix in the city. Here, though, in the men’s department, the thick scrums of Rick Owens, Thom Browne and Stone Island feel predictable, a selection salvaged by a handful of stunning pieces: an oversize yellow print parka with aviator hood from Takahiromiyashita the Soloist (US$2,500) and a ruggedly cut military-style jacket with detachable liner by Jil Sander (US$2,750).\nThe women’s store is far more effective, with wilder styles from a wider range of companies: A short-sleeved cropped floral sweater from Molly Goddard (US$350) just a couple of feet from a stunning princess cape covered in glittery embroidery by Rodarte (US$10,388); a Monse patchwork wrap skirt and shorts set made of what looked like rep-tie-patterned silk (US$1,890) and also a sharp black top with architectural pouf sleeves from Dice Kayek (US$1,195).\nOn a recent Saturday, Neiman Marcus, which begins on the fifth floor and rises two more, felt like a true amusement park. In the men’s section, there was a foosball table, an arcade game and a Skee-Ball game all getting loads of use. But at any given time, only a handful of clerks were working, eyeing the huge floor like a centre fielder at Fenway.\nThe selection was wide but not particularly deep. Some fine-enough Balenciaga and a Burberry collection that could plausibly pass for bootleg. There were generous helpings of Kiton and Brunello Cucinelli.\nBut the real showcase was the shoe section. Now me, I’m old enough to remember when you had to hunt for US$1,000 sneakers, but here they all are, indifferent to who might buy them. The only refreshing disruption was a thorough selection of Lucchese boots, the biggest in the city. I tried on a US$3,000 pair of alligator boots, and immediately my posture improved. They made me feel beautiful (and also poor).\nEven though this Neiman Marcus is vast, it’s less a space for serious clothes shopping and more for superluxe trinkets, which is why the whole of the fifth floor is given over to bags, shoes, scarves and other low-hanging fruit of wealth signification, whether it’s a saddle bag from the Row (US$1,980) only a few will be able to identify or a graffitied kitten heel from Balenciaga that will lose half its value the moment it leaves the store.\nA woman walked up to the display of exquisitely brittle-looking Rene Caovilla sandals and whispered to her partner, “Cinderella shoesssss.” You will never miss Phoebe Philo more than when looking at the spiceless wall of Celine handbags here.\nOnce you go below the fifth floor, however, things change radically. Given the size of this building, there is surprisingly little shopping to be done. I’ve never been somewhere where the ratio of people walking through the halls to those actually in a store was as high as it was on the middle floors here. Those spaces feel more like tourist attractions, especially given the large-scale art installations scattered throughout.\nMuch of the art is interactive, meant for lingering: A wall of scrapable sequins by Lara Schnitger, which never didn’t have a few dozen teenagers fiddling with it; pastel industrial-collapse animal statue benches from Serban Ionescu, which provided succour for glum-looking shoppers; a psychedelic mural with embedded QR codes from Jeanette Hayes. (Whoever selected the artists follows the same people on Instagram that I do. Please contact me for your future curatorial needs.)\nEven though there are plenty of attractions and distractions, the act of actually accommodating people still feels like a challenge. The mall is curiously under-bathroomed, and trash and recycling bins aren’t prominent. The music can be comically loud, like the hi-NRG goth-SoulCycle assault that defied Shazaming.\nThat tension, between being a place for people to shop and a place for people to merely linger and marvel, is the clearest on the ground floor. Cartier, Piaget, Rolex – inside, they’re beatific, and there are guards at the doors to ensure they remain that way. Out in the corridors, greeters in black suits and blue ties enthusiastically guide lost tourists to the escalators, perhaps hoping they’ll be sated by some H&M or Athleta, or some ice cream from Van Leeuwen (which always had a line).\nThe grimmest space in the whole building is the art store near the exit, Avant Gallery, which sells overpriced, absurd post-graffiti canvases that would be gauche even in the middle of a third-tier suburban mall.\nFor a development whose idea of an art installation is the staircase-to-nowhere Vessel, as conceptually rigorous as the sprinkle pit at the ice cream museum, this perhaps isn’t much of a surprise.\nBut as a barometer of the level of sophistication the owners expect of their customers, it’s telling. They’re counting on the fact that money doesn’t know where it came from, and it doesn’t care where it goes – all the way to the sky, or buried deep in the ground.\nBy Jon Caramanica © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     New York ', '     shopping ', '     Luxury Destinations ', '     fashion ']}"

      Reinventing the classic: Crazy Rich Asians' Constance Lau takes the coloured suit challenge
  </h1>, 'text': ""If you think suits only run the gamut of black, blue and grey, you’re in for a right surprise. Serious suit makers Boss, Max Mara and Escada have showed us on the Spring/Summer runways what it means by next-level suiting by putting out razor-sharp numbers in energising hues of mimosa, tangerine and emerald.\xa0\nIt’s a whole new bright world out there.\nWant to try your hand but haven’t the faintest idea where to begin? CNA Lifestyle taps Crazy Rich Asians' Constance Lau who is a self-professed “huge fan of the suit” to show us how to wear Spring’s coolest suits in style.\nMIMOSA MOMENT\n“I\xa0always dream\xa0about\xa0owning a wardrobe filled with tailor-made suits in every imaginable\xa0colour,” says Lau. But not all suits are equal. A punchy hue changes the game completely, introducing energy, not to mention, personality to the wearer.\n“Coloured suits are perfect for injecting character into formal wear – edgy and perhaps a little loud yet still classy.” And if you’re game to soup up your\xa0suiting game a little further, unusual interpretations like oversized culottes or a Mandarin\xa0collar make for surprising twists that hit the spot between individualistic and fancy.\nShade yourself from the glaring hue with sunglasses. Style tip: Oversized frames give the illusion of a smaller, sharper face. Frame the face further with interesting, asymmetrical earrings.\nGO GREEN \nThe green peace movement extends even to getting dressed. “I gravitate towards green even though I’m generally a fan of colours,” said Lau.\xa0The calming quality of the colour helps her find tranquility amidst her manic filming schedule – she stars in Lion Mums 3, which airs on Apr 22, 9.30pm on Channel 5.\nThe beauty of\xa0green\xa0is that it looks amazing against yellow skin tones;\xa0pastel green makes the wearer appear fairer, while neon green flatters olive skin tones. Or go tone-on-tone for a happy middle ground. \xa0\xa0\xa0\nToughen up the softly tailored look with polished hardware in the form of 24K chain links and gleaming studs. Shiny and lustrous, they add just the right amount of sophisticated street cred to the ensemble. \xa0\nSEEING RED\nFor Lau, “colours are a celebration of life”. The infectious, celebratory vibe of red makes it a winning colour to get with. We suggest experimenting with different shades and textures of red if you’re planning on\xa0an evolved take of the Little Red Riding Hood.\nA boxy, double breasted jacket hides a multitude of sins – chubby arms, a thick waist, a short torso. Petite ladies will want to keep this jacket style cropped around the waist to avoid looking frumpy or worse, overwhelmed.\nHeads up:\xa0Cropped jackets make faking supermodel proportions super easy. Just add palazzo pants and stilettos for the illusion of endless legs.\nAnd here's a leg-up for those of us with a borderline case of unhealthy obsession for red shoes. Vibrant and oh-so mesmerising, there’s a whole lot of magic in them. They are a surefire guarantee\xa0of pulling together even the drabbest of looks – watch the tee and jeans combo come alive. Consider throwing in\xa0a matching red bag for good measure.\n\n\nMAROON FIVE\nWe have Monsieur Yves Saint Laurent to thank for the Le Smoking suit. Celebrities like Charlize Theron, Jennifer Lawrence and Coco Lee have taken turns to sizzle up the red carpet with different incarnations of the suit.\nThe question now is, how do we crank up the trusty suit in our wardrobe to a suitable Le Smoking candidate?\nTake your\xa0cue from Lau, who jazzes hers up simply by “adding a belt to my waist”. Sounds simple enough. Some sparkles on the belt – be it the buckle or all around – infinitely up\xa0the formal quotient.\nThe right bag sets the tone for any ensemble. A chic minaudiere says you’re up for after-dark shindigs. A structured sac that you can easily slide the laptop into is indicative of boardroom engagements that could well extend to cocktail soirees.\nIN THE PINK\nLike many women, Lau professes to “being not very adventurous” when it comes to dressing up, but at the same time, she doesn’t relish “being too boring”. How does she get around this sartorial conundrum? “I gravitate towards the classics or basics with a twist.”\nJust because salmon has been hailed as the new Pantone colour of the year doesn’t mean that pink no longer has a place on the style charts. An all-pink suit comfortably straddles two evergreen themes – the timeless suit and a classically feminine hue – giving it tons of mileage for wear.\nWearing a suit doesn’t have to be serious business.

      Fanny packs and beer-can totes: 7 man bags you need to own right now
  </h1>, 'text': 'Isn’t it funny how some people still consider owning a manbag a rather feminine affectation, when the oldest purse known to humankind belonged to a man and is believed to date back 5,000 years? Its owner was a well-preserved male mummy discovered in the Otzal Alps in 1991, who was said to have lived between 3,400 and 3,100 BCE.\nMaybe it’s got to do with how pockets in garments were invented only in the 17th century. Before that, early hunter-gatherers tied bags around their waists to store foraged foodstuff; Scotsmen such as the legendary warrior William Wallace (CE 1272 – 1305) used fancy sporrans to store small daily essentials, show off their status and quite possibly, prevent their kilts from blowing up in strong winds and inadvertently revealing their family jewels. Italian Renaissance men owned girdle pouches that held spices, herbs and money – and that showcased their wealth through their ornate fabrication.\nAfter pockets came along, small items were stashed into garments, close to the body. As a result, bags used by males became bigger and more utilitarian, with form following function. Cue stable-bottomed doctor bags with mouths that open wide to reduce the need for rummaging for the right potions and medical tools; messenger bags worn cross-body to reduce the likelihood of the bag slipping off the shoulder; saddle bags for cowboys and bikers; briefcases for white collar workers, and so on.\n\n\nCome to think of it, there’s really no reason why any modern man should be expected to continue relying just on his pockets to carry daily essentials, especially with health concerns over placing radiation-emitting smartphones too near the gonads, credit cards getting bent out of shape from wallets stored in pants’ back pockets, and lugging around your own water bottle, reusable chopsticks and stainless steel straws because #PassOnPlastic.\nAnd when you do have bigger items to tote around, such as laptops and gym gear, why do you have to stick to the same old plain, utilitarian messenger, duffel and backpack styles, and only in the drabbest of colours?\nIt’s something that fashion designers are cottoning on to in recent years. According to research firm Euromonitor International, the market for men’s luxury bags in the US grew 23 per cent between 2011 and 2016. And in 2017, Singer Pharrell Williams became the first male face of the Chanel bag, and was pictured a US$3,600\xa0(S$4,800) “Gabrielle” Chanel tote.\n\n\nThis season, top fashion houses such as Dior, Fendi and Hermes have even taken a leaf from their women’s handbag collections, re-issuing them in male-centric styles. So boys, know that it’s more than okay to bring on the murses (guy-appropriate purses) and motes (man-sized totes). Here are our favourites.\nDIOR SADDLE FANNY PACK\nDesigned by John Galliano in 1999, Dior’s original Saddle Bag, with its equestrian inspiration and distinctive saddle shape, first debuted on the runway in Spring/Summer 2000 as a compact shoulder bag and quickly became the It-Bag that every It-Girl of the time, such as Paris Hilton and Sarah Jessica Parker, sported.\nThe hype soon died down (the 90s era of seasonal It Bags was super competitive after all), but in 2014, Beyonce was seen carrying a vintage one around, and more celebs soon followed suit.\nIn 2018, Dior revived the piece, with Artistic Director Maria Grazia Chiuri creating 20 different designs and colours for the Autumn/Winter 2018 womenswear collection, and menswear designer Kim Jones doing a male version for his first collection for Dior Homme, the Spring/Summer 2019 menswear Ready-to-Wear.\nElegantly crafted out of grained leather and boasting a streamlined shape, it’s attached to a jacquard strap subtly inscribed with the brand founder’s name, which fastens with a industrial style metal buckle that incorporates the “CD” initials, making for a distinctive and sleek-looking\xa0bumbag (so on trend this year) that won’t get you mistaken for an ‘80s tourist.\nFENDI BAGUETTE FOR MEN\nThe original Fendi Baguette for women, designed by Silvia Venturini Fendi in 1997, was a neat rectangular front flap bag with a short shoulder strap that allowed the purse to be tucked snugly under the arm, much in the same way people toted around their baguette loaves. Issued in a mind-boggling array of colourways, patterns and materials (ranging from the FF monogram canvas, to fur, sequins and precious skins), it’s said that 100,000 pieces flew off the shelves during the bag’s initial year of release.\nIn 2019, the Baguette was re-released for the Spring/Summer 2019 womenswear collection, and the male version for the upcoming Autumn/Winter 2019 season, sees the arrival of Baguette For Men, which comes with detachable shoulder straps and top handles, and a bum-bag-style round-the-waist fastening.\nLOUIS VUITTON UTILITY TRIO\nAs you’d have figured out by now, luxed-up bum bags are hotter than hot this season, and Louis Vuitton ups the must-have factor by fitting not one, not two, but THREE separate zippered compartments onto the same belt, that’s thankfully, adjustable. Available in monogrammed leather or matt crocodile, we love how it’s super functional – your condoms can be stashed in a different section from, say, your business cards or phone, to prevent potentially embarrassing situations. An added bonus: Those pesky pickpockets in Europe who are always attempting to prey on Asian tourists queueing outside the designer boutiques will be left completely confounded as to where exactly your wallet might be.\nPRADA BRIQUE SAFFIANO LEATHER BAG\nAvailable in two neat, structured and oh-so-practical rectangular shapes (one’s a tall rectangle, while the other’s a wide rectangle), each model is available in two smallish sizes that are just enough to store stuff a guy would otherwise be carrying in his pockets. Think powerbank, phone, wallet, keys and lip balm. It’s available in macho-enough hues such as black, white, red and navy, but we say, have a little fun and go for the one designed in collaboration with architect Rem Koolhaas’ studio, which features super-cute retro-style marine-inspired Prada logos.\nHERMES OMBRE OVERSIZED BIRKIN\nAs the story goes, the original Hermes Birkin was inspired by an incident in 1983, when Hermes CEO Jean-Louis Dumas was seated next to actress Jane Birkin during a flight from Paris to London. Apparently, she had placed her straw travelling bag in the overhead compartment, and the contents fell out. Birkin had then explained to Dumas that she found it hard to find a leather weekend bag that she liked. In response, Dumas created a supple leather bag for her in 1984, christening it The Birkin. For men, this oversized multi-hued stunner from the maison’s Spring/Summer 2019 men’s Ready-to-Wear collection is bound to turn heads and induce pangs of envy.\nRAF SIMONS BEER CAN TOTE\nYou can’t get any more macho than a man who drinks lots of beer. Which is why Belgian designer Raf Simons’ Spring/Summer 2019 menswear collection, which is inspired by British lager louts, features tank tops fashioned out of plastic beer can rings, and this lightweight yet sturdy leather cut-out tote. A much more stylish way to transport your favourite hoppy beverage to the next picnic or BBQ than carrying a cardboard carton over your shoulder. If your sartorially-challenged bros poke fun at you, just patiently explain to those Neanderthal plebs that Raf Simons said it’s also “like Paco Rabanne”.\nJACQUEMUS NECK SLING POUCH\nThis label’s been on the lips of female fashionistas the past few seasons, and in his first menswear collection, Frenchman Simon Porte Jacquemus presents his idea of modern masculinity: The gadjo, a hunky Mediterranean boy who wears Provencal-inspired sorbet hues, and carries his possessions slung around his neck. His leather neck pouch is perfect for hands-free transportation of your daily essentials such as your phone, keys, and a slim card case, while adding a small but punchy accent to even the plainest T-shirt-and-jeans getup.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Men ']}"

      Style Switch: Getting this educator to venture beyond an all-black wardrobe
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sirfan Sulaimi is used to dressing simply and predominantly in black. The 44-year-old is the artistic director of Funplay Workshop, a professional children\'s workshop, theatre, design and events company that brings entertaining and educational performances to schools and companies.\n“I’ve been doing this for over 20 years. I perform for children\xa0and teach drama to kids,” he shared, adding that he specialises in shadow puppetry and would often go to schools to teach students how to create shows.\nIt seems like Sirfan\'s\xa0sartorial choices are also shrouded in darkness, which is why he decided to try out the Style Switch session.\xa0“[Black outfits are]\xa0simple and easy to match.\xa0I don’t have to think too much about whether my clothes clash,” he explained.\nBut Sirfan\xa0shared that he does worry about looking too casual, especially in meetings with potential clients.\n“First impressions last,” he said. “Clients will look at how you dress, your mannerisms, how you speak, how you conduct yourself, how you do your work. These\xa0influence\xa0their decision to\xa0continue engaging your services or not.”\nHe also dresses for the children. ""When I teach, I usually bun or tie up my long hair and wear a cap\xa0to cover it.\xa0The children\xa0treat me as a role model, so I have to dress appropriately.”\nSirfan’s go-to outfits for the week\xa0usually consist of\xa0slacks or cargo pants paired with T-shirts, and accessorised with braces or a vest. Comfort is key for him – he wears no jewellery or accessories. He prefers cotton T-shirts because he is\xa0allergic\xa0to\xa0fabrics such as linen and silk.\n“I signed up for Style Switch to get ideas for my dressing and also what to do with my hair,” he said. “I’m hoping that I don’t need\xa0extra clothes for\xa0when\xa0I transition from a class\xa0or performance\xa0to a meeting. I’d like to have a certain look or style.”\n\n\nStylist Yang Derong recognised that Sirfan is a little awkward about his dressing.\xa0\n“He performs in shows at schools and does training, so he needs\xa0comfortable clothes that move well and let him stretch out. He can’t be wearing clothes that are too tight – like his pants.”\nSirfan also\xa0interacts with\xa0teachers, principals and, on occasion, parents as well. So, there’s also a need to maintain a professional look.\nSetting out to make Sirfan a little more “smart casual” in his style, Derong picked out\xa0a selection of tops and bottoms made of cool materials that look polished, while avoiding heat-trapping polyester.\n“I wanted him to try and gradually\xa0get\xa0used to adding some colour into his wardrobe,” explained Derong.\xa0“We picked a series of printed tops and T-shirts for him to break the monotony of wearing black all the time.""\xa0\n“Also, we found him pants that were bigger and more flattering, and didn’t hug his calves, which, because he is a performer, are quite muscular and big.”\nSirfan was delighted with the choices the styling team made for him: Shorts worn over running tights gave him the edgy look of a sports coach, and a striped T-shirt worn with a red jacket livened up his looks.\nHe especially liked the final outfit: A class-to-meeting combo of grey sportswear-styled pants that allow for movement, a white T-shirt\xa0(basic\xa0but made of a good cotton material), a maroon parka worn over the ensemble and black lace-up sneakers.\nSirfan’s signature ponytail was also transformed into a neat bun, giving him a fresher and more modern look.\n“I liked that they gave me a completely new look,” said the performer. “It’s amazing how the stylist managed to change the way I look in such a short time.”\nHis takeaway from the session was a lesson in understanding fabrics and colours. “They introduced me to colours that I can use comfortably, both for performances and meetings.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      High fashion and high spirits: All the hijinks at the Tatler Fashion Awards 2019
  </h1>, 'text': 'It was the first party to be held at Jewel Changi Airport, on the day the attraction opened its doors to the public. And what a party it was. The evening’s theme set the mood: “Neon Jungle”, with a dress code that was limited only by the imagination of party guests.\n“There’s a funny story behind it,” said Corinne Ng, Managing Director of Edipresse Media Singapore, which publishes Singapore Tatler, referring to the theme. “We often model the theme based on what’s hot right now. Neon is a big theme, animal is a big theme. We couldn’t decide between neon and animal so ta-da! Neon jungle!”\nFlorist Beato – the go-to floral atelier for names like Chanel and Fendi to Credit Suisse and Hashida Sushi – transformed the venue, Violet Oon’s newest outpost, into a literal neon jungle. On tabletops and countertops, oversized bouquets of tropical flora burst forth. Acid hued blooms carpeted the main photo wall. It was like a mini version of the lush Shiseido Forest Valley just outside, except flush with fluoro.\n\n\nThe intimate venue created an ambience that felt like a stylish house party, and allowed the guests to truly let their hair down. That they certainly did, as the Laurent-Perrier champagne flowed and the small plates of Dry Laksa, Hakka Abacus Beads and Tau Hu Goreng were served, butler-style.\nThe evening’s entertainment included a fashion showcase by Christian Dada. Rapturous cheers burst out as society ladies Adeline Teo, Annabel Bohm and Yenny Then walked the show alongside professional models. The biggest cheers, though, were reserved for society maven and fashion icon Peggy Jeffs, who strut her stuff with the relaxed confidence of one who has seen it all and done it all.\n\n\nOf course, the highlight of the evening was the presentation of awards to the four winners. “The Most Stylish Man and Most Stylish Woman are perennial awards,” explained Ng. “The people who won it this year are Nancy Ong and Mervin Wee. They were voted most stylish as they consistently exhibit a certain style at every event they attend. You’ve got to give them props for it, for turning out to events well-dressed and well put-together all the time.”\nOn his fashion sensibilities, Wee said: “I’m not someone who likes to wear… any suit that’s too matching. When I was a boy, I liked things that were different. When I bought my first Levi’s jeans, I found that they were too clean and too blue. So I deconstructed them myself, burying the jeans, bleaching them. Stuff like that. Deconstructed dressing is unpredictable. It’s fashion freedom. But as long as it harmonises, it has a theme, I find that it’s alright.”\n\n\nThe third award was Fashion Newcomer, which is typically given out to a younger member of society. “This year, [the award] goes to Chloe Ng,” said Ng, who is of no relation. “Her mother and father also love to experiment with fashion. So she’s taken after them.”\n“I really like to mix and match and men’s and women’s wear,” said Ng, describing her personal style. “I think there’s more to fashion that focusing on gender. Like what I’m wearing today. My top is a YSL nappa leather top. My Supreme pants are a collaboration with North Face. If you want to be a bit more cool, a bit more different, you need to look beyond women’s wear [to] men’s wear.”\n\n\nThe final award of the evening was a new category, the Fashion Wildcard. This prize went to Kimihisa Abe, who deserved the title because of how, as Ng described, “he puts funny things together, and you would never do it and I would never do it but somehow it all works on him”.\nAccess is a partnership between CNA Luxury and Singapore Tatler.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      Hermes CEO Axel Dumas on helming ‘the world’s biggest craft shop’
  </h1>, 'text': 'Axel Dumas, the 48-year-old chief executive of Hermes, the family-run French luxury house founded in 1837, is sitting in a large warehouse space near Vauxhall, London, discussing which Shakespeare play he considers most relevant in 2019.\nThe space is part of a huge experiential event being staged to promote the brand’s longstanding relationship with the UK, its biggest European market after France, and to celebrate Veronique Nichanian who, as artistic director of Hermes men’s ready-to-wear since 1988, is now the longest-serving designer at a luxury house not created in their own name. The Shakespeare is a demonstration of Dumas’ enthusiasm for the playwright whose work he returns to after every four books he reads.\n“I love Macbeth,” he said of his favourite play. “But, for the present time, the one that really resonates is Othello. You’ve got this great hero who I think has lost his ability to see reality as being as complex as it is, and sees it with such single-mindedness he becomes a villain. I think what’s telling for the moment is that we have a complex story but because we are less and less able to deal with it, everybody is radicalised into thinking they can do it in their own way.”\nIt certainly seems an apt description of the UK’s current political stalemate. Is Dumas guilty of such obstinacy? “I am never dogmatic,” he insisted. “The main value I try to keep in the company is freedom,” he continued. “Freedom of speech, freedom of thought and then the freedom of creation.”\nWhile once the dramatic plot twists at Hermes might have been worthy of one of Shakespeare’s more lurid dramas – in particular the resolution of a court battle, in 2014, in which the group fought off the possibility of a hostile takeover by Bernard Arnault’s LVMH group by persuading family members (in 2011) to pool their shares in a holding company that forbids them from selling for 20 years – the present mood at Hermes is akin to one of the Bard’s bucolic pastorals. Appropriate enough for a chief executive who likens his role to that of a gardener: “planting the seeds for the tree of tomorrow and tending to your roses every morning”.\nThe poet-philosopher credo might sound a little quaint but Dumas can afford to be expansive. In the company’s 2018 results, published on Mar 20, the group’s consolidated revenue amounted to €5.9 billion (S$9 billion), up 10 per cent year on year, with a 15 per cent increase in net profit to €1.405 billion. Hermes reported a strong presence throughout the world, with a sales growth of 14 per cent in Asia (excluding Japan) and a 12 per cent increase in the US.\nThe Hermes garden continues to grow. And arguably it’s for precisely the more idiosyncratic ideas that Dumas advocates – just as his forebears did before him – that the house is currently so fruitful. For instance, Hermes has never had a marketing department: “Our new perfume is called Jardin sur la lagune,” said Dumas, pronouncing every syllable in a lugubrious drawl, “which should be proof enough that we have no marketing department.” Instead, the brand takes a more Darwinian approach to its wares. “We almost never do a product launch,” Dumas explained of the group’s 15 categories, which include ready-to-wear, perfumes, jewellery, silk and leather goods. “We create novelty, we let creativity lead and then we see what survives . . . ”\nHe extends the same freedoms to the group’s store managers, each of whom has free rein to pick what they want to carry in their store with scant regard for minimum orders. “The buyer has all the power,” said Dumas, “every store manager has the ability to decide his own assortment.” It sounds bonkers, but it works. “When I arrived at the leather department, the first thing the finance department said to me was: ‘We need to stop orders of the bags that are less than 10 units,’ ” said Dumas of his early induction as chief executive, a role he assumed in 2014 after a stint in banking.\xa0\n“And I said: ‘OK, how much does it represent from the total order?’ And they told me, 15 per cent. So, of course, I said, I’m not going to get rid of 15 per cent of the leather business on my first day. And sometimes there are 10 units of the same bag spread over our 310 stores. And a lot of people will never see it, but I love the idea. OK, on the negative side, in terms of supply chain and organisation of production, it’s less efficient,” he conceded. But the system works in other ways: “It obliges Hermes to be multi-local and diverse.”\nWith its focus on diversity and a curated approach to sales in local markets, Hermes has found itself fashionably on-message as the rights and wrongs of global expansion have become an industry preoccupation. “I think what is nice for Hermes is that the macro of China is good, but we are still micro,” said Dumas of the brand’s position in Asia. “We didn’t decrease during the slowdown in 2015 for corruption because we had a very different clientele at the time, so we were maybe the only ones who still grew. And then after that, [in] 2016/17 we grew again.” But things have changed since 2009 when the Asian market first exploded. “It’s much more polarised. I think we still have some very good macroeconomic trends for China but to be successful you need to have your own micro strategy: it’s about your product, your relevance to the client, and the faithfulness of them also.”\nAnother hot topic, sustainability, is also an area in which Hermes has found itself a leader. “I do believe, and you can challenge me on that, that at Hermes we are much more part of the solution than the problem,” said Dumas of the environmental issues now plaguing the business of fashion. “First of all, we have the utmost respect for the natural material that we use, and that can only work in a sustainable environment in a relationship with nature. And secondly our bags are made by hand, for 16 hours apiece, which means that in terms of usage of energy we are very low. We don’t produce a lot, and also we have a lot of people in the company who repair product.”\nIf any company were to represent the edict that we should buy less but buy better, Hermes would be it. But quality materials are becoming harder to come by. “Leather is not as good as it used to be,” said Dumas. “And it’s a real fight. Ten years ago, it was the skills shortage among artisans that worried me the most. And we found a way to organise schools with our education minister, and we also have a great internal school to train new craftspeople. Today, my greatest worry is the quality of material and where we should continue to invest.”\nUnlike most other luxury brands which produce, according to Dumas, around a “maximum” of 25 per cent of their product in-house, Hermes makes 75 per cent in its own factories. “We make it in France or wherever there is the most cultural history and the most know-how to do it,” said Dumas. “I am not snobbish about it.”\n“Respect for the craftsmen” remains at the core of the business. It’s what makes the group, with all its gloriously esoteric offerings – from the scarfs created by a global pool of part-time designers (including Kermit Oliver, the Waco-based former postman who has contributed 17 scarf prints to the house since 1980) to the nourishing leather balm sold in its saddlery department, or the deliciously perfect “Constance” handbag, first launched in 1969 and delivered this autumn in wallet-sized proportions – so authentic.\n“For me, the first employee in Hermes is the craftsman,” said Dumas. “Then the second is sales associate and then there are the people like me in the office. In other companies you will see the marketing department being first . . . The concept I try to have for the company is to remain a craft shop. That’s what we are, the smallest of the luxury companies and the biggest craft shop around. And I think this association between the craftsmen, the creativity and our level of exigence for quality is what makes the company unique. We are the Last of the Mohicans,” he said, throwing yet another literary reference into the mix. “But I hope our version has a happier ending.”\nBy Jo Ellison © The Financial Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     Luxury Looks ', '     fashion ']}"

      In Vienna, this entrepreneur keeps the family business going one hat at a time
  </h1>, 'text': '“We have golden hands, with these golden hands we can do almost everything”, exclaimed Klaus Muhlbauer, the fourth-generation scion of hatmaker Muhlbauer, who has been helming the family business since 2001, when his father Hans decided to retire.\nThe brand has been making hats for the fashionable set in Austria since 1903, when Muhlbauer’s great grandmother Julianna opened a small millinery and shop in the Viennese suburb of Floridsdorf.\nTo survive the turbulent 60s, the company began producing apparel alongside its dwindling hat business. But it was only when the elder Muhlbauer wanted to close the company down upon his retirement that a sense of nostalgia hit his son.\nMuhlbauer recounted, “I’m not nostalgic in any way, but this moment was a little bit sentimental.” So he told his father he would take over the business on one condition: “From the moment I am in the company, in any decision [that’s made], I will have the last word.” The elder Muhlbauer accepted the condition, and his son has never looked back since.\nOne critical decision Muhlbauer made was to do away with the apparel department and re-channel the company’s efforts into hat-making. He explains: “As a small company you have to have one product which is unique. And what was unique was the hats. It was the way these hats are produced and how they look.”\nMuhlbauer has never been happier working in the company. He explained: “I was overwhelmed by how nice it can be to think about a piece of work in the morning, and have it ready in the evening and go home, go to bed with a beautiful piece of work in your hands.”\nWhile things at work have changed, one thing that has remained constant is the production process, which as Muhlbauer explained, “is the only thing [that’s] like it was 100 years ago”. The reason for sticking to tradition? “The result is so nice. By shaping hats with your own hands and fingers, it is completely different from machine-made results.”\nMuhlbauer enthuses that although he is proud of the tradition, he is not relying on it as he wants “to make fresh things, new things”.\nA recent example is how a pair of sneakers, which was made from a combination of different materials, inspired the design of a series of hats. He adapted this concept by combining it with designs from traditional Austrian masks, resulting in hats that looked thoroughly unique.\nMuhlbauer’s ambition is to “dress people well, we don’t want to disguise them. We want them to look cool, to look sexy, to look special if they want to go to a party.”\nSince taking on the family business, designing and creating new hats has become his passion and he wants to surprise his customers with more new designs in the coming years.\nMuhlbauer pointed out: “It’s not always easy to produce something new, after having [produced] several thousand hats… [but] as long as we are open to the world, I think we can do new things.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Style Switch makeover: From traditional and comfy to Priyanka Chopra-inspired
  </h1>, 'text': ""Swarnima Korde is an attractive 25-year-old who already possesses a strong personal sense of style –\xa0but considers herself too “safe” in her dressing.\n“I am constantly faced with the struggle for aesthetics versus comfort when I shop for clothes,” said the petite 1.55m recruiter for tech experts.\nWhich was why she signed up for CNA Lifestyle's Style Switch makeover:\xa0To get some tips on how to dress comfortably for her work environment while looking presentable.\xa0Even if her adoring husband already thinks “she’s perfect”.\nSwarnima’s vivacious personality comes through in the “uniforms” she routinely picks out for herself. Her choice of clothing fall to three styles: Palazzo pants paired with a spaghetti top, long, flowy dresses and her go-to\xa0Kurtas.\n“My style is a reflection of my personality,” she said. “People usually say I’m unique and colourful, that my dressing is very ‘me’.”\n\n\n“There are things I like but I don’t think work for me, such as pairing high-waisted pants with crop tops,” she shared.\n“My body type is such that my lower half is heavier than the average Asian body and therefore, it’s hard for me to find pants that fit well. The waist-to-length ratio is often a miss, and I have to get my pants altered. This is why I tend to prefer wearing palazzos.”\nStyle Switch host Yang Derong liked Swarnima’s personal style from the get-go. “She is quite proud of her ethnic heritage,” he said, noting her preference for kurtas and dresses with an Indian influence. “So, I thought, why don't we update that style a little and make it more modern?”\nHe picked for Swarnima a flattering camel belted dress with\xa0a flared skirt. The shape, while reminiscent of the tunics she favours, offers a chic touch. Derong accessorised the look with nude high heels and bangles, a nod to traditional Indian bangles. The effect was a Priyanka Chopra-esque look that showed off Swarnima’s best qualities.\n“She looks shiny in it!” declared Derong.\xa0“She’s got a great figure, so we gave her something that enhances that!”\nIt’s a great look that Swarnima would not have picked for herself before this, but “now she can imagine herself wearing that,” said Derong, smiling. “She’s a modern Indian girl; she exercises; she works in a startup. I told her that she shouldn’t be afraid to reveal her body, but to be confident of her assets.”\nWhile Swarnima’s office dictates a smart-casual look, Derong suggested an update by incorporating sportswear and colour. It’s a choice that comes as a surprise to her, but the look is decidedly modern and fresh.\n\n\n“For work, I suggested she throw on a colourful parka over her spaghetti strap top, something not too warm, made of material that’s cool,” he said, recommending modern cuts from the likes of Lululemon. “It’s a look that will work well in her office environment.”\nSwarnima was thrilled by it. “I like the sporty jacket.

      The allure of demi-couture: Halfway between pret-a-porter and haute couture
  </h1>, 'text': ""In a fashion world that’s looking for new things within shorter and shorter time spans, it’s no surprise that, even as luxury streetwear, athletic leisurewear and fast fashion brands have transformed the ready-to-wear (RTW) scene in a few short years, there is a counter movement taking place.\nThe roots of demi-couture began growing a little more than a decade ago, when fashion began seeing ready-to-wear designers put out exquisitely handcrafted pieces in a collection, pieces that cost more than the average RTW piece but came with a lower price tag than haute couture, which is usually privately decided between the customer and the atelier and can easily go up to six figures.\nDesigners that were creating these less-inaccessible pieces of wearable art included Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, Valentino and Mary Katrantzou. Intricate handiwork, exquisite – often otherworldly – shapes and silhouettes, rare materials all featured in these demi-couture offerings. Fuelled by ecstatic fashion spreads in glossy magazines featuring these almost-unattainable dresses, coats, suits, an audience that liked to collect these special pieces began to grow.\nMcQueen had been doing demi-couture for years – way before the term was trendy – and Sarah Burton has so beautifully continued the late designer’s couture-like creations year after year, pushing the limits on ready-to-wear.\nHowever, it’s Vionnet that has been credited with being the first to formally launch demi-couture – by simply being the first to outright call it that. Vionnet owner Goga Ashkenazi hired Hussein Chalayan to create the brand’s demi-couture line to show at the Haute Couture Spring shows in 2014 – an enchanting collection of bespoke apparel made with high-level craftsmanship but costing much less than an haute couture piece because they are essentially “off the rack”.\nHer gamble paid off – Vionnet cemented its reputation as a must-have brand, even though the brand has since stopped showing at Couture Week due to the lack of financial viability. Chalayan was then hired to work on the brand’s ready-to-wear collections, while Vionnet’s demi-couture business continued behind the scenes, serving private clients.\nThis past January, Olivier Rousteing of Balmain followed in the footsteps of the house’s founder Pierre Balmain and launched his demi-couture collection for the house. Balmain has not shown at Couture Week for 16 years. It was a natural progression for Rousteing: already his sensibilities veer towards couture-style finishing and detailing. His futuristic couture collection showed off the finest of his talents: one jumpsuit he dreamed up took six people and 1,200 hours to create –painstakingly crafting a “fabric” from ostrich feathers!\nSingapore designer Thomas Wee also offers a demi-couture outfit with his pret-a-porter collections of distinctive hand-tailored outfits in fine fabrics like Shantung silk, each bearing strong Asian details. Tan Kheng Hua wore his kimono-inspired silk wrap gown to the Los Angeles premiere of Crazy Rich Asians last year.\n\n\nFashion expert Daniel Boey, who styled Tan for that event, explains, “Thomas creates one piece per collection, then he will make adjustments and add or tweak to make the outfit suitable for you. Demi-couture isn’t just all beads – it can be bespoke but not couture. These are customised pieces from a collection.”\nSo, what’s the big deal about haute or not haute couture? Honestly speaking, to the untrained eye, many of these demi-couture pieces look practically indistinguishable from an haute couture equivalent. But for fashion purists, the distinction could not be more acute.\nThe very term “haute couture” – which is protected by French law, so don’t go calling any other fashion from anywhere else by the same term – is defined by the Paris Chamber of Commerce. The regulating body that determines which fashion houses are eligible to be authentic couture houses is the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture; a fashion house has to be a member of this body and adhere to very strict rules to earn the right to call itself a couture house.\nThe rules include showing a full collection of at least 50 designs – comprising daywear and eveningwear – every January and July at the Paris Couture shows, have an atelier located in Paris, employ at least 20 full-time technical people, all to design made-to-order clothing for private clients, requiring one or more fittings. Think about it: One ready-to-wear dress takes about three hours to produce; one haute couture gown takes upwards of 200 hours. Phew.\nWhile we all love our haute couture houses – from legends like Chanel and Dior to relative newcomers like Guo Pei – in this age of conservation and sustainability, there is an increasing amount of criticism about the wisdom of keeping haute couture going.\nDemi-couture appears to be a refreshing answer to this: it has no organisation to join and no strict rules to follow. By offering off-the-rack couture-quality pieces that come in standard sizes, demi-couturiers can get away with showing just a handful of pieces on the runway instead of 50 outfits, tagged on to their ready-to-wear shows (saves time, effort and much cost!), while still earning the oohs and aahs and Instagram posts of admiring fashion journalists and influencers, and eschewing the pain of many, many, many rounds of fittings.\nFor the customer, demi-couture is an alluring option. That divine beaded gown you saw on the runway can be yours for less than a third of what you’d be paying in an haute couture atelier, plus, it’s mostly one-of-a-kind, and you can have it crafted to fit you and only you.\nIt looks like fashion’s middle ground is growing ever larger by the day. Even as the world’s love for normcore shows little sign of abating, the two extremes – disposable fast fashion and haute couture – are suffering. Demi-couture could well keep growing, eventually filling that sweet spot between what’s too normal and what’s too formal.\nShot on location at Caroline's Mansion at The St Regis Singapore.

      A head for fashion: Headbands, caps, straw designs and oversized hats rule
  </h1>, 'text': ""Hats are big this season – both literally and figuratively. Remember Jacquemus’ now-iconic La Bomba straw hat with the massive brim for 2018? This year, Valentino’s similarly gigantic, feathered version from the titular’s Spring/Summer 2019 outing has replaced it as the latest conversation piece.\nSize aside, hats are great\xa0accents for making a fashion statement or adding a finishing touch to your outfit. And let’s also not forget that they\xa0are actually\xa0great sun-shielding accessories that we could really use in this blistering heat.\nWhich\xa0headgear trends were all over the runways\xa0this season? We highlight the best runway hits, including an upsized hair accessory that could pass as a headpiece, and tell you how you can work them without looking like a fashion victim.\nSTRAW HATS\nLightweight, breathable and altogether perfect for our balmy weather, the straw hat is not just trendy this season but also highly functional. Sure, there's no real use for the super-exaggerated runway pieces (Valentino sent out outsized designs in both XXL and XL versions) but there were also plenty of straw designs in practical bucket and boater styles that won’t be out of place in your closet.\nBUCKET HATS\nHere’s one trending headgear piece you probably already own –\xa0most likely bought on that beach vacay in Phuket or Bali. Well,\xa0this tourist staple is officially chic.\nBanish those that are emblazoned with outlandish prints or names of vacay destinations but hang on to those that are plain and in one solid shade. We’ve seen the street-style set wear the bucket hat with suiting and formal-looking outfits but beginners can play it safer by matching it with casual ensembles or printed summer dresses.\nCAPS\nCaps are the easiest to wear of all of this season’s headgear trends. Don’t just go for the predictable sporty snapback\xa0–\xa0upgrade your style with caps in different materials like leather and straw, or fabrics that are less commonly seen, such as corduroy or tweed.\n\n\nVEIL HATS\nMysterious and alluring, the black veil hat reminds us at once of femme fatales with scarlet lips and funeral scenes in the movies. Celine’s creative director Hedi Slimane, however, showed us that it can be fun and peppy by styling it like a fascinator-slash-visor hybrid.\nWant to try one for, say, a party with an adventurous dress code? Find one with a smaller veil that covers just a teensy bit of your face or is so sheer that it is practically invisible –think less funereal drama and more high-fashion chic.\nHEADBANDS\nWe are classifying the headband under headgear because Spring/Summer’s designer versions of the schoolgirl accessory are big, broad, bold and impossible to miss. Just look at Prada’s super-puffy headbands and Simone Rocha’s bejewelled tiara-like creations - these are proper headpieces, except they are created with hairbands as their base.\nYou might not be able to carry these off IRL but you can certainly try Dior’s double-band ribbon version without people staring. Just remember to keep hair straight and sleek - if yours is long, try a neat ponytail for that dancer-inspired athleisure chic that the label is channelling this season.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      That 128-carat yellow diamond Lady Gaga wore to the Oscars is visiting Sydney
  </h1>, 'text': 'Yes, we were all captivated by Lady Gaga’s emotionally charged acceptance speech at the Oscars. Sure, like millions of viewers worldwide, we too, were taken by her pseudo romance with Bradley Cooper when the pair performed Shallow, the theme from A Star is Born.\nBut while the pair were exchanging googly eyes, we remained googly-eyed over a certain chunk of yellow rock draped around Gaga’s decolletage, a sparkler so massive it could well have had its own gravitational force.\nIt was the legendary Tiffany Diamond, a 128.54 ct., cushion-shaped whopper that’s one of the largest yellow diamonds ever unearthed. It has only ever been worn thrice – once by the wife of a US politician at the Tiffany Ball in 1957; once by Audrey Hepburn when she was taking publicity shots for Breakfast at Tiffany’s in 1961; and then in February by Gaga.\nThe stone, along with its accompanying platinum necklace of alternating cushion-cut and round brilliant diamonds, will take centrestage from today, Apr 3, for three weeks at Tiffany’s new two-storey flagship in Sydney. The 1,800 sqm store, which opened on Mar 5, is located at the corner of Pitt Street and King Street in the city’s CBD.\nIf you happen to be in town then, you’ll want to take a gander at the dazzler, which is otherwise only on display at the jeweller’s Fifth Avenue flagship in New York. And while you’re there, pause to admire – not just the other stones or lust-worthy creations on offer – but also the store’s striking modernist-meets-Art Deco architecture.\nCarved stone panels on the exterior form a wheat leaf pattern, while a wraparound, fluted glass canopy welcomes visitors with its prismatic performance. Inside are private salons for intimate viewing, as well as gallery-like spaces lit by natural light streaming in from large windows and skylights.\nIt’s all about the play of light, because how else is one supposed to appreciate diamonds in all their glory? The edge of glory, Gaga might remark. Too bad the pop icon won’t be parading around with her multifaceted companion. There aren’t that many entertainers that can carry off a gem of such heft without it overpowering them. Gaga, like the diamond itself, is one of the rare few.\nREAD> These are the 10 most expensive gemstones sold at auction, and the stories behind them\n', 'related_topics': ['     Music ', '     celebrity ', '     fashion ']}"

      The Japanese bespoke shoemaker who doesn’t want his creations to stand out 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Most shoe lovers will tell you that the best shoes are made in Britain, France or Italy. But increasingly, shoe cognoscenti are turning to Japan, which is fast becoming a bespoke shoe haven. Here, custom-made footwear rival those made in Europe. And on the shoulders of those continental shoemakers stands Shoji Kawaguchi, famed for his version of classic made-to-measure shoes.\nKawaguchi has been creating shoe magic in his Ginza-district workshop over the last eight years. He started his label Marquess with his wife Yuriko, also a famed shoemaker. Both had studied shoemaking at Tresham Institute in Northampton, England, the country’s – and possibly Europe’s – foremost centre for men’s shoemaking.\nHe ended up as an apprentice to the renowned shoemaker Paul Wilson, where he learnt not only the craft’s technical skills, but also the impact shoemaking had on one’s livelihood. He said: “You can make great shoes, but if you take too long, you won’t earn enough to feed yourself.”\nKawaguchi spent three and a half years under the tutelage of Wilson before returning to Japan to start his workshop, and then his brand Marquess, which offers classic shoes in the style of those made in the 1930s.\nOn why he specialises in classic footwear, and in particular those from that era, Kawaguchi explained that shoes made in the ’30s and ’40s were, to him, the most beautiful, and that classic shoes are the foundation of style.\nBefore launching Marquess, Kawaguchi researched, studied, and tested out various techniques to make the perfect pair of shoes. He chose the name ‘Marquess’ because he liked the way it sounded, and also because it was a rank of nobility. He hoped it would convey the meaning “to people what kind of shoes I make”.\nMastering the basics for Kawaguchi was paramount, and skipping this step would make it difficult for him to make good shoes. Also, handmade shoes allow the shoe artisan to add more details, which according to him, “cannot be expressed with machines”.\nHe believes that “it’s the details that make a good shoe”, placing great emphasis on the material because texture is very important, along with durability. He explained: “Even if the shoe is made very well, if the leather is of bad quality, it will result in a bad pair of shoes.”\nFor a shoemaker, Kawaguchi has a rather unusual attitude. He said: “I want to make shoes that don’t stand out,” a point quite contrary to other shoemakers. Yet, his logic makes sense, because he believes that because “the surface of the shoes is very small… the focus should still be on suits, clothing. But if the shoes are not good enough, I think it leaves a lacklustre impression.”\nUnlike many who believe that bespoke shoemakers should continue to only make bespoke shoes, Kawaguchi does not want to limit himself. He wants to try out other things that he’s interested in. He said: “If I want to wear a particular type of shoe, I’ll try to make them. I hope I’ll be able to do that.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

Honouring 50 years should be something we celebrate outside of the pressures of award season.”\nIts location at the Dolby Theatre, where the Oscars were held, was no coincidence either. “We wanted to host this year’s Image Awards in a grander theatre, and it is at the Dolby Theatre, where the Oscars are held. This is the first time the Dolby has housed the Image Awards.

      Saving one of the oldest eyewear ateliers in France with vision and a master
  </h1>, 'text': ""Finding a perfect fit when it comes to glasses can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. What you need is a pair that’s specially crafted for you; after all, there are bespoke bags, bespoke shoes and bespoke suits, so why not bespoke spectacles?\nMaison Bourgeat\xa0is one of the oldest eyewear houses in France. This doyen of\xa0made-to-measure glasses was founded in 1879 in Morez in\xa0the Jura region of France – the birthplace of French eyewear. In 2016, the grand dame was relaunched with Oscar Esteves, head designer and craftsman leading the charge.\nEsteves, originally from Brazil, started crafting glasses while working for his father. He was so passionate about restoring and modifying old frames that he gave up his career as computer engineer at age 27.\nIn 1992, he moved to France and made a name for himself working with some of the country’s biggest eyewear brands including Lafont and Frederic Beausoleil. The year 2015 was a definitive year for Esteves when he won the prestigious Meilleur Ouvrier de France award, a recognition that further sealed his reputation as a master in the art of crafting bespoke glasses.\xa0 \xa0\nMaison Bourgeat has been producing bespoke eyewear for brands such as Balmain, Lanvin, Saint Laurent and capsule collections for Karl Lagerfeld for many years. It has a\xa0long history and has weathered many storms.\nFrom the late 1800s to the 1960s, 90 per cent of the world's production of spectacles was realised in France. Then came the rise of Asian manufacturers, which saw many French companies shut their operationss. In 2004, production at Maison Bourgeat itself was shut, but even then it did not signal the end of the company.\nEnter Harry Bessis, an optician who took over the brand and became its CEO. Bessis recognised that Maison Bourgeat needed a skilled craftsman to increase its brand value. “For me it was obvious that when I was looking for an exceptional person, I would go knocking on Oscar’s door, so that he could join us in the adventure to bring out the value this know-how and this French tradition,” said Bessis.\nThe house is not only able to present a library of styles for its clients, said Bessis, it also allows clients to “come up with an idea, a photo, a pair of\xa0broken glasses, or something that doesn’t exist anymore in the mass market but which he wishes to reproduce.”\nMaison Bourgeat’s long nurtured expertise in frame-making allows it to control of the whole process from the design until the final adjustments for a pair of glasses. A single pair of bespoke spectacles can take up to a month to make by hand.\nEsteves added that what is beautiful is the ability to do something “extraordinary with very little things”. The biggest\xa0satisfaction, he said,\xa0comes from the people in his town who say,\xa0“It’s Oscar who made them for you.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Slouchy pants, fluid blouses and A-line skirts: Meet your new tailored essentials
  </h1>, 'text': 'While voluminous shapes like\xa0tent dresses and exaggerated puff sleeves are still big this season, a sharper and more wearable silhouette has also emerged on the runways in the form of a softer, tailored look. This new, subtly formal styling isn’t quite as stiff as a tuxedo or pantsuit, yet still\xa0refined and elegant enough to wear to a business or evening do.\nThink mix-and-match separates with which you can play with contrasts –\xa0fluid versus structured, androgynous versus feminine –\xa0and look out for designs that blend casual with polished-looking elements. The combinations are endless and will work for a whole spectrum of occasions.\xa0\nThe best thing about them is that they are much easier to carry off, compared to some other trends of the moment. What’s more, some of these separates can definitely be worn beyond this season. You have every reason to try this versatile silhouette.\xa0\nNow, start by gathering these essential components.\nSLOUCHY PANTS\nIt may look baggy but this relaxed pant silhouette is\xa0artfully tailored for a smart look. There’s polish in its casual looseness –\xa0the high waist creates a cinched-in shape, while the lower legs are tapered. Worn with a blouse tucked in or with a cropped tank or jacket, this season’s loose pants exude a laid-back vibe yet still manages to project a professional appearance.\nFLUID BLOUSES\nA crisp white shirt is forever a classic but this season, try replacing it with a softer blouse that has slightly ballooned or billowy long sleeves. Wear it with aforementioned slouchy pants for a fluid pairing that looks feminine yet pulled-together enough for the office.\n\n\nA-LINE SKIRTS\nAn oldie but always a goodie, the A-line skirt flatters just about any figure, skimming over the hips and then going away from the bum and thighs –\xa0where most figure flaws tend to lie. Best of all, they come in a multitude of variations this season –\xa0sheer, pleated, printed, floaty or structured. You’ll have no problem finding a piece to like.\nSTREAMLINED BERMUDAS\nConsider this an offshoot of the bike-shorts trend that was all over the Spring runways –\xa0a more forgiving, tailored variation of the skin-tight garment that crossed over from sports to designer fashion. Cut knee-length and tapered, the berms of this season are surprisingly sophisticated, especially when paired with a sharp blazer and pointy pumps.\nLONG-LINE BLAZERS\nSpring’s blazers are oversized, boxy, deconstructed and strong-shouldered –\xa0across these key design features, an elongated tunic length is also generally favoured. When shopping for blazers this season, try all kinds of materials but look for those in a thigh-grazing length that’s currently in fashion.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Faure Le Page's Artistic Director Augustin de Buffevent on arming women for seduction
  </h1>, 'text': 'As a popular saying goes in fashion, you can never be too rich or too thin. This is exactly why there’s no way we’re stuffing our pockets with our smartphones, makeup pouches, wallets, keys and so on. Reason number one: It makes us look fat and lumpy. Reason number two: Handbags are wonderful tools to help us tote stuff around, while making a style statement.\nA big driver in the business of women’s fashion, global handbag sales are expected to reach US$32.17 billion (S$43.42 billion) by 2023, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.97 per cent between 2017 and 2023, according to Business Wire.\nWhile major French brands such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior and Hermes continue to enjoy healthy bag sales, there’s been a growing demand for indie labels that are less well-known, combine quality materials with high-level craftsmanship, and have an interesting story to tell –\xa0that not everyone knows by heart already. And that maybe not every office lady, fashion victim or nouveau riche tourist is toting.\nThat’s probably why Faure Le Page, an almost-forgotten 302-year-old French heritage brand, is set to open its first SEA boutique in Singapore this June (also its ninth worldwide), unabashedly making its presence felt amongst the heavyweight handbag brands in Ngee Ann City.\n\n\nEstablished in 1717 by Louis Pigny, a gun- and swordsmith from Normandy, it made swords, sabres, pistols and rifles for three of France’s kings, before going on to arm the France’s revolutionary forces in 1789 and in 1830. In 1925, it began producing leather hunting accessories such as cartridge cases, kitbags and satchels.\nMany of its creations feature in leading museum collections around the world, and are mentioned in classic literary masterpieces by the likes of Balzac, Dumas, Chateaubriand and Pushkin.\nIn 2009, Frenchman Augustin de Buffevent, who had worked at Dior for 10 years, got to know about the brand, was introduced to its owners, and became intrigued by its storied past.\nSo much so that his family purchased, and then relaunched, Faure Le Page with an eye towards creating fashionable, hunting-themed luxury handbags and other small leather goods that cheekily reflect its motto, “armed for seduction”, while reflecting the brand’s rich heritage.\n“Faure Le Page supplied royal weapons; symbols of prestige and power. It also armed two French Revolutions, upholding the spirit of freedom and independence.\xa0 The language of Faure Le Page has always been about love and seduction. Our motto, ‘Armed for seduction’, is about being empowered to take action. It’s about the power of the unexpected, the element of surprise,” said Faure Le Page’s Artistic Director Augustin de Buffevent, before adding, in typically French style, “Because boredom and monotony are the enemy of love.”\nPre-Faure Le Page, he had spent a decade working in retail for Dior, with stints in France, the US, Spain and the Middle East.\n“That’s how I got to meet many customers and understand their minds. There’s been an evolution in customers’ knowledge of fashion, and [the] consumption of luxury. Before, people used to buy entire looks; nowadays, it’s more about expressing their own identity, creating their own look. And that’s sexy,” noted de Buffevent.\n“The woman who buys Faure La Page is definitely not a fashion victim. She’s independent, she works. With the right weapons, she has the power to start a revolution. Love is a battle, and you can either do nothing, or make the effort to rise to the challenge to exercise your sensuality and fight for your personal happiness.”\nThe indie spirit is also well and alive at Faure Le Page. De Buffevent’s father is President of the company, while his brother is in charge of organisational matters. He explained: “We expand and open new stores only when we feel ready, and would say no if a big luxury conglomerate wanted to buy us over. We prefer to remain family-run because we believe our independence is what keeps us creative.\n“As a small team, we’re in constant dialogue. Things never proceed in a rational or linear fashion. It can take a year or more for one of our designs to move from initial 2D sketch to store shelf. To us, craftsmanship is very important. Depending on the processes required to make a product, we may have one specific craftsman working on a single item, or different craftsmen working on different aspects.\n“For the Boum Box, each design tells a different story, and we only make 10 of each. If it sells out, it sells out,” he said, shrugging his shoulders. “But more than craftsmanship, I define success as when a design surprises and delights a customer, making her smile.”\nOn the subject of his creativity, he shares his sources of inspiration: “Aside from Faure Le Page’s history, I’m so proud of how French culture — from cuisine to fashion to art — is so highly regarded across the world. And Paris inspires me — it’s one fantastic big museum with many museums; one of my favourite places is the Palace of Versailles, and one of my favourite hobbies is attending antique auctions.”\nThe brand’s signature waterproof canvas is printed with a fish-scale motif inspired by the same pattern featured on its firearms. Bestsellers include The Daily Battle, a roomy everyday shopping tote, the Calibre 21, a satchel-style handbag which features a pistol-shaped front pocket, the Boum Box, a boxy evening clutch, the Envelope Triomphe, an envelope clutch festooned with military-style “medals”, and its pistol-shaped coin purses and wristlets.\nCome June, shoppers will be able to arm themselves at the Singapore boutique, that’s done up to resemble a sun-lit tropical garden.\n“The woman who buys Faure La Page is definitely not a fashion victim. She’s independent, she works. With the right weapons, she has the power to start a revolution.” –\xa0Augustin de Buffevent\nIf you can’t wait until then to get your fix of retail therapy, here are other French indie bag labels to consider in the meantime.\nPOLENE PARIS\nThe brainchild of three siblings who do not reveal their surname on their website nor in media interviews –\xa0one sister (Elsa) and two brothers (Mathieu and Antoine) –\xa0Polene sees the trio expanding on a generations-old legacy in the apparel business.\nTheir great grandparents founded the brand St James, which is most associated with creating the classic Breton striped jersey. With a design philosophy that reflects “exceptional pieces with unique lines and an interplay of fine material, all done in a Parisian spirit”, Polene’s made-in-Spain bags are handcrafted from fine leather sourced from well-known French, Italian and Spanish tanneries, and are elegantly understated, beautifully sculptural, and effortlessly chic.\nTheir “we are family” ethos, and commitment to keeping items democratically priced, sees the siblings choosing to remain independent, having only one flagship store (in Paris), and using their website as the main sales channel. Each month, Polene revisits an existing bag model to release a new tri-material, tri-colour design.\nRSVP PARIS\nRSVP founders Thomas Cerkevic and Jonathan Andres have, since 2015, created premium quality leather goods completely handmade in France: Think Grade A leather sourced from tanneries that work with, or are owned by, major luxury brands, and artisan workshops in Franche-Comte and Touraine.\nPair that with a pricing policy of two times markup (as opposed to the industry standard of 12 times markup); absolute transparency (all costs and margins are displayed on the website); plus classic, clean-lined, no-nonsense designs with every item numbered and limited to 100 pieces, and you’ve got an irresistible winning formula.\nLEO ET VIOLETTE\nInitially launched in 2013 via Kickstarter as “Le Petit Cartable”, Parisan couple Leo Dominguez & Violette Polchi renamed their leather goods brand Leo et Violette in 2017. With a will to offer “elegant, timeless and functional” products and maintain a direct and transparent relationship with the clients, products are available only at their sole store in Paris, or on their online store.\nAll products are carefully designed to fit modern life, meaning their dimensions take into consideration that you’d have a laptop, iPad and other daily accessories to schlep around. Products feature Italian and French full-grain calf leather; bags are made in Italy, while small leather goods are produced in Spain.\n“We would say no if a big luxury conglomerate wanted to buy us over. We prefer to remain family-run because we believe our independence is what keeps us creative.” – Augustin de Buffevent\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ', '     Paris ', '     France ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Make cargo pants sexy again: The perennial appeal of Utilitarian Fashion
  </h1>, 'text': 'You might have noticed it happening already: How items like cross-body bags, skirts with pockets and utility belts have become part of everyday wear on fashion-forward individuals. The (fashion) world appears to be increasingly taken with the Konmarie approach, with wardrobes and runway collections being pared down to the essentials.\nWho would have thought that what began as standardised clothing, created with strict regulations, would enjoy such popularity decades later? Utility clothing was first created by the British in 1941 to help revive the country’s economy: These were basic clothing items that met minimum quality standards. They were made using cheaper fabric – leather and wool were scarce – and could be obtained with ration coupons.\nRestrictions governed the making of utility clothing. For example, a dress could only have two pockets, five buttons, six seams in the skirt, 160 inches (or four metres) of stitching, and four knife pleats or two box pleats. No unnecessary embellishment of any kind was allowed. Basically, these pieces had to be practical, inexpensive and still look decent.\nFast-forward 50 years. While “workman chic” had a brief moment of fame in 1983 when Jennifer Beals sheds her welder jumpsuit to reveal her off-shoulder slinky top and leg warmers, it was really in the 1990s that the utility aesthetic found its ground.\nIt was a time of minimalism – remember Calvin Klein’s clean, spare silhouettes in colours like “concrete” and “eggshell”? Arguably the most beloved – and influential– designers of that era was Helmut Lang, whose first collection in 1998 heralded the start of the modern utilitarian wave.\nHis references were everyday uniforms, such as police and military outfits. He introduced (at that point) never-before-seen details in luxury fashion: Velcro, neoprene, motorcycle pants, tech fabrics, painted strips across parkas – decades before Virgil Abloh did it.\nHe sent military outdoor jackets and bulletproof vests shimmying down the runway. He was also the one credited with creating the first “skinny suit”, both for women and men – body-skimming jackets and low-slung pants that upended another piece of everyday workwear: The office suit that used to be boxy, broad-shouldered and wide-legged. These days, we’re still buying skinny suits, and Hedi Slimane practically made his career on a version of that.\nSince Lang’s time, fashion has seen the utility trend resurface every few years: Military greens, policemen hats, crossbody bags, toolbelt-style accessories, Sarah Jessica Parker’s fanny pack in Sex And The City, and, thanks to John Galliano at Dior in 2000, camouflage cargo pants.\nGalliano took a leaf from his British wartime forebears and turned parachute material into exquisite dresses with army canvas belt straps, complete with ferrets, that sold for thousands of dollars – a fashion farce on the spirit of utility fashion, which was take to good, cheap fabrics to make clothing that everyone could afford.\nThis Spring, utilitarian fashion is back with a vengeance. The late, great Karl Lagerfeld released what must have been one of Fendi’s most surprising and beautiful collections – and his final one for the brand – that was utility fashion deluxe.\nThe military coat was resurrected as a raincoat with splendidly large leather pockets. Kaia Gerber in a chocolate leather utility dress and Gigi Hadid in a brown pair of cargo pants and a cropped sweater are a visual statement that utilitarian fashion is not only here to stay, it’s now decidedly luxurious.\nAt the Louis Vuitton Men Spring 2019 show, military influences were pervasive – think white poplin shirts with multiple pockets and pouches. Abloh started a trend with his “accessamorphosis”, a new class of garment, he says, that are literally wearable luggage, such as harnesses bearing pockets.\nToday’s designers give their own spin on utility chic these days, combining the ethos of practicality with their preferred luxury fabrics and finishes, and updating the look for a different era. In fact, if you think about it, utilitarian fashion is the grandpa of normcore and gorpcore – inspired by everyday clothing. The only thing is, now, you can’t get even a fraction of a utilitarian sleeve for ration coupons.\nPhotography by Joel Low, styling by Daryll Alexius Yeo, hair by Junz Loke Using Kevin Murphy, makeup by Alex T, photography assistant Alfie Pan, models Milk/Mannqeuin & Tim/AVE.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Ugly Fashion is on its way out. All hail the return to elegance, hurrah!
  </h1>, 'text': 'The height of Ugly Fashion fell upon an unsuspecting world a few years ago (2015 or 2016, depending on who you wish to blame) like a half-drunk bag of kopi tossed off a high-rise building, spattering the catwalks and sidewalks with eww. Who can unsee those pink Balenciaga x Crocs? How to scrub Rick Owens’ mouldy Spongebobs out of our delicate minds?\nSome argue that certain Ugly Fashions were wearable, such as giant coats and oversized shirts. Some were padded, some had shoulders like the boat atop Marina Bay Sands, and most ended at the knees. You looked like a hobo, but, apparently, that was fashionable.\n“Thank God Ugly Fashion is over!” breathed fashion producer and writer Daniel Boey. “When I look at these things, I just wonder whether Demna [Gvasalia] is just sitting there having the last laugh. But, Ugly fashion will continue to sell as long as there’s some sucker to lap it up!”\nMake no mistake, at Balenciaga and Raf Simons, just to name two Ugly Fashion pundits, there are still deeply questionable offerings this season. Gvasalia’s voluminous workmen jackets and tartan tent shirts will still fetch four figure-sums each at Balenciaga. Simons went to Kmart and recycled plastic beer rings into “shirts” and “bags” and you will drop at least couple of hundred for each one.\nBut Fashion, being the mercurial spirit that it is, has begun to fight back against itself with beautiful designs – beautiful-beautiful, not ugly-beautiful. Clare Waight Keller’s collections at Givenchy are a breath of fresh air – of course, the woman created the custom Givenchy wedding dress for the Duchess of Sussex, aka Megan Markle, aka Mrs Prince Harry.\nAlready having stamped her mark on the house of Givenchy last year with a sharply modern take on classic British tailoring, Keller’s Spring 2019 is the antithesis of ugly fashion: floaty long dresses boasting exquisite handwork and a genteel inspiration drawn from Japanese motifs and perfect pleats.\nPaco Rabanne won much praise this season – the gorgeous Julien Dossena is that rare designer who uses materials and prints that seem most iffy to conjure the most magical apparel outside of Cinderella’s fairy godmother. His Spring 2019 collection comprises sarongs, slip dresses, gypsy wraps, matched with futuristic bodysuits bearing tribal prints, and, true to the spirit of Paco Rabanne, a perfectly draped mesh dress. Now that’s true elegance.\nThe long dress was a staple at many labels, a nod to elegance and ladylike looks. Dries Van Noten, one of the original Antwerp Six when Demna was a preschooler, shows how it’s done with lovely sarong-style skirts and breezy scarf-style one-shouldered dresses that women can feel sexy in. Jonathan Anderson over at Loewe is a kindred spirit, dreaming up folkloric patchwork scarf dresses and sensual satin dresses with contrast colour panels.\nPerhaps the greatest testament to the shift in tide from ugly fashion to elegance are the Spring collections from the Ugly Squad itself. At Balenciaga, Gvasalia’s stunning red silk dress crafted from a single piece of fabric bore testament to his immense talent.\nRick Owens, too, did an about-turn from last season with divine kimono jackets and wide legged pants in pastel satin. And given the recent Fall Winter 2019 collections that showed earlier this month, it looks like even the most hardcore normcore brands are jumping on the bandwagon of glamour: Virgil Abloh Instagrammed Karlie Kloss in a splendid shiny yellow gown at Off-White’s show.\nPerhaps the most savvy of them all is Alessandro Michele at Gucci, who doesn’t actually make Ugly Fashion – he just presents it that way. Gucci’s individual pieces are beautiful and sellable – just don’t wear that feathered blue long dress with that pink fur coat and socks.“Gucci is so successful because you can walk in and buy something,” said Boey. “Michele has made it accessible – he’s made ugly beautiful but it’s all styling.”\nIf only we could make that excuse for those dad trainers.

      ‘I own 470 G-Shocks’: Exploring the obsessions of Singapore’s watch collectors
  </h1>, 'text': ""You’d think that in the age of mobile phones and smart watches that the good ol’ wristwatch would be in its death throes. But Singaporeans, it would seem, still love their wrist candy.\nLook no further than the number of Facebook groups about watches. Today, there are at least 27 Singapore-based ones, with some memberships, such as the Rolex Owners Club Asia, Seiko Club Singapore and Singapore Rolex Club, running in the tens of thousands.\nAnd while many might simply be watch enthusiasts, a lot are actually collectors of one sort or the other.\nIt was a far cry from 15 years ago, when Sugiharto Kusumadi opened his first specialty watch store, Red Army Watches.\n\n\n“Back then, it was mainly high-end;\xa0we didn’t have options for affordable mechanical watches, which collectors prefer,” he said.\nKusumadi, who also co-founded alternative watch microbrand store Watch Wonderland, reckons there are a few factors that have led to the popularity of watches in Singapore. These include having a high concentration of watch experts, journalists and bloggers; a high living standard, which results in discretionary income; and the fact that watches are the perfect collectible in space-constrained Singapore.\xa0\nAnd then, there's the Internet. Online shops, online watch communities and the onset of Kickstarter, which has been used by many watch microbrands, has given watch lovers more options – enough to take the plunge and embrace or spark an obsession.\nSo, what is it about watches that makes people want to collect them? Is it simply about investments, the cool cache, or something else? We had a chat with some collectors to find out what makes them tick.\nIN LOVE WITH G-SHOCKS ('CAN YOU SLAM A ROLEX AGAINST A WALL?')\nThree years ago, Kelvin Lim decided to overhaul his only Casio G-Shock. It was the same watch the 39-year-old real estate agent had saved up for and owned since he was a student.\nBut for some reason,\xa0servicing the watch took a long time. In his frustration, he decided to buy another G-Shock online. And another. And another. After a month of waiting, he had 40 pieces to keep him company.\n“It was relatively affordable and it was only after many months that I hit the three-digit figures,” he said.\nToday, Kelvin has a whopping 470 G-Shocks in his collection. “If you factored it all in, I can afford a few Rolexes if I wanted to. But can you slam a Rolex against a wall?” he joked.\n“If you want me to wear a delicate watch, I’m likely to damage it easily but G-Shocks don’t have that problem – getting a scratch is a badge of honour compared to scratching your Rolex, which is heart pain!”\nHis love for G-Shocks is legendary in the watch community, and Kelvin often steps in to defend criticisms about the brand at online forums. “Whenever there’s negative press or any misconceptions about a particular G-Shock, I’ll come in to clarify.”\nBut being known as a G-Shock connoisseur hasn’t shielded him from being criticised “very often” by others who look down on the kind of watches he loves.\nBut he remains unfazed, pointing out that there are G-Shock collectors out there “but we’re relatively below the radar,” he said.\nAnd it’s also not uncommon for hardcore collectors to come to his defence at online forums. “We do tease him sometimes but we admire and respect him for his focus. I respect obsession,” said fellow collector Yang Minxiang.\nThe co-founder of Watch Wonderland would know a thing or two about obsessions – he’s also one of them.\nMinxiang started collecting a decade ago – beginning with Russian watches that\xa0range from S$25 to S$50. And he’ll really go in deep. “I’ll collect maybe 72 different variants of the Vostok Komandirskie. Later, I went into Seikos,” he said.\n\n\nToday, Minxiang’s collection numbers more than a hundred pieces from different price points.\xa0And like Kelvin, he’s not one to shy away from what others may think is unusual. “I even buy women's\xa0watches, because I like the idea and art of it. To me, a watch is not only for wearing but an object to look at.”\nWhen it comes to watches, they\xa0all have\xa0their charm. “If I wear my S$50 Vostok Amphibia, I will speak about it as passionately as I would a vintage Patek Philippe. I find equal enjoyment in both,” he said.\nAnd Singapore’s full of these obsessive fanatics of all sorts – from people who only collect Adidas watches to those who focus on Seikos or Russian brands. “We can be quite fanatical,” he said.\nWOMEN WHO CHOOSE WATCHES OVER BAGS\nIf you thought watch collecting is a man’s world, try telling that to Nana Ahmad and Elaine Wee.\nLast month, the two women were spotted in a sea of male watch collectors at Watch Wonderland for the first Seiko Perspectives gathering.\n“I think other than us, the only women were the Seiko staff!” said Elaine, with a laugh.\nThe 43-year-old project manager started collecting in 2017 – as a way for her and her husband to get over the passing of their beloved dog, Patches. “We decided to splurge to get over our sadness,” she said.\nAnd splurge they did – they got each other a Rolex each. “And there was no turning back,” she recalled. The couple started reading up on\xa0watches and they now have a joint 40-piece collection ranging from Seikos to microbrands to a handful of luxury pieces.\nTo think that before that, Elaine kept teasing her friend Nana: “You only have two wrists, why buy so many watches? Now I understand!”\nOf the two, Nana has been collecting longer. The 46-year-old had been buying watches here and there since 2000.\xa0But it was on\xa0a trip to Japan in 2016 and seeing the Japan-only Seiko models that\xa0she caught the bug.\xa0\nFurthermore, her husband suggested that she collects watches instead of bags. “He’d rather I bought them because at least they’ll look good for a long time and you never know when they’ll be collectors’ items. A handbag you’ll use for one to two years and they start to deteriorate,” she said.\nToday, Nana\xa0has around 90 pieces (mostly Seikos but with some luxury and microbrands, too) and even\xa0an Instagram account (@wristed_time). And about the\xa0collection? It’s all Nana’s;\xa0her husband just borrows the watches from time to time.\nBeing the rare female watch aficionado hasn’t been a problem for the two women. While there have been the odd surprised comment about Nana’s preference for “men’s” watches, she said: “I don’t see any discrimination. I think they’re beginning to see there’s a group of women\xa0who loves watches, men’s watches.”\nElaine added: “We just like watches and talk about our hobbies, although hopefully, there will be more female watch collectors joining in.”\nTHEY’RE NOT WATCH SNOBS, THEY’RE WATCH GEEKS\nTwenty-five years ago, Lim Ee Chiat saved up for his Rolex. And when he got it, he did the unthinkable – he dismantled it.\n“I was curious, but I couldn’t put it back together! I spent about S$600 just to fix it\xa0but that’s how I started to like automatic and mechanical watches,” said the 47-year-old engineer.\n\n\nMeanwhile, James Martin Lim got into watches by default.\xa0The 49-year-old businessman’s wife worked at City Chain in the 1990s, so they would inevitably get watches\xa0–\xa0before James started to seriously collect them in\xa02009.\nToday, the two are well known in the community for their collections – Ee Chiat’s a lover of vintage pieces, while James has a broader collection from all sorts of price points.\nAnd while they do have many\xa0luxury watches in their collections (and also\xa0a reputation for them), they’re far from being the\xa0stereotype\xa0associated quite often with collectors – the watch snob who dismisses a Seiko. (We’re looking at you, Robert Downey Jr.)\n“Watch collecting has long been associated with expensive brands like Omega, and there are people who are high-end watch collectors who do tend to look down on others who buy, say, microbrands,” said James. “But a watch is a watch – regardless of the brand, you can be a watch collector.”\nFor Ee Chiat, looking solely at price tags (and even primarily at the investment aspects of watch-buying) is a surefire way of losing that magic. “There’s a fine line between a watch collector and a watch investor. If you cross the\xa0line and think ‘will this watch depreciate or appreciate (in value)?’ you’ll lose a bit of the passion.”\nWatch snobs James and Ee Chiat\xa0may not be but when it comes down to labels,\xa0there’s one stereotype that fits the\xa0two: The watch geek.\nDuring a recent online release of a limited-edition Seiko Alpinist model, they recalled calling and messaging each other at midnight just to make sure everyone’s awake and can go online to buy it. The same thing happened during the release of an online-exclusive model of Omega’s famous Speedmaster, which sold out in a few hours.\nBut if you think that’s not geeky enough, how about this: Some of them collect … watch parts.\nEe Chiat, for instance, collects watch bezel inserts, which he self-deprecatingly describes as “aluminium junk”.\n“You know what the worst thing is? Even if people offer me S$8,000 dollars, I will still not sell!”\nPhotography: Aik Chen. Art direction: Jasper Loh\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     fashion ']}"

      Taking 'gift with purchase' to the extreme: Free-diving and training with commandos
  </h1>, 'text': 'For a select few, the concept of a luxury brand experience is nothing new. Top collectors – be they art, automobile, jewel or timepiece connoisseurs – are regularly wined and dined. On occasion, they’re invited to meet the makers: Artists, designers and engineers. The minds (and hands) behind the very things they collect.\nLuxury brands never used to put a price on such experiences. Each fiscal year, budgets would be set aside for such expenses, considered necessary to keep collectors happy (and spending). But experiences are key when it comes to wooing Millennial and Gen Z consumers, for whom mere ownership of things is not enough.\nFor them, it’s the experience of, and the emotions associated with, the object that fuels their desire. And with collectors getting younger – Millennials and Gen Zs are set to dominate the luxury market by 2020 – marketers are finding that slapping a price tag onto an experience might be the way to go.\nAt the SIHH fair in January, Panerai took a bold step in this direction. The Florentine brand announced that it would be offering three experiences with the purchase of a corresponding limited-edition watch. The first experience would kick off in June 2019, followed by another in October 2019, and the third in March 2020.\nThe experiences don’t specifically target Millennials or Gen Zs – there aren’t any influencer-led campaigns (not yet anyway) or music festivals with big-name DJs to speak of. They’re aimed at diehard Panerai fans, known as Paneristis, and those imbued with a daredevil streak.\nJOIN THE NAVY … WELL ALMOST\nThe first experience taking place in June, for example, involves an opportunity to spend two days training with an elite unit of the Italian Navy. Like a mini bootcamp, buyers of the Submersible Marina Militare Carbotech will be able to train alongside divers and commandos of Comsubin in La Spezia, Italy, a port city with a rich maritime history.\nOnly 33 watches/experiences are available, 33 being the number of Gold Medals for Military Valour won by Comsubin members throughout its history. Translation: You’re in exclusive company. It’s the stuff of boyhood fantasies, except this fantasy is rooted in authenticity and legitimacy, given the brand’s historic ties with the Italian Navy.\nPanerai supplied the fleet with diving watches between 1938 and 1970. That association is driven home by the watch’s military stylings: Military green on the indexes, lume, and rubber strap – which itself renders the timepiece perfect for diving. The Comsubin logo is engraved on the case back.\nTAKE A DEEP DIVE\nIn the 1990s, the first Panerai watches were made available to civilians\xa0and were an instant hit, thanks to its naval legacy. The experience that accompanies the purchase of a Submersible Chrono Guillaume Nery Edition\xa0mirrors this aspect of the brand: There’s diving involved, but of the civilian variety.\nCall it an immersive experience: In October, each of the 15 owners of the watch will get to dive with French free-diving champion Guillaume Nery in Moorea, French Polynesia, where Nery lives (it’s an island adjacent to Tahiti). Nery’s record is a depth of 126m\xa0on a single breath, though he has since retired from competition.\nThe watch, which is waterproof to 300m\xa0and comes with a unidirectional rotating bezel to calculate the dive duration, will stand wearers in good stead. The hulking 47mm case, forged out of titanium with a DLC (diamond-like carbon) coating, is built to withstand more than a couple of knocks on the way down.\nThe dial, with its turquoise colour and sharkskin texture, will no doubt remind owners of the time they spent in paradise, diving with a world record holder and observing dolphins and humpback whales in their natural habitat. July to November is peak season for whale watching as humpbacks shelter in the warm waters of French Polynesia to breed.\nTREK IN THE ARCTIC\nThose who relish physical challenges can consider embarking on an expedition to the Arctic with South African explorer/conservationist Mike Horn, who, among other things, has swum the Amazon River solo and unsupported, as well as circumnavigated the equator without the aid of motorised boats.\nThe experience involves a few days of intensive training with Horn among the ice floes of the Arctic. It’s as much a chance for adventurers to confront nature and its challenges, as it is for them to increase their awareness of our fragile ecosystem. Set to take place next March, it’s packaged with the 19-piece Submersible Mike Horn Edition.\nTo remind owners of their Arctic exploits, the watch is dressed in cool polar tones of blue and grey. Meanwhile, the case and strap are both hewn from recycled materials to reinforce the message of sustainability. The case is made from EcoTitanium, which in turn is derived from a company that produces titanium from aviation industry scrap metal.\nThe strap comes from recycled PET. Roughly three PET bottles are needed to produce one strap. Panerai’s intention is to help reduce plastic waste in the oceans, a cause close to the brand’s heart considering its maritime past – and present.\nIf Panerai succeeds in selling out these experiences (and we’re pretty sure they will), the brand will set a precedent for other watchmakers to follow. And by tapping into each buyer’s individual social media following – because who isn’t going to be Instagramming, vlogging or GoPro-ing while on expedition – it will facilitate a user-generated marketing campaign. Without having spent a single cent. Brilliant, no?\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      The mess of modern power dressing: Many proposals, few conclusions this fashion season
  </h1>, 'text': 'What does female power dressing look like today? As Theresa May fights for her political life and agenda in a bright red jacket and statement necklace, strict black suits and pearls, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez exerts a magnetic force in a shoulder-pad-less white shirt and plain skirt at the South by Southwest festival, it’s hard not to wonder.\nThe struggle to provide an answer formed the subtext of the recent fashion season, which ended last week in Paris. Many proposals were made, but few conclusions reached.\nBackstage at Givenchy, for example, Clare Waight Keller talked about “power shoulders” and created big domed ones of tweed on her pantsuits and sharp ledge ones on jackets. They were dwarfed only by the linebacker shoulders at Saint Laurent (often paired with micro-hemlines), the bolster shoulders at MaxMara and Hugo Boss, and the soft shoulders at Chanel.\nAt Celine, Hedi Slimane riffed relentlessly on the Dress for Success era in culottes and blazers, not to mention the Margaret Thatcher pussy-bow blouse. At Burberry, Riccardo Tisci offered his version of adult dressing (following his version of Gen Z dressing) in the form of ties and cardigans and trenches. Thom Browne subverted the Man in the Gray Flannel Suit by turning him into a woman – and then turning his suits into trompe l’oeil sheaths.\nRick Owens name-checked “the power of glamour” as expressed in film; so did Julien Dossena at Paco Rabanne. There were combat boots everywhere. Also a lot of pinstripes. That’s three entirely different suits of armor.\nWatching, you thought: Aha – 1980s power dressing is back! Then you thought: Aha – it’s the 1940s! Then you thought: The 1970s? Then you thought: Whatever.\nThere was no consensus. It was a messy state of affairs, and it reflects our messy current understanding of the situation. Which may actually be the real point. And why it matters.\nTHE QUESTION OF POWER \n“Power dressing” is a term we throw around often and easily, kind of like “sustainability,” without really grappling with a definition. In part that’s because the definition changes with culture and society. We tend to think, as Justice Potter Stewart said in a 1964 Supreme Court case, “I know it when I see it.” But what if that’s no longer true? Does it matter?\nOnce upon a time, power dressing was identified with the uniform of the ruling class, whether demarcated by gender or profession or race, and those who would have access to it. Once upon a time, during her husband’s first presidential campaign, Michelle Obama wore floral dresses with sleeves to sugarcoat just how strong she really was.\nWhat the runways revealed is just how incoherent such tropes have become.\nWe are in a convulsive moment of change, one in which the old order and the new coexist in uneasy alliance; one in which received notions of presentation are increasingly being rejected in favor of individual identity. A person’s experience and history are worn as badges of pride, not disguised so as to better blend in.\nThe codes (because what is power dressing but a dress code by another name?) of old are going out the window. Both those that are explicit and dictated, and those that are unspoken but widely accepted.\nThis is a more complicated proposition for everyone: Designers, consumers, viewers, job hunters. More choice is always harder. It places the burden on the dresser as opposed to the majority. It requires active thinking about clothes and identity as opposed to passive shopping.\nFASHION IS NOT THE ANSWER?\nIn an email exchange, trying to hash this all out, Richard Ford, a professor at Stanford Law School who is working on a book on dress codes, wrote, “There is a lot to like in the demise of overly stringent dress codes and such, but it’s also true that the old uniform of business suit had a certain democratising power – everyone from world leaders to file clerks wore a suit, and eventually as the workforce became integrated, there were standard feminine versions as well – a safe bet for women who wanted to command respect.”\nFashion isn’t there to provide a solution to the problem. That’s up to individuals.\nThis is why, increasingly, designers seem to explain their shows as being aggregations of “characters”, and different kinds of women being given different ways to signal their aspirations. This was a thing, for example, at Marc Jacobs, who gave us a bit of it all – big voluminous protective garments and florals and feathers and rigorous minimalism – and at Louis Vuitton, where Nicolas Ghesquiere’s piazza full of performers and BCBG art dealers and rockabilly kids brought Paris to a close. It has become the essence of Alessandro Michele’s Gucci and its success, which maybe should have taught us all something.\nYou can see the flux as a sign of weakness or inability to commit. (I’ve levelled that accusation on occasion.)\nBut maybe instead of wanting a neat and easy new look, we should be celebrating the confusion and what it signifies. A loosening of bounds, a pivot point, an expression of the reality that diversity of all kinds (thought, aesthetic, opinion) is on the rise, and that the uniform is no longer an object of desire. An acknowledgment that there are many kinds of power and ways to design for them.\nBy Vanessa Friedman © 2018 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Butterflies, ladybirds and four-leaf clovers: What will you find in Pandora’s Garden?
  </h1>, 'text': 'There’s a crisp scent of eucalyptus that greets you, and your ears pick up the rustling of leaves. You step forward, and feel the soft mossy floor beneath your feet. The air is refreshing – a wash of soft blooms and disappearing dew – and as you turn the corner at a shrub, you witness the most magical spectacle: Pandora’s Garden.\nSpring is expressed three ways in the lush compound, and similarly, three paths lead off into the distance.\nThe first beckons with a shifting curtain of willow leaves, dancing in the breeze. The next is framed by twisting olive trunks, its canopy one of minty silver. And the final path disappears into tall, swaying delphiniums, flanking them with two soft rivers of blues.\nIt is your adventure\xa0– your garden experience. Which entrance are you most inspired by? And, which will you pick?\nSTYLE BLOSSOMS\nParting the draping willow branches, their wispy leaves gliding across your skin, you step through to be greeted by the fragrance of a hundred blooms. The rich display before you is a wild garden of roses, hibiscus and peonies – a gathering of the largest flowers. As you wind deeper among the shrubs, both the perfume and nodding blossoms naturally lift your spirit.\nFlowers have such rich symbolism – it’s no wonder they have a language of their own. Pandora picks out the four-petal design as the universal icon of joy. Its Style Blossoms collection consists of delicate ringlets of blossoms to be worn on your finger, or feminine charms finished in Pandora Shine or the new Pandora Rose, ready to decorate your wrists.\nReign over the floral kingdom with the Reflexions Queen Bee Clip charm. It’s a bold icon of power, drenched in sunny gold, while adding a touch of glam with sparkling cubic zirconia on the body.\nMAKE YOUR LUCK\nStepping under the olive canopy, it’s a rolling landscape that awaits. Gentle mounds are covered by moss, and rocks jut out like little islands. A brook meanders in and outwards of the path, leading you eventually to a small grotto filled with clovers. As you bend down to pick one, you see that they are all four-leafed – an unusual phenomena. Even more surprising, just as you pick one, a dainty dot of red flies towards you and lands atop the leaf. You smile at the curious little ladybird and this fortuitous encounter.\nIt’s not easy to spot one of these rare items, and that is why both the four-leafed clover and ladybird have become associated with good luck. Make Your Luck with Pandora, and create your own good luck charm with its newest Spring Collection. Discover dainty Sterling Silver clovers with movable leaves perched on slim rings, or have the above story unfold with the Pandora Rose ladybird on a sterling silver clover charm.\nThe Lucky Four-leaf Clover pendant is especially detailed, set with an aqua-green crystal for a dash of lively. Or wear them on your ears, with the Lucky Four-Leaf Clovers drop earrings, and may they bring you many compliments.\nFor that extra touch of glam, add the Pink Ladybird charm to your wrist. A gorgeous pink enamel sits on the Pandora Rose body, encrusted with black crystals and glittering cubic zirconia.\nWINGS TO FLY\nAs you wander into the sea of delphiniums, swimming in the sky-blue blooms, they disperse to present a field of ranunculus flowers, rippling with the breeze. The colourful petals sway and bob, and you realise that some of the petals are actually butterflies! Right on cue, they take off into the air, and shimmer in a cloud of hues.\nFrom an unassuming caterpillar, the butterfly is metamorphosis realised in one of nature’s most splendid creations. The grace and artful flight of the winged creature is drawn by every imaginable pattern and colour one can dream of. Carry the butterfly with you and reclaim your Wings To Fly.\nExpressed in their movement and wings, the Bedazzling Butterflies open ring is a swooping trail around your finger, glittering with the inset cubic zirconia. The Decorative Butterfly Pendant prefers to rest around your neck, its Pandora Shine and glittering body a pretty presence.\nIf you are into your blues, the Dazzling Blue Butterfly brooch is a scene-stealer. The wings of the butterfly profile become a night sky of stars, achieved with clear cubic zirconia and royal blue crystals. A little bit of Art Nouveau comes with the Blue Butterfly Wing charm. It looks like a mystical lagoon with its tie-dye-effect blue enamel, but is actually the lacy wings of the butterfly wrapping the spherical charm.\nCOME VISIT THE GARDEN\nYour expression, your garden. Pandora’s celebration of Spring is a collection of symbols that resonates with meaning and purpose – a statement and cheerful reminder for every day. Pick out your own special piece at any Pandora store or online at sg.pandora.net/en.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Fifty Shades Of Yay: In times of doom and gloom, fashion fights back in colourful ways
  </h1>, 'text': ""Dress like you are going to meet your worst enemy today, once said\xa0Coco Chanel. Mademoiselle\xa0probably wasn't talking about politics when she uttered this immortal line, but she might as well have been.\nThe world is currently not fabulous. A few weeks ago, it looked as if a full-scale war was going to break out between India and Pakistan – thankfully, it did not. But there’s still Brexit to dread on Mar 29 and the UK looks no closer to a happy solution. Plus, two summits and millions of dollars and dong later, Trump and Kim are no closer to nuclear disarmament. And the International Monetary Fund has projected slow economic growth for 2019 and 2020. Oh, joy.\nFashion’s greatest appeal must be the sheer escapism it offers both buyers and beholders. Even in the worst of times, fashion has always had a way of fighting back the darkness and bringing a modicum or two of joy to women (and some men).\nDuring World War II, when fabric was rationed and could only be purchased with coupons, shorter skirts and bared legs became the fashion. When Germany was threatening chemical warfare against the Allies, women in London could buy gas protection suits made from oiled silk in a variety of colours, from Harvey Nichols.\nLikewise, in this current climate of doom and gloom, it feels like fashion got its act together and decided on a feel-good party for Spring/Summer 2019. Colour explosions hit just about every runway. Gucci sent coats of pink fur and dresses of blue feathers down the catwalk, glamorous protective coverings soften any blow. Marc Jacobs dressed Kaia Gerber in a defiantly shiny yellow slicker dress, a metaphoric middle finger to the stormy world out there. Versace – which has never shied from loud – turned it up to eleven: Donatella ramped up and mashed up colours, prints and silhouettes like she was sparking joy all over the place.\nThe determination to stay – no, slay – positive didn’t just overcome the fashion crowd, it infected celebrities too, of course. It began at the Grammys on Feb 10 with the likes of Cardi B wearing a pink peacock concoction from the Thierry Mugler haute couture archives (complete with long pink gloves); Katy Perry in a pink strapless Balmain cake; a newly-minted billionaire Kylie Jenner in pink Balmain too – and pink gloves (are you noticing a trend?); and a personal favourite: Post Malone in a star-encrusted pink jacket and pants that almost – but not quite – distracted from his face tattoos.\nThe Oscars two weeks later on Feb 24 was awash with ebullience in the form of more adorable pastels and sparkling metallics. The luminescent Gemma Chan stopped traffic in a pink Valentino haute couture gown (with pockets that famously held cookies), along with Helen Mirren in Schiaparelli haute couture, Jason Momoa in custom Karl Lagerfeld, Lisa Bonet in Fendi Couture and Angela Bassett in Reem Acra.\nGlenn Close led the charge on the metallic brigade with an elegant gold caped gown by Wes Gordon for Carolina Herrera, while girl of the moment Brie Larson sparkled in silver chainmail (Celine), as did Jennifer Lopez (Tom Ford). Emma Stone dazzled in a glittering otherworldly Louis Vuitton gown. Other candy colours were not spared: Constance Wu wore a butter-yellow Versace gown and Tina Fey a bright blue Vera Wang.\nThe one image in black that scored more smiles than all of the above was Billy Porter, who stole the show at the Oscars in a dramatic black gown custom-made by Christian Siriano. He called it “a walking piece of political art” – a poignant reminder for the world to take a breather from bad news and just enjoy seeing their favourite celebrities all dressed up.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     celebrity ', '     Luxury Looks ', '     Television & Movies ']}"

      The belt bag is back with a new classy upgrade you can't say no to
  </h1>, 'text': 'When designers started sending belt bags out on the runway a year or two back, not many, honestly, could admire them. The bag took most of us - those who partook in ’80s trends as they happened then - right back to the age of the cringe-inducing fanny pack.\nYet, fashion does work in fascinating ways – as soon as the waist bag was seen around multiple celebrity waists, it swiftly became the accessory du jour and a full-fledged trend (one that looks like it’s here to stay – for 2019 at least, we can safely say).\nOf course, the modern belt bag comes in slightly more wearable styles (such as Gucci’s highly sought-after oval version) in addition to those that are largely modelled after the traditional bum bag. Still, while both are hot favourites with the fashion set, they seem to have a lower take-up rate elsewhere.\nThis year, however, things are set to change. The belt bags of Spring have shed much of the 80s vibes and acquired a much more palatable shape - less fanny pack and more chic fashion statement to be strapped around the waist.\nTake a look at the best of the season’s choices below. Sure, some of these might border on the quirky, but we’d take these over the typical bum bag any day. Perhaps, you might just also consider strapping one of them on?\nBURBERRY\nThe chic TB-logo (created in homage to the brand’s founder, Thomas Burberry) belt bag with a sleek metal chain is dressy enough for cocktails and nights out. Bonus: Remove the chain and the bag doubles as a clutch.\nCHANEL\nWork two Spring/Summer 2019 accessory trends with just one item – this hybrid design by Chanel combines a belt bag with a lanyard strap.\nCHLOE\nClassy, refined and simple, barring the giant gold C affixed on the front flap. Chloe’s new belt bag looks pretty fab, even when casually held in the hand.\xa0\nDIOR\nThe super-popular saddle bag gets slimmed down this Spring, turning up on the runway as a convertible crossbody-slash-belt bag. Wear it as seen on the model - with both the belt and sling on, for the most on-trend effect.\n\n\nFENDI\nPockets were seen everywhere on the Spring/Summer runways - including this luxe utility belt for fashionistas.\nSALVATORE FERRAGAMO\nEasily the least conspicuous and most wearable option here, this belt bag is the safest way to dip a toe into the trend. Whether you can actually fit anything into the bag is secondary.\nGIVENCHY\nThis has a shape most like the bum bag, yet is somehow so much chic-er in white leather and a relaxed shape with the most minimal of hardware and accents.\nJACQUEMUS\nNot strictly a belt bag, Le Chiquito is actually a miniature handbag with a detachable shoulder strap that can also be slung around the waist. Quirky, no doubt, but how cute is that?\nNANUSHKA\nThis drawstring bucket bag miniaturised for wearing on your waist is an excellent example of the many varied forms a belt bag can take.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The watchmakers turning your dreams and stories into custom timepieces
  </h1>, 'text': 'Michael Young belongs to a unique group of independent craftsmen who have been making waves in the world of horology. Nicknamed the bracelet magician, Young has been repairing and restoring vintage watches for many years.\nHis love affair with watches began at age 12, when he was shown the inner workings of a Rolex watch. “It was a little moving thing. I like things that moved and I was immediately hooked.” He started “looking at watches and stuff” but it was the Rolex watch his dad gave him at 15 that inspired him to explore further – not just repairing other people’s timepieces, but customising and designing his own as well.\nUnlike cars, which allows owners to customise its interiors, its parts and its colours, a watch doesn’t, says Young. That led him to the idea of “revolutionising the industry”. In 2016, through Kickstarter, he received HK$2 million (S$345,318) and together with his partners started Undone, an e-site where watch lovers could custom-make watches. Since then, the company has become a byword in the world of horology, and it has also launched collaborative collections with other major players in the watch industry.\nWhen he started the business, it was with the idea to offer customers something that’s different from what others were offering, something that most people would not think of, something that’s treasured. Young, an engineer by training, believes that luxury to a person is what he treasures – something that’s well-made, where “he actually puts in his own idea of how this is gonna be made”, like an heirloom that was designed by one’s grandfather.\nBesides customising to the minutest of details, Undone also ‘vertically integrated’ everything, says Barry Cheung, the company’s vice-president of marketing. That included sourcing for their own watch part, cases as well as product development, which underscore their demands for quality build and design in their productions.\nSaid Young: “I’ve been always dealing with very high-end watches, [so] I put that standard into my watches too.” Cheung also shares Young’s vision of using new materials, forms and technology to improve their timepieces. But more than that, they want their watches to be works of art that would be appreciated.\nJames Wong, vice-president of PR and Business Development, echoes their ethos. “People know about the scarcity, the passion about the user or the product. A watch from Undone that you can customise for yourself is a meaningful piece of watch that you want to wear every day”.\nFor Young, Undone is about “people’s stories, dream, it’s a collection of them”. Even more, the creative side of him recognises that designing something from scratch, doing a project from scratch, and the adrenaline that kicks in, it’s something that’s “really ‘wow’!”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Retro kicks: Did you know the Reebok Pump is 30 years old?
  </h1>, 'text': 'The year was 1989. The Berlin wall just came down; Michael Keaton’s Batman was fighting Jack Nicholson’s Joker; Indiana Jones was on his last crusade; and pumping air into one’s shoes became the coolest thing since sliced bread.\nIt’s hard to believe that it’s been a whopping 30 years since Reebok came up with the Pump. \xa0\nBack then, if you were a proud owner, you were most likely the freshest (or richest) kid on the playground. Even if you didn’t have the money to own a pair, everyone knew exactly how the pump worked.\xa0\nPUMP UP THE JAM\nStep one: Push that big embossed ball in the tongue. Step two: Activate the air pumping action and “inflate” your shoe. Step 3: Show off as you try to dunk like an NBA basketball player while fending off your friends constantly trying to press your trainers.\nAt least that\'s how it looked to the rest of us in our white Bata school shoes.\nTo think that the Reebok Pump became the innovation that it was simply by being inspired by very disparate ideas: Inflatable splints used to rehabilitate injuries and\xa0medical IV (intravenous) bags.\nYes. IV bags. Who knew the answer to the new must-have sports shoe\xa0was all about having something you see in hospitals built directly into it?\nTHE ANSWER TO NIKE AIR\nReebok desperately needed a product to compete with longtime rival Nike’s Air technology: A new generation of Air Jordans (Michael Jordan’s popular line of Nike Air sneakers) was already making waves with a\xa0balloon in the heel that was filled with compressed gas\xa0to provide additional comfort and support.\nReebok head and CEO Paul Fireman knew the company needed a customisable shoe. And so it was up to engineer and chosen point man Paul “Litch” Litchfield to collaborate with industrial design firm Design Continuum to ask themselves: Could they make a shoe that reduced injuries by providing more support and a better fit?\nThe Reebok Pump with its\xa0inflatable insert and adjustable fit technology was their answer.\nAccording to the Reebok Archive, the pump technology was all about the inflatable chambers fitted within the shoe which enabled the wearer to create a custom fit by either inflating or deflating the areas of the shoe around the ankle.\nThe design was clever in the way that the air chambers were quilted so only certain amounts of air could reach the most flexible parts of the foot in order to retain that movement. It offered a level of comfort, along with stability and support unheard of at the time.\nIn another\xa0Reebok Archive interview, Litch credited the lightbulb moment to solving a problem for athletes.\n“We listened to the college players and pro players and that’s why we made the Pump. We wanted to make a shoe that was more supportive. As (the players)\xa0were getting bigger, stronger, the high-top shoes were just big shoes. Today they wouldn’t wear shoes that high, they’d wear mid cuts or low cuts but back in the day the philosophy was that you want to support the ankle so that’s why we did the Pump,” he explained.\nIt was the very\xa0innovation Reebok needed to keep rival Nike on their toes and pretty much rule the 1990s.\xa0\nIT\'S THE SHOE YOU WANT, NOT THE SHOE YOU NEED\nReebok has called the Pump ""one of the most amazing innovations in footwear...since the shoe lace"" and many, inside and outside of the industry, sneakerhead or not, will readily agree.\xa0\nIt was the exciting dawn of high-tech development in the sports apparel world where science was fused with footwear and then cleverly marketed as “want” and not just a “need”.\nDespite its high price for the average kid, the Pump became something of a status symbol on urban basketball courts and in schools all over the world throughout the 1990s. You couldn’t find a playground without them.\xa0\nFROM A NO-LOOK DUNK TO SHAQ TO TUPAC\nA little marketing push of course didn\'t hurt either. Nike had Michael Jordan, so Reebok went with NBA All-Star Dominique Wilkins to advertise and rock their eponymous Pump basketball shoe on and off\xa0the court.\nBasketball-related Pumps would become even more popular with\xa0the introductions of the Twilight Zone, Omni Zone, and SXT Pump in 1990. But it was another innovative new kid on the block who really cemented the Reebok Pump in NBA history.\nIt was the 1991 NBA Slam Dunk Contest and\xa0Dee Brown of the Boston Celtics\xa0had entered the slam dunk contest as the underdog against fierce competition.\nAll that changed when he took home the crown with the now iconic ""no look"" dunk, but not before playing to the crowd and pumping his\xa0Reebok Pump Omni Lites before taking flight and making his\xa0competition-winning move.\nThis had kids all over the world amazed by their technology and sales of the Reebok Pump reportedly skyrocketed.\nConsidered as the\xa0bonafide rival to Nike and Michael Jordan’s mass\xa0empire, the Pump grew throughout the early and mid-90s.\xa0\nShaquille O’Neal was one of Reebok\'s biggest stars with his own audacious brand of pumps that matched his personality, the Shaq Attaq.\xa0Originally released in 1992, it was the first signature sneaker for O\'Neal from Reebok. They featured a leather and suede upper with the Pump technology on the tongue and Graphlite.\xa0 They were retroed for the first time in 2013, shortly after Shaq returned to the brand.\nThe\xa0Pump was also a ""Hollywood"" star, featuring\xa0in a variety of different films and TV shows, most notably, two of hip-hop artist Tupac Shakur’s films:\xa0Juice and Above The Rim. An Above The Rim Pump also came out with the release of the film.\n""PUMP UP AND AIR OUT"": FOR\xa0GOLFERS AND TENNIS PLAYERS TOO\nThe Reebok Pump may have debuted as a basketball shoe, but the Pump quickly transitioned to a number of brand-new arenas. Then unknown\xa0tennis star Michael Chang (who went on to win the French Open at 17 years old) popularized the Pump on the court with the Court Victory Pump, while\xa0golfer Greg Norman even hit the links in his own Pump-equipped golf spikes.\xa0\nAND THEN CAME THE INSTAPUMP\nReebok\'s InstaPump technology was\xa0the next iteration of the Pump evolution, with the use of a ""pump gun"" that now\xa0filled the bladder with carbon dioxide.\nIn 1994 ,the Reebok InstaPump Fury (or Reebok Pump Fury) emerged to\xa0prove to the disbelievers that a running shoe without laces could actually work.\nDetermined to do for runners what Pump originally did for basketball kicks five years earlier, the sneaker created\xa0used a Pump Full-Foot Chamber system instead of laces and lightweight GraphLite material in place of a midsole.\xa0\nNow decades later,\xa0the InstaPump Fury is still considered a huge technical achievement in footwear.\xa0Its cut-out silhouette, Pump, and split\xa0midsole seemed so\xa0way ahead of its time that even know, it still gets attention whenever it hits the street.\xa0\nCHANEL X\xa0REEBOK INSTAPUMP FURY\nDuring Instapump Fury’s 20th\xa0anniversary in 2014, Reebok released 27 exclusive collaborations and releases to celebrate, sending sneakerheads clamoring for a pair.\xa0\nIt is no\xa0stranger to being\xa0reworked via collaborators though. In 2000, Chanel put its double C branding on the sneaker which for many collectors was deemed a unicorn.\nThe Chanel x Reebok InstaPump Fury was never produced beyond the runway, with one rare example surfacing at 2015’s Out Of The Box: The Rise Of Sneaker Culture\xa0exhibition.\xa0\nAccording to the American Federation of Arts, which\xa0organised the traveling exhibition in partnership with\xa0Toronto’s Bata Shoe Museum, “The Reebok x Chanel InstaPump Fury is one of the first and most elusive high fashion sneaker collaborations.”\nTHE FUTURE\nIndeed, the Pump has come a long way. Other companies have tried their hand with it as well, but it remains, till this day, one of Reebok\'s signature technologies.\nSome might argue that it\'s currently riding more on nostalgia than performance but undeniably, it has evolved significantly throughout its history and\xa0has sealed its place in sneaker legend.\nSo yes, we remember when some people made fun of kids who wore pumps way back in 1989.\xa0 “What idiot would wear that tacky shoe with a big basketball on top” you would hear muttered under resentfully envious breaths.\xa0\nBut that’s because we were just jealous that the only way we could achieve a perfect fit without the Reebok Pump was to double our socks.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Spring/Summer trends to shop: Tie-dye, bleached denim and... bike shorts?
  </h1>, 'text': ""With the best of Spring/Summer fashion now in stores,\xa0this is probably the best time to hit the shops and get your pick of newly arrived stocks, whether it's online, designer or high-street.\xa0\nThere are plenty of runway trends from this season to choose from, but the big question is:\xa0Which ones that are the easiest to translate from what the model wore to real life? Which ones can you actually use?\nHere are the key trends that are worth spending on – and experimenting with – that will give you the most wearable and stylish Spring/Summer wardrobe.\n1. BEIGE\nWe can’t think of a more wearable colour than beige (next to black, that is). It’s low-key, classic, versatile, and a neutral that should be a staple in your wardrobe all year round. This season, wear it the way it’s most frequently seen on the runways – from top to toe.\nAfraid of looking washed out in this understated hue? Look to the runways for chic ways to assemble your all-beige outfit. Play with separates in different fabric textures and varying shades of beige – in case you didn’t know, there’s eggshell, ecru, camel, desert sand or greige.\n2. BOLD TONES\nBeige a tad bland for your taste? Good news – bold, vibrant colours are also in trend. Go for maximum impact with rich, saturated shades like marigold, fuchsia and tangerine, or highlighter brights if you dare.\nYou don’t necessarily have to go bold from head to toe – pair with denim or black to make these loud hues more workable for you.\n3. UTILITY\nPockets, in all sizes, are big and seen on everything from blazers, pants and tops to maxi-dresses, jumpsuits and belts. Besides being decorative, they are actually useful for stashing things – yes, fashion can be practical, too.\nThis also means that cargo pants are officially back, now also done in more feminine and fluid cuts that are easier to carry off IRL. Boiler suit-inspired jumpsuits were hot last season and still a do – why not try one in a softer and dressier material like charmeuse?\n4. MODERN HIPPIE\nTie-dye has made a comeback in fascinating forms – this season, you’ll see it not just on t-shirts, but also jeans, dresses and outerwear. On the same 60s note, there are also scarf prints, handkerchief hems and flowy tunics that channel\xa0flower-child vibes albeit with a new slant.\nFinish these boho-inspired looks with a low-slung rope belt, chunky jewellery, tinted sunglasses and a chill ’tude.\n\n\n5. BLEACHED DENIM\nIt’s time to lighten up on the denim front – you’d still want to wear those indigo jeans now and then, but this season, a few new pairs in bleached wash\xa0(or an acid wash if you dare) are an absolute must.\nBleached denim jeans might look super-casual (and indeed, it looks best on relaxed fits) but go ahead and try it on a tailored cut, too — it can be surprisingly dressy with a snug fit and when paired with, say, a velvet jacket and stilettos.\n6. LACE\nLace can be girlish and romantic, dark and sexy, or everything in between. Some designers played up its ultra-feminine qualities, while others gave it an urban edge by using it in the most unexpected ways – on utilitarian and sporty styles, which are perfect for after-hours.\n7. FLORALS\nWhat is Spring without the blooms? Take your pick from this season’s myriad varieties, from the large, bold and colourful to the delicate, subtle and discreet.\nHow to make them work for you? Choose a print in a scale that best suits your frame – some large floral prints may overwhelm a petite frame or highlight certain figure flaws so\xa0do make it a point to try them on for size.\n8. BIKE SHORTS\nThe latest athleisure item you need in your wardrobe is none other than bike shorts. We know – who would have thought these unforgiving sportswear bottoms would have made it into a list of trends to follow?\nAdmittedly, bike shorts are not something that curvy ladies can easily pull off. However, they look amazing on someone with an athletic bod.\xa0\nSome points to note when shopping for your shorts: A thicker fabric is flattering and do watch out for that camel toe – don’t go for an overly tight fit and do always pair them with a long-line jacket or top.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Tartan, hats and nipped waists: The big trends from Paris Fashion Week
  </h1>, 'text': 'Tartan, nipped waists and lots of hats – as Paris women’s fashion week reaches its climax, we pick out the biggest style trends in the Autumn/Winter collections.\n1. RETURN OF THE WAIST\nParis fashion has found its shape again. After several seasons when baggy ballooned into ever more exaggerated oversized, designers are back cutting to the body.\nSharply tailored looks that followed and flattered the contours of the body reconquered the catwalk, from the reborn glamour of Glenn Martens\' Y/Project to Atlein and the relentless sexiness of Saint Laurent, which premiered its ""nappy"" hotpants, shorter than micro minis but with no danger of them rucking up to reveal more than they should.\nDior and Olivier Theyskens nipped waists, the former inspired by 1950s Teddy Girls, while Lanvin\'s promising newbie creator Bruno Sialelli ghosted a couple of corset lines into his clothes. Even Rick Owens refound his love of sharp body-hugging lines.\nWith belts de rigueur, designers rediscovered the joys of a waist after years of draping and enormous coats.\n2. TARTAN ARMY\nIf you are going to add anything to your wardrobe for next winter, make sure its tartan. Or at least some kind of plaid.\nTartan, Prince of Wales check and houndstooth have blanketed the Paris catwalk from the bold, blocky lumberjack tartans at retro Dior to the acid plaid of young guns Ottolinger and Marine Serre to India\'s Rahul Mishra.\nThey were a key element at Loewe and in Lanvin\'s romantic revival, and Hedi Slimane relied heavily on them for the handbrake turn he performed at Celine, going from skinny black-clad rock chick waifs to horsey culotte-wearing country types in pussy bow blouses and boyfriend jackets.\nChloe mixed understated grey and brown check suits, trousers and skirts with nifty mid-calf red tartan boots, while Virgil Abloh sent out his Off-White supermodels onto a chequerboard set with Gigi Hadid dressed as a chequered ""super-shero"" (she hero).\nLoewe invented its own tartan while Andreas Kronthaler, who now designs for his wife Vivienne Westwood – the woman who brought red tartan back into fashion with punk – packed his ultra glamorous show with houndstooth.\n3. YOU CAN\'T TOP A HAT\nUntil Hedi Slimane radically changed tack Friday, Celine and Saint Laurent had been in danger of becoming mirror images of each other, Slimane having long led YSL.\nNo surprise then that both now insist on hats with Slimane sending out gaucho riding hats at Celine while Anthony Vaccarello opted for silky fedoras at Saint Laurent. Both looked cooler than cool.\nDior put a retro bucket hat on every one of its models and Nina Ricci turned up the 1950s vibe a further notch with huge cloche hats big enough to store your sandwiches in.\nLanvin went for a more romantic tone with a series of dreamy outsized sou\'westers.\n4. POWER FLOWERS\nParis catwalks did not go all floral with the first shoots of northern hemisphere spring, but flowers made big statements in several collections.\nThe Flemish master Dries Van Noten said it with roses with gorgeous acidulated prints of blossoms from his garden, while Japan\'s Junya Watanabe spliced together an array of floral and paisley patterns for his more street collection.\nFellow Antwerper Christian Wijnants was so on trend he had both flower print and tartan suits in a collection of such vividness that it could brighten the dullest Belgian winter day.\nLeonard packed a whole garden centre into its iris and fuchsia-heavy designs while French brand Kenzo upped the vegetal ante with huge tomato and red pepper prints.\nOver at Saint Laurent Vaccarello used rich dark petal bursts to break the slick monotony of his midnight blacks.\n(Source: AFP)\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Luxury Looks ']}"

      Creative Capital: These siblings want to make their sunglasses the next big thing 'since chicken rice'
  </h1>, 'text': 'Rocket Eyewear is fast becoming\xa0the cool kids’ brand in the Lion City, but it all started from a simple desire: Siblings Ong Ker-Shing and En Ming Ong noticed their mother kept losing her sunglasses and wanted to give her one.\nAll their life, she only wore one style of frames, the P3. First developed by the British military, it has long become one of the most iconic styles of glasses (and sunglasses) around, and celebs ranging from John F Kennedy to Grace Kelly and James Dean have all been spotted sporting P3s.\nThe siblings – who had also collaborated on the popular but now-defunct chilli sauce business Two Rabbits Smoky Chilli – decided to make their own version of these frames as a gift for their mother. She liked them so much, she asked for a few more pairs. The rest is history. Rocket sells only one style, the P3, but in a myriad of colors and, smartly, two types of nose bridges.\nToday, Shing juggles duties as Rocket Eyewear’s chief designer with her other responsibilities as a partner in the architecture firm Lekker and numerous teaching gigs, while\xa0Ming runs the company.\nHere, in CNA Lifestyle\'s series, where we speak with creatives making their mark in Singapore, the Ong siblings talk about turning Rocket Eyewear Company into\xa0“Singapore’s biggest export since chicken rice”.\nHOW DO YOU CREATE THE SUNGLASSES? WHAT’S THE PROCESS LIKE?\nMing: In hindsight, choosing to focus on just one shape has added a magical simplicity to our production. Whereas other companies have to spread their energies across various different SKUs (stock keeping units), we focus all our energy on making a single kickass product.\xa0\n\n\nIn terms of what we do, Shing comes up with the colours, and I work with the manufacturer to turn the concepts into reality. Regarding manufacturing, we were very lucky because we have a family friend based in China whose family has been in the eyewear industry for over 30 years.\xa0\nWe think Singaporeans are excited to get behind a brand like Rocket because it\'s aspirational and authentic at the same time.\nShe liked our idea and through her, we had the privilege to work directly with the best manufacturers from the beginning – the very same ones who make for the world\'s biggest luxury brands.\nDO YOU THINK YOU’LL EVENTUALLY ADD ANOTHER STYLE TO THE COLLECTION?\nMing: Right from the beginning, we decided we wanted to start a hyper-focused company that specialised in doing one thing really well. It may not be the smartest business decision, but we don\'t plan on adding more styles to Rocket.\nWe built this brand because we believe that people should have access to gorgeous, functional glasses that won’t break the bank. Rockets are based on a classic, flattering shape designed with a travel-inspired twist.\xa0\nWe think of our sunglasses a little like a polo t-shirt: The style pretty much stays the same, with experimentation and variation happening with the colours, materials, et cetera.\nANY CHANCE OF PRESCRIPTION LENSES OR READING GLASSES IN THE NEAR FUTURE?\nMing: Actually, we do a tonne of prescription Rockets because let\'s face it, most of us Singaporeans are half-blind. There are even a number of people walking around town (myself included) who wear Rockets as reading glasses! You just need to get in touch with us and let us know your lens specs.\n\n\nA LOT OF SIBLINGS CAN’T WORK TOGETHER AND YET, THIS IS YOUR SECOND BUSINESS TOGETHER. HOW DO YOU DO IT?\nMing: Shing handles everything design-related, whereas given my experience with startups, I\'m better at translating the ideas into reality. Another reason we work well together is that we\'re both pragmatic and logic-oriented.\nDO YOU THINK SINGAPORE IS SUPPORTIVE OF LOCAL BRANDS AND CREATIVES?\nMing: Extremely. We were really surprised by how eager and willing people in Singapore were to support a local brand like us. We think Singaporeans are excited to get behind a brand like Rocket because it\'s aspirational and authentic at the same time. And we\'re very proud about our heritage: we literally say it in the first line of our story: ""We\'re Ming and Shing, a brother-and-sister team from Singapore...""\n\n\nInstitutional support has also been really strong. We owe an incredible amount of gratitude to pop-up events like Keepers and Boutique Fairs; local attractions like Gallery & Co and Tanjong Beach Club; hotels like COMO, and organisations like TAFF and STB for taking a chance on us. We\'re very lucky.\nWHAT’S THE HARDEST PART ABOUT RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS?\nShing: I have found that the hardest part of running my business(es) is learning not to be afraid of being the hard stop. At Lekker, I am always exhorting my staff to run through issues and try to decide themselves how to proceed, because I am asked about a hundred questions each day. They made me a poster that hangs over my desk; it reads “Make your own decisions (then check with me).”\nSHING, YOU WERE ALSO BEHIND THE DESIGN SHOP STRANGELETS. DID THAT EXPERIENCE HELP INFORM THE DECISIONS YOU’VE MADE WITH ROCKET?\nShing: Absolutely. When we started Strangelets, one of the things we were really excited about was that we would choose beautiful things for the store, and place them there. We thought “customers can just come in and see the stuff and decide if they like it or not, and either take it or leave it.” But you know, when they don’t take it, you don’t sell, and you lose money!\xa0\nSo we learned how to compromise, to have things that we like, that we think are beautiful and that set the overall tone of the store, and also to have other objects that were less… esoteric perhaps, or less aesthetically subjective. So at Rocket, for example, even though I personally do not like black sunglasses, a huge percentage of people do, and so we will always have our glasses in black.\nTHE BIG TREND THESE DAYS IS COLLABORATIONS. WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK WITH?\nMing: Kim Kardashian, obviously… kidding! We’d love to come up with a limited edition range for the Pink Dot Festival this year!\nFINALLY, WHAT HAPPENED TO TWO RABBITS SMOKY CHILLI? I LOVED IT!\nMing: We decided to stop selling chilli because the market size in Singapore is too small, and shipping a S$12 bottle of chilli around the world isn\'t terribly feasible! It\'s a shame we had to shut down the business though because even to this day, we get about 10 messages a week from hungry customers asking where they can get it!\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Style tip: How to look taller than you really are – it isn't just about heels
  </h1>, 'text': 'There are distinct benefits to being tall –\xa0not only can you avoid the hassle of getting every pair of jeans you buy shortened, you can carry off most looks, fashion-wise, with ease and confidence.\nBut, don’t fret if you are petite or short –\xa0who says you can’t own a sense of style with equal aplomb? Just look at famous folks like Zoe Kravitz, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman, who all are barely 1.6m tall yet counted among the chicest dressers of their celebrity cohort.\nYes, we know, they have professional stylists at their beck and call. But you won’t require one to help you dress to look taller –\xa0all you need is to learn to enhance your body proportions with the right type of accessories and clothes. There’s a lot more you can do than just simply putting on a pair of sky-high heels.\nANKLE-CUT PANTS\nHeel-skimming flares are unfortunately not made for the short girl. Instead, go for pants and jeans that are cut at the ankle –\xa0they create the illusion of longer legs. Skinny jeans are okay but don’t pick a pair with hems that wrap too tightly around the ankle –\xa0they tend to emphasise the actual length of your lower legs.\nGO HIGH-WAIST \nIf you have a long torso (relative to the length of your legs), make high-waist bottoms your best friends. They’ll balance out your body proportions by visually raising your waistline, making you look leggier.\n\n\nTRY MONOCHROME\nKeeping to a single hue (or shades of one colour) from top to toe creates a uniform column of colour that is visually heightening. Alternatively, stick to a palette of similar or complementary colours instead of “chopping up” your silhouette with contrasting shades.\nTAILORED AND FITTED\nPetite frames can easily be “lost” in blousy, voluminous outfits and also clothes that bear too many large accents such as ruffles and flounces. What you need are well-fitted pieces with clean lines that define your silhouette –\xa0they won’t overwhelm your frame but, instead, will make you appear slimmer and thus taller.\nCROPPED TOPS\nWe don’t mean that you should go exposing your bare waist. Pick tops that end above the hip or nearer your natural waistline for a flattering, leg-lengthening effect not unlike what you’ll get from high-waist bottoms.\nTorso-elongating tunic tops are not your best bet –\xa0if you must wear them, be sure to pair them with fitted bottoms and heels.\n\n\nSMALL BAGS\nKeep away from XL-sized bags or long totes –\xa0they’ll simply make you look like a little girl who’s carrying her mother’s bag. Small and compact work better for you and there are plenty of options out there – how about a clutch, cross-body, shoulder or top-handle bag?\nWAIST BELTS\nA waist belt is a handy accessory for cinching in a loose top or dress to help you define your waist. Just remember to go for the skinny ones instead of the chunky wide belts that will make your silhouette look broader and thus shorter.\nNUDE HEELS\nA pair of nude heels is a great asset every woman, petite or not, should own. Here’s why: They’ll match everything you throw on. Find a pair that matches your skin tone –even better if they have a low vamp and pointed toe – and enjoy the instantly elongating effect they have on your silhouette.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Ladies: Here’s how to style yourself to look instantly slimmer – weight loss, optional
  </h1>, 'text': 'Hands up, if you’ve been there – the quest to shed\xa0weight to fit better in\xa0clothes. We are all for exercise and a healthy diet, but at the same time, a girl’s gotta learn to embrace her curves.\nThe most savvy dressers\xa0aren’t those who are the most ""fashionable"";\xa0they are the ones who know what to wear to not only look like a million bucks, but also look taller and a few pounds lighter.\nYou certainly don’t need to be stick-thin to look sharp, stylish and well put together.\xa0All you have to do is follow these rules.\nDEFINE YOUR SHAPE\n\n\nA post shared by Kylie �� (@kyliejenner)\nWe are so fixated on putting together an outfit, we sometimes neglect what goes underneath it. Never underestimate the power of shapewear – the right kind can help you look slimmer in every outfit.\nThe key is to find shapewear that holds in everything –\xa0be it your bust, waist, butt or thighs – perfectly. Beware of going too tight as\xa0that will only make you look pudgy\xa0by creating VPLs and unsightly bulges.\nFor the sleekest fit, buy shapewear in a size larger (or two, if the fabric feels exceptionally tight) than your usual undergarment size.\nWEAR BLACK IN THE RIGHT SPOTS\n\n\nA post shared by Dior Official (@dior)\nThere’s a reason why black is universally loved – it instantly hides (almost) all of our figure imperfections. But while we understand the desire to get one LBD after another,\xa0there’s no fun in a wardrobe that consists of just one colour.\nSo, don’t be afraid to experiment with light and bright hues;\xa0you just need to pair them appropriately with separates in darker colours. Bottom-heavy? Even out your silhouette by wearing a light-toned top with dark indigo jeans or a black skirt. Light colours tend to have a visually enlarging effect, while dark colours recede, doing the opposite.\nIT’S ALL ABOUT THE CUT\n\n\nA post shared by Song Hye Kyo | 송헤교 (@songhyekyo.ig)\nNot only do structured and tailored styles make you look put-together, they also nip in your figure at the right places. These usually come in fabrics that are thicker and generally stiffer, and have a slimming effect since they won’t cling to your body in areas where you don’t want them to.\nThink pieces like a well-cut white shirt and blazer, pants of the perfect length, or a form-fitting pencil skirt that skims your shape without being skin tight. These don’t just work for office hours,\xa0they can also be paired with casual separates such as jeans or a T-shirt.\nGO LOOSE ON TOP\n\n\nA post shared by Tiffany & Co. (@tiffanyandco)\nTighter doesn’t necessarily equate to slimmer, especially for curvy girls. Besides structured pieces, as mentioned above, loose styles such as a blouson top or cocoon sweater in the right cut can also be figure-flattering, provided you wear them with fitted bottoms such as pants or jeans with tapered legs.\nLAYER UP\n\n\nA post shared by Victoria Beckham (@victoriabeckham)\nWhen in doubt, just cover up – outerwear can disguise figure flaws in a flash. Go for length such as\xa0hip-grazing styles to help hide bulges around your torso and bum. Try a blazer with a nipped-in waist, or a long cardigan in a not-too-flimsy material.\nACCESSORISE TO SIZE\n\n\nA post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo)\nJewellery, belts and bags are not just the finishing touches to your outfit, they can also make you look thinner, if you know how to use them to enhance the proportions of your body.\nHere’s the general rule: The larger the accessory, the smaller you will tend to look wearing it. Think cuff bracelets, statement necklaces, a broader waist belt or a good-sized tote – but not all at once, of course. Leave the itty-bitty pieces to the petite ladies.\nBOOST YOUR HEIGHT\nA post shared by Jimmy Choo (@jimmychoo)\nAny other clothing or accessory that helps visually elongate your proportions will naturally have a slimming effect. Pointed heels, for one, are always a good bet\xa0as well as leg-lengthening ankle-cut pants.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Chanel's style circus to roll on despite loss of Lagerfeld
  </h1>, 'text': 'The death of legendary designer Karl Lagerfeld leaves a huge hole at the head of Chanel, but the fashion juggernaut is in such rude health it is likely to power on without him, analysts say.\nThe workaholic German turned around the fading fortunes of Coco Chanel\'s iconic house in his 36 years in charge, setting the template for the modern luxury fashion industry.\n\n\nWhen the iconoclastic Lagerfeld took over in 1983, the brand was dowdy and somewhat doddery, but by hitching its rich heritage to the supermodel sass of Linda Evangelista and Claudia Schiffer he made its clothes the armour in which women began to break the glass ceiling.\nHe had previously performed a similar miracle for the Fendi sisters in Italy, turning what the New York Times called a ""boring bourgeois (Roman) furrier into a hip fashion name"".\nSuch was their gratitude that the brand took out a full-page black-trimmed advert in the newspaper Wednesday (Feb 20) to thank ""Karl for the most beautiful journey. With all our love, your Fendi family.""\nWith the label now worth US$3.8 billion (3.3 billion euros), they had a lot to thank him for.\nAt Chanel he did the same thing but on an even bigger scale, making it one of the three richest luxury houses in the world.\nEver the showman, he packed Paris\' enormous Grand Palais with celebrities for his spectacular shows.\nSALES OF US$9.6 BILLION\nUntil last year the real scale of his financial success at Chanel was kept secret. But in June the Wertheimer family who own the brand released figures for the first time showing sales of US$9.62 billion in 2017.\nThat put them ahead of Gucci and just behind Louis Vuitton as the biggest luxury fashion label, although much of Vuitton\'s profits come from sales of bags and luggage.\nEven without Lagerfeld, whose name became synonymous with the brand, Chanel is still ""a Ferrari of the luxury world"", analyst Luca Solca of Bernstein Consulting told AFP.\n""There is no doubt that the house is in a very strong position,"" he said.\nSolca said Chanel had the ""ideal business model"", with its handmade haute couture collections allowing it to ""keep its prices high"", while its perfumes and cosmetics ""also appeal to the middle classes, who can get into the brand through its fragrances or lipstick"".\nIn fact, Lagerfeld\'s death could push up sales even further with ""very strong interest in his final collections which could almost become collectors\' items,"" he added.\nWithin hours of the designer\'s death at the age of 85 on Tuesday, Chanel said Virginie Viard -\xa0who Lagerfeld has called his ""right and left hand"" -\xa0would be stepping into his shoes as creative director.\n\n\nSolca believes that ""a few new ideas"" would do Chanel no harm. ""There is a big hunger for novelty right now with brands like Gucci and Balenciaga"" breaking records with edgy and irreverent collections.\n\'UNSINKABLE\' BRAND\n""Chanel is a myth, the brand has such power that it is unsinkable,"" insisted Eric Briones, one of the founders of Paris School of Luxury.\n""In fact, following Karl should be fairly easy stylistically because he did not impose his own look but instead riffed on the base"" of Coco Chanel\'s classic themes.\n""It\'s even a great chance to bring new life into Chanel,"" Briones added.\nMore difficult will be finding someone with Lagerfeld\'s gift for making headlines.\n""What will be tough is following Karl in terms of image, marketing and communication,"" Briones told AFP.\nLagerfeld was also a phenomenal workhorse, putting out an average of 14 collections a year for Chanel and Fendi as well as overseeing his own label well into his eighties -\xa0a pace that would have burnt out many half his age.\n""He has become a model for so many other creators,"" Briones said. ""He worked so hard, managed to please everyone, and was totally free in what he said - totally ignoring political correctness,"" he added.\nIndeed he could often be ""staggeringly straight-talking"" without somehow ever damaging the brand, said Arnaud Cadart of Flornoy management consultants.\n\n\nCadart sees few problems on the horizon, arguing that ""other great houses have managed to survive the loss of great creators like Yves Saint Laurent or Christian Dior.""\n""The brand is a more important than the designer, and Virginie Viard, who worked alongside Lagerfeld for 30 years, had quite a bit to do with that success,"" Cadart added.\nFashion, however, is a notoriously fickle business. The British designer Phoebe Philo -\xa0formerly of Celine - who has a large feminist following, is often mooted as a possible longterm replacement for Lagerfeld.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      Who is Virginie Viard, the woman replacing Karl Lagerfeld as head of Chanel?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Following the passing of Karl Lagerfeld yesterday evening (Feb 19), Chanel has appointed his longtime collaborator Virginie Viard as creative director of the brand.\nIn a statement, the House Of Chanel named Viard “Karl Lagerfeld’s\xa0closest collaborator for more than 30 years” and entrusted her with “the creative work for the collections, so that the legacy of Gabrielle Chanel and\xa0Karl Lagerfeld can live on”.\n\n\nLagerfeld had said of Viard in the Netflix documentary series 7 Days Out: ""Virginie is the most important person, not only for me but also for the atelier, for everything. She is my right arm and even if I don\'t see her, we are on the phone all the time"".\xa0\nViard started at Chanel as an intern for haute couture embroidery in 1987, just four years after Lagerfeld became creative director of the iconic French brand. She was introduced to Lagerfeld by Prince Rainier of Monaco’s chamberlain, marking the beginning of a 32-year-long relationship.\nThe granddaughter of silk manufacturers, a young Viard started her career in costume design for films and plays.

      Men: The simple style rules for dressing to look slimmer than you are
  </h1>, 'text': 'So, you went a little too far with the Chinese New Year binge. But it’s too late for regrets now. The loose-fit jeans are feeling\xa0a little snug and the weighing scale is screaming red alert.\nPlus, your buddy set up you up on a date with his hot, new colleague.\xa0You need to look like your pre-binge self. Pronto.\nWhat can you\xa0do?\nThe most important thing is to identify the type of body shape you have and work on drawing attention away from the not-so-flattering bits. And no, you don’t have to\xa0slave at the gym nor diet to look good in clothes.\xa0\nHere are some styling tricks that can help you look like you’ve lost 5kg without the hard work.\xa0\nPROPORTIONS\n\n\nA post shared by Common Suits (@commonsuits) on Oct 3, 2017 at 3:05am PDT\nJavin They, founder of Common Suits, a homegrown company that offers bespoke suit service, said\xa0that if you’re short and stout, your clothes should try to “elongate your body and de-emphasise breadth”.\nChoose high-rise trousers to lengthen the leg line visually; they should fit on your natural waist and not below protruding stomach.\nFashion stylist Damian Huang added: “Opt for straight-fitting trousers if you’re a little on the heavy side. Skinny trousers will make your body look disproportionately large.”\nWhen it comes to shirt collars, They says that longer, straight-point shirt collars balance out a\xa0round face. When making a suit, wider lapels are more flattering for bigger\xa0girths.\nAlso, your jacket length should be long enough to cover your abdomen fully, with a slight taper in the waist to create a V-shape silhouette. Alternatively, consider a waistcoat to conceal your mid section, They suggested.\nAnother styling tip is to pick V-neck collars over round ones – the V-shape elongates your neck and can make you look slimmer than you really are.\nAlso, avoid baggy clothes. It’s a common misconception that the looser your clothes are, the more they’re going to hide your flaws. On the contrary, baggy outfits make you look sloppy and even larger. Remember: Fit is king.\n\n\nFABRIC\n\n\nA post shared by Hyun Bin | 현빈 (@withhyunbin) on Oct 31, 2018 at 6:51am PDT\nAs for your\xa0suit\'s fabric, They suggests a “medium-to-heavy weight cloth such as high twist wool and mohair” that has some structure and body so your suit “hangs nicely"".\nCOLOURS AND PATTERNS\n\n\n Thank you @gq #gqmanoftheyear2018 an honor\nA post shared by  Jonah Hill (@jonahhill) on Dec 7, 2018 at 7:27pm PST\nPick fabrics in dark, solid colours, or with medium-width stripes or\xa0herringbone\xa0because they minimise the emphasis on bulk, said They.\nHuang also suggested\xa0wearing “dark, solid colours to camouflage heft” and to avoid lighter hues which can play up your size.\xa0Besides picking the right colour, he also stressed\xa0that not all stripes are flattering.\n\n\nA post shared by Common Suits (@commonsuits) on Apr 7, 2018 at 8:31pm PDT\n“The wider the\xa0stripes, the more they\xa0draw\xa0attention outwards,” he said. “Narrow\xa0stripes, on the other hand, create the illusion of a slimmer silhouette. Most importantly, avoid horizontal strips which can make you look bigger than you already are.”\nIf you must wear printed shirts, opt for smaller patterns such as small checks and floral prints. This way, your shirt won’t draw attention to your body.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      Remembering Karl Lagerfeld's love for his 'kept woman': His cat Choupette
  </h1>, 'text': 'The passing of legendary fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld on Tuesday (Feb 19) has undoubtedly left an impact on the fashion world. But there is one superstar who might be most affected by the Kaiser\'s passing. And she was the love of his life.\nChoupette, Lagerfeld\'s\xa0blue-eyed Birman cat, lives in one of Lagerfeld’s many residences in Paris, eating off silverware and keeping company with\xa0“exceptional” guests like Caroline de Monaco, who also has a cat.\nThe blue-eyed beauty\xa0had belonged to model\xa0Baptiste Giabiconi, who left her\xa0with Lagerfeld during his\xa0travels in August 2011. Lagerfeld\xa0was so besotted with the cat\xa0that he refused to return the ""divine creature""\xa0to her owner.\n""I never thought that I would fall in love like this with a cat,"" Lagerfeld said in an interview with CNN interview.\nWhile it is not known who will be looking after\xa0Choupette – which means “sweetie” in French\xa0– it is very likely Lagerfeld had made arrangements for her. In 2015, he told\xa0The Cut that his little princess was the “most famous” and “richest” cat in the world, having made\xa0US$3 million in a year through endorsements with Japanese beauty brand Shu Uemura and a German car company.\n“She has her own little fortune,"" Lagerfeld told Vanity Fair. ""If anything happens to me, the person who will take care of her will not be in poverty.”\nHere\'s a look back on how Lagerfeld showered little\xa0Choupette with every luxury known to cat-kind.\n\n\nSHE\'S A \'KEPT WOMAN\'\nThe Birman beauty hates being alone at home, and doesn’t like being left in the dark. To keep her company are\xa0two ladies-in-waiting (one for the night, one for the day) as well as\xa0a body guard to keep her safe.\xa0Madame Francoise, Choupette’s favourite maid, keeps a diary of the eight-year-old’s every move.\n""Even if she sleeps, she doesn’t want to be alone,” said Lagerfeld. “She’s like a chic lady, like a kept woman with her personal maid.\n\n\nSHE WORKS, OKAY?\nThe kitty\xa0has two books under her fluffy belt – Choupette: The Private Life Of A\xa0High Flying Cat, and What’s Right Meow.\nShe was also the face of Shupette, a makeup line by Shu Uemura, a car model for the Opel Corsa 2015 calendar as well as muse for Lagerfeld’s titular label.\nWHEN DINING\xa0OUT\nEvery Wednesday, Choupette dined\xa0with Lagerfeld and ate out of custom-made Goyard or Louis Vuitton silver bowls filled only with fresh food.\nOnly water cocktails from Colette\'s Water Bar wet her whiskers. These are made with a quarter of Chantemerle still water and\xa0four other assorted waters from the Swiss Alps, Britain, Germany and Sweden.\nEven chefs fawn over her. Chef Ozuru (formerly of Nobu Paris) and other culinary magnates have created special dishes like Japanese-styled beef or chicken gelee with asparagus especially for her. As for special kitty treats, Choupette gets the\xa0finest caviar\xa0– approved by Dr Yola Horn, one of Paris’ most upmarket vet, of course.\n\n\nTHEY USED TO\xa0JET-SET TOGETHER\nParis, New York, Rome, Dallas, Monte Carlo in winter and Provence in summer... Choupette followed wherever\xa0the Kaiser went. And in no less than a custom-built luggage by Louis Vuitton and Goyard.\xa0And by private jet, of course.\nSHE\'S A BEAUTY QUEEN\nChoupette\'s must-have accessory: A customised Cheshire & Wain collar.\xa0Her coat is brushed four times a day and she maintains an ideal weight of 3.5kg. The blue-eyed beauty hates manicures and to accommodate her, Lagerfeld wore mittens around her.\nSHE HAS HER OWN IPAD\xa0–\xa0AND SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGER\nNo, really.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ']}"

      The denim guide: How to make your butt look amazing in jeans 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Pop culture\xa0started us on an unhealthy obsession with butts. Cue\xa0Bootylicious by Destiny’s Child, My Humps by Black Eyed Peas, All About That Bass by Meghan Trainor, and contrast that with how the world’s highest-paid models and actors tend to be owners of tiny, perky, barely-there behinds.\nThankfully, peachy perfection – ok, let’s just say improvement – can be attained with the right pair of jeans.\xa0Here’s how.\n\n\nBIG BUTTS\nYou find jeans shopping a real pain in the ass because most tend to be too tight on the derriere but\xa0too loose in other places. Or, they make your butt look even bigger.\nSTYLE AND FIT\nAvoid low-rise styles as they’re likely to result in you flashing plumber’s crack. Skinny jeans are not your best friend\xa0as the narrow ankles just serve to emphasise how much bigger and wider your butt is in comparison. Stay away from cropped styles, too, as they tend to make legs look shorter and draw attention to your width.\nInstead, opt for mid- to high-rise styles, so there’s enough coverage for your hips, thighs and butt.\xa0\nNote also that the stretchier the denim (it should ideally be in selvedge denim, and contain polyester and Lycra and/or elasthane), the better the jeans will mould to your butt for a much-needed lifting and shaping effect. A slim, straight or regular fit helps create a long, lean line from waist to ankle, while a slight flare or boot cut can help balance your proportions.\n\n\nWASH\nDark and plain all round is the way to go. You want to pay extra attention to the back pockets; ones that are too small or set too far apart make your butt look bigger in comparison. It also helps if the bottom seam of the pocket ends above your butt crease, drawing the eye upwards.\nWEAR WITH\nLong tops in any colour\xa0that cover your butt. Make sure the tops are made of a stiffer or thicker fabric, so they skim over your behind\xa0rather than cling to it.\xa0\nFor women, a chic alternative is a waterfall-hem top with a shorter front and longer back. Make sure your footwear has some heft, too, so opt\xa0for chunkier shoes with thicker treads.\n\n\nSMALL OR NO BUTT\nDespite most people envying your petite rear, you find that\xa0jeans tend to pack too much fabric in the crotch and seat areas, creating a baggy, droopy look.\nSTYLE AND FIT\nWe say, lucky you, as you can get away with experimenting with all those far-out denim trends that most other mortals are warned to steer clear of.\xa0\nThe only styles you should avoid are low-rise styles (these might fall right off you), and overly relaxed or baggy styles that make you look like too skinny.\nA high-rise skinny, regular-fit or boyfriend style in a thicker fabric helps create an illusion of fullness where there isn’t. For women, feel free to play with edgy styles such as a paperbag waists, highly tapered pants, or super wide-legged cropped or flared styles.\xa0\nWe don’t recommend ultra-skinny jeans for guys, unless you’re going for an emaciated rock-star look. But this style can help women make the most of their curves.\nWASH \nWhile we warn everyone else to stick to dark colours, you, on the other hand, are free to wear anything that draws attention to your behind, from blinding whites, neon brights, bold primary colours, pale denims, and even acid wash.\nA faded/sand-blasted wash on the butt area can give the appearance of a more bodacious booty, as can tiny back pockets set further apart towards the hips, and those with front flaps, or bold embroidery, patchwork or bling details.\nWEAR WITH\nGuys, tuck in your tops and wear a belt in a bright or contrasting colour to your jeans. This draws the eye upwards away from your skinny behind. Another option is to wear a top that ends at the widest part of your hips.\nLadies, do as the above, and also feel free to try on peplum, or fit-and-flare tops\xa0–\xa0and even belted shirt-dresses\xa0over your straight-leg, regular or skinny fit jeans.\xa0\nPair wide-legged, flared, paperbag-waist and cropped styles with close-fitting tops (tucked in) to make your top and bottom halves appear more balanced, and your figure, curvier.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      The denim guide: Score the perfect pair of jeans to slim down thunder thighs
  </h1>, 'text': ""Maybe it’s genetics. Maybe it's\xa0the result of your thrice-weekly spin\xa0class,\xa0or one too many barbell squats that have led to\xa0those muscular thighs.\nWhatever the cause, it’s practically impossible to pin\xa0down a pair of jeans that fits you perfectly. You either struggle to pull them past your thighs and hips, or the waistband is too big.\xa0\nFor men, you can’t squat down in your jeans without crushing the life out of your family jewels, or fearing\xa0that you’d\xa0bust the butt seam. Women\xa0dread being immortalised in\xa0their friends’ Instagram wefies with a camel toe.\nWe feel your pain (from the jeans chafing against your inner thighs as well). The good thing is, it’s probably because you’ve been approaching jeans-shopping the wrong way.\xa0Here’s what to look for/do instead.\n\n\nSTYLE AND FIT \nRegular straight cut, boot cut, trouser cut or slightly tapered jeans that fall below your ankles without pooling around your shoes are your best bet.\xa0\nThese create the most flattering, form-fitting silhouette for your body type, helping to elongate your bottom half, while balancing out your upper and lower legs.\nOpt for a medium to high rise\xa0in a fabric with about 1-per-cent Lycra or elastane for a bit of stretch. Cuffed hems can help to draw attention towards the ankles and feet, distracting from the size of your thighs.\nAvoid overly wide-legged fits as they make the entire leg (as opposed to just the thigh) look thick. A low-rise style draws attention to your problem areas, such as your hips and thighs, and makes them look even bigger, while making legs appear shorter.\nOverly tapered and cropped styles merely emphasise the contrast between heavy thighs and skinny calves/ankles, which can make you look disproportionately off-kilter.\xa0The exception: Women can get away with\xa0these styles if they’re\xa0wearing heels, wedges or platforms. Women with small waists can also try a high-rise style for a sexy, curvy effect.\nFor women: A\xa0cropped kick flare or extra-wide cuff can help draw attention to slim calves, well-turned ankles and kick-ass shoes.\nRemember to check\xa0for a contoured pitch as well;\xa0this refers to how the waistband is curved such that the back sits higher than the front. This helps minimise the likelihood of gaping at the waistband.\nWASH \nMedium to dark washes and colours help thighs look slimmer. Avoid details such as whiskering at the hips. A vertical fade down the middle of the thigh on a medium-fade jeans can have a slimming and elongating effect (think the Kardashian Kontour, but for your legs).\nWEAR WITH\nGuys, avoid wearing tops that end below the hips; instead,\xa0opt\xa0for those that sit at the waist or just above the hips. Better still, wear your tops tucked in. Opt for a contrasting or bright colour, or even a print to draw attention to your upper body. A belt in a contrasting colour is also a good way to distract from your thighs.\xa0\nPay attention to what goes onto your feet, so you’ll be known as “the guy with snazzier socks than Justin Trudeau” or “the guy with the coolest shoes”, instead of “the guy with thunder thighs”.\nLadies, follow the guys in keeping your tops above the hip level.\xa0If your upper body is in good shape, take a tip from Serena and Venus Williams and rock those tight tanks, spaghetti straps, toga,\xa0peplum tops and cropped tees. These help ensure all eyes will be on your upper half.\xa0\nComplete the look with fancy footwear. Another alternative is to wear side-split tunic tops that camouflage your thighs while elongating your side leg.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The denim guide: How to find the perfect pair of plus-size jeans
  </h1>, 'text': 'Are you carrying extra jelly in your belly, or packing too much junk in your trunk?\nIt’s our last intention to engage in any fat-shaming here – we’d recommend regular exercise (at least 150 minutes a week) and a healthy diet to everyone and anyone, even to Victoria’s Secret models.\nIn the meantime, finding the right pair of jeans to flatter your plus-size figure, and the right top to wear over it, can go a long way in solving the myriad wardrobe woes that heavier-set individuals face. Such as muffin top, belly overhang, overstuffed-sausage legs, builder’s crack and a bad-ass case of badunkadonk.\n\n\nForget skinny jeans, here’s how to look skinny in jeans:\nSTYLE AND FIT\nLearning what to avoid is extremely crucial when it comes to dressing slimmer.\nNever, ever fall under the illusion that ultra-skinny jeans can make a plus-sized person look skinny.\xa0\nMen end up with a curvy, girly-looking figure, which we doubt you want. Larger ladies, however, can get away with skinny jeans when worn with high heels or platforms.\nBaggy jeans are not a good look as they tend to make you look shorter and bulkier than you are. Flared or bootcut jeans can make legs look thicker and stumpier. One exception: tall heavier-set women can get away with bootcut jeans if they wear high heels. Cropped jeans are another no-no as they’re more suited for slimmer frames.\nAvoid anything too tight around the waist. Instead of holding all that extra jelly, it’ll just make any lumps and bumps you’ve got look even more obvious. Plus, it’s also extremely uncomfortable.\nSteer clear of low-rise jeans as they accentuate wide hips and are prone to exposing your belly overhang when you reach your arms up, and your butt crack when you bend over. High-rise waists aren’t a good idea as they can make you look like Humpy Dumpty or Batman’s nemesis, The Penguin.\nInstead, opt for relaxed-fit, standard cut or straight-leg jeans with a medium rise, in as long a length as possible without pooling above your footwear to create the most streamlined silhouette possible for your body type. It also helps to get your jeans in a medium-weight fabric with a slight stretch.\xa0\n\n\nWASH\nGo as dark as possible: think deep indigo, forest green, charcoal grey and black. Avoid any embellishments such as diamante, embroidery, patches, rips, fading, whiskering.\nBACK POCKET\nThese should be on the larger side to match your behind, not placed too far apart, and set low. They should be as plain as possible, meaning no decorative elements, no flap pockets etc, to avoid drawing too much attention to your derriere. Avoid carrying anything in your jeans pockets, so as not to add extra visual bulk to your silhouette.\nWEAR WITH\nGuys, make ‘body skimming’ the rule. Plain V-neck tops, and smart collared shirts help draw attention upwards while elongating the neck. Darker colours help create the illusion of a slimmer upper body, while effortlessly matching your dark jeans to create a long, unbroken line.\nTops should be hip-length and ideally be left untucked. Avoid patterned tops except for vertical pinstripes and plaids or camouflage print in dark, subdued hues.\nA coloured belt serves to emphasize the size of your waist.\nSingle-breasted jackets are the most flattering cover-up for layering, helping round bodies to look more angular.\nLadies, follow the above tips in terms of V-necks, hip-length tops and darker colours. But you get extra leeway too. Lower necklines, and three-quarter-length sleeves are a great way to show a bit of skin without letting too much flesh spill out.\nIf you have an hourglass figure, empire-waist or fit-and-flare tops are super-flattering. A bold-coloured top, or one that’s strategically colour-blocked is a sophisticated way to make an eye-catching fashion statement while drawing attention away from your butt and thighs.\nMake sure the footwear you choose balances out your proportions and your jeans. Avoid anything too dainty and flat (eg: ballet flats, slim rubber flip flops, stilettoes), and instead, opt for block heels, platforms, and wedges to make you look taller and slimmer. If you need to layer up, hip-length waterfall cardigans are your best bet.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The denim guide: Tips for short people to find the perfect pair of jeans
  </h1>, 'text': ""So you're short. You can barely buy jeans off the rack without alteration required (in the adult section, at least). Those tall people will never understand your retail frustration.\nDon’t get mad – get even by adopting some nifty wardrobe strategies that fool everyone (yes, even yourself) into thinking you’re more lithe and leggy than you actually are.\n\n\nHere’s CNA Lifestyle’s guide to standing tall(er) in your denims.\nSTYLE AND FIT \nGo for slim straight or slim tapered styles that fit relatively close to the body to create a sleek, smooth body-lengthening silhouette.\xa0\nGuys, avoid baggy, flared, bootleg or wide-legged styles that can make you look stumpy. We’d also recommend steering clear of any super-tight/ultra-skinny/jegging styles as they have the effect of making petite men look like Christmas elves.\nLadies, you have more leeway because women’s fashion offers way more options. For example, try bootleg jeans with heeled boots or stilettos to add extra inches to your height. Or capris with a skin-baring camisole and platform sandals for a slim, gamine effect. Or jeggings with anything. Just put that camel toe away.\n\n\nRISE\nThis refers to the distance between the jeans’ waistband and crotch. A standard or medium rise helps to keep your proportions looking balanced.\nGuys, too high a rise will make you look like a kid waiting to grow into a pair of oversized jeans, and make your torso seem shorter.\nGo for slim straight or slim tapered styles that fit relatively close to the body to create a sleek, smooth body-lengthening silhouette.\xa0\nLadies, high-waist jeans can give a charming 50s effect if you’ve got a tiny waist and pair the jeans with a cute cropped top or tight tank.\nBoth genders: Too low a rise will make short legs look even shorter.\nINSEAM LENGTH \nThis refers to the distance between the jeans’ crotch and hem.\nZero in on the petite range. This reduces the chances that you'll\xa0need to send the jeans to the tailor to get the hems taken up, which could ruin the line of the jeans. But if your jeans are indeed too long, altering the hems such that the break sits just below the ankle, without bunching up above your shoe, is essential.\n\n\nWASH\nAny solid wash or colour will do, but avoid details such as rips at the knee, whiskering, faded patches at the thighs, and embellishments such as patches or embroidery. These things just\xa0\xa0distract from the long, lean line you’re trying to create.\nBACK POCKETS \nPockets that are too big, and too low, draw attention to the fact that your butt isn’t that far from the ground. As far as possible, do not\xa0add bulk by stuffing anything into the pockets for the same reason we’ve just stated.\nWEAR WITH\nGuys, whether it’s a tee, a casual short-sleeved shirt, a long-sleeved shirt, a sweater or a jacket, tops should be close-fitting, sit right above your hips, and in monochromatic colours.\nLadies, do as above and keep things close-fitting. Play around with footwear since heels, wedges, platforms and boots can add extra valuable inches. Avoid anything above 5 inches as you’ll look like you’re trying too hard. Plus your feet will probably hurt.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

If you’re wearing a floral print top, pair it with plain trousers and shoes so the floral print really pops, while the rest of your look is understated and masculine,"" he told CNA Lifestyle.\n""I wouldn’t recommend pairing florals with another print such as stripes. But if you want to go all out, pair florals with other florals!”\nThe Mediacorp leading man, who turned heads in his poppy print velour hoodie, and other Singapore celebrities got together at Marina Bay Sands last Friday night\xa0(Jan 25), as\xa0the glass-encased Louis Vuitton Island Maison was transformed into a twinkling rainbow prism.\nThe occasion? To celebrate the launch of Virgil Abloh’s debut collection as Men’s Artistic Director for the famed French luxury fashion house.\nFOLLOW THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD\nGuests who showed up for the party found the Island Maison decked out as a fairy-tale environment that brought the world of Oz to life.\nThey followed a winding, yellow brick road that meandered past displays of the latest apparel and accessories, video screens showing visuals from The Wizard Of Oz, and footage from the collection’s runway show that took place at the Palais Royal in Paris, pausing to take selfies against neon and LED backdrops featuring LV’s famed monograms.\nThen, they ascended a flight of rainbow-hued stairs to the party zone, where a DJ and handsome waiters bearing trays of canapes, champagne and rainbow-hued shots cranked up the mood.\n“I like the collection for its mix of luxury, street and comfort – and the bags are crazy, too,” said Tan. “My favourite one is the iridescent rainbow hologram monogram Keepall bag. I like how it combines shine, colour and transparency with classic LV elements such as the monogram and the bag design.”\nOther items in the collection include parkas, sneakers, the Millionaire sunglasses, shirts and sweaters featuring the four main Wizard Of Oz characters or poppy prints,\xa0cargo pants and day suits in 50 shades of “greige” – that’s grey plus beige, for the uninitiated – making a reference to Abloh’s own label, Off-white.\nPHILOSOPHY OF\xa0A NEW GENERATION\nNews of Abloh’s appointment, which took place in March 2018, attracted its fair share of controversy.\nAbloh is the first African-American to design a collection for Louis Vuitton. He grew up in the American Midwest, which isn\'t exactly known for its high fashion. As a teen enamoured with Air Jordans, he used to mail unsolicited shoe designs to Nike. But he received no formal training in fashion — instead, he obtained a degree in a civil engineering and a Masters in architecture. Along the way, he somehow became a DJ, then Kanye West’s right-hand man. In 2013, he set up high-end streetwear label Off-white.\nThis resulted in hordes of fashion-conscious youths queuing\xa0overnight for the privilege of dropping hundreds or thousands on clothing that looked\xa0just like normcore athletic gear – well, to older folk, anyway.\nIn 2017, Abloh was finally invited by Nike to re-imagine 10 of its most iconic sneaker designs.\nAnd now, here he is, introducing his street sensibilities to the world, via what is\xa0considered to be one of the world’s most venerable luxury marques.\nIt’s an irony that did not go unnoticed by Abloh himself, who created a lexicon called “The Vocabulary According to Virgil Abloh” to accompany his debut with Louis Vuitton. In it, “Irony” stands for “the philosophy of a new generation. The presence of Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton”.\nOther concepts? ""3%: the exact ratio needed to twist a normative object into something special”; “Accessomorphosis: a portmanteau describing the transformation of an accessory into a garment, effectively evolving its functional form”; and the motto “Good style is always off-putting”.\nInspired by 1939 movie The Wizard Of Oz, about a Midwestern ingenue who is transported to a fantasy land by a tornado, the collection is as much an allegory of Abloh’s rise to fame and a metaphor for change, as much as it is about celebrating diversity and maintaining an optimistic outlook on life.\nMotifs that appear in The Wizard Of Oz, such as Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Lion, the yellow brick road, poppies and rainbows, are silk-screened onto shirts, knitted into oversized sweaters, handflocked onto hoodies and translated as iridescent monogrammed bags.\nAnd, of course, Abloh’s penchant for sneakers remains strong as ever, with a collection of footwear inspired by old-school high-top basketball sneakers and running shoes.\nSTARS DESCEND ON \'OZ\'\nSinger and Singapore Idol alum Tabitha Nauser was every inch the rock star in a white Taurillon Monogram leather utility vest, a cropped white tee and white leather cargo pants, worn over chunky, black heeled boots.\n“My favourite piece is the vest I have on. It’s street, yet luxe, and incorporates certain pieces of LV’s small leather goods. The story behind it is that when Virgil Abloh was much younger, he would save up to buy himself LV’s small leather goods such as card holders and coin pouches,"" she told CNA Lifestyle at the party. ""It’s super practical too\xa0– I’ve got gum, my wallet, my phone and my earphones, all in here.”\nHer advice for women wanting to rock menswear? “I’ve always been a bit of a tomboy and I’ve always been into hip hop street style, incorporating oversized menswear pieces for a tough girl look. You can pull up your T-shirt to create a short midriff-baring top and add heeled boots.”\nLocal style star Mae Tan was Lolita-dangerous in a Yellow Brick Road sweater over a Wizard Of Oz photoprint shirt, completing her bottom-less outfit with thigh-high, black leather sneaker boots.\n“I’ve always been fond of wearing oversized menswear pieces,"" she said. ""I like the sense of whimsy and optimism conveyed by the Wizard Of Oz.""\nThe Sam Willows’ lead guitarist and vocalist Jon Chua went for an all-white ensemble comprising a mesh LV monogram tee over a shirt, paired with cargo pants and sneakers, accented by a black monogram leather clutch with orange chain detail.\n“I’ve been a fan of Off-white for some time, and for Virgil Abloh to come aboard a brand like Louis Vuitton changes the equation for younger people like me who’re in their late 20s,"" he said.\nStill, our eyes came back to Tan in his red poppy hoodie.\xa0“The 3D effect, which was created using a special weaving technique called fil coupe and shaved down bit by bit by hand, is amazing,"" he said. ""It makes the flowers look like they’re alive and breathing.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     style ', '     fashion ', '     celebrity ']}"

      How to curate your watch collection, according to industry experts
  </h1>, 'text': ""There comes a point in every man’s life when he starts to realise the value of, well, value.\xa0 It's about spending time and money on only\xa0the things that matter: Family, friends, property and\xa0maybe a nice timepiece or two to mark life’s milestones. As Alvin Wong, Editor-in-Chief of Crown Watch Blog puts it: “Watches, more than anything, are great mementos and signposts of our lives.”\nBut how do you decide which watches define those moments? Which ones are essential? Which ones will keep you looking sharp at work and at play? Which ones will stand the test of time, hold their value, and make meaningful heirlooms? How do you begin to curate a coherent starter collection?\nIf you find yourself asking these questions, well, know that advice is on the way.\nWe picked the brains of three influential figures in the local watch industry: Peter Chong,\xa0co-founder of the blog Deployant, and a watch collector himself; Tom Chng, founder of the Singapore Watch Club and also a collector; and Wong, who is quick to point out that he isn’t a collector, but merely someone who has chronicled the watch industry for many years.\n\n\n“I would recommend three checkboxes for beginners,” Wong offered. “One, go with reputable brands. Two, go for mechanical watches. Three, go for models that will give you lots of mileage – that is, watches that look and feel comfortable to you, and something that you would wear often. No one can tell you that what you like is wrong.”\nFor Chng, it’s watchmaking legends that make the most sense for those looking to build a collection.\n“Evergreen icons are always compelling options for the modern discerning gentleman. They have withstood the test of time, and have proven to be relevant despite the trend changes in shape, sizes and colours. It’s always a good idea to stay on the mainstream at the start, venturing into more niche genres as your taste matures,” he said.\nIn terms of numbers, Chong suggests having “three or maybe four watches” comprising “two sporty/tool watches and one or two dress watches”. Whereas in Chng’s experience, “the numbers usually stabilise between four and seven”.\nSTART WITH A BUDGET\nFirst things first: Begin with a budget in mind. “It’s important to set a budget, as otherwise the options are limitless,” explained Chong. “A good budget to start with is S$3,000. Or if you can afford it, S$6,000 or S$12,000 for each watch. Save to reach the target.”\nSome due diligence is necessary too, of course. Chong recommends reading reviews and expert opinions from sites like his own, which has articles contributed by the local watch collecting community.\nFor those on a budget and in the market for sporty/tool watches, he recommends starting out with diving watches such as the Citizen Fugu, Seiko Tuna, Seiko Samurai or Seiko Sumo, as they are all below the S$1,000 mark.\nMoving up the scale – to a budget of up to S$6,000 – Chong nominates marques like Bell & Ross, Oris, Sinn and Tudor. “The Sinn tool watches like the EZM or the U2 series are good places to start,” he said. Also good starting points are the Omega Seamaster, Omega Planet Ocean or Breitling Superocean.\nStretching that budget a little bit further gets you the Omega Speedmaster Professional Moonwatch (S$7,150) – the watch that went to the moon. This icon is Chng’s choice. “The Speedy is fun, casual and convenient. It is without a doubt the watch with the most interesting story, and also a relatively friendly price tag,” he said.\nFor those with more means, must-haves in the tool watch segment are Rolex sports watches in stainless steel. “Either the Explorer, GMT Master, Submariner or even the Air King are good starting points,” suggested Chong.\nThe Submariner is also Chng’s choice. “Probably the most iconic watch in the world, this living legend from 1954 is so popular in both the primary and secondary markets that it’s basically liquid cash,” explained Chng.\n“It set the tone for what a diver’s watch should look like, and went on to inspire various designs from different brands all around the world. A great choice for any occasion, whether diving in the waters off Yongala, Australia or desk-diving in the comforts of your own office.”\n\n\nDRESSIER OPTIONS\nDespite what you might think, respectable, high quality dress watches can be had for below S$5,000. “Consider Grand Seiko, Longines and Hamilton,” proposed Chong. “Most [dress watch] models are within that price range, and are good choices.”\nIn the next rung up – around the S$10,000 mark – budding collectors can “look at Breitling, IWC, Jaeger-LeCoultre or Omega. The Omega Speedmaster Professional Moonwatch is a good option. As are the Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso or the Master, IWC’s Portofino or Breitling Premier.”\nChng, too, puts forward the Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso, alongside the Cartier Santos and Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, as essential dress watches in a man’s collection.\n“[The Reverso] is most recognisable for its rectangular swivel case, designed to protect the timepiece’s crystal when worn by British Officers playing polo in colonial India. This timepiece looks great under a tuxedo sleeve, and is often paired with a hand-winding movement.”\nAs for the Santos, Chng shares that it was the first pilot’s watch ever produced – a little known fact. “First introduced in 1904, the Santos hasn’t actually changed that much at all, albeit [having been] resized for a more contemporary flavour. Most suitable in a professional office setting, its conservative monochromatic livery keeps the timepiece discreet and elegant.”\n\n\nThe Royal Oak, Chng believes, is “the grail to work towards… the end game for many”. A timepiece that’s aggressive yet elegant at the same time. The famous octagonal timepiece demonstrated a great amount of horological excellence, and was a breakthrough in case and bracelet finishing.”\nBut, even if you’ve reached the end game, you shouldn’t close yourself off to other options. Wong believes that reviewing or taking stock of one’s watch collection is an ongoing process, as is acquiring new knowledge of timepieces.\n“Tastes evolve and finances [hopefully] grow, so that would certainly have an effect on what watches one wishes to add to his collection,” he said. “It is also common for collectors to let go of older watches to fund new purchases.”\nChng concurs. “As we go about our horological journey, our taste changes, evolves and matures. We discover watches we never even knew we wanted. This process of consolidation and upgrading is both rewarding and fulfilling. Low wrist time is usually a good sign for review, especially when it will take you closer to your next grail.”\xa0\nAnd, Wong added, there is no need to set a finite date to assemble your ideal collection. “I think if a person loves watches, he wouldn’t be putting a deadline to his passion. It’s like asking a music lover when he ought to stop his Spotify subscription!”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     timepieces ', '     fashion ', '     Men ', '     Watches ']}"

      Bold and beautiful: Rebecca Lim sheds her insecurities and steps out of her comfort zone
  </h1>, 'text': ""Being bold isn’t something that comes naturally to Rebecca Lim. Given a choice between an adrenalin-pumping experience and staying in bed, well, she’ll probably go for the latter.\n“Privately, as a person, I’m a zero when it comes to boldness,” the 32-year-old actress admitted, with a laugh. “I don’t ride roller coasters and I don’t think I’ll ever bungee jump or sky dive. I’m a bit scared of heights as well, which a lot of people don’t believe. When I’m not working, I just really want to stay at home and lie on my bed!”\nWhen on-cam duty calls, however, she can crank it up. “On a scale of one to 10, I’ll probably be a 10. Work-wise, I can consider myself pretty bold – I’m not averse to trying anything new or feel I’m too good for something,” said Lim, who sat down with CNA Lifestyle at our video shoot.\n“Like today’s (fashion) shoot – I’ve never done this kind of concept before. It's a first time for me.”\nFROM ‘DIRTY’ COP TO MARTIAL ARTIST\nOf course, being gorgeous in front of a green screen backdrop for a fancy fashion spread isn’t quite on the same level as hanging from the side of a building (which she’s also done), but we get what she means – Rebecca Lim is up for anything.\nAbove: Colour block silk dress with appliques,\xa0by Valentino.\nAnd boldly trying out new stuff has served the actress in good stead. Last year, in particular, was a fruitful one, with Lim winning Best Actress at the Star Awards for her role in The Lead and having done a handful of interesting projects including the recent HBO crime drama The Bridge.\nFor the latter, where she played a no-nonsense cop, Lim gamely did all her stunts and recalled suffering a lot of cuts, bruises and muscle strains. She also had to look “dirty”, given her character’s propensity to skip the sunblock “while on the other hand, Rebecca is like spraying it on every 10 minutes even indoors!”\nShe was also the only Singaporean cast for the scenes that were shot in Malaysia. “It was really about getting out of your comfort zone, and I think that’s when you really grow as a person.”\nAbove: Lace long sleeve top and cotton flat front pants, both by ck Calvin Klein.\n\xa0\nThis year will see Lim getting out of her comfort zone even more. She’s been doing a bit of boxing\xa0training under the watchful eyes of Zheng Geping for The Good Fight. In the new Channel 8 martial arts drama, which is slated for June, Lim plays the daughter of a martial arts master.\n“I’m just trying to my best to at least look good while doing it. I’ll be a Zumba coach who does mixed martial arts and competes in wushu competitions – it’s completely not me,” she said, with a laugh. “I’m not very gifted in that department!”\nFENDING OFF QUESTIONS AT CNY DINNERS\nBut as Lim gets into fighting form for The Good Fight, there’s a more immediate occasion where she expects to do a bit of parrying moves – Chinese New Year reunion dinner often entail fending off questions from relatives.\n“I’m definitely not looking forward to that! Like, when am I getting married or industry gossip. I’ll\xa0just say ‘Nobody talks to me and I don’t know anything!” she laughed.\nAbove: Embroidered tiered dress and leather pumps, both by Bottega Veneta.\nOne thing she’s looking forward to, of course, is the food. “We always look forward to my grandma’s cooking and my dad makes this very good siew bak. I always look forward to uninterrupted time with my family.”\nShe added: “For the past few years, I've had to do reunion lunches because we have to report to the TV station for Chinese New Year shows – I’ll have lunch at my grandmother’s place and pack extra food for the crew – that’s something she looks forward to every year.”\nAs for what she’s looking forward to the most in 2019, Lim said she’s hoping for more experiences overseas, having done and enjoyed shooting co-productions in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines during the past two years.\nAbove: Silk chiffon toga long dress, by Halston from Theoutnet.com.\n“I would love to experience a production in China. When people look at me, they probably associate me with something more English, contemporary or more art house. But China would be a huge challenge for me because the entire culture is something so different from Singapore, and language wise it’s something I would really have to work hard at. I just want to give myself that challenge. I want to experience as many things as possible before I slow down and start a family or something.”\nFROM INSECURE KID TO SCHOOLING KIDS\nSpeaking of family – and China, for that matter – Lim revealed another bold plan she’d love to work on sooner rather than later. She hopes to start a bilingual acting school for children.\n“It’s been growing in my head for a while now and my friends who are mostly mothers already would joke ‘Hey, why don’t you teach my daughters some acting?’. I kind of have the passion for it because I struggled so much with Mandarin when I entered the industry.”\nShe added: “I lost interest in Mandarin when I was a student because I had a really boring teacher. So I can hopefully teach kids in a fun way that would make them interested in it and make them good at it.\nAbove: Embroidered jacket with grosgrain belt and\xa0matching pleat skirt,\xa0both\xa0by Fendi.\nBut there’s also another reason why Lim’s passionate about teaching youngsters acting-slash-language skills.\n“I grew up being very insecure. I was in an all-girls school and was pretty pleasantly plump – I used to be in the Trim And Fit Club all the way till I was 15,” she said.\n“(The acting school) could be a way to instil some form of confidence from a young age, to say they’re doing well or can do well. As an actress, I always got scolded when I started out because I wasn’t street smart and tended to make mistakes on-set, and that kind of makes you less confident to make another move.”\nFrom the looks of it, she has definitely done enough to get to where she is now, without losing that hunger to try something new. Sure, Lim would rather just chill at home than sky dive or bungee jump for the sake of her craft. But if she had to, she’ll do that too – right?\n“Hopefully not – please write that down!” Lim said. “I have a feeling after people read this, they’ll make me do it!”\nStyle Editor: Serene Seow; Art Direction: Chern Ling; Photography and video by Nonlinear; Styling by Jeremy Tan; Hair by Nigel Woo/Passion Hair Salon; Makeup by Sam Ong.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', '     celebrity ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Dye dye must try: Singapore’s batik culture gets a fashion and art makeover
  </h1>, 'text': ""Last December, Oniatta Effendi spent three days in Yogyakarta and Solo, barging into people’s homes looking for batik.\nThe Singaporean theatre actress was on one of her regular trips to Indonesia, where she makes it a point to visit villages of batik makers. “I went to three different kampongs and just went\xa0inside someone’s house,” she said, with a\xa0laugh. “They’d show us their wares, and I would buy and bring them back.”\nA hardcore batik enthusiast, Oniatta has a bunch of paintings hanging at home, a stack of books in her library and a collection of more than 40 pieces of fabric. She also creates batik outfits for her three-year-old label Baju By Oniatta.\n“To me, batik has a life – there’s a soul and a heartbeat in it, when you actually go to a kampong and see the precision, craft and why they do it,” said the 44-year-old. “And now, everybody seems to want a piece of it.”\nA CULTURE OF WEARING BATIK\nThe past couple of years has seen a resurgence in interest in batik in Singapore, with\xa0Baju By Oniatta\xa0being just one of a handful of labels championing batik, which include the likes of YeoMama Batik, Pakai and Gypsied.\nThere have also been pop-up events, such as those from The Batik People and Oniatta’s own My Kain Of Batik last year.\nAnd it’s not just in fashion but in the arts as well, with batik-making classes and the occasional exhibition springing up.\nOver at the Malay Heritage Centre is one such show about batik. Of Wax, Dyes And Labour, a show under Singapore Art Week, features works of young artists that put a spotlight on it.\nAmong these is a 5m-long piece of batik with the phrases “Culture Of Batik” and “Wear Batik To Be Asian” written on it.\nElsewhere, there’s a batik dress similar to the iconic Singapore Girl's sarong kebaya; and ceramic versions of the canting, the metallic tool used to create designs on the fabric. There’s even a performance by one of the artists, who will be folding pieces of batik fabrics.\nThe show aims to explore what the identity of batik is in Singapore, said curator and artist Fajrina Razak, 30, who also made the manifesto-like fabric installation.\n“Batik is so close to us. We use it on a daily basis, we wear it for weddings, formal events, at home and even in funerals in the Malay culture. We have a culture of wearing, buying and trading batik – our ancestors did that a lot in the past and it’s still happening now,” she said.\nNO BATIK INDUSTRY IN SINGAPORE\nThe ancient technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to cloth is perhaps one of the region’s iconic trademarks and very popular in Malaysia and Indonesia. It was even designated an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO.\nBut while many in Singapore love to use it, there’s not much in terms of batik production\xa0here.\n“We don’t have a culture of production, no batik industry. While there are artists who run batik studios, it’s solely for art-making;\xa0not for fabrics or mass production,” said Fajrina, who cited the lack of manpower and proper facilities as some of the main reasons.\n“It’s labour intensive, and the labour cost is cheap\xa0in Indonesia and Malaysia. To do batik, you also need a big outdoor space. In Singapore, I don’t think people would want to go through all that trouble.”\nThat means many batik proponents here just turn to neighbouring countries to procure them, like Oniatta, who also pointed out that not all batik are made equal.\xa0While she sources hers straight from batik-making villages, the market is also full of lesser-quality stuff using digital prints.\nAnother hurdle batik lovers have is its reputation of being culturally specific to the Malay community.\n“Batik belongs to everyone – it’s a medium. What we ‘own’ are the motifs that reflect us,” said Fajrina, citing, for example, how the cloud motif called batik megamendung is Chinese-inspired, or how the Dutch were influential in the mass production of batik, using the copper implement called tjap.\nShe added: “Even in India and Japan, you find similar techniques, even if they don’t call it batik.”\nArtist Yang Jie, who is contributing an interactive, umbrella-like batik sculpture to the exhibition, shared how he discovered there was a Yunnan tribe that did something similar as well while researching for the show. “The idea of a single craft restricted to a single type of person is something that’s a bit outdated,” he said.\nBATIK FOR THE FUTURE\nAnd speaking of outdated, one of the challenges that\xa0Singapore’s batik lovers has always faced is to push it into the contemporary space.\nWhile a handful from the older generation of artists use batik – including the late Jaafar Latiff and Sarkasi Said, who had a big show a couple of years back – there aren’t many from the current generation who do so, said Fajrina.\nShe reckons it might seem a bit “old school” for younger artists, who are more excited about\xa0mediums like digital art, to want to explore it. But silk screening or digital printing might actually be a way of reinventing the batik wheel in the art-making world.\nWhen it comes to her fashion designs, new label Pakai’s Ida Supahat prefers to use a minimal touch of batik.\n“Some would think using batik means creating something ‘in your face’ with the traditional brown or batik prints all over, but I would use it in a subtle way,” said the 28-year-old, adding that she would also try to keep in mind other communities and create\xa0cheongsam- or kurti-style designs in her collection.\n“I think it’s not only open to the Malay Muslim or Javanese community.\xa0I’ve a lot of customers who are Chinese or Indian, so I try to design them in a way that\xa0fits any wardrobe.”\nFor Oniatta, it’s all about balancing today’s needs and doing justice to its heritage. “It’s not about reinventing the batik but reinventing the way it is worn,” she said.\n“Batik is completely sensorial;\xa0it’s not fast fashion for me. For many, batik is just a pattern but there’s a massive ecosystem that we are supporting when we buy one – the people who make them have their little stories to tell.”\nOne of those, perhaps, is of a Singaporean woman who went all the way to Indonesia to visit them in their kampong homes.\nOf Wax, Dyes And Labour runs from Jan 19 to Feb 9 at the Malay Heritage Centre.

      Style Switch: Helping this financial consultant dress for success – and for his personality
  </h1>, 'text': 'Ridhwan Hardi is a man of diverse tastes. The 31-year-old financial services consultant is a big wrestling buff (he has a wrestling podcast on Mixcloud called Hard Hidz) and film enthusiast. His weekends are spent recording his weekly podcast and playing basketball.\nHis personal style is just as colourful and bold: He is the owner of many wrestling T-shirts and polo shirts – and he has a big love for traditional batik. His typical work outfit is a shirt with sleeves rolled up, tapered pants, and his accessory of choice: Suspenders.\nHardi, as he likes to be called, signed up for CNA Lifestyle’s Style Switch because he recently switched careers: He used to be a teacher.\n“I sometimes get comments that my dressing is too gaudy or garish,” he mused. “Now that I’m in financial services, I feel I need to maybe look more professional, so my clients have more confidence in me.”\nThe change to a different line of work was necessitated by Hardi’s need to support his ageing parents and his younger brother, who is studying law in Cambridge University in the UK. Hardi feels\xa0the pressure to find success in this new career. But shopping for clothes isn’t all that easy for him.\n\n\nHardi has a unique body shape. Standing at 1.67m, he has a wrestler’s body: Broad shoulders and thick thighs. “I get my clothes from Mustafa and G2000,” he said, but has problems finding clothes that fit. Pants might fit at the waist but, given his height, they don’t fall properly.\nStyle Switch Stylist Yang Derong admires Hardi’s unique style and joie de vivre. “He’s a big guy, and he’s so funny – he calls himself a sumo! Also, he is proud of his heritage – he has a beautiful collection of batik shirts, which is not something you see very often.”\nDerong decided it was key to retain Hardi’s big personality while making him look professional for his client meetings. “We needed to empower Hardi to succeed,” he said.\nThe stylist’s key tip for Hardi was to find a good tailor and his buys altered to fit him. For example, he should buy a pair of pants that fit at the waist, and get the tailor to turn the trousers to a tapered pair. Shirt sleeves can be easily shortened by a professional tailor, too.\n\n\nDerong’s guiding principles for dressing Hardi were to take attention away from his oval shape and to reduce bulk. Tapered pants create a slimmer silhouette, as do shirts with vertical stripes that create an optical illusion of height.\nFor formal occasions, instead of the standard tie that most men wear, a bow tie gives Hardi a smart finishing touch that matches his outgoing personality – without drawing the eye to the torso the way a regular tie does.\n\n\nWhat about Hardi’s beloved suspenders? Derong gave them the green light. “I told him, that’s part of your personality. Enjoy it, make it part of your style. Wear a pair of red suspenders with red socks, for example. Make it a statement!”\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Style Switch: Getting this working mum out of hand-me-downs and into her own style
  </h1>, 'text': ""What’s hers is her sister's – quite literally. “Most of my clothes are from my younger sister,” said art teacher Jeannie Loo. “They may not be my style, but they’re free!”\nJeannie, 31, is a working mother with two young children. She signed up for CNA Lifestyle’s Style Switch to learn what kind of clothes flatter her while staying fuss-free. “I’m always in a rush or dressing my kids and I have no time for makeup,” she said.\nHer life revolves around the children. She heads to work at a primary school near her home every morning, then rushes back after school to supervise her children’s homework. Weekends are spent bringing the kids to various activities and visiting her mother. The little time Jeannie has for herself, she spends doing pole fitness.\nJeannie’s go-to outfits for work are her sister’s old dresses (“usually black”) and pants matched with a plain top. On weekends, she’s a T-shirt-and-jeans kind of dresser.\n\n\n“People say I’m always in the same colour – my clothes are mostly in dark colours,” she said. “It looks like I shop a lot or have a lot of clothes, but my friends don’t know they’re mostly from my sister.”\nWhat stops Jeannie from buying her own clothes – apart from time – is money. “I can’t bear to part with my money, even though it’s not hard to find clothes that I like,” she admitted. So, when she does shop, she buys her clothes online at Taobao, and her purchases are usually basics.\nMotivation to dress up is another issue. Jeannie is married to a man who is as simple as she is, a “grab-and-go” dresser. As their lives revolve around activities in and around their home, there aren’t many occasions for her to dress up either. So, Jeannie has been putting up with clothes from her bigger-sized sister, rolling down waistbands to keep her skirts from falling down her hips.\n\n\nWhen the Style Switch team met Jeannie, she was in her favourite dress: A long, voluminous grey dress that she had worn during her pregnancy and has continued wearing.\nStylist Yang Derong understood what the dress meant to Jeannie, but gently told her:\xa0“That dress has served you. You can wear it for sentimental value – but don’t wear it out.”\nThe team embarked on picking out pieces for Jeannie that best suited her lifestyle and her body. “She looks fantastic for a mother of two!” said Derong. The key for her was to buy pieces that actually fit.\n“We worked with very simple colours: Black, white, grey, khaki, navy. Very basic pieces. Then, we added an accent print – stripes or petit fleur,” said Derong. “All the pieces we picked were inexpensive and easy to care, so she doesn’t have to spend two hours ironing every day.”\n\n\nAn array of shirts, tees, slim-fit pants and cardigans from Uniqlo formed the mix-and-match wardrobe for the busy teacher. “Uniqlo makes beautiful clothes that are simple, beautifully shaped, well-studied,” said Derong. “And, very importantly, they come in petite sizes.”\n“I respect every-day heroes like Jeannie,” said Derong. “I respect that she doesn't want to spend a lot of money on clothes – she’d rather spend it on her children. We shouldn’t chase fashion. We should chase good quality clothes that don't need dry cleaning. Even when you have a limited budget, you can still make it work.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

And he’s a father of two, and frequently finds himself at kids’ parties.\nSo, on a given day, John may find himself at church in the morning, on a plane an hour later to meet investors in a boardroom in another country, before heading back on another flight to attend a gala in the evening.\n“My wife has been asking me to get a style makeover,” he shared. “I usually meet investors wearing a jacket and chinos. And if I’m meeting entrepreneurs, I’m in jeans and a T-shirt.”\n“Once, I had an awkward encounter with a CEO,” he said. “I was dressed casually for an event, and the CEO made a joke that the person who is most casually dressed is usually the one with the most money. Obviously, he meant me – and obviously what he said was not the case!”\n\n\nStyle Switch stylist Yang Derong set to work on a “simple capsule collection” for John. “We kept it neat and tight. I picked simple, neutral colours for him – black, white, ecru – so that no matter how you throw them on, they look good.”\nBecause of his broad shoulders, John has his shirts made by a tailor. “That’s the best thing he can do,” said Derong, approvingly. “He wears size 50 suits but with size 48 pants. His body is almost a rhomboid.”\n\n\n“If he buys off-the-rack, the shirt may fit him but the collar won’t. So I told John:\xa0Find a shirt-maker you really like, and get him to make you the same shirt in all colours, and in multiples. That way, you can have a spare one in your travel bag that’s ready to go anytime.""\nLayering was another tip. “He can get T-shirts in all kinds of material: Cotton, silk cotton – these are great for layers under shirts, jackets.”\nFor pants, “we worked with a slim-fit cut, but not tapered – he needs to be comfortable on a plane, since he is always travelling.” Derong also suggested the five-pocket pants for John\xa0– it’s comfort-meets-professionalism. “Not in denim, of course, but in a black, stretch fabric.”\nAs for shoes, Derong proposed sneakers, which have gone from being utilitarian to being a style symbol. “Cool sneakers, but in neutral tones. Some luxury brands make very nice ones that are subtle.”\nThe central idea, said Derong, is to build a capsule collection of these basics that can be packed into a travel case, ready to go at any time. “This collection is very minimal but high quality in terms of fit and fabric, and it goes with him wherever he goes.”\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Style Switch: How to dress for your body when you’re taller than most women
  </h1>, 'text': 'Danielle Chin is taller than the average Asian girl. She stands at a towering 1.78m – a dream height for a model; a nightmare for someone who doesn’t know how to dress for her body.\nThe 29-year-old is an executive for a community organisation, handling fund administration and partnerships. While her job doesn’t require formal attire, Danielle feels she needs a style makeover to achieve “a more professional look”. And so do her colleagues.\n“They say I look sloppy, or ask me why I’m wearing pyjamas,” said Danielle. “I don’t know what to do with my flat hair, and I don’t wear make-up.”\n\n\nHer mother is especially invested in Danielle changing the way she dresses. “My mother and her friends say I’m too informal, and that I should start dressing up so I can go out and meet people,” said Danielle, who is single. “Sometimes, my mother buys me clothes because she can’t stand what I wear. Sometimes, she even forces me to change my outfit before leaving the house!”\n“I think my mother dresses better than me,” she admitted.\nDanielle’s height, combined with both a lack of awareness of how to use fashion and what makes her look good, means she\xa0has resorted to pairing rainbow harem pants with a sports top and flip flops – her go-to outfit.\n“She is totally bo chap!” quipped CNA Lifestyle Style Switch stylist Yang Derong. “But she is a beautiful girl with great features, who is shy about her height and her body. She has the look of a modern Chinese model\xa0with those lovely eyes.”\n“We wanted to give her something in which she looks professional but feels comfortable,” said Derong of the makeover plan. “Clean lines, minimal prints … We want to soften the look because she’s broad-shouldered.”\nHis list for Danielle included solid, neutral colours, and for formal meetings, soft, unconstructed jackets so that she could be comfortable. “Things that are so soft and easy to manage, she can almost forget about them.”\nFor Danielle’s head-turning makeover look, the team put her in a chiffon top with cutaway shoulders, paired with a beautifully tailored pair of tapered pants.\nAs for her beauty makeover, the first thing the team did was to get rid of her bleached, blonde hair. “On one extreme, she is bo chap about her dressing – but she also goes to the other extreme of doing something radical to her hair,” mused Derong.\n“She was really happy with her look, but she was worried how to manage her makeup every day,” said Derong. “But she has great skin! She just needs to darken her brows, put on a bit of mascara and a nice lipstick. That’s it! She doesn’t need very much to look good.”\n', 'related_topics': [""     Women's Style "", '     fashion ']}"

      Men's styling hack: The right eyewear is the easiest way to score compliments 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Picking out a pair of eyewear used to be simple – it’s either metal or plastic, round or rectangular.\xa0But that is now a thing of the past.\nToday, there is a myriad of styles for you to choose from:\xa0Aviators-inspired frames to classic round metal frames.\nWhile you should generally choose the type of frames based on your face shape, bear in mind that none of us fit squarely into one category. So, a big round frame may not work for someone with a fuller face, a similar style in a smaller size might actually add panache, depending on your personal style.\nRule of thumb: Go eyewear shopping with a close buddy. Seek out his or her opinion, and don’t be afraid to get adventurous and try something new. Who knows, a bold style may just leave a lasting first impression.\nA round, metallic frame never goes out of style. You do, however, need to pick the right size to compliment your face shape. If you have a slimmer and longer face, the circular frames can create an illusion of a fuller face. The best part? It goes with almost every occasion, whether it’s a formal event or casual outing.\nThe round frame in plastic is another style that is still popular today. To dial up the style factor, pick one in brown, clear plastic or tortoiseshell instead of a classic black one. Remember: Size matters.\n\n\nA statement piece, there’s nothing bolder than a pair of irregular rectangular frames rendered in tortoiseshell. The hefty construction draws the right attention to your face and makes for a great conversation starter.\nNot for the faint hearted, this particular eyewear is bold and eye-catching. If you’re an adventurous and savvy dresser, it’s time to stand out from\xa0the crowd with this pair of aviators-inspired frames with unique cut-out edges. The metallic material minimises the exaggerated shape and size, and gives out an avant-garde yet elegant vibe.\nTHE THROWBACK KID\nTaking cues from the 70s, this frame is a nod to old-school hip hop with its retro-esque styling. With a thicker rim on top, this particular style is a modern update that will set you apart from the rest of the style pack.\nPhotography by Kelvin Chia, styling by Damian Huang, grooming by Lin Hongling, model Zewen from Mannequin.\n\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Accessories ', '     Men ', '     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      Men: How to pull off the colour red this Chinese New Year and look great
  </h1>, 'text': 'Often associated with passion and danger, red is not an easy colour to master, especially when it comes to a man’s wardrobe. But who’s to say that you can’t rock this standout shade and top the sartorial scale?\xa0\nStudies done by the Journal Of Personality And Social Psychology indicate that women are more likely to find a man attractive when he is associated with red. How’s that for incentive to go all out this Chinese New Year?\n\xa0\n\xa0\nWhen it comes to incorporating the colour red in your wardrobe, there are a few things to consider.\nFirst, this is a very attention-grabbing shade and it will most certainly stand out on its own, so if you’re not confident of pulling off an all-red outfit, consider taming it down with other muted colours that play well with red, such as light blue and\xa0burgundy.\nIf a bright fire-engine red is too much for you to handle, opt for darker crimson shades such as a rusty red.\nFinally, it’s all about wearing the colour with confidence. Remember: It’s all about big risks and bigger rewards. Plus, you just might score a sizable ang pow with your favourite grandma.\nTAME IT DOWN\nIf it’s your first time attempting to wear red, consider layering it with other lighter shades. For example, a bright red denim jacket with a light pink shirt tame down the loud visual cue, while a pair of tailored off-white trousers smartened up the look instantly.\nADD VOLUME\nIf standing out among your relatives is your biggest goal, we say go big or go home. A red tracksuit might garner you the eyeballs you want, but why not take it up one more notch with an oversized windbreaker?\nThe extra volume is an unexpected silhouette and is most likely to get you voted best dressed among your cousins. If the weather gets a little too toasty, you can always take it off and show off your impeccable street style-inspired look.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nLEISUREWEAR LUXE\xa0\nIf\xa0you take your style cues from athleisure, then consider dialling up the casual vibe with a smart blouson. Saturate your whole look with a red tee but if you’re too conscious of wearing red-on-red, then anchor it down with a light blue or beige top.\nACCESSORISE\nAnother way to incorporate the colour red into your ensemble is with accessories, such as a leather pouch (to hold your hongbaos\xa0and other necessities).\n\xa0\n\xa0\nLAYERING\nIf you’ve already mastered the art of wearing red like a fashion editor, then it’s time to take it to the next level with layering. Consider a dark jacket with a pair of denim berms. The look is unexpected and the darker jacket also creates an interesting contrast to the striking shade of red. If the weather gets too warm, you can peel of the jacket and still look cool.\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, grooming by Lin Hongling, model, Zewen from Mannequin.

      Fresh inspiration: 5 chic, flattering ways to pull off an all-white ensemble
  </h1>, 'text': ""It is pristine, fresh and beautiful, but many women often think twice about wearing white because they either think it's going to make them look bigger or that they'll spill their lunch on it.\nThe reality is white is incredibly versatile and, with a little finesse, also flattering on the body.\nAll you need are the right textures, silhouettes and\xa0– we cannot stress this enough\xa0– the right underwear.\nAs for spilling your lunch... there's not much we can do to help you except, perhaps, suggest a sandwich?\nMAKE\xa0ROOM FOR COMFORT\nWe get it that white is a larger-than-life colour – which is exactly why you’re best off going in with a “go big or go home” mindset. Embrace it for what it is and add\xa0volume.\nTake this roomy shirtdress, for example – it looks fabulous when worn outsized. In fact, sizing down will result in unnecessary bulging and you don’t want that.\nTo create the desired look, turn to structured shapes and stiff fabrics.\nWEAR\xa0THE PANTS\nThe classic white suit doesn’t get worn enough. It’s chic, it's smart, it’s modern. And it's a seriously ballsy look.\nTall girls will look absolutely smashing when pairing the white jacket with tone-on-tone palazzo pants. Meanwhile, white cigarette pants are every petite girl’s friend.\n\n\nFAUX FUR REAL\nNot quite feeling that neon blue faux fur? Then give its pristine white cousin a shot on your winter jaunts.\nMore versatile than its crazily coloured cousins, it will help you shapeshift from hippie (it pairs well with flared jeans) to apres ski (when worn with moon boots for some alpine hopping in Megeve) to cosmopolitan (slip on white denims to pound the pavements of\xa0Ginza).\nDRESSED TO THE NINES\nThe devil is in the details when it comes to white dresses.\xa0\nHere are a couple of things to keep in mind:\xa0Tight and clingy will fit the svelte like a glove. Appliques and embellishment are wonderful distractions for those with less-than-perfect bodies. Meanwhile, pint-sized individuals will be able to pull off cute, mini pieces with aplomb.\nTHE BOYFRIEND IS MINE \nBoyfriend dressing doesn’t have to stop at jeans. Next time, borrow his white shorts. Wear them low, slung around the hips for effect. To really draw attention to that tiny waistline, throw on a midriff.\nWhat’s his is yours anyway, right?\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, hair and makeup by Wee Ming using Chanel and Kevin Murphy.

      Style Switch: How we turned this lawyer from dishevelled to dapper  
  </h1>, 'text': 'Wilson Foo needed a little help with his style.\xa0“The way I dress\xa0every day is: First in, first out from my cupboard,” the 30-year-old advocate and solicitor told CNA Lifestyle.\nWilson wears what is essentially a uniform throughout the week. As a lawyer, he is dressed for court from Mondays to Fridays: “Black suit, dark tie, white shirt, black shoes. When I’m not in court, [I\'ll wear a] shirt and pants.”\nWhen asked if he was happy with the way he dressed, Wilson remained ambivalent. “I’m not sure,” he said, “but I would like to improve my image.”\nWe at CNA Lifestyle offered a little help – in the form of style expert Yang Derong.\nHe found Wilson to be a fascinating personality. While he is a professional by day, Wilson develops apps for a hobby. “There’s that ‘geek’ side of him,"" said Derong. ""Plus, he takes Esperanto classes.” Esperanto is the most widely-used artificially-constructed language in the world that bases its vocabulary on Romance languages like Spanish.\n“All the other parts of a person, other than work, are important too,” said Derong of the process of making over someone like Wilson.\n\n\nMETAMORPHOSIS\nThe team began by changing Wilson’s court outfit. As he doesn’t buy his own clothes – other people, like his wife, buy them for him – the only clothes he does buy are souvenir T-shirts when he travels. Having someone else buy his clothes for him also means that the fit is usually off.\nAs Derong noted, “The suits he has are ill-fitting. We decided to spiff him up to look smart, not trendy.”\nTo create the illusion of height, Derong put a skinny tie on him in place of the traditional broader ties he usually wears. “He put it on and looked like a Man In Black,” quipped the stylist. “In fact, we gave him different ties with different textures, some which he can wear on non-court days.”\nWilson’s jacket sleeves were too long for his arms. “His white shirt sleeves should show half an inch under the jacket sleeve. The focus should be on his cuffs.”\n\n\nOnce his work outfit had been sorted, Derong moved on to dressing Wilson for more casual but still dapper look. “I challenged him to put away his white shirt and black pants on Fridays,” said Derong. “He should try printed shirts – we put him in a gingham checked shirt that looked really good. For blazers, he should go not for a formal blazer but a soft one, like one made from pique cotton that has a really nice texture.”\nWilson’s pants needed a little more navigation. “He has heavy calves so straight slim pants don’t look so good on him,” noted Derong. “What works are slim stretch pants. And I told him, ‘When you find a pair that fits you well – fit at first sight – buy it in multiples and in different colours! The best clothes are like your girlfriend: When you find them, keep them!”\nFor the finishing touch, the team gave Wilson a facial makeover. “He came to us with funny whiskers all over his face,” said Derong, noting that the lawyer liked his facial hair and was looking for a way to wear it more stylishly.\nGrooming consultants from barbershop Sultans of Shave trimmed away the excess and left him with a neater, shapelier goatee. They also gave his salt-and-pepper mane a good cut and styled it away from his face.\nWilson’s new look turned heads – specifically, his wife’s. “His wife said, ‘Oh my, now the pressure is on me!’” laughed Derong. “And Wilson said, ‘I think they’ll be very surprised to see me like this at the office!”\nHappy to help, Wilson. Happy to help.\n\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      The winter virgin's guide to packing your bags for a cold-weather vacation
  </h1>, 'text': 'You’re going on your first winter vacation – or at least, the first in a long time. And because you’re a tropical guy or girl, and your idea of a cold climate is the confoundingly frigid movie theatre at the mall, you’re not sure where to start when it comes to ensuring you’ll have everything you need when you travel.\nThe bad news is that it’s not simply a question of cramming every sweater you can get your hands on into your suitcase. Packing for a winter trip is as much an art as it is a science.\n\n\nThe good news is that we’re here to help, with this quick and easy guide on everything you need to be prepared for temperate weather.\n1. DON’T TRUST THE WEATHER FORECAST\nWhen preparing for your winter trip, the first step is to check the weather forecast. The second step is to eye the forecast with suspicion.\nAfter all, there’s a reason the saying “changeable as the weather” exists. Even up to one day before, weather patterns could shift drastically. So, use the forecast as a rough guide only.\nAnother reason to do this is that often, the temperature level does not match the actual feel of the weather, due to factors such as the amount of sunshine or wind chill.\nAlways pack for a higher and lower temperature than anticipated. You don’t want to be freezing your butt off should a cold front move in overnight, nor do you want to end up with nothing but wool and fleece to wear should the weather be unexpectedly warm.\n2. YOUR EXTREMITIES ARE IMPORTANT\nPeople often tend to focus on the down jackets and overlook the accessories. But in freezing temperatures, it’s your extremities that will suffer most.\nFor instance, you will start to feel the pain of the cold in your fingers first, so it’s essential to have a pair of gloves for temperatures approaching zero and under. It’s also easy to lose a lot of heat from your head and neck, so make sure you pack a scarf, hat, earmuffs or all of the above – you’ll be amazed at what a difference those accessories make.\nAnd if it’s snowing, it’s vital not only to have the right kind of non-slip footwear, but also to have socks that are made of thick wool.\n\n\nHere’s a helpful tip: It’s possible to purchase gloves with fingertips designed for use with touch screens, so you don’t have to remove your gloves when fiddling with your phone. Not even the perfect Instagram photo is worth getting frostbite for.\n3. LAYER SMART, NOT HARD\nNow we’ve come to the good part: What you should actually wear.\nIf you’re going to be mainly outdoors, hiking or skiing for example, thermal underwear is a good idea. But if you’re sticking to the city, bear in mind that it can get very hot indoors, where the heating is often cranked up to suffocating levels.\nPack some lighter clothes to wear next to your skin, such as a button-down shirt, a light turtleneck or even a T-shirt. You can pack sweaters, cardigans, vests or jackets to layer over those, and simply shed them if it gets too hot.\nMost essentially, you’ll need a good coat. For dead-of-winter trips, one of those little puffy jackets isn’t going to be enough, my friend. Invest in a heavy duty down coat that ideally also protects you from wind and precipitation –\xa0and if it comes with a hood that makes you look like a pillaging Mongol warrior, all the better.\n4. ZIPLOC BAGS ARE YOUR FRIENDS\nNow that you’ve assembled all the winter wear you’ll need, the Herculean task at hand is to fit it all into your suitcase. After all, cold-weather clothes are the bulkiest clothes of all.\n\n\nHere’s where you’ll want to trot down to a place like Daiso and buy a bunch of very large Ziploc bags. That down coat can be squished down to one-third of its bulk if the air is sucked out of it.\nJust remember to save the bags so you can re-use them for your next trip. Don’t kill the earth.\xa0\n5. HEAT PACKS WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER\nWhile you’re there\xa0or the drugstore, pick up some pocket heat packs. These will be useful not only for your chilly fingers while outside, but also to help keep your electronic gadgets in a suitably warm environment – sometimes, the cold can drain their batteries in record time.\nYou can also put the heat packs in your clothes or socks – or even in your bed – so they’ll be warm and toasty when you’re ready to slip into them.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Travel ', '     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Time to splurge: Our picks of the best jewels worthy of your year-end bonus
  </h1>, 'text': 'You’ve been good all year, spending less on holidays, buying only one new handbag\xa0(and an affordable one at that) and limiting yourself to just two pairs of shoes at a recent sample sale. And now you’ve saved up a small sum that, combined with your bonus, amounts to a rather decent figure.\xa0\nWell, you deserve a reward for all that good behaviour. And we can think of no better way to spoil yourself than with shiny wearables – from the best brands, of course. Here’s our edit of the season’s finest and most lust-worthy jewellery, from rings and bracelets to earrings and necklaces.\xa0\nIn the 20th century, American jeweller Harry Winston earned a reputation as the “King of Diamonds” among royalty, celebrities and ladies-who-lunched. It’s easy to see why when you feast your eyes on this pair of platinum earrings: The fire from the 16 round brilliant and four pear-shaped diamonds is just dazzling. They’ll hold their own when paired with other jewels in your wardrobe, and will jazz up a simple white shirt-and-blue jeans combo. Wear them everywhere.\nFor more information, visit https://www.harrywinston.com/en/collection/jewelry/sparkling-cluster-by-harry-winston \nItalian jeweller Bulgari’s latest fine jewellery collection is a portmanteau of the Italian word ‘fiore’ (or flower) and ‘forever’. It’s meant to symbolise everlastingness – because, well, diamonds are forever, and also because the label hails from Rome, the Eternal City. These tassel earrings in 18K white gold are anchored by central diamonds (0.30 ct each) that are fringed by pave diamonds (1.05 cts). The stones are of D to F colour with a clarity of IF to VVS.\nFor more information, visit https://www.bulgari.com/en-sg/fiorever-jewellery-collection \nWant to be queen for a day? Heck, why not be queen for life. As its name suggests, Louis Vuitton’s Conquetes-Regalia collection plays with classic symbols of royal power. This 18K white gold bracelet, for instance, resembles a mini tiara. Embellished with 7.43 cts of diamonds – including 23 baguette-cut stones and a single pear-shaped gem – we’re told this bauble took 580 man-hours to craft.\xa0\nFor more information, visit https://hk.louisvuitton.com/eng-hk/articles/introducing-the-new-high-jewellery-collection-conquetes-regalia\nIf the shape of Chaumet’s Josephine Aigrette rings seem familiar, that’s because they’re meant to invoke the silhouette of 1920s-style feathered tiaras – ‘aigrette’ is the French name for this type of decadent headdress, popularised by flappers of the era. Recapture the Roaring Twenties with these pave-encrusted 18K gold rings, which come in several variations, including ones studded with citrine or cultured Akoya pearls, as shown here. You can also wear them stacked for a more dramatic look.\nFor more information, visit https://www.chaumet.com/jewellery/josephine-collection\nTiffany & Co. launched its Paper Flowers collection with a bang a few months ago, winning over customers with its delicate, feminine character. Fashioned from platinum, this cluster necklace bears a bouquet of round brilliant diamonds (total weight: 0.91 cts) interspersed with round and cushion-cut tanzanites (totaling 0.94 cts) that add a subtle dose of colour.

      Sell your Rolex Daytona and you could make almost double what you paid
  </h1>, 'text': ""Collecting vintage watches used to be a leisurely pursuit. A dedicated hobbyist \xad– say, your dad, uncle or granddad – might have spent an entire Sunday poking around second-hand dealers or flea markets, only to return home for dinner to regale the family with tales from that afternoon’s hunt.\nWhen Shawn Tan first started Heirloom Gallery in 2000, for example, his customers were mostly enthusiasts. “[These were collectors] who collected watches as a passion… and regarded it as a form of art collection and appreciation,” he told CNA Lifestyle.\nThese days, however, vintage watches are big business. Over the last five years, a new group of more discerning collectors have surfaced, what Tan refers to as “serious collectors, astute investors and prolific dealers all-in-one”. They are younger, web- and social media-savvy and, crucially, bigger spenders.\n“From the average spending of a few thousand dollars on a single purchase in the past, we are now seeing… spending in the tens of thousands and more on a watch, as most informed collectors would regard their spending as an educated purchase, an informed investment with a potential for value appreciation,” shared Tan.\nAnd then there are the astronomical figures realised at auctions, which have made even those outside the watch-collecting community sit up and take notice. How could they not, when a timepiece sells for almost US$18 million (S$25 million)? That record-breaking sum was achieved in Oct 2017 by the Rolex “Paul Newman” Daytona Reference 6239.\nAt US$17.8 million, it was – and still is – the most expensive wristwatch ever sold. And although such stellar performances are the exception rather than the norm, it raised awareness of the potential of vintage watches to outperform other forms of investments.\n“These auction results have been instrumental in setting the scene for vintage watches, reinforcing consumers’ confidence and sending the whole world chasing after the staggeringly rare and historic pieces available,” added Tan.\nFrom the average spending of a few thousand dollars on a single purchase in the past, we are now seeing… spending in the tens of thousands and more on a watch.\n“The sale of the ‘Paul Newman’ Daytona… was like a high tide that raised all the boats,” explained Scott La Du, Gemmologist at Betteridge, an American jeweller that showcased at the JeweLuxe fair in Oct. “It single-handedly made that type of dial – the Panda dial – very important. Now, watches in that genre are commanding top dollar across the board. We find steel Daytonas with Panda dials fetching anywhere from US$125,000 to US$800,000.”\nAs Alexandre Bigler, a consultant at Christie’s Hong Kong Watch Department, put it: “Today, having money in the bank doesn’t get you anything. On the contrary, it might cost you. There’s a lot of cash in the market, and [people] don’t want to store it. They’d rather put it in something they can enjoy.”\nAnd that something is vintage watches. “Vintage watches are ‘safe’,” added Bigler. “If you’re a newcomer on the stock market, what do you do? You buy what’s safe. You go for the blue chips. They perform well, and at least you’re not going to get burned.”\nSURGING GLOBAL DEMAND\nWhile it’s difficult to gauge the entirety of the market, Bigler estimates its value – at least in the auction realm – at around US$350 million. Jonathan Tee, founder of local vintage watch specialist Passions Watch, puts the figure at somewhere between US$200 million to US$500 million.\n“We’ll never know [the total value] because many transactions are unaccounted for,” said Tee. “In recent years, a lot of collectors, some dealers and privateers have moved to trade on social media, such as Facebook, Carousell and Instagram.”\nRegardless of how large the market is, there’s no doubt that the demand for vintage watches is huge and growing. So much so that homegrown, public-listed pawnshop Maxi-Cash held its inaugural “pre-loved timepiece festival”, Faces of Time, in September.\n“We noticed that every time people come in to trade watches, or when there are unredeemed [watches] – which means they’ve been pledged but not redeemed – they get snapped up almost immediately when we put it in the store. That shows that there’s a very strong demand for pre-owned watches,” offered Maxi-Cash CEO Ng Leok Cheng.\nAnother reason for the demand: The scarcity of watches on the primary market. In other words, when consumers can’t get their desired watches first-hand. This is due to two factors: Manufacturers deliberately restricting the supply to drive up demand, and the long waiting list for popular models.\nToday, having money in the bank doesn’t get you anything. On the contrary, it might cost you.\n“Some watches have five- or eight-year waiting lists,” said Ng, naming models like the Rolex GMT-Master II, affectionately known as “Pepsi” and “Batman” depending on the colour of their bezels (red and blue or black and blue). “A lot of customers are not willing to wait. They have the cash, and they want to wear it now.”\nTheir fervour comes at a price.\n“The hottest model right now is a steel Daytona with black bezel. The pre-owned asking price is almost S$30,000. We just sold one for S$26,000. At an authorised dealer, they’re only asking S$16,000 to S$18,000,” said Ng. The recommended retail price (RRP) listed on rolex.com is S$16,600.\nHalfway around the world, Rolex is also a top performer. On the models that receive the most attention besides the Daytona, Betteridge’s La Du offered: “Anything in the Professional Series, which includes the GMT-Master, Submariner, Explorer and Yacht-Master, is very much in demand. As Rolex has reduced the availability of those watches, it’s created an upward inertia. Everybody wants to buy them.”\n“Patek Philippes and Audemars Piguets are also hot,” Ng added. “[Audemars Piguet] Royal Oak Offshores are going up [in price] like crazy. We also get a lot of enquiries for the [Patek Philippe Nautilus] References 5711 and 5712. The waitlist is maybe two to three years.”\nLa Du had a similar story. “I just had a client who came back from Patek Philippe’s Place Vendome store in Paris, and the first thing the sales assistant had told him was, ‘Do you have 10 years to wait?’ He was really shocked.”\nTom Chng, founder of the Singapore Watch Club, noted that the tables have turned. “Traditionally, you’d buy the Nautiluses and Aquanauts to build towards a higher-end complication [model]. But now, you’d need to buy a Perpetual Calendar to get on the list to buy a Nautilus! That’s ridiculous. Things have completely flipped around.”\nWILL THE BUBBLE BURST?\nWith the potential to make a handsome profit – in some cases, doubling the principal with models like the Rolex Daytona or the Patek Philippe Nautilus – it’s no surprise that enthusiasts are increasingly seeing vintage watches as less of a hobby than a form of financial investment. Some have turned to reselling to make a quick buck.\n“Many collectors are now flippers, buying watches as an asset and selling in an instant following trends and prices,” observed Tee.\nWith speculative behaviour rife, is a bubble imminent? And, perhaps more importantly, will the bubble burst?\nMany collectors are now flippers, buying watches as an asset and selling in an instant following trends and prices.\nChng believes so. “I definitely think that this is what we’re looking at. The [Nautilus] Reference 5711 is a very nice watch. But when you compare it with other watches at similar price points, you’ll wonder why you’re paying S$70,000 for a steel sports watch that’s not exactly rare or discontinued.”\nThe watch’s RRP is S$39,300. “It’s just a matter of time before people start to question this [logic],” Chng added. “[For S$70,000], you could buy a complication model from a brand with a similar heritage. Maybe not as hot, but in the same league. When people start realising that, the market will start to normalise.”\nWhile waiting for the fever to die down, Chng believes it’s a good time to pick up pieces that have been overlooked by other collectors, such as the Audemars Piguet Star Wheel, a rare model from the 90s that he bought in Hong Kong recently.\nUltimately, Tee believes that acquiring vintage watches should remain a hobby, because “Once you treat it like an investment, you lose the soul of collecting… There is little true love and as a result, brands rise and fall like seasons change… Once you want to treat [vintage watch collecting] like a portfolio, then you'll have to get your charts out and start a plan with a fund,” he said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     timepieces ', '     investment ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Caught in the rain? Here's how to keep your white sneakers in pristine condition
  </h1>, 'text': 'White sneakers have become every stylish woman’s go-to kicks, pairing effortlessly with summery floral sundresses, minimalist shirt-dresses, jeans, shorts, athleisure get-ups and even clubwear.\nWhile they’re definitely easy on the feet, it’s hard to keep them easy on the eye, being the dirt magnets that they are.\nHere’s CNA Lifestyle’s definitive guide to keeping them looking box-fresh and as pure as driven snow.\nASSEMBLE YOUR WHITE SNEAKER CARE KIT\nThis comprises the following items: A stain- and water-repellent spray or a white candle, a shoe brush, a toothbrush, a dishwashing sponge, whitening toothpaste, baking soda, laundry detergent or dishwashing liquid, bleach, soft, clean rags (cut-up old T-shirts are great), wet wipes, melamine sponge, a mesh laundry bag, a stain remover pen, white shoe polish, white nail polish, and nail polish remover.\nBEFORE YOU WEAR THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME \nBe patient and pre-treat your sneakers (especially if they’re canvas) with a stain- and water-repellent spray. This will help create a protective barrier against water and grime.\nCHECK THEM CAREFULLY AFTER EVERY SINGLE WEAR \nThis\xa0will enable you to spot and treat any stains ASAP, which is important because the longer you let\xa0a stain\xa0set, the harder it will be to remove.\nEven if your shoes look clean, it helps to give them a quick once-over with a wet wipe. If only the sole is dirty or scuffed, moisten a melamine sponge and rub gently to remove the marks.\xa0\nIf your sneakers are dirty, brush off any dried\xa0dirt or grass clippings, then clean them. If your sneakers are wet because you got caught in the rain or you spilled your cold brew coffee onto them, clean them immediately.\nAt this point, you’ll realise that leather sneakers are easier to clean than canvas or mesh sneakers as all they need is usually a wipe down, as opposed to a full wash.\n\n\nDON’T FORGET THE SHOELACES\nAlways remove the shoelaces before cleaning your shoes. Soak them for half an hour in a soapy solution before placing them in a mesh bag, and tossing them into the washing machine with your other white laundry – clean shoes with dirty shoelaces is not a good look. Better still, have a few spare pairs of white shoelaces on rotation.\nHOW TO CLEAN YOUR CANVAS/MESH SNEAKERS\nPre-treat serious-looking stains by rubbing a paste of toothpaste, baking soda and water, and leave on for about 30 minutes. Add a teaspoon of laundry or dishwashing detergent, and a teaspoon of baking soda to a large bowl of water. Scrub the shoes with a toothbrush dipped in the soapy solution, spending more time on stains and scuff marks.\nIf the toothbrush or soap solution gets too dirty/muddy, make sure to rinse the toothbrush off and replace the soap solution. After scrubbing, blot the shoe with a damp rag, stuff it with face towels, and air dry away from direct sunlight as that can cause the soles to yellow.\xa0\nHOW TO CLEAN LEATHER SNEAKERS\nHOW TO CLEAN SUEDE/NUBUCK SNEAKERS \nYou can’t wash them or even get them wet.\xa0Your best bet is to head to the stationery store, buy a white eraser and gently rub it on any marks.\nSOME EXTRA POINTERS\n\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     style ']}"

      Creative Capital: The Singaporean brothers who built a Japanese fashion brand
  </h1>, 'text': ""It is hard enough to launch and sustain a successful fashion label here in Singapore. But when you create a local label that pitches simple, monochromatic T-shirts at prices ranging from S$65 to S$155, you may as well have stacked the cards against yourself from the get go.\xa0\nNonetheless, this is exactly what brothers Kenghow and Kage Chong did when they launched their own men’s clothing brand Biro in 2013.\nThey weren’t exactly newbies. The duo had previously developed the\xa0streetwear brand,\xa0Massiveoutfit, that\xa0they founded in 2007.\xa0But they were importing, labelling and selling clothes made by others\xa0–\xa0which, as they learnt more about the trade, wasn’t satisfying enough.\xa0\nThey wanted to design what they sold, and very importantly, they wanted to play decision-making roles in selecting the fabrics used in their products.\xa0\nBy 2010, the Chong brothers\xa0knew they wanted to focus on urban menswear, and spent the next three years on research and development. Within that time, they learnt as much as they could about fabric selection and tailoring. And in the third quarter of 2013, Biro was unveiled.\n\n\nThe two brothers look very different. Kage, the younger one, has long, flowing locks, while Kenghow has a clean, almost civil-servanty look. Kenghow has a background in design. He is an experienced art and creative director. Kage, on the other hand, started his career in dance, but eventually drifted into fashion and retail, working as a buyer and on the production side.\xa0\nThe combination works well. One knows supply chain management, purchasing and merchandising. The other, design, marketing and business development. And while some brothers can\xa0never work together, these two do. And\xa0do they do a fantastic job of complementing each other’s strengths, and covering each other’s weaknesses.\nThe duo, despite the contrasts in look, are both equally taciturn. They like their clothes, their products, to speak for them. Personally, I think they need to be a little more effusive. The average customer, if looking at their shirts or jeans for the first time, would most likely balk at the brand’s prices.\xa0\nIt’s only when one of the brothers takes the time to explain the rarity of the cloth they select that you become comfortable with paying S$95 for a T-shirt, S$190 for a Hawaiian shirt, or S$240 for a pair of jeans.\nTake the S$95 T-shirt as an example. It is made from 100-per-cent\xa0premium Japanese cotton. The fabric for this T-shirt is yarn dyed in Kyoto in the same way that kimono fabric was traditionally dyed, before being woven into fabric. This gives the garment a natural texture, richer colour and excellent colour fastness.\xa0\nIn many ways, Biro is both a Singaporean and Japanese brand. All of the fabrics are handmade in Japan. In fact, Kage has moved to Japan to oversee production and material selection, while Kenghow is minding the store here at home.\nThe most difficult part is balancing your\xa0sense of creativity with\xa0running the business.\nAt present, their clothes are stocked at Tangs Plaza, Isetan, Robinsons, Manifesto, Colony Clothing, Kapok, Keepers, FrontRow, Atomi, Swee Lee, farfetch, and their own little shop Shouten.\nHere, in CNA Lifestyle's series where we speak with creatives making their mark in Singapore, the brothers Chong discuss the challenges of growing a business without compromising integrity.\n\n\nHOW DID YOU DECIDE TO WORK TOGETHER? DID YOU GROW UP THINKING YOU’D WORK TOGETHER?\nKenghow: I had learnt about the confluence of visual art and clothing in my studies. Back then, I'd already imagined us working together on a streetwear line.\xa0One day, Kage\xa0suggested that we go into\xa0clothing business together. The next day, we registered Massiveoutfit, and started importing labels from the States and selling them through a web portal.\xa0\nKage: I have\xa0always been interested in clothes\xa0since\xa0I was young.\xa0Our mother was a tailor and I used to follow her when she visited her clients.\xa0\nWhen I started\xa0b-boying, I was quickly\xa0fascinated by the individuality, and the culture that surrounds the whole dance and b-boy scene. That was kind of the catalyst to starting Massiveoutfit.\nHOW DO YOU DIVIDE THE WORK?\xa0\nKenghow: I focus on business development and marketing, while Kage takes care\xa0of the sourcing and production in Japan. He also creates the\xa0blueprint for each collection.\nWHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOURSELVES FROM\xa0RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS?\nKenghow: We still have a lot to learn and a lot to buck up on.\nKage: The most difficult part is balancing your\xa0sense of creativity with\xa0running the business.\n\n\nDO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELVES ENTREPRENEURS OR CREATIVES FIRST?\nKenghow: Entrepreneurs first.\xa0When we started Massiveoutfit, we were importing and selling goods.\nKage: I’d rather say creative entrepreneurs. We like to start a brand or business but we also have to be creative.\nFor Singaporean customers, I think some brand recognition is still needed to build their confidence in purchasing from a new or relatively unfamiliar brand.\nIS SINGAPORE A TOUGH PLACE TO BE A CREATIVE?\nKenghow: Yes, in one way or another, it’s tougher than other trade or profession.\nKage: Yes, especially if you are small. There will be some struggle if you are not working for a big firm.\nHOW ARE YOUR SINGAPOREAN CUSTOMERS DIFFERENT FROM FOREIGN CUSTOMERS, IF THEY ARE AT ALL?\nKenghow: Thankfully, I think\xa0most of our Singaporean customers are the same as our overseas customers. That is, they are discerning, and attracted to the qualities and details that our brand and clothes offer. It's\xa0just that the number of Singaporeans who buy our clothes is still lower than that of foreign customers.\nKage: For Singaporean customers, I think some brand recognition is still needed to build their confidence in purchasing from a new or relatively unfamiliar brand.\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT INSPIRE YOU?\nKenghow: For me, it's travel. I love going to new places and meeting new people. Also, film. Films inspire me.\nKage: Definitely music, as well as culture and people.\nWHO IS YOUR DESIGN OR CREATIVE HERO?\nKenghow: I like Christopher Nolan’s visuals.\nHOW DO YOU FIND NEW FANS AND CUSTOMERS?\nKenghow: We've been pretty fortunate. Usually, it's through word of mouth. Publications and social media also help a lot.\n\n\nTELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS I WOULD NEVER EXPECT.\nKenghow: We always start our design process by selecting the fabrics, the material, first.\nKage: We work directly with some of the best factories and fabric millers in the world. That’s a pretty big deal for a small Singaporean brand. I’d love for more people to recognise this.\nWe always make sure that the prices are worth paying for.\nWHAT DO PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR BRAND?\nKenghow: That it is not as simple as it seems.\nKage: That our clothes are meant to be easily paired.\nWHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON RIGHT NOW?\nKenghow: We’re crazy busy. We have just released a new collection. We are working on another staple collection that is set for release really shortly, relocating our store in Singapore, looking for a space in Shanghai, conceptualising another brand, and setting up base in Japan, all while seeking out meaningful collaborations.\nWHAT'S BEEN YOUR HERO PRODUCT SO FAR? WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS SO APPEALING?\nKenghow: Our Nishijinori Tee. The fabric is unique. It’s a T-shirt, hence very wearable in Singapore.\xa0And well, honestly, it’s one of our more affordable items.\n\n\nSPEAKING OF THAT, YOUR PIECES ARE NOT CHEAP.\xa0CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT MAKES THEM COST WHAT THEY DO?\nKenghow: Apart from being made in Japan, we use mostly vintage machineries in our production.\nKage: We always make sure that the prices are worth paying for; small\xa0details like the buttons and trims are all premium quality.\nWHAT’S BEEN THE GREATEST WIN SO FAR FOR BIRO?\nKenghow: The countless number of friendships and work relationships that we have made since launching five years ago. These are the driving forces behind the label.\nKage: We have persevered past the hard times, and we’re still growing steadily without compromising\xa0our beliefs.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ']}"

      A watch that costs as much as a 5-room BTO? Someone bought it ... online
  </h1>, 'text': 'As any savvy shopper will tell you, you can buy pretty much anything online these days, even cars.\xa0Yes, cars can be added to your shopping cart as if they were cans of cat food.\nSimilarly, e-tailers are increasingly offering high-value items, such as luxury timepieces and jewellery, for sale on their sites.\nOn Jeweluxeworld, you can order a handmade necklace from Spanish jeweller Magerit for\xa0US$42,229 (S$57,755). On Net-a-Porter, you can find a Buccellati cocktail ring for US$85,888.\xa0\nSincere Fine Watches’ e-commerce platform has a Laurent Ferrier dual timezone watch for S$136,000. And on Net-a-Porter’s sister (or should it be brother?) site Mr\xa0Porter, you can have a one-of-a-kind Roger Dubuis watch with a skeletonised dial for £213,516 (S$371,856).\nExcept you can’t – because it’s been sold. Two of the three Laurent Ferrier watches, which are world exclusives available only on sincerewatch.com, have also been sold.\nThis sort of high-spending habit might come as a surprise to those of us more accustomed to shopping for clothes and accessories on Asos or Zalora, groceries on Redmart, and gadgets and toys on Amazon, where the final bill doesn’t often – or perhaps never – exceeds S$1,000. At S$370,000, you could get a 5-room BTO flat in Sembawang, Sengkang or Yishun.\xa0\nWhat’s interesting is the speed at which these high-ticket items were sold. While Mr\xa0Porter has retailed timepieces since 2013, the Roger Dubuis special edition was only made available on Nov 19. Meanwhile, Sincere Fine Watches went online in Jul 2018. Clearly, there’s a demand for such items.\nOng Ban, CEO of Sincere Fine Watches, admitted that the fine watch industry in Singapore “has been slow to embrace e-commerce and digital innovation”, and that until this year, the only digital channels that customers could acquire or trade luxury watches were online marketplaces.\xa0However, “most of the watches sold [through such channels] are deemed unauthorised by the brands”.\n\n\nNet-a-Porter’s Global Director, VIP Client Relations Lupe Puerta believes that the demand was pent up. “Our customers are very savvy and have been wanting to buy hard luxury online for a long time,” she told CNA Lifestyle.\nThe site began offering a dedicated watch and jewellery section earlier this year, and now counts 50 brands in its stable. Some of these brands, such as De Grisogono and Piaget, have never had an online retail presence prior to Net-a-Porter.\nNot surprisingly, Singapore ranks among the top three markets for the site’s fine jewellery business, said Puerta, the other two being Hong Kong and Australia.\xa0\nThe top-selling brand in the region? The (Chinese-owned) Italian brand Buccellati, makers of that US$85,888 gem-encrusted ring. There are more affordable options from the brand, of course, like a US$612 pair of 18K gold earrings.\nBut affordable doesn’t come with bells and whistles, and perhaps that’s part of what’s driving the interest and demand.\nThe buyer of the unique Roger Dubuis Excalibur Aventador S timepiece – designed in partnership with Lamborghini – gets to enjoy an equally unique experience. He will be flown to Geneva, put up in a five-star hotel, presented with his purchase at Roger Dubuis’ watchmaking facility, and then taken on a driving tour through the Swiss Jura mountains in a (what else) Lamborghini Aventador S. Nice work if you can get it.\nWILL MILLION-DOLLAR TRINKETS BE SOLD ONLINE SOMEDAY? \nPrior to Nov 19, the most costly timepiece on Mr\xa0Porter was a Vacheron Constantin Traditionelle at £112,350 (S$195,950), or half the price of the Roger Dubuis. Which begs the question, will the company ever retail watches that cost more than US$500,000 or even a cool million?\n“It would be tricky for me to say if there will be a price limit set on the luxury watches we sell,” Mr\xa0Porter’s Managing Director Toby Bateman told CNA Lifestyle. “We endeavour to introduce even more luxury and exclusive timepieces to our global customers, so the sky would be the limit.”\nCurrently, Net-a-Porter’s priciest bauble is the Buccellati ring. Its costliest timepiece is an IWC Schaffhausen Da Vinci, retailing for US$40,069. Puerta believes that it won’t be long before the US$100,000 threshold is crossed.\n“Our customers are incredibly loyal to Net-a-Porter,” she explained. “Almost all of our jewellery customers revisit the site on a weekly basis, showing us that they are very comfortable shopping with us for high-end pieces regularly.”\nPuerta added: “A significant proportion of our fine jewellery sales come from our EIPs (Extremely Important Persons)\xa0who are in contact with their personal shoppers on a daily basis through multiple channels. Especially with known brands, it is a matter of service and convenience that our customer can have pieces sent directly to their homes.”\nDO ONLINE SHOPPERS HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICE BARRIER? \nAngela Loh, Founder and CEO of jeweluxeworld.com, said that for well-known brands, customers would “spend up to S$5,000”, but for lesser-known brands, “they will not go beyond S$1,000”. She also noticed that for items costing above S$1,000, customers would make enquiries before committing to the purchase.\nOng noted that while sincerewatches.com has sold everything from S$400 pieces to the two S$136,000 Laurent Ferrier limited edition models, he sees “no limit to how much customers will spend online”.\xa0\nHe said: “Customers’ level of comfort is dependent on various reasons including the offer, product exclusivity and rarity. If customers can shop in confidence and with assurance on an authorised platform, there is no reason why they will not acquire the timepieces.”\nPuerta and Bateman sang a similar tune. Said Puerta: “We cannot generalise when it comes to the high-end and luxury customer. We see some customers who like to invest in very important pieces, no matter the price but they are driven by different factors, whether that be emotional, as a collector’s piece, or for a special occasion.”\nBateman explained: “I’m afraid it would be unrealistic for me to set a price threshold on luxury watches for our customers. A luxury timepiece can be an object of mechanical wonder, and people are allowed to perceive its value differently based on their taste and experience with the brand. A watch could mean a substantial fortune to someone if it resonates with them aesthetically.”\nBUSINESS SCHOOL 101: SERVICE IS KEY\nOften, how much a customer is willing to spend depends on the experience he or she has had on the site, believes Loh. “If they spend S$15,000 and they feel positive, they will continue to buy,” she said, adding that she places a lot of emphasis on her site’s concierge services. “We call or WhatsApp (our customers), so it’s more personal.”\nMeanwhile, Net-a-Porter and Mr\xa0Porter both maintain multiple avenues of support for their customers, ranging from live chat functions to private viewing opportunities.\n“We continue to educate ourselves through working with the variety of watch brands onsite, and only with such are we able to pass that knowledge and advice to our customers through our Luxury Watch Guide and detailed description for each timepiece,” said Bateman.\xa0\n“We are definitely also acquiring watch experts to provide 24/7 service to answer any questions our customers may have through a phone call or via live chat.”\nNet-a-Porter’s Personal Shoppers receive training from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) – the industry standard for training and professional development in gems and jewellery – which Puerta says allows the team to deliver on-demand, expert advice.\n“Our Personal Shoppers can also reserve key styles from the brands stocked on Net-a-Porter, with the exclusive opportunity to host private viewings of new collections and place bespoke orders for one-of-a-kind pieces for those wishing to build a truly original collection,” she added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

While it may seem like an unlikely item to splurge on yourself, it is an investment-worthy piece that will last you a lifetime.\nBERLUTI FAST TRACK TORINO SNEAKERS\nKnown for its well-crafted leather shoes, Berluti’s sneakers are just as exquisite as its formal offerings.

      Time to splurge: Our picks for the best watches worthy of your year-end bonus
  </h1>, 'text': 'After diligently toiling away for the past 11 months, along comes an email from HR with the three little words you’ve been waiting all year for: Year-end bonus. And lo and behold, the payout is better than you expected, thanks to your company having a bumper year.\nIf that’s the situation you find yourself in, well then, a celebration is in order. And by celebration we mean splashing out on a finely-wrought Swiss or German timepiece. We’ve shortlisted six timekeepers that we feel are worth the splurge, whether as an expression of your personality, or because they make good value propositions.\nROLEX COSMOGRAPH DAYTONA\nIt didn’t take long for Rolex’s Cosmograph Daytona – or Daytona for short – to outgrow its origins as a tool watch meant to time race laps. Today, it is as much a status symbol as it is an icon of the motoring world.\nThis striking version in full Everose gold has an unmistakable swank about it. But the high-contrast black sub-dials – all the better to see them with – hint at its utilitarian past. Considering how highly sought-after Daytonas are, it’s never a bad choice to splash out on one. Your future generations will thank you.\nVACHERON CONSTANTIN FIFTYSIX COMPLETE CALENDAR\nNo doubt the vintage look is trending at the moment, but look beyond the current fad and you’ll realise that, well, the “vintage look” never really went away at all. The ancestors of many current production watches look contemporary today. By the same token, many current production models still bear that classical look that won’t look out of date 10, 20 or even 50 years down the road.\nVacheron Constantin’s Fiftysix Complete Calendar is one such example. That classical dial layout, with its day and month windows, as well as moon phase indication, is going to stand the test of time. Plus, the watch is certified with the Hallmark of Geneva – one of the industry’s highest standards of quality.\nHERMES CARRE H\nHere’s a nifty number that’ll speak to the design-oriented. That’s you, architects and interior decorators, admen and graphics folks. Admittedly, the Hermes Carre H struck us as resembling an Apple Watch at one glance, but upon closer inspection the (many) differences become apparent. For one, the watch runs on a mechanical, in-house movement, meaning Hermes quality inside and out.\nThe wealth of subtle design details is what makes the watch stand out. We’re referring to the elegantly curved profile of the case – so that it sits nicely on the wrist; the guilloche design on the dials that reflect light in a unique way; and the unusual choice of colour on the seconds hand, which give the watch its personality. All this is courtesy of designer Marc Berthier, whose work is exhibited in the permanent collection of New York’s MoMA.\n\n\nFRANCK MULLER CRAZY HOURS 15TH ANNIVERSARY ASIA EDITION\nIf you aren’t familiar with the antics of Swiss watchmaker Franck Muller, his Crazy Hours watch is a good place to start. Notice how the hour numerals are not arranged in sequence? Well, that’s part of the appeal. The idea is that time is what you make of it. Muller dreamt up this idea while on holiday in Mauritius, which is frankly where we’d like to be right now.\nThe watch does keep time, in case you were wondering: The hour hand jumps to the correct number every 60 minutes. This handsome version, made specially for the Asian market to celebrate the watch’s 15th birthday, pairs a rose gold-and-diamond studded case with a cobalt blue leather strap. It’s a special occasion watch for sure, but there are 39 other versions to choose from if this particular combo doesn’t tickle your fancy.\nA. LANGE & SOHNE DATOGRAPH UP/DOWN LUMEN\nAsk any watch enthusiast what his holy grail timepiece is, and there’s a high chance the reply will be “a Datograph”. In which case, he’d be referring to German watchmaker A. Lange & Sohne’s Datograph, which launched in 1999 to critical acclaim thanks to the sheer beauty and functionality of its integrated mechanical chronograph movement. As proof of its desirability, a circa-2000 model recently sold for almost 20 per cent above its high estimate at a Sotheby’s auction in Geneva.\nIn 2012, that first generation was replaced by the Datograph Up/Down, which came with a power reserve function. In Oct 2018, the Datograph Up/Down Lumen made its debut with a luminous display on its hands, chronograph counters and power reserve indicator – handy for movie nights. With only 200 pieces available, procuring one is going to be tricky, but we reckon it’ll be worth your while in the long run if you manage to.\nMB&F LEGACY MACHINE SPLIT ESCAPEMENT \nThose with a taste for classics with a twist will do well to consider MB&F’s Legacy Machine Split Escapement. Brand founder Maximilian Busser describes his Legacy Machines as what “MB&F would have created 100 years ago”, and it’s not hard to see why. There’s a healthy respect for the old ways in both the construction and finishing of the pieces.\nOn the Split Escapement model, the twist lies in the way the balance is constructed. It appears to cantilever over the dial, but its supporting structures – the key components that make the watch ‘tick’, such as the lever and escape wheel – are concealed below the dial. A hundred years from now, we bet this ticker will still look good.\nPhotography by Ealbert Ho, art direction and styling by Chern Ling.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     timepieces ', '     fashion ']}"

      Creative Capital: The Nanyang Polytechnic entrepreneur fancying up men's fashion
  </h1>, 'text': ""A degree in software engineering is not the usual background for a bespoke tailor. But Matthew Gideon’s interest in fashion was ignited concurrent to his enrolment in Nanyang Polytechnic at 17.\nYoung Matthew could not find, what was in his opinion, the perfect hoodie.\xa0Unlike most teenagers his age, who would have been satisfied with the closest thing to the vision in his mind’s eye, Matthew started to customise his hoodies. The resulting pieces were so eye-catching that friends urged him to start his own streetwear label.\nGood Asian son that he is, Matthew waited until he received his degree and finished National Service. At that point, the then 22-year-old budding entrepreneur had long since traded in his hoodies for more sartorial togs. Matthew established his label – DEBONEIRE – not for the person he was then, but for the person he envisioned himself to be.\xa0\nWhich is why Matthew decided to focus his business around tailored suits, exquisite, often ornate dinner jackets, and splendid robes.\nDEBONEIRE made its debut in 2015. Through his online store, Matthew sells ready-to-wear pieces but is also available to service clients who are looking to commission more bespoke products. The now 27-year-old designer has built up not just a great reputation but an enviable client list, which includes singer Nathan Hartono.\nHere, in CNA Lifestyle's series where we speak with creatives making their mark in Singapore, Matthew discusses entrepreneurial challenges, growing up in a grocery store, and his desire to spark a movement promoting elegance.\n\n\nHOW DID YOU GET INTO TAILORING? DID YOU KNOW THIS WAS WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO DO?\nMATTHEW GIDEON: Most definitely not. In my final years of secondary school, blogs were just becoming a thing. Web design and graphic design hugely piqued my interest to the point of obsession, so I enrolled for a software engineering course.\nIt was then, for the first time, going to school without having to wear a uniform, that I discovered another interest – putting ensembles together. I’ve been told that I was picky about my wardrobe choices growing up. Even my pyjamas had to look coordinated.\nTELL ME A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU GREW UP.\nI grew up spending a significant time of my childhood living with my paternal grandparents in a quaint little neighbourhood in the West. They owned a grocery store, and were very involved in the daily operations. I recall spending afternoons doing my homework sitting on piles of rice sacks, and in times of mischief, I’d be caught poking through eggshells and getting reprimanded by grandma.\nI believe it was through spending a lot of time hanging out in the shop and observing daily activities that I got my entrepreneurial spirit. It’s also where I learned the concept of managing money. I’ve been instilled with a prudent mind-set from a very young age.\n\n\nThe only luxury I was allowed was the occasional candy despite having the access to it in grandpa’s store, and a new toy train every birthday from the Thomas the Tank Engine series that I was so obsessed with. Other than that, I never had a lot of store-bought toys. Most of them I actually made with the help of my nanny and my mum.\nThe coolest thing I remember making was a Thomas The Tank Engine made out of hand-painted recycled cardboard boxes that was big enough for me to sit in.\nMy parents were often told by my teachers that I was a creative and expressive child, and my parents have always been encouraging me to pursue my passions. They even gave me the opportunity to take up violin lessons as well as drama classes when I was younger.\nIS SINGAPORE A TOUGH PLACE TO BE A CREATIVE?\nIf you compare Singapore with the other side of the world, Singapore is a relatively tough place. However, it’s important to realise Singapore, in comparison, is such a young country. Europe, for example, has had many more centuries to allow culture and support systems to develop. Hopefully Singapore will catch on soon.\nI appreciate that in recent years, our government has been starting to pay attention and offering more support to the creative industry. At the end of the day, there are always challenges that come along with every endeavour. If you’re truly creative, you’d be able to find ways to get by.\nWHAT’S BEEN THE HARDEST PART ABOUT BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR SO FAR?\nStarting out was the hardest, especially at such a young age. I truly had no idea what I was in for, but as time went by I learned to manage.\nEntrepreneurship is something you learn and manage through practice. No matter how much time is spent studying it in theory, every individual’s entrepreneurship journey will be different. Change is the only constant – there is almost always a new fire to fight every day.\nAlong with that, managing people and managing my own expectations were definitely some of the biggest challenges I faced.\n\n\nHOW DO YOU FIND NEW FANS AND CUSTOMERS?\nI have my friends and customers to thank, who often help me to spread the good word. Then there’s social media, of course! We also occasionally organise events in collaboration with other brands and institutions.\nWHAT SETS YOUR WORK APART FROM OTHER TAILORS?\nDEBONEIRE is more of a design house. A brand with a voice and aesthetic. In addition to regularly putting out collections of ready-to-wear clothing, we launched DEBONEIRE By Appointment, a house-call custom tailoring service we offer, to better meet our client’s needs.\nWhether it’s a fabric of a specific colour, pattern, a jacket cut in a certain way, or simply to make a suit that fits to one’s physique, we’re there to make it happen with you and for you in the comfort of your own home. From the shape of the pockets, to the colour of the stitches, every element of the clothing item can be customised as you please.\nDO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ENTREPRENEUR FIRST OR A DESIGNER FIRST?\nI started out really just wanting to create polished, elegant, clothing for men. Entrepreneurship is something I learned along the way, and it’s become more of a mind-set, a way of life. If you had asked me this earlier, I probably would have said designer in an instant, but now I think I function more as an entrepreneur.\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT INSPIRE YOU?\nI have an obsession with the ornate interiors of grand palaces around the world. That has definitely inspired me for the longest time. Other than that, inspiration can come from anywhere: The people I meet, places I go to, music, movies and furniture.\nWHO IS YOUR OWN DESIGN OR CREATIVE HERO?\nJacques Garcia. His work perfectly embodies the world I desire to exist in.\n\n\nTELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS I WOULD NEVER EXPECT.\nThanks to modern day technology, the entire design process can be accomplished from start to finish on my phone. Apart from the actual garment construction, of course.\nWHAT’S THE FUTURE OF MENSWEAR TO YOU?\nTough question. Menswear has gone incredibly street the past few years, which, honestly, I’m not a fan of. As far as I’m concerned DEBONEIRE will always be classic and a brand that represents a more glamorous style that I hope people will always be willing to embrace.\nWHAT’S BEEN YOUR HERO PRODUCT SO FAR? WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS SO APPEALING?\nOur evening wear. A lot of our evening jackets use ornate fabrics that help the wearers to tastefully and effortlessly differentiate themselves.\nWHAT’S THE DREAM?\nFor DEBONEIRE to become a respected name in the menswear space, and a brand that helps spark a movement promoting elegance. We’re too casual about everything these days, and I’m really hoping to change that.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"

      Street food and Sailor Moon: 5 unique Miss Universe 2018 costumes from Asia
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Internet\xa0was abuzz when Miss Universe Singapore Zahra Khanum unveiled on Thursday (Nov 29) her national costume, which she said embodied world peace.\nHowever, peace was the last thing Miss Khanum enjoyed as her Trump-Kim summit costume ignited debate over its style, colour choice\xa0and depiction of the North Korean and United States flags.\nAhead of the Miss Universe pageant that will be held in Bangkok next month, we take a look at five other unique national costumes from Asia that have also become the talk of the town:\nJAPAN\nJapan’s\xa0Yuumi Kato will be bringing something old and something new to the competition, in the form of her double-duty costume that will see her transform from a female ninja into\xa0anime icon Sailor Moon.\nIn an Instagram video on Wednesday, Miss Universe Japan showed Miss Kato parading a traditional red kunoichi outfit, before turning around and morphing into the anime schoolgirl\'s alter ego.\nCommenting on her cosplay choice, Miss Kato said this year’s costume represents the ""new Japanese culture""\xa0of ""woman warrior Sailor Moon"".\nNational Director of Miss Universe Japan said that she wanted to have a costume that could ""express Japan to the world"".\nVIETNAM\nAlthough it was not to everyone\'s taste, Miss Universe Vietnam\'s bold fashion statement embodies one of the most iconic foods from the Southeast Asian nation.\nH\'Hen Nie\'s elaborate outfit features a skirt of banh mi, a ubiquitous Vietnamese baguette sandwich, flanked by two basket ""wings"".\nWhile the design went against the grain for many, Miss Nie was quoted by Viet Nam News as saying: ""Whether you go to the poorest areas of the North and Central Highlands, or the most exquisite places of HCM (Ho Chi Minh) City and Hanoi, you will find the presence of bread. For foreigners, seeing banh mi and pho (noodles) they will think of Vietnam.""\nThe controversial pick was voted\xa0the most popular outfit from six potential choices. Several of the other options were more formal.\nMALAYSIA\nHaving\xa0drawn flak for its nasi lemak and Petronas Twin Towers costumes in the past, Malaysia hopes to sail through the competition this year with a creation inspired by a traditional Malay fishing boat.\nThe ensemble made a splash\xa0on Instagram earlier this month, with Miss Universe Malaysia Jane Teoh explaining that her national costume was based on the bangau perahu from the state of Terengganu.\n""It\'s iconic and rich in Malay culture, making it uniquely Malaysian. Definitely feeling strong, bold and confident donning it,"" she wrote.\nTHAILAND\nThis year’s pageant host will grace the stage as ""Chang, the Icon of Siam"".\nA video of Thai beauty queen Ning Sophiba introducing the outfit on Nov 19 shows the dress\' white train unfurling into a hood in the shape of an elephant’s head, complete with a collapsible trunk.\nMiss Universe Thailand decided on the outfit after a competition, which included other creative submissions such as pieces inspired by Ratchaburi’s floating market as well as Thailand’s Songkran festival.\nAccording to Khaosod news agency, winning designer Theer Phasuk said: “Elephants are a symbol of our nation and have been with us for a long time. Elephants are what foreigners recognise about Thailand.”\nIn 2015, Thailand drew derision for its tuk-tuk costume, complete with working headlights. The\xa0outfit raced ahead of other competitors to be named Best National Costume at the pageant in Las Vegas.\nCAMBODIA\nMiss Universe Cambodia Rern Sinat will have the weight of the kingdom on her shoulders.\nDubbed “The Kingdom of Wonder”, the costume has rich cultural and historical elements, including a headdress in the form of UNESCO World Heritage Site Angkor Wat, set against the colour of the Cambodian flag.\nThe Cambodian flag is\xa0echoed on the arm hangings, while the dress is also adorned with designs based on the mysterious smiling faces of the Bayon temple and the Romduol, Cambodia’s national flower.\n""For me, this National Costume is more than just an attire.

      The printed shirt takes you from street casual to cocktail formal this party season
  </h1>, 'text': ""It’s easy to stick to the tried-and-tested formula with your sartorial choices but why not take it up a notch and embrace bold prints that are all the rage on the runways this season?\nAlready an established staple in many high street brands and luxurious labels, the choices you have to stand out in a party crowd are\xa0aplenty, whether it’s a brash shirt with outlandish colours or an updated Hawaiian vacation shirt that’s been having its own\xa0quiet renaissance.\nWhile a huge dose of confidence does help when it comes to\xa0pulling off a bold shirt, the key to making it work\xa0is impeccable styling: Keep the silhouette simple and work it with the staples already in your wardrobe.

      Minis and bell bottoms, geometry and tights: The swinging 60s are back in style
  </h1>, 'text': ""When Karl Lagerfeld put his Chanel Cruise cast in white stockings and Mary Janes, it was clear\xa0the 1960s was once again upon us. The 60s was a particularly prolific time for fashion, spawning many style trends we now call iconic:\xa0Mod, the babydoll, the flower child, the hippie, to name a few.\nBlame it on the rag trade’s unwillingness to let go of the past, but the biggest names in fashion – Lagerfeld along with his famous friends Gucci’s Alessandro Michele and Ferragmo’s Paul Andrew – are loving a little throwback fashion.\nCNA Lifestyle counts the ways to relive the Swinging Sixties without looking like you're attending a costume party.\nBABY, YOU’RE A DOLL\nThe babydoll first came about in the 1960s, and despite umpteen reiterations, the instantly recognisable A-line continues to make an impact\xa0– this time\xa0in a patterned wallpaper print of deep, dark colours punched up by flashes of neon.\nFor a modern touch, consider changing up the fabrication. Instead of clunky wool and restrictive polyester, try gossamer chiffon or lightweight cotton for a svelte and airy finish. It won’t hurt to add au courant touches of knife pleats (busy girls need to take bigger strides) and/or a high neckline (modest dressing is so in\xa0trend right now). Style tip: Coloured tights make for a playful finish to your look. \xa0\xa0\nART IN MOTION\nPop art was an indelible part of the 1960s, thanks to icons like Andy Warhol. Three decades after his passing, Warhol's masterful play on bright colours remains relevant and directly lends itself as a source of inspiration for ready-to-wear.\nBut don’t limit yourself to just colour play – push it further with colour geometry (hello, Mary Quant) that is at once modern and timeless. While you’re at it, work in it dash of beatnik style for that irreverent artist vibe.\n\n\nLONG LIVE THE MINI \nIt is still debated if Mary Quant did in fact invent the miniskirt. Not comfortable flashing so much bare leg? Take a style tip from the 60s and bring on the coloured tights.\xa0Remember this: Solid\xa0and neon tights\xa0add\xa0character to the getup (think Mary Quant in pink tights and Twiggy in opaque white tights) while prints double up as accessories. Pair with boots or Mary Janes to pull the look together.\nDO THE HIPPIE SHAKE\nBuild your own Summer Of Love memory. Just be sure to adjust to modern context. The modern flower child no longer wears flowers in her hair and she's traded in that braided leather belt for a designer one. Yes, she’s shiny and new but she still wants peace and love.\nSHE WEARS THE PANTS\nHow can we do a 60s roundup without bell bottoms? And who wore them best?\xa0Cher, of course. The label Staud even named their flared pants after her.\nBut flared pants aren’t the easiest to wear. It’s all in the hip-to-flare ratio. The smaller the hips, the bigger the flare, and vice versa. Girls who are generous at the hips can cheat with bell bottoms covered in\xa0busy swirly prints.\xa0Let the attention be on the print.\nBring back Cher’s blunt-cut bangs and kohl-rimmed eyes to complete the resurrection.\nPhotography by Kelvin Chia, styling by Damian Huang, hair by Sean Ang, makeup by Melissa Yeo, model Bora from Mannequin.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Culture & Trends ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Rain, Zoe Tay, Fann Wong, Rebecca Lim attend Cartier ION flagship re-opening
  </h1>, 'text': ""Nine years ago, when Cartier first opened their ION Orchard flagship boutique, Zoe Tay was there to officiate the ceremony. On Friday (Nov 23), Ah Jie was back – this time to unveil the store’s brand new look after a six-month renovation and expansion.\n“I’m happy to see the new store [now occupying] a larger space. I’m looking forward to seeing the beautiful exhibition pieces,” Tay told CNA Lifestyle on the red carpet, before being hastened into the boutique by harried minders.\nThe cause of the haste? Heavy rain that contributed to traffic woes and a delay in the stars’ arrivals. The other reason, of course, was the general craziness of Black Friday.\nThe biggest star of the night, Korean superstar Rain – being named after a weather pattern doesn’t preclude you from being at its mercy\xa0– showed up an hour past his scheduled appearance.\n“I’m so happy to be back in Singapore again. My fans are always so welcoming,” he said, speaking through a translator. Last in Singapore for a concert at Resorts World Sentosa in Dec 2016, the 36-year-old entertainer added that he was currently working on a new movie, a new album and an Asia-wide tour in 2019, without revealing further details.\n\n\nDespite Rain’s megawatt presence, the biggest cheers of the night were reserved for Rui En, whose fans had set up camp on both sides of the red carpet. Known as the RBKD, they held banners and chanted loudly upon catching sight of their idol.\nThe 250 or so VIP guests, however, were thrilled to be able to meet Rain. Actress and model Sheila Sim told CNA Lifestyle with a laugh: “[I want to say to him]\xa0'You’re very handsome, welcome to Singapore!'\xa0And I hope he has time to stay. I’m proud of Singapore’s food. I hope he gets to enjoy it.”\nAlso lending glamour to the evening were power couple Fann Wong and Christopher Lee.\nConsidered friends of the brand, the couple have officiated overseas boutique openings, such as the one in Ho Chi Minh City in Jan 2018. Lee was also part of the brand’s Drive de Cartier campaign in early 2017.\nRebecca Lim – this year’s Best Actress winner at the Star Awards – last worked with Cartier in 2014, customising a bag for the brand.\n“I like the heart, the craftsmanship, the history behind the brand. What sets Cartier apart from other brands is its rich history, and the amount of workmanship and heart that they put in everything they do,” she told CNA Lifestyle.\nThe actress revealed that she’ll soon start filming a Chinese-language martial arts film, while her new 10-part crime drama, The Bridge, in which she plays a detective, is premiering tonight (Nov 26) on HBO and Viu.\n“It’s a Malaysia-Singapore co-production and it’s about a body found on [Malaysia–Singapore Second Link], and how two detectives from both countries solve the case together despite their differences. It’s my toughest character to date. Hoping that people will like it!”\nCartier's new three-story boutique features an exhibition focusing on its famous panther motifs, and is open to the public.\xa0Cartier, Icon Of Style explores the evolution of this iconic design and links to royalty and celebrities, including\xa0a diamond-and-sapphire brooch that once belonged to the Duchess Of Windsor, Wallis Simpson.\nCartier, Icon Of Style runs from Nov 24 to Dec 6.

      Watchmakers focus on interchangeable straps to provide more value for money
  </h1>, 'text': ""For the part of the watch that enjoys maximum real estate on your wrist, the bracelet has been woefully untapped by watchmakers. That is, until now. Previously regarded as merely a functional tool needed to secure your watch to your wrist, the bracelet is no longer just an after-thought, as it has become a crucial element in watch design.\nThat’s not to undermine the importance the watch bracelet has always played in determining the overall aesthetic of your look, as different straps have long been associated with different occasions: Leather straps for boardroom meetings, stainless steel for the weekends, and so on.\nBut the problem with pigeon-holing the aesthetic of your watch bracelet means that it offers scant versatility, unless you have the luxury of time to visit a watch shop every time you wanted to change up your look, or you have the necessary tools at home – which in itself is a deterrent as amateur prodding and probing can easily scratch the case or lugs.\nIn recent years, astute watchmakers have identified this issue and are looking to jump on the personalisation bandwagon that has already permeated the fashion and jewellery worlds. If you can monogram your Louis Vuitton bag and change your Pandora charm, why can’t your watch offer the same level of customisation?\nPreviously, the dial was one of the only elements of the watch that could be personalised, as it can be engraved, enamelled or painted, but it is a long and expensive process.\nNow, watchmaking brands are investing capital and R&D into creating bracelets that are not just aesthetically pleasing, but also ergonomic, comfortable and hypo-allergenic. They are also offering a much wider range of colours and materials for the straps than ever before. No longer are you restricted to muted brown or black leather straps.\nAt IWC Schaffhausen, for instance, customers can choose from a range of Santoni straps in a range of colours when purchasing a Portofino 37. The watchmaker also recently released summer edition Nato straps for selected Portugieser and Pilot’s watches.\nBut if you truly want maximum bang for your buck, watchmakers including Vacheron Constantin, Hublot and Cartier have recalibrated the watch bracelet and lug system so the straps can be easily interchanged at home, no tools required.\n\n\nElegant solutions like Hublot’s One Click system, whereby the activation of the latch disengages the bracelet, offer a plethora of choices and the option to expand your wardrobe without the need to invest in a new timepiece.\nAt Vacheron Constantin, this easy-to-change bracelet system was launched in 2016 within the Overseas collection, whereby each watch is sold inclusive of two or three bracelets. Gold watches come with two strap options: Alligator Mississippiensis or rubber, while stainless steel timepieces are given an additional full metal strap.\nEven the deployant buckle can be adjusted by 4mm while you’re wearing the watch – a boon in a climate like Singapore’s, where your wrist responds to the weather, expanding and contracting accordingly.\nThis year, when Cartier brought back its iconic Santos collection, it came with a much-needed 21st-century update: Two interchangeable straps that can be swapped with the patent-pending QuickSwitch system.\nAnd if you've ever gone back home after a watch purchase and realised that your strap is too snug, you’ll appreciate the SmartLink self-fitting technology, whereby links can be removed or added on without any tools.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     timepieces ', '     fashion ']}"

      Cartier’s ION flagship is now the size of 10 HDB flats and features Peranakan artefacts
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’ve ambled past ION Orchard in the last week or so, you’d have noticed the sudden appearance of a red-and-gold ferris wheel emblazoned with the Cartier logo.\xa0\nNo, the French luxury house isn’t venturing into the manufacture of ferris wheels (although the Singapore Flyer would benefit from a\xa0makeover). The ferris wheel is meant to add a festive flair to the mall and\xa0draw attention to the brand’s renovated premises, which, after a six-month refurbishment, has emerged bigger and shinier than before.\nThe renovation was necessary because ""people are more sophisticated these days, with them travelling for work and/or leisure and they get exposed to different shopping experiences"", Cartier\'s Regional Managing Director Jerome Metzger told CNA Lifestyle.\xa0\nThe Cartier ""triplex"" sprawls over 688sqm –\xa0or the size of almost 10 three-room HDB flats –\xa0and now boasts an entirely new third level.\nCartier’s love letter to Singapore begins on the boutique’s facade, where the 20m glass frontage is patterned with palm frond motifs, a reference to our tropical climate. It continues on the third level, which is styled to look like an apartment with living and dining areas. Here, you’ll find Peranakan artefacts artfully displayed throughout, as well as Peranakan motifs incorporated in the interior design.\nThe idea behind the apartment setup is to create ""a\xa0general atmosphere of feeling comfortable in one’s home"", said Metzger, while the Peranakan artefacts are meant to ""highlight the local Singaporean culture"".\xa0\nIt’s also on the third level that you can glimpse the Museum pieces in the Cartier, Icon Of Style exhibition, which is on show for just two weeks. The brand is best known for its panther motifs, which first made its appearance on a wristwatch in 1914. Today, the feline can be found on everything from rings to\xa0pendants, wristwatch dials and even perfume bottles.\nFittingly, the exhibition explores the evolution of this iconic design, as well as its connection to royalty and celebrity. The Duchess Of Windsor, Wallis Simpson, was a fan of the big cat, purchasing a diamond-and-sapphire brooch from Cartier in 1949. You can admire this exquisite (and very adorable) piece, a diamond-encrusted panther with sapphire spots that sits atop a 152.35-carat Kashmir cabochon sapphire\xa0in the exhibition.\nThe big cat doesn’t just live on the products, though; it also exists in the very bones of the shop. On a plaster panel in the stairwell between the first and second levels is the sculpted form of a panther carved in bas-relief, nestled amid tropical foliage. It’s another reference to Singapore, specially designed for the space.\nAs a flagship boutique, the store carries a comprehensive range of products, including iconic collections like Love, Juste Un Clou, Santos De Cartier and Panthere De Cartier; as well as high jewellery collections such as Coloratura and Cactus. There\'s also a 10-piece limited edition Panthere Lovee watch that\'s only available at ION.\xa0\nCartier, Icon Of Style runs from Nov 24 to Dec 6. Opening hours are from Mon to Fri, 12pm to 9pm; Sat and Sun, 10.30am to 9pm. Admission is free.\xa0As viewing slots are limited, visitors are encouraged to reserve a session at\xa0www.cartier-ion.sg/register.\xa0 \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     jewellery ', '     timepieces ', '     fashion ']}"

      Decoding men's dress codes: What to wear when the invitation gets specific
  </h1>, 'text': 'Cocktail. Smart casual. Black tie. Black tie\xa0optional? We’ve all been befuddled by the different dress codes stated in invitations. While you may be tempted to go as you please, dressing accordingly shows decorum and, more importantly, respect for the host.\nAs the year-end festive invitations start to roll in, we break down the different types of dress code for you so you can navigate your way through the complexity of dressing for the occasion.\nBLACK TIE\nWhile white tie is the most formal (it consists of a black\xa0dress\xa0tailcoat worn over a white starched shirt, waistcoat and a white bow tie worn around a detachable collar), the black tie is the most common dress code for events such as award ceremonies, a prestigious ball or a grand wedding.\nTraditionally, a black tie tuxedo is in midnight blue, because the colour looks darker as the sun sets and under artificial lighting. Today, black is favoured.\nJust like any suit you own, fit is everything for your tuxedo, from the shoulders to the length of the sleeves to the lapels. Unlike a traditional suit, the lapels of your dinner jacket should be in a different material such as silk or satin. Pick peaked lapels to accentuate the V-shape of your dinner jacket. The trousers should have a satin or silk ribbon strip running down, fit flawlessly and match the colour of your jacket. \xa0\nA black tie ensemble is not complete without a bow tie, and your formal black shoes should be immaculate, especially for this special occasion.\nShould you wear a cummerbund or a waistcoat? That’s entirely up to you. However, if you’re wearing a waistcoat, it should cover the band seams of your trousers. Exposing the top of your trousers or white shirt is a big no-no.\nSometimes, an invitation may state “black tie optional”. What this means is that\xa0the event is still a relatively formal one but guests have the option of coming in a business suit if they choose to. In this case, opt for a dark suit with a dark tie and a pair of black shoes.\nCOCKTAIL\nCocktail essentially means semi-formal or an outfit that will take you from boardroom to dinner. In this case, a suit or blazer-and-trousers combo is a safe bet. You can also add a colourful pocket square or patterned socks for a touch of whimsy. Alternatively,\xa0swap out your business shirt for a turtleneck sweater, printed shirt and polka dot pocket square to stand out in the crowd. \xa0\nNot sure about prints? Then play with the textures of your fabric. Don’t be afraid to mix and match. Instead of black or brown formal shoes, you can even opt to go sockless with a pair of elegant loafers.\nBUSINESS\nWhen the dress code calls for “business” or “businesswear”, it simply means a matching single-breasted or double-breasted suit in a solid colour such as black, navy or grey. A plaid or pinstriped suit is acceptable too. While a tie is encouraged, in our humid climate, you can choose to remove it if the situation allows it. Last but not least, pick a pair of black or brown shoes to complete the outfit.\xa0\nBUSINESS CASUAL \nJust because the word ""casual"" appears on the invitation doesn’t mean you can turn up in tattered jeans and a polo tee. The “business casual” dress code still requires a certain amount of propriety.\nWhile the dress code is less formal than business, it’s always better to be slightly overdressed than under. Wear a blazer with a pair of khaki pants or tailored trousers and put on a tie for good measure.\nIf the party is less stuffy than you think, you can always remove the tie and/or blazer. Instead of black leather shoes, consider a pair of leather sneakers in a sombre hue.\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, grooming by Lin Hongling, model Benjamin Yu from AVE.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Men ', '     Christmas ']}"

      Your disco needs you: Up the shine factor of your style this party season
  </h1>, 'text': ""The festive season is upon us. And unless you’re got a stylist on speed dial, chances are you are on red alert for quick fixes to get from zero to hero for the party rounds, pronto.\nTake a cue from perennial club kid Hedi Slimane who stands by disco dressing no matter which fashion house he heads up. Say what you will about where he’s taking the house of Celine but the controversial man of the hour is onto something – happy, shiny things make the best party clothes.\n\n\nBut where does one begin amid all that\xa0glitter? Should you go decked out in sequins or go subtle in lame? Is head-to-toe shine way too\xa0gaudy? Or should you keep the sparkles to just those shiny Jimmy Choos? Will\xa0you then need to accessorise further with sparkly baubles? So many questions, so little time.\nCNA Lifestyle dispenses a little help to make\xa0disco dressing work for you.\nYou can take Hedi Slimane out of Saint Laurent but you definitely can't take the club kid out of the French designer. The sequined mini dress is one of Slimane’s tried and tested favourites – it has turned up at every single one of his collections at Saint Laurent and, now, into the elegant archives of Celine.\nAnd if you intend to work the dance floor like J Lo, consider masculine footwear that makes for an unexpected albeit comfortable twist.\nThe beauty of disco dressing stems from its excess. Start with a shiny yet suitably subdued piece, then keep topping up the\xa0shine. Pile a fully sequined jacket over a lame blouse, then compliment the ensemble with a shiny trim down the trousers. Work within a colour family to keep it controlled yet chic.\n\n\nLooking shiny and new has never been easier now that sequins for day is actually a thing. Unlike its outrageous nighttime cousin, these sequins come in a colourless permutation that are\xa0way more subtle. Think of them like a shiny top coat you apply on your nails.\n\n\nPut the black jacket on the back burner for now and reach for that glittery\xa0number. You need to look like you actually have somewhere to go. Exaggerated sparklers work best on cropped jackets, while smaller, understated sparklers are more appropriate on oversized or long options because more is not always more. Even when it comes to disco.\nPhotography by Kelvin\xa0Chia, styling by Damian Huang, hair by Sean Ang, makeup by Melissa Yeo, model Xinxin from Ave. Carousel horse: The Propz Company.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Christmas ', '     new year ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Level-up your basic fashion game by layering smart with style and personality
  </h1>, 'text': ""The fact that\xa0we live on the waistband of the equator doesn’t make layering a bad idea.\xa0Sure, you can pass on the down-filled parka but you can still have a field day indulging your inner stylist.\nGet\xa0creative by mixing up the basics with the not-so basic. CNA Lifestyle shows you how to layer your outfit for a high-fashion sheen.\nDon’t shy away from a cropped top or bustier just because you’re worried about flashing too much skin.\xa0Reach for a simple white tee to use as a base, and then start building your style blocks. Take it up a notch\xa0with a cropped jacket.\nMIXING DETAILS AND TEXTURES\nKeep your layering focused but interesting by pulling juxtaposing influences: Masculine with feminine, prints with solids, pleats with asymmetry. All you really need is that one statement piece to take your look to the next level.\n\n\nSHEER SHIRTS\nSheer shirts are just begging for cover-up – they're too soft, too sheer and too filmsy. You’d do well to give shape and coverage by adding structure to the look. Subscribe to a time honoured designer trick: Make like Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons who consistently turns to a moulded jacket or corset\xa0to pull the look together. And that’s how timeless chic is done.\nTOUGH LINGERIE\nGive your lingerie slip a PG rating simply by slipping something under it. Wear it as you would a jacket. Tough it up for the day with pants underneath like Kendall Jenner. Or take it out for a night about town with sexy knickers a la Bella Hadid.\nLOW-SLUNG PANTS\nHold up, don’t be in a hurry to chuck last season’s low-slung pants. Give it a new lease of life by adding a pair of tights under them. Yank those designer tights up so the cummerbund sticks out for all to see. You did say they were designer, after all.\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, hair and makeup by Lin Hongling, model Bora from Mannequin.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      Louis Vuitton's Virgil Abloh can do no wrong – and that might be his superpower
  </h1>, 'text': 'Just weeks ago, Virgil Abloh was in a DJ’s console spinning his Halloweekend set at the new Circo Loco at Brooklyn’s Navy Yard. It was a hot ticket - only 5,000 tickets available at US$150 (S$207) a pop - that put fans in the same breathing space as Naomi Campbell and Kyle. Abloh tossed in a bonus, as he frequently does: Limited signed records of his Circo Loco club mix of Kanye West’s Lift Yourself.\nFast forward seven days and Virgil Abloh is working hard (as documented on his Instagram account @virgilabloh) on his photo campaign for Louis Vuitton (LV) Men Spring Summer 2019, with photographer Ryan McGinley.\nThe collection, which showed in Paris in this past June, was a rousing success for the designer - if not for the clothes and accessories, then for the triumph of a dream come true for Abloh, who had been vocal about his desire to head a European luxury brand for many years.\nThe photo shoot reflects the essence of his show, which featured a diverse racial mix of models, highlighting the clothes in his impeccable collection, which was a prismatic take on white and refracted rainbow colours. This ad campaign has a feel that is distinctly different from LV Men’s previous styling: Hard white light bouncing off hard white bodies have made way for warm colours, warm lighting and cocoa-skinned models gleaming in cool pistachio blazers and pullovers. The effect is uplifting, wholesome, unexpected.\nThat’s kind of the whole point about Abloh. He is uplifting, wholesome and unexpected. He breaks the stereotype of the Creative Head of a luxury brand, with his Ghanaian heritage, 1.9m frame, authentic humility and smouldering heterosexuality - yes, the guy married his high school sweetheart Shannon and they have two little girls, Lowe and Grey.\nHe did not study at Central St Martin’s or Parsons School of Design; he studied engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and obtained a Masters degree in architecture from the University of Illinois. And oh yes, he’s the first African-American male to take the top creative spot at a European luxury house, and not just any European luxury house but Louis Vuitton, which is, in his words, “the zenith of the zenith” of luxury brands.\nThe show, which Abloh said he conceived of in minutes during a flight, was symbolic in many ways. It opened with a beautifully cut, slouchy, white mohair suit, followed by a series of white outfits - a nod to his success in streetwear via his Milanese brand Off-White – before it exploded into joyous colour: Purples, greens, reds and tie-dye in all kinds of fabric (tie-dyed leather, imagine!).\nExhibiting his social media savviness, he sent Internet celebrities like Playboi Carti, Dev Hynes and Kid Cudi\xa0walking down the catwalk in his LV. The designer made reference to The Wizard Of Oz, explaining in his show programme a veritable dictionary of “new lexicon” such as “accessamorphosis”, for the accessories melded with outfits that he introduced - some that looked like holsters; others like pencil cases. As The Guardian reported: “D was for Dorothy, ‘A farm girl from the Midwest transported to Oz, a fairy tale land where she experiences things beyond her imagination. As an outsider, she soon discovers she was taken to Oz for a reason’.” Ostensibly, Abloh was talking about his own yellow brick road to success.\nFrom the fashion crowd, the reaction was deeply mixed: Some celebrated the fresh, loose silhouettes that have hardly ever seen an LV runway; others pooh-poohed his mixing of plastic chains with LV’s leather bags. However, fashion director for Saks Fifth Avenue, Roopal Patel told Reuters: “He respected the codes and the heritage of Louis Vuitton, which is very important for a house of this nature, but he infused his own sensibility and his own DNA into what we saw.”\nFor fans of his own label Off-White, as well as his celebrity friends in the front row like West, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, Rihanna, artist Takashi Murakami and the 3,000 fashion students he invited - because he’s about inspiring youth too - the Vuitton Men SS 2019 collection was a watershed moment, a success that could not be easily outdone. It can’t just be about the clothes and the accessories anymore; in the same way Abloh has blurred the lines between streetwear and high fashion, the barometer by which a show is critiqued must surely start to transform as well. Yes, crisp tailoring is a good thing, as Abloh’s predecessor Kim Jones demonstrated. But a luxury interpretation of eminently wearable, and more importantly, desirable pieces that consumers are actually looking for - that’s where the money is.\nAs he told GQ, “People, when they say ‘streetwear,’ they miss the central component, which is that it’s real people; it’s clothes that are worn on the street. The street (is) where you get the relevant ideas to real people.”\nCAN’T KEEP A GOOD MAN STILL\nWhile other, more human designers would probably drop everything else to focus on this very important new job, Abloh doesn’t look like he’s about to change anything about his multihyphenate\'s lifestyle. Yes, he has moved his family to Paris, but he has also moved his recording set-up into his LV office so that he can continue recording Televised Radio, his show for Beats 1 Radio on Apple Music.\nHis own label Off-White could not be hotter. Just five years old, it was named “Hottest Fashion Brand in the World” by Lyst, a global fashion search platform that bases its findings on Google search data, social media mentions and actual sales. Searches for “Off-White” in online stores have been increasing 14 per cent every quarter, outstripping popular luxury brands by a mile. This is the power of the “real people” Abloh talks about and talks to.\nHe is the King of Collaboration. In fact, it was his Off-White collaboration with Nike, “Ten Nike Icons by Virgil Abloh”, where he redesigned 10 of Nike’s most classic sneakers (which, of course, flew out the stores and are now being resold at many times their original prices) that propelled him into the fashion stratosphere. The sneakers featured details like his ironic quotation marks (“AIR”) and text printed over the swoosh.\nWhat’s probably most exciting about Abloh is his enthusiasm about collaborations across industries. Most recently, he teamed up with luggage maker Rimowa for a collection called “Personal Belongings”, in which Rimowa pieces come emblazoned with his signature typography, arrows and a yellow Off-White belt and tag.\nHe has also collaborated with Byredo on a fragrance called Elevator Music, done an interior design project with Hirshleifers, tote bags with Mr Porter and a drink with Parisian café Wild & The Moon, and, most recently, Moet & Chandon x Off-White (bottles bearing “Do Not Drop” on the side) and a gradient capsule collection, Off-White x Selfridges. What’s most anticipated must be his collaboration with furniture giant Ikea on a millennial collection of furniture that hits stores next year.\nOne of his longtime collaborators is artist Murakami, whom he met when they both worked for Kanye West’s creative content brand Donda for which Abloh was creative director. Currently, Abloh and Murakami are holding their third exhibition, America Too, at the Gagosian in Beverly Hills. In true Abloh style, only 500 pieces of a special edition America Too T-shirt were printed for sale online at the Gagosian (which had to be picked up in person at the Beverly Hills gallery). Sold out, of course.\nHow did Virgil Abloh get so far, so fast to the zenith, to borrow a term, of fashion? It looks like the perfect storm of right time, right place, right message and right attitude. It could not have been predicted given his backstory: One of two children born to Ghanaian immigrants in 1980 in Chicago, Illinois, Abloh grew up a middle-class kid in the middle of America who listened to his parents and studied engineering; his mother, a seamstress, was the one who taught him about sewing. It was at a Catholic private high school that he met his wife Shannon Sundberg.\nAbloh started DJ-ing when he was 17 and to this day, it’s his happy place. He continues doing it under the moniker Flat White, his Soundcloud account name. “DJ-ing is my only peace of mind. When the phone is off, I play my favourite songs really loud for myself and I’m not talking to anyone, I’m not managing anything; it’s just a time when I can listen to music… I’ll be DJ-ing after I’m done designing or doing anything else,” he told Teen Vogue. Like many teens, he was influenced by skate culture and skater fashion - only with Abloh, these influences would later parlay into luxury streetwear.\n2002 marked the turning point in Abloh’s career, when he met a young black man known as Kanye West. West saw a gift in Abloh and made him creative director of his agency. That was the beginning of their strong friendship, buoyed by a shared creative streak that won them both an internship at Fendi in Rome in 2009.\nIn 2009, Abloh and West went to the fashion shows in Paris and Milan. He recounted to Highsnobiety that response to their presence was less than enthusiastic in those days - not surprising, considering the highly exclusive industry fashion is - or at least, used to be. “We got into about 60 per cent of the shows [in Paris]. We were a generation that was interested in fashion and weren’t supposed to be there. We saw this as our chance to participate and make current culture. In a lot of ways, it felt like we were bringing more excitement than the industry was.”\nIn this light, Abloh being at LV is a really big deal. American football star Victor Cruz, who has African and Puerto Rican roots, told Associated Press that “I’m happy to be alive and be part of this, because this hasn’t happened before in my generation. People now have to pay attention to minorities and the culture that we are shaping for ourselves… Pay attention in a real way, and not just (by) inviting us to their shows. There are more doors opening to us now.""\nAbloh’s first attempt at fashion in 2012 was to buy deadstock Ralph Lauren flannel shirts at US$40 apiece, stencil his design on them and sell them for US$550 each under his first label, Pyrex Vision. Despite the disdain of fashion purists, those shirts were snapped up fast, and have since inspired a fake version called Pyrex Original.\nThat same year, he launched Off-White (official name: Off-White c/o Virgil Abloh), which successfully married street culture with couture, ushered in an age of luxury streetwear and has practically conquered the world. In 2017, Abloh received the British Fashion Awards’ Urban Luxe Award. This year, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\nWORLD DOMINATION, IN A FLASH\nThe moment that catapulted Virgil Abloh into public consciousness beyond the runway was when he designed the Queen collection for Nike with Serena Williams and dressed her up in what has been indelibly printed on the minds of millions around the world: Her one-shouldered tutu (with “LOGO” over the swoosh) on Aug 27 at this year\'s US Open, in defiance of the French Open officials’ objection to her wearing a compression catsuit, also by Nike.\nWhen asked how he does so many things at a time, Abloh admits to needing less sleep than normal people. He also has a way of designing things in a very short time. That definitely helps if you want to conquer the world from every angle.\nHe told GQ, “From my perspective, I’m trying to stand for a generation. You know, each generation has designers who go along with it. I think it’s explicitly the fact that I split my time among many things that gives me the point of view to know (what I’m doing is) relevant.”\n“Relevant” sums it up. Virgil Abloh will no doubt be in our news feeds, Instagram feeds, podcasts, and even traditional newspapers because of his uncanny ability to identify what really matters to whom, when. Who knows what he’ll be up to next - but we can be sure it’ll be just the right thing for the right time, and we will want it badly, because we’ll probably be seeing it debuted by Rihanna and dozens of Abloh’s other celebrity friends.\nHe has done so much in so short a time that next year, the Museum of Contemporary Art in his birthplace Chicago is holding an exhibition titled Figures Of Speech, which focuses on Abloh’s creative process and collaborations in fashion, future and graphic design.\nThe closest Abloh has come to to demystifying his success factor is his comment to GQ: “We’re consumers. We’re raised off of the understanding of what makes things valuable.” That understanding of what consumers want in every industry is his superpower.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Disney, bling and hoodies for dogs – why Jeremy Scott is the 'People's Designer'
  </h1>, 'text': '“Fashion is for everyone,” says H&M’s\xa0creative advisor\xa0Ann-Sofie\xa0Johansson - a belief that kickstarted and now sustains\xa0the Swedish fast fashion giant’s\xa0collaborative conversations with some of the biggest names in the fashion industry.\xa0\nMoschino’s creative director Jeremy Scott echoes Johansson’s sentiment. Known as the ""People’s Designer"", he said: “Nothing makes me happier than seeing my designs worn by the people.”\nThe two powerhouses have put their creative minds together for Moschino [tv] H&M, the 15th designer collaboration by the Swedish fast-fashion\xa0giant.\nWith pieces starting from S$34.95 for women\'s briefs, S$109 for a Disney sweater and S$299 for a leather bag, the gap between high fashion and the masses is practically\xa0non-existent here.\nOver the years, H&M has helped break down the barriers in fashion, merging high fashion with accessibility.\xa0Johansson distilled the success formula\xa0down to\xa0""finding the right time for everyone”.\nPinpointing the right time to work\xa0with a chosen\xa0collaborator\xa0is as important\xa0as seeking out the opportune occasion for\xa0customers to best appreciate the collection.\xa0Added Johansson, ""Fashion right now is all about being loud, positive, individual and fun.""\nIt would have been a stretch for her to\xa0pick\xa0a louder or prouder collaborator. Everything about Moschino is in-your-face, from its boisterous creative director\xa0to his\xa0unrestrained use of the Disney prints he calls cartoon couture\xa0to the trademark\xa0gold\xa0hip hop accoutrements that dangle from\xa0caps, belts, sweaters and purses. There are even outfits for dogs, if you are inclined to match your pooch to your getup.\nAhead of the much talked about Moschino [tv] H&M launch,\xa0CNA Lifestyle caught up with Scott to\xa0talk\xa0collaboration, fierce fashion\xa0and diversity.\nHOW DID MOSCHINO [tv] H&M COME ABOUT?\nI love to collaborate! It’s something that I’ve always loved to do. No matter how strong-willed I am, I also love to collaborate with others to create something new. H&M wanted the real Moschino deal - no compromise, no watering down.\xa0It was so much fun to create.\nWHAT WAS YOUR STARTING POINT FOR THE COLLECTION? \nWhen I was designing Moschino [tv] H&M, I was thinking street, street, street. I wanted an urban attitude, high mixed\xa0with low, while introducing\xa0some bling bling and pop culture, and with a sense of humour. I wanted it all to have punch. I wanted it to be 100 per cent me, 100 per cent Moschino.\nHOW IS THIS COLLABORATION DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES BEFORE? \nI wanted to give the\xa0fans the realest Moschino collection they can get, with all of the Moschino elements that they love and need, without a big price tag. There’s a touch of vintage Moschino given a new twist; then there’s the energy of the street, the Italian glamour, a sense of humour, and then some pure pop culture, too. It’s so Moschino that it feels like an extra capsule collection for the season.\nWHY IS POP CULTURE SUCH A HUGE DEAL FOR YOU?\nWhen I was a kid, MTV was my window to the world. It’s where I saw fashion and music blending. The iconography of MTV is seared into my brain. Disney is the purest of pop culture iconography. I always want some cartoon couture. For me, being able to mix Disney characters with the Moschino logo is taking things to the next level.\nON TOP OF HAVING FUN, INCLUSIVITY IS A BIG THING FOR YOU.\nI’m the People’s Designer, and I believe fashion should be accessible to the people. I’m thrilled to do this collaboration because I want people to have it. I’ve seen the effect when you make fashion not just accessible but also affordable. It makes me so happy when I see my designs being worn by people on the street, and I cannot wait for this collection to reach the fans all around the world.\nDIVERSITY IS THE OTHER BIG THING FOR YOU, ISN\'T IT?\nDiversity has been my world from the very beginning, right from my first collections in the 1990s. For me, fashion has always been about self-expression and the right to be whoever you want to be. I have always pushed for diversity. This isn’t politics, it’s a way of life. It’s amazing to be able to use fashion to spread this message round the world.\nHOW DOES GOLDEN GIRL GIGI HADID, WHO HAS THE WORLD AT HER FEET, FIGURE IN THIS DIVERSITY DIALOGUE?\nGigi is like family to me. I was the first designer to put her on the catwalk. I love her, I adore her. I couldn’t do Moschino [tv] H&M without her.\nEVERY JEREMY SCOTT DESIGN IS INSTANTLY RECOGNISABLE. BY THE SAME TOKEN, THEY ARE NOT THE EASIEST TO WEAR. HOW SHOULD JEREMY SCOTT-VIRGINS APPROACH THE COLLECTION? \nEverything I design is so easy to wear! For me, fashion is about joy and pleasure and expressing who you really are. I always want to elevate what I wear because I’m a freak and I love to have fashion show moments every single day. I want what I’m wearing to say everything about who I am and I want people to know it.\nMoschino [tv] H&M is such an amazing way to try something new, because it’s so approachable and affordable. Have an open heart, an open mind, and try something new.\nWHICH PIECES WILL YOU BE HOARDING? \nThat is the most impossible question because they are all like my babies! I’m in love with them all, from the cropped padded jacket that’s just so much fun, to the Disney pieces because I love Mickey so much, to the black leather dress that’s total Italian glamour. And the fake fur that’s punctured with chains is such a fierce statement.\nWHAT IS THE ONE THING PEOPLE DON’T KNOW ABOUT JEREMY SCOTT? \nThat I interned for Marc Jacobs when I was studying at Pratt. It was amazing that Marc took time to attend my Moschino [tv] H&M show in New York.\nMoschino [tv] H&M will launch at H&M Orchard Building, H&M ION Orchard and online at hm.com, on Nov 8.

      How three Indian jewellers are putting their own spin on traditional designs
  </h1>, 'text': 'Indians have a long and profound relationship with jewellery, one so unique it has spawned an entire universe of its own, boasting diverse style codes and techniques.\nThe first ever diamonds in the world were found in India, and the country’s legendary – and now depleted – Golconda mines produced such icons as the Kohinoor and Hope diamonds.\nThe country’s strong Hindu culture also birthed a style called temple jewellery and introduced a number of superstitious uses for gemstones, while the advent of the Mughals in the 1500s introduced techniques such as Kundan that are still widely used today.\nFar from being considered old-fashioned, these antique styles are finding favour with young Indians today. When leading Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma tied the knot with cricket superstar Virat Kohli late last year, she wore elaborate, ethnic jewellery that featured the art of Kundan and Polki diamonds.\n\n\nIn Singapore, a number of jewellers specialise in modern Indian jewellery: Manjrie, Temptations Jewellery and Jaipore Jewels. This Deepavali, the founders share their festive traditions, their inspirations, and their designs, which can easily be worn with contemporary clothing.\nMANJRIE\nIt is customary for Indian families to spring clean before Deepavali, and it was no different in Manjrie Gupta’s household when she was growing up. As a young child, however, she truly disliked having to clean up, but age has taught her how to appreciate those special moments.\n“Spring cleaning brings in fresh energy and in its own weird way brings family together,” the Indian-born designer told CNA Lifestyle. “I hated it growing up but now it has stayed with me. Also it was my sister’s and my responsibility to light earthen lamps and candles all around the house in the evening. It’s one distinct and very sweet memory of Diwali for me and would love to see that tradition continue in my family.”\nOn Deepavali day itself, Gupta and her family wake up early to decorate the house and exchange last-minute gifts and sweets with their neighbours. As evening dawns, she’ll dress up in elaborate Indian finery for the prayers and a night of heavy feasting, looking resplendent in a traditional Indian skirt paired with a blouse, topped by chand-bali earrings (moon shaped earrings from Mughal times), which she designed herself.\nGupta had studied engineering at the bequest of her parents, but her passion for jewellery proved too potent to ignore. Ten years ago, she left a promising career in computer science engineering at various firms in the US and UK to set up her eponymous brand, embarking on a journey of creating Indian jewellery for the modern woman.\n“I spotted a gap for a brand that mixed traditional Indian elements with a chic aesthetic. Right after graduating, I started working on my own designs. With time, my namesake brand grew into a fine jewellery label with a vision of melding exotic elements of the East and modern silhouettes of the West,” she explained.\nThere are several traditional elements that she proudly uses in her jewels, namely Kundan, Meenakari and Polki diamonds. The influence of the Mughal period is best seen in the Kundan style, where glass pieces are embedded in a 24K gold mould. While coloured stones are often used, sometimes you’ll see uncut diamonds that are called Polki set within the gold.\n\n\nThen there is Meenakari, where the gold is adorned with enamelled colours and motifs that surround the stone. This technique can also be used to colour the underside the jewel. A combination of all three techniques in one piece is called Jadau.\nMore often than not, these techniques are used on very elaborate and opulent necklaces that are often seen on brides, but Gupta has appropriated these styles on smaller pieces that can be worn daily. “The traditional jewellery of India has always been quite heavy, consisting of voluminous gold pieces. However, with changing times, jewellery that’s lighter in weight has gained a lot of popularity among Indian women,” she explained.\nTEMPTATIONS JEWELLERY\nFor Indian-born Nayantara Dhillon, Diwali was a favourite festival of hers growing up. The days leading up to the festival were always full of anticipation of meeting and greeting, gift-exchange, a plethora of Indian delicacies and the opportunity to don colourful traditional clothing.\n“We place diyas all over the house and do traditional rangolis in the house. The day is spent offering prayers in different workspaces and homes.\xa0On Diwali night, we offer special prayers to Lord Ganesha and Lakshmi, the God of new beginnings and prosperity and the Goddess of wealth,” she told CNA Lifestyle.\n“After the prayers and the singing of hymns, a few sparklers and crackers are burst. We leave all ours doors and windows open as it is believed to be a good omen for the Goddess Lakshmi to enter and bless our homes for the coming year,” she added.\nDuring the festive season, Dhillon loves wearing her traditional heirloom jewels that have been passed down from generations. It’s no wonder that Temptations Jewellery – which was founded in Hong Kong 30 years ago and which made its foray into Singapore in 2014 – is inspired by India’s vast heritage.\n“Some of the Indian techniques used in our jewellery are that of Jadau, Kundankari and Meenakari,” she explained. “Our collection of Indian jewellery combines contrasting geometric and asymmetrical patterns and motifs inspired by tribal folk art, and Mughal motifs of flora and fauna.”\nThe tear-drop shape, for instance, is a recurring motif in Indian design, and one that is often found in Temptations’ jewellery. But it is certainly no pastiche of an archaic style, as Dhillon wishes to create wearable pieces that can be worn on a regular basis, and not just for special occasions.\n“Every Jadau and Polki piece we design is in keeping with international sensibilities and can be used not only for traditional but also for fusion and contemporary wear. While our collections are inspired by the modern woman of today, we have tried to retain the soul of Indian traditional art forms,” she explained.\n“For example, a key component of every piece we design is that it should also be comfortable to wear for the entire day and can be complemented in the evening as well, something that was lacking in most other designs that only focused on the ornamental aspects of the piece,” she added. It is an accolade to her success, then, that many of her clients pair Temptations’ jewellery with cocktail dresses and gowns.\nJAIPORE JEWELS\nA pioneer of Indian jewellery in Southeast Asia, Ritu Aurora established Jaipore Jewels in 1989 after moving to Singapore from India.\nShe found a gap in the market here as hardly any jewellers were selling coloured gemstones, and found her niche in melding Indian and western style codes. “While my customers are both Indian and non-Indian, my design work is\xa0often\xa0inspired by the ornate work that can be found in India,” she said.\nDeepavali at the Aurora family is a festive affair, one where they spend as much time as possible with their nearest and dearest. To show their appreciation, the Auroras also distribute hampers comprising nuts, sweets and candles to their close ones, and make it a point to decorate their house in fairy lights and floral arts using Rangoli (a coloured dye) to welcome friends and family.\nThey also visit their extended family for a meal or to exchange gifts during the Deepavali period, dressed in new outfits and traditional Indian jewellery, designed by Aurora herself.\nToday, Aurora keeps the Indian tradition of jewellery-making alive by appropriating traditional forms in modern avatars. She explained, “The designs have been derived and refined from these traditional art forms to evolve into a more modernistic look so as\xa0to broaden the appeal to cosmopolitan women.\xa0I think it is about the format in which the pieces are made today. Polki diamonds, for instance, were often seen in large, impressive necklaces, nose rings and head pieces back in the day, but can now be adopted to more simple and sleek pieces like rings or pendants.”\nAurora says that she was one of the first designers in Singapore to introduce Polki diamonds to this part of the world. She explained, “Polki are a distinctively Hyderabadi style of cutting diamonds that are flat with a larger surface or table and have less depth. The light refracts differently; it is warmer and the result is spectacular. Polki jewellery was loved by the Mughals, and Rajasthani jewellers became experts in combining these diamonds with enamel and coloured stones. The tradition lives on.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Deepavali ', '     jewellery ', '     fashion ', '     Beauty ']}"

      Khaki takes its spot as fashion’s hottest colour 
  </h1>, 'text': 'When Maria Chuiri Grazia put a skinny khaki pant suit down the runway, the fashion set gasped in collective ""oh, why didn’t we think of that""\xa0amazement. Then Oscar de la Renta offered an understated yet undeniably sexy ruffled number, also in khaki. By the time Sportmax rolled out a deconstructed utilitarian dress, it was clear that we were onto something.\nBut perhaps the biggest crusader had to be Riccardo Tisci who reimagined Burberry in 50 shades of the classic trench. With Madonna, Beyonce and Rihanna all sporting\xa0varying shades of khaki, this once neutral hue is on fire, getting the acclaim it deserves.\xa0\n\n\nCNA Lifestyle offers up five ways to make the best of fashion’s brand new all-star fashion player.\nSUPERSIZE ME\nGo big or go home. Just because khaki is a basic colour doesn’t mean you have to subscribe to basic styling solutions. Upsized classics are a godsend for downplaying flaws. Tuck strong biceps under a man-sized jacket. Keep muffin tops under the wraps of oversized sweaters. Hide thick thighs behind roomy culottes.\nCOLOUR PLAY\nNot convinced by head-to-toe dressing? Then strike up a tromp l’oeil conversation with colours. Call the shots\xa0between denim (for that faux ""oh, this old thing?"" insouciance) or neons (for that pop of ""hello, look at me"" shoutout).\nTHE BUSINESS OF CASUALS\nGive stuffy work separates a rest and give street culture a chance. Gathered waists, oversized pockets and fancy footwear are fantastic starting points for flouting office decorum. Take the look up several notches by adding gold accents of statement earrings or signet rings.\nMAXIMUM UTILITY\nThe utilitarian wave is anything but over. Set your look apart from army regulars by turning style tricks with the help of rivet-like buttons, epaulet details and coloured stripes for a bit of flash. Or wear yours softly tailored like\xa0Nicolas Ghesquiere for a high fashion finish.\nBASIC NOT BASIC\nWhy content with basics when you have carte blanche to get creative? Put patchwork, faux fur, exaggerated sleeves (that double as fingerless gloves) together and you got yourself a spiffy front-row worthy getup. Trench coat optional.\n\n\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, hair and makeup by Lin Hongling, model\xa0Nuoya from Mannequin.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      The Men’s Edit: 5 stylish items to raise your style game in November
  </h1>, 'text': ""While menswear isn’t as showstopping as womenswear, who’s to say you can’t make smart choices that will leave a deep impression.

      Six stylish timepieces for the corporate warrior
  </h1>, 'text': 'In watch industry slang, the term “sport-elegance” is used to describe that class of timepieces that are, well, both sporty yet elegant.\nThink robust tickers, some with sporty functions like chronographs, that are versatile enough to be worn with office wear and casual weekend garb.\n\n\nConsidering what busy lives men lead these days – hopping from the workplace to the gym, or client meetings to after-work drinks – it’s no surprise that this class of wrist machines is a popular one.\nHere are six that we think perform double duty the best.\nTUDOR BLACK BAY FIFTY-EIGHT\nWith a vintage look that’s trending at the moment, Tudor’s Black Bay Fifty-Eight is hands down one of this year’s most coveted watches. It’s already sold out at Tudor’s new pop-up store in Tang Plaza. The timepiece gets its old-school cool from a circa-1958 model – hence the name – the Tudor Oyster-Prince Submariner (Ref. 7924).\nWhat’s great for corporate warriors is that the case is now a smidge smaller than the rest of its 41mm Black Bay brethren, with a 39mm diameter. Thickness has also been reduced from 14.75mm to 11.9mm, meaning a snugger fit both on the wrist and under a sleeve.\nThe new movement comes with a 70-hour power reserve. You can leave the watch on your dresser on a Friday evening, pick it up on a Monday morning and it’ll still be running. Not that you’d necessarily want to do that, since it looks great with casual weekend garb as well.\nHUBLOT CLASSIC FUSION BLUE CHRONOGRAPH KING GOLD\nStrong characters are likely to be drawn to Hublot’s Classic Fusion Blue Chronograph King Gold. The combination of the lustrous blue dial and the warm tone of the 18K King Gold (Hublot’s proprietary gold alloy) case makes for a striking presence on the wrist.\nRose or red gold suits virtually all skin tones. Hublot’s King Gold is redder than 5N red gold, thanks to its heightened copper content. And we trust the blue will pick up the colour of your shirt. Because let’s be honest, your wardrobe probably consists largely of shirts in various shades of blue. The matching alligator strap adds a dressy touch.\nMeanwhile the chronograph function, as well as an option for a rubber strap, lend\xa0a casual-sporty vibe, making the watch more versatile than\xa0a three-hand watch on a full-gold case and bracelet.\nPANERAI LUMINOR DUE 3 DAYS AUTOMATIC ACCIAIO – 38MM (PAM00903)\nThere was a time when oversized watches were all the rage, but those days are behind us. Over the last four or five years, tastes have shifted towards more discreet sizes. Even Panerai, which kick-started the oversized trend in the mid-1990s, has had to concede to this paradigm shift.\nThis year, it released its first collection with a diameter of less than 40mm: The Luminor Due 3 Days Automatic Acciaio – 38mm. And its ample girth is not the only thing that’s been shed; its profile too, is now a slim 11.2mm in height. It’s a boon for those with slender wrists, as well as those who want to rock a classic Panerai look with their corporate threads, without feeling out-of-date.\nThe model shown here, PAM903, has a retro look with its ivory dial and blue strap (we told you vintage was trending). It also has a three-day power reserve, handy if you want to swop out your ticker for the weekend but still want it running on Monday.\nAUDEMARS PIGUET ROYAL OAK CHRONOGRAPH 41MM \nCall us old-school, but nothing says Boss quite like a solid (yellow) gold watch dangling off a French-cuffed wrist. And a top contender for the title of ""Boss Watch"" is the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Chronograph 41mm.\nAlthough the timepiece has been around for a while, Audemars Piguet gave the line a cosmetic refresh in 2017 when it turned 20. However, only stainless steel and pink gold models were made available, all with contrasting coloured chronograph sub-dials for better legibility.\nThis year, yellow gold was added to the lineup. Used on the case, integrated bracelet and sub-dials, it sets off the blue dial beautifully. And for OCD types who like to be perfectly coordinated, matching cufflinks are available.\nPATEK PHILIPPE REF. 5740 NAUTILUS PERPETUAL CALENDAR\nAlso on this year\'s\xa0hot release list\xa0is the Patek Philippe Ref. 5740, a.k.a the Nautilus Perpetual Calendar. We say ""hot"" because it combines two Patek Philippe icons – the beloved Nautilus and the brand’s renowned perpetual calendar function.\nAnd what happens when the twain meet? Horological fireworks that comes in the form of the ultra-thin, automatic winding Calibre 240 Q movement housed under the hood. Despite the wealth of information it offers – moon phases, day, date, month, leap year and 24-hour indication – the case is a mere 8.42mm thick.\nThat’s right, it’ll fit discreetly under your sleeve and sit inconspicuously on your wrist. But those in the know will recognise it from afar, and cast admiring glances your way.\nJAEGER-LECOULTRE POLARIS CHRONOGRAPH\nIt might not look it at first, but Jaeger-LeCoultre’s new Polaris Chronograph actually has a connection to the corporate world: The watch evolved from a 1968 model, the Memovox Polaris, which itself grew out of a 1950 archetype, the Memovox.\nThe original Memovox – or the Voice of Memory – had a mechanical alarm function designed to help businessmen remember their meetings. The new Chronograph doesn’t have an alarm. Not that it matters, since you use your smartphone for that purpose anyway.\nWhat it does have is vintage appeal (there’s that word again\xa0– Vintage) and a timeless quality. A stainless steel case (relatively thin – 11.9mm), on a bracelet with a black dial, this will\xa0pair with virtually anything.\n\n\nArt direction by Chern Ling, photography by Aik Chen, styling by Arthur Tan.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     timepieces ', '     Men ', '     fashion ']}"
662,44,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/why-coloured-gemstones-are-so-popular-right-now-1395681,"{'title': <h1 class=""h1 h1--page-title"">
      Why coloured gemstones are so popular right now
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’ve been following the royal weddings this year, you might have noticed that the rocks adorning the royal brides’ ring fingers aren’t your typical white diamonds, red rubies, blue sapphires or green emeralds – the so-called Big Four.\nEarlier this year, Jack Brooksbank proposed to Princess Eugenie with a sunset-coloured Padparadscha sapphire, the rarest of all sapphires. Meghan Markle goes about her daily business with a light-blue aquamarine (a variety of beryl)\xa0ring.\xa0\nAway from the royal universe, the biggest jewellery houses have also been infusing their collections with all manner of rainbow-hued rocks\xa0not of the Big Four variety.\xa0Tiffany & Co. is trumpeting the merits of\xa0pink morganite, lilac kunzite, and purple-blue tanzanite, while Cartier’s Coloratura family of jewels is a treasure trove of mint tourmalines, pink morganites, red rubellites, and others.\nAngela Loh, founder and CEO of jewellery exhibition JeweLuxe, said\xa0that these stones have only gained popularity in Asia some three to five years ago. Jessica Nasr, Director of Marketing and Communications for jewellery house Mouawad Singapore, said\xa0the increase in demand for coloured stones began two years ago.\n\n\nFor the casual buyer, it might be easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of varieties and species of minerals out there, and by the deluge of information (sometimes incorrect) that you can find online.\nTanja Sadow, Dean of the Jewellery Design and Management International School Singapore (JDMIS), explained: “There are about 4,800 minerals, of which only about 100 or so are of gem quality. Some species have many varieties.\xa0For instance, blue, yellow, pink, and orange sapphires and rubies are all varieties of the corundum species.”\nShe added that it does not help either that there are more varieties of minerals than there are colours in the world. Translation: Many of the stones boast similar or even the same colours, and sometimes, only a professional with the right equipment can tell the difference between a red spinel and a red ruby.\nTRUE COLOURS\nWhile coloured gemstones such as tanzanites, rubellites and spinels have been around for decades – even centuries – why are we\xa0only starting to see more of them these days?\nThis interest in “alternative” precious coloured stones can be attributed to various factors, but the\xa0main reason has been the exploding prices of the traditional Big Four gems.\xa0\n\n\nOne of the most expensive coloured gems sold at auction was a 25.59-carat Burmese pigeon blood ruby which sold for US$30 million, or just over US$1 million per carat, at a Sotheby\'s Geneva sale in 2015.\xa0Such prices are usually achieved only by the rarest and most exceptional coloured diamonds.\nTay Kunming, Director of the Far East Gem Group, put it succinctly: “Most gemstones are relatively not as expensive as diamonds, and gemstones do not have a standard price guide like the Rapaport guide for diamonds. So,\xa0men can hide the price of their gift"".\nSadow added: “The price of a nice ruby is astounding nowadays. Some of the traditional stones are really not affordable to most people. That is why [alternative]\xa0gemstones have better prices. We have been training people\xa0for the longest time about what makes a gemstone beautiful, and one of the main factors is colour.\xa0\n""We look at the same four C’s (colour, cut, clarity and carat) used to grade diamonds when grading coloured gemstones.\xa0But unlike\xa0diamonds, where the cut is the most important, we care most about colour for coloured gemstones.”\nThat’s not to say that you can disregard the rest of the C’s, as it’s the sum of all the parts that determines the value of the stone.\nJeweLuxe’s Loh explained: “Some people think the bigger the stone, the better. True, but it must come hand-in-hand with clarity and colour saturation. Some people also think provenance is important, for instance, untreated Burmese pigeon blood rubies. But if this gemstone has intrusions, it would not be of as high a value as an untreated Mozambique high saturation red ruby of superior clarity. It’s all about the gem as a whole, and one attribute does not absolutely determine its value.”\nIS THERE AN UPSIDE POTENTIAL?\nThis begs the question: If prices of traditional Big Four gemstones have increased exponentially, can we start seeing a similar upward trend for coloured gemstones?\xa0And if so, can they be considered investments?\nThe experts we spoke to\xa0warned against such speculative sentiments. Tay Thye Sun, Senior Gemologist at Far East Gem Lab, explained: “The coloured gemstones business can be risky if you do not know how to trade. Knowledge of gemstones is vital.\xa0For instance, how do you differentiate natural from synthetic stones? There is a lack of knowledge, high risk of fraud at each level, and no clear guidelines on\xa0the quality and price guide for different gemstones.\n“Since I got into the trade in 2007, the overall market value of rubies have risen at least 400 per cent for specific qualities, such as vivid red, unheated Burmese rubies [with no visible inclusions, weighing]\xa0one carat and above. Any investment that has so many factors involved is risky. To look at a gemstone, to think about investment first, might not be that wise.”\nFor Sadow, it’s simple. “Jewellery should be appreciated not just for its intrinsic material, but for the design, the joy it gives you, its sentimental value. If you put a loose stone away in the safe, where’s the value and joy unless you can wear it and enjoy it?”\nTRICK OR TREAT\nNavigating the world of coloured stones can seem more challenging than reaching the final level of Candy Crush.\xa0But ultimately, it’s fundamental to recognise the basic trifecta that makes a gemstone “precious”: Beauty, rarity and durability.\nThe first is a matter of taste, and it’s easy enough to develop an eye for beautiful stones by simply visiting as many jewellers as you can to get an idea of the different stones available, and their aesthetic patterns.\nRarity is harder to establish, but questions like “where is this gemstone from”, “how many mines can it be found in”, or “are there many known quantities of this gemstone left” are helpful guides. Of course, a Google search is imperative, too.\n\n\nAs for durability, the\xa0Mohs scale is typically used to determine hardness, but it should not be confused with toughness. For instance, a diamond, the hardest material on the earth, is scratch-resistant but is still susceptible to chips and breaks if not handled properly. Hence, knowing the durability of your gemstone will guide you on how to take care of it.\nAnother aspect of gemstone buying that often confuses consumers is that of treatments: Gemstones are sometimes sold with the prefix “unheated” or “untreated” – does this mean those that are heated and treated should be regarded with suspicion?\nAbsolutely not, said Sadow. “Most gemstones are treated nowadays, it’s a standard practice. It’s like me putting on foundation, mascara and lipstick before leaving my house – it’s still me under the makeup.\xa0The stones that are not treated are often big and stunning, and have a certificate of proof – and it will come with a different price range.”\nWith such an extensive range of coloured gemstones available, we asked the experts which five they believe are worth a second glance.\n1. SPINELS\nSpinels came into the spotlight a few years ago when the 170-carat Black Prince’s Ruby adorning the Imperial State Crown of England was “denounced” as a spinel. Even then, said Sadow, it took a long time for people to really appreciate the stone. But it has many virtues that are worth considering.\xa0“It comes in beautiful colours like red, blue, and purple,"" she said.\nIn terms of value, Sadow said that fine Burmese spinels with vibrant and intense colour that are\xa0under one carat are still very affordable. Prices can range from US$200 (S$276) to US$500 per carat. Prices do go up exponentially with size.\xa0\n""Top reds and pinks typically\xa0easily sell\xa0for US$600 to US$1,200 per carat in the one-to-two carat size, and increase dramatically\xa0over two carats,"" said Sadow.\xa0\n""Top quality spinels (very good colour, clarity and cut), which are two to five carats in size, will easily sell for US$3,000 to US$5,000 per carat. For even rarer stones over five carats, prices have been found in the range of US$8,000 to US$10,000 per carat, but the colour and clarity have to be the best.”\n2. COLOURED SAPPHIRES\nMost people do not know that rubies and sapphires belong to the same species of corundum. While blue sapphires are most common, these stones can also come in a plethora of colours. “Sapphires can come in light green, pink, colour-changing varieties and more. As these sapphires are less marketed, the demand for them is not so high and prices are inexpensive,"" said\xa0Far East Gem Group’s Tay.\nAccording to Simone Ng of Simone Jewels, purple sapphires of ""super top quality"" average around US$2,000 per carat for stones less than one carat in size.\xa0Those between one and two carats average US$2,800 per carat; and those three-to-five-carat stones are US$5,000 per carat. Gems weighing more than five carats fetch around US$8,000 per carat.\xa0\n3. PARAIBA TOURMALINES\nThese blue-green stones have captured the imagination of jewellers for their brilliance and almost swimming pool-like quality of their colour, but are becoming increasingly rare. It’s the only tourmaline in the world that is coloured by copper, which gives it its neon-like hue.\xa0\nSadow explained: “The Paraiba tourmaline was only discovered in the 1980s in the Paraiba mine in Brazil, from where it derives its name. But recently, it was found in Africa too, and after extensive testing, it was discovered to be the exact same material. Even so, the mines are tiny and the stones are becoming very rare.”\xa0\nWhen it comes to prices, Simone Jewels\' Ng explained that the intensity of colour matters more than carat weight, with top quality Paraibas costing between US$10,000 and US$20,000.\xa0\n4. PERIDOTS\nDistinguished by their lime-green hue, peridots were formerly plagued by their distinction as semi-precious stones, but Tay dismissed this nomenclature.\xa0“Did you know that only three or four countries come to mind when talking about gem-quality peridots?"" he said. ""They are\xa0Pakistan, Myanmar, China, and the US (Arizona). Most of these mines are small-scale open pits or open-cast mines, compared to the open-pit mining of diamonds in general.”\xa0\nFor top quality peridots, Ng said that stones under one carat fetch an average of US$500 per carat.\xa0This goes up to US$800 per carat for stones between one and two carats, and US$2,500 for those between three and five carats. Above five carats, the price jumps to US$8,000 per carat.\xa0\n5. COLOURED DIAMONDS\nYou’ve probably read the news about blue and pink diamonds going for stupendous prices at auctions. But Loh believes that there is still “some bandwidth to grow in the next couple\xa0of years”, especially for fancy coloured diamonds that are defined by their high-colour intensity, such as blue, green and pink, she said.\xa0\nFor pink diamonds, Vihari Poddar, Managing Director of Vihari Jewels, explained that assuming the diamonds were of Fancy Pink colour, VS2\xa0clarity and better, and with no fluorescence, the prices can range from US$40,000 to US$90,000 per carat for stones under one carat.\xa0At the top end (that is, stones heavier than five carats), the cost is between US$350,000 and US$400,000 per carat.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     fashion ']}"

      McQueen and Teochew porridge: Inside one of Singapore's glitziest society balls
  </h1>, 'text': ""A year of planning. A budget of S$250,000 – of which, almost S$100,000\xa0went towards the food alone. Over 300 guests. And one Teochew Porridge Bar.\nThese are just some of the figures behind the Singapore Tatler Ball, one of the key highlights of the society calendar every year. Organised by high society magazine Singapore Tatler, it is attended by some of the country's\xa0most influential families and individuals.\xa0The magazine is published by Edipresse Media Singapore.\nAs Corinne Ng, the firm’s Managing Director noted, “The Ball costs us about S$250,000 every year, which is why we’re so tight with the guest list. This is not a charity ball, where you can buy your seat. If you’re here, you have to be somebody who’s doing something for our society.”\nAmong the guests this year were Kwek Leng Beng, Executive Chairman of Hong Leong Group Singapore, and his wife Cecilia Quek; Arthur Tay, Chairman and CEO of the SUTL Group; Haresh Sharma, resident playwright of The Necessary Stage; and Saleemah Ismail, social entrepreneur and activist.\nThis year’s Ball celebrated the publication’s 36th anniversary, and\xa0was held at the Capella Singapore ballroom in Sentosa on Friday evening (Oct 26).\xa0\n“It’s ridiculous, the amount of time and effort spent on this Ball,” Ng told CNA Lifestyle. “We started planning for next year’s Ball the moment tonight ends.\xa0Okay, maybe we’ll give ourselves a three-day break. But then it starts after that!”\nEach year’s Ball has a theme. For 2018, it was Maximalism.\n“When deciding on the theme for each year’s Ball, we try to ensure that it resonates with guests on multiple levels. On one level, it’s quite superficial – inspiring [guests] on the fashion front, making them want to find something spectacular and dress up,” said Ng.\n“On a deeper level, we\xa0try to capture the zeitgeist. Maximalism for us is a response to the overly cautious mood of the world right now,” she added.\nROCKING THE ROCOCO\nAppropriately, the decor was a hat tip to France’s Rococo era (1730 to 1770), a period known for its ornamental, theatrical style.\nNo expense was spared to evoke a maximalist mood. At the entrance to the ballroom, a crystal chandelier lay on its side, as if magically transported from the Palace Of Versailles.\nThe flowers that made up the table centrepieces were carefully chosen to represent blooms that were commonplace during the Rococo: Dusty pink roses, amaranthus, and ivy.\nOn some tables stood Lladro porcelain figurines that the Spanish company specially flew in for the occasion. “They cost upwards of S$100,000,” said Ng. “But they do add [to the atmosphere] and our partners were very committed to pulling off a great event. Lladro did not bat an eyelid when we told them what we required.”\nAll this in an effort to please the 300-odd guests, who are accustomed to the finer – nay, finest – things in life. This is something that Ng was acutely aware of. “We have to try our best to at least meet the mark. It really does challenge us. They enjoy much more than the Ball can maybe offer them.\n“But I think what they ultimately come for is the camaraderie, the fact that we have an insider space, a safe space, where they can let their hair down with like-minded friends.”\nMAXIMALIST STYLE\nCertainly, this was the case for guests like socialite Susanna Kang, who told CNA Lifestyle that “it’s an opportunity to meet up with fabulous friends and [enjoy] the incredible hospitality from Tatler. And the entertainment”.\nKang, like many of the other guests, spared no expense at looking her best. Dressed to the nines in a red stole, red leather Alexander McQueen bustier and black-and-white printed skirt “from a Thai designer”, she also engaged celebrity hairstylist Grego Oh and celebrity makeup artist Dily Wang, spending “two hours, all-in” prepping for the evening.\nAnother showstopper was Carmen Ow, Director of Clydesbuilt Group, who appeared in an ethereal, mint-green, bespoke concoction from Time Taken To Make A\xa0Dress. The local design duo also dressed actress Constance Lau at the Los Angeles premiere of Crazy Rich Asians.\nOn how she interpreted the theme, Ow said, “Maximalism is [all about] more is more, so for this dress, I decided to work on the volume of the shoulders and the train of the skirt. The driver had to help ‘pack’ me into the car and ‘unpack’ me afterwards”.\nFor other guests, however, there wasn’t much interpreting to do. “If you know me, you’ll know that I always dress maximalist,” remarked society maven Peggy Jeffs. “My daughter told me to just go as myself.”\nJeffs stole the show with a bespoke gold sequinned dress from Shanghai Silk House – “they usually make Chinese dresses, but I asked them to make a Western one” – and feathered headgear from Kristine Hakim, an Indonesian milliner based in Singapore.\nThe feathers were burnt to remove excess material until only the central quills remained. These were then affixed onto a hardened lace mount as a metallic one would have been too heavy. “I used a hairband to hold it in place because my hair is short,” said Jeffs, adding that she had to sit with her head tilted for the 45-minute drive to Sentosa.\nFor gentlemen such as Gaurav Kripalani, getting prepped for the evening was a much less elaborate affair. The Artistic Director of the Singapore Repertory Theatre (SRT) spent all of “30 minutes” getting dressed.\xa0Yet, he cut a dashing figure in an off-white Brioni tuxedo that stood out in a sea of black tuxes.\nAfter partying the night away to live music from American cover band Liquid Blue – which, said Ng, “cost an arm and a leg” to fly in – guests welcomed a round of sustenance in the form of the Teochew Porridge Bar, a Singapore Tatler institution that opened at the stroke of midnight.\n“Lots of charity balls in Singapore have a Teochew Porridge Bar at the end of the evening, but Tatler was the one that started it,” explained Ng. “You think Singaporeans would be full at the end of the evening, but no, they can still put away some Teochew muay!”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     Trending ', '     luxury ', '     fashion ']}"

      Singapore is designing and making watches – but Singaporeans aren't buying
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you’re a watch enthusiast, you’ll be familiar with cult, independent marques like Greubel Forsey, MB&F, and Urwerk. But if you\'re truly in the know, you\'d have heard of\xa0a new crop of independent brands that have emerged in the last couple of years. They’re collectively – and somewhat affectionately – known as “micro-brands”.\nMany of them got off the ground as successfully funded Kickstarter projects, and typically produce less than 500 watches a year. And – this might come as a surprise – a fair few of them were started by Singaporeans.\nKICKSTARTER PROJECTS MADE GOOD\n“At last count, there were about 40 (Singapore micro-brands),” Sugiharto Kusumadi told CNA Lifestyle. So much so that the Managing Director of Red Army Watches was spurred to launch a new concept store, Watch Wonderland, in Suntec City last year – with a section dedicated exclusively to micro-brands, both Singapore-based and otherwise.\nAmong the store’s portfolio of Singapore micro-brands are names like Arcturus, BOLDR, Gruppo Gamma, Orodeus, Reverie and Vilhelm.\n“Micro-brands are really something that people are looking at. And not just consumers, but the big brands, too. Swiss brands are starting to adopt a similar approach using Kickstarter. Alpina used the platform for a smartwatch launch (in early 2018),” said Kusumadi.\nIt has been challenging. I always tell my friends, if you’re in it for the money, you’re in the wrong trade.\nA quick check on Kickstarter revealed that there are 84 ongoing projects related to “mechanical watches” and 1,344\xa0projects concerning “watches”. On Facebook, there are 16 micro-brand interest groups, with the biggest and most active, Micro-brand Watches, counting more than 16,000 members in its fold.\nOn how he cottoned on to the surging interest in micro-brands, Kusumadi said he actively monitors social media forums, and\xa0picks\xa0the brands that showed the most promise\xa0based on a few factors.\n“If they have achieved some sort of success on Kickstarter, that’s a good gauge. Some (brand owners)\xa0are more active (on social media), telling stories about their product. And people respond. That’s a good gauge,” said Kusumadi.\n\n\nEarlier this month, watch subscription club TenTwo launched a\xa0tier consisting exclusively of Singapore micro-brands, kicking off with Arcturus, BOLDR, Reverie and Vilhelm.\n“The reason we started TenTwo was to promote a diverse selection of watches to people, without focusing on one specific brand name, to open up the world of horology to potential members,” TenTwo co-founder Dan Kruimel told CNA Lifestyle.\nThe biggest challenge was the stigma that Singaporeans have with regards to local brands – that they are of inferior quality to foreign brands. That is simply untrue.\nExtending this philosophy to\xa0Singapore micro-brands, he said, opens up a completely different world that many may not even be aware of. ""I myself wasn’t aware\xa0of these micro-brands, (which were started by)\xa0passionate individuals, who were designing and making their own watches, and just following a dream.”\nDREAMS DON\'T COME EASY\nOne of the earliest dreamers was Azimuth, which was started by Christopher Long and Alvin Lye in 2003 – well before crowdfunding was even invented. Today, the brand is well established in the niche watch-collecting community, and has maintained steady growth over the years.\n\n\n“We’re focused on unique designs. Our watches are objects of fantasy. We sell about 1,000 watches a year,” Long told CNA Lifestyle. “China and Hong Kong remain the most important markets. Singapore is an important market. The US is also relevant.”\nBut it hasn’t always been plain sailing. “It has been challenging. I always tell my friends, if you’re in it for the money, you’re in the wrong trade,” said Long. “On the surface, it looks luxurious and glamorous. If you’re on the commercial side, you could make some money. But if you’re on the artisanal side, you’re going to suffer.”\nThe micro-brands that CNA Lifestyle spoke to – Arcturus, BOLDR, Reverie and Vilhelm – have all faced their own uphill battles.\n“The biggest challenge was finding a manufacturing partner that could deliver quality products on schedule,” said Reverie founder Samuel Tay. “Competition in the micro-brand space is also intensifying with new brands popping up and the more established micro-brands improving their product quality. Quality components are also increasingly more expensive and difficult to source for.”\nA more pressing concern that many micro-brands face, however, is the brand perception.\n“The biggest challenge was the stigma that Singaporeans have with regards to local brands – that they are of inferior quality to foreign brands,” shared Arcturus founder Alexander Ian Loh. “That is simply untrue. A foreign brand could possibly use the same manufacturers as the ones that local brands use as well. There would then be no distinction in quality.”\nTravis Tan, co-founder of BOLDR, echoed this sentiment. “The Asian market is generally more brand conscious,” he said. “We are hoping to gain a foothold in the Asian market, which is supposedly our home ground.” BOLDR is stocked in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong, but the US remains its biggest market.\nBe creative, do something different.\nThings are a bit different for Vilhelm, whose main customer base is local. Singapore buyers constitute 30\xa0to 40 per cent of sales, shared co-founder Nop Srinara.\nBut even with that elusive local support, there remains another set of hurdles. “The most challenging issue we face is\xa0convincing people to pay more for our watches,"" he explained. ""They have a perception that if it’s a micro-brand, it should be cheap.”\nVilhelm pieces cost around US$800 (S$1,100) to US$1,200, compared to an average of US$500 for many micro-brand watches.\n“Our watches aren’t necessarily the cheapest due to the complexity (of case construction),\xa0the materials used,\xa0the Swiss movement costs, and the customised mounds to make the watches that we design from scratch.”\nVilhelm’s other co-founder is Elshan Tang. Tang also co-founded Ventus, as well as his own label Zelos on Kickstarter in 2014. Back then, his initial goal of US$30,000 was reached within two or three days, with the final tally hitting US$90,000.\n\n\nAlthough Tang was one of the pioneers of the current crop of micro-brand owners, Red Army’s Kusumadi feels that Zelos can no longer be classified as a micro-brand. With an annual production of 5,000 timepieces, it’s easy to see why Kusumadi would come to that conclusion.\nYet, even for a brand as successful as Zelos – Tang told CNA Lifestyle that his sell-through rate is “99 per cent”, with the balance “kept as spares for repairs” – Singapore customers only constitute “five to 10 per cent” of business. The bulk of his watches – some 50 to 60 per cent – is sold to enthusiasts in the US.\nAsked why the brand has performed so well, Tang replied: “I try to offer the most value for money, like Valjoux\xa07750 (chronograph)\xa0movements, meteorite dials”.\nFeatures like Valjoux 7750 movements and meteorite dials are typically found on high-end Swiss makes. Certain models from Hublot, IWC, Panerai, TAG Heuer and Tudor are fitted with the 7750. Meteorite dials are found on watches from Corum to\xa0Jaeger-LeCoultre, Rolex and Zenith.\xa0Tangs watches are priced between US$269 and US$2,099.\n\n\nHis advice for those thinking of, well, kickstarting their own watch projects? “Be creative, do something different.”\xa0That said, meet the makers that have passed muster with both TenTwo and Red Army Watches.\nARCTURUS\nFounder: Alexander Ian Loh, 26\nLaunched: 2017\nWhat’s unique: Loh often incorporates elements of Singapore in his designs. “I do my best to draw inspiration from the things around me,” he said. “For example, a section of the Helix Bridge is laser engraved across the movement rotor in the LC-1. My upcoming diver model draws inspiration from the Republic of Singapore Navy’s ships.”\nTarget demographic: “The kind that’s willing to try bold and unabashed designs.”\nLoh, a trainee lawyer sitting for the Singapore Bar, was a former technician in National Service (NS). It was there that he developed a fascination for weaponry and the transmission of mechanical energy.\nThat led to a curiosity about mechanical watches, and he began purchasing Seiko timepieces to modify, using parts sourced on eBay. “Designing my own watch was a natural progression from there,” he said.\nHis launch on Kickstarter attracted pledges amounting to S$20,000 “within a couple of minutes”, and he reached his S$40,000 goal within an hour. The 200 pieces he produced sold out, with 40 per cent of his buyers coming from Singapore. The rest came from the UK, US, Switzerland, Japan, France and Germany.\nLoh hopes to double his production during his next launch, and has begun using 3D printers to toy with ideas. “I plan on creating super funky pieces that usually have\xa0a five-to-six figure price tag, at a lower price point,” he explained.\nBOLDR\nFounders: Travis Tan, 33; Leon Leong, 33; Isa Ghani, 29\nLaunched: 2016\nWhat’s unique: Beyond watches, this micro-brand aspires to be a lifestyle company, with a product lineup that includes small leather goods and an upcoming line of bags.\nTarget demographic: “We’re targeting 17\xa0to 35-year-olds who share a spirit of adventure and exploration.”\nTan, Leong and Ghani started the company with the idea to create products they could use themselves. They first thought of watches as “time is the most important resource in our lives”.\nIt helped that Tan’s mentor was a watch manufacturing professional, who had more than 30 years of experience under his belt, which gave BOLDR a head start in producing quality watches. The pieces are made in China but use Swiss-made movements, both of the automatic and quartz variety.\nDeclining to reveal the company’s annual production, Tan said that the bulk of orders come from the US and Europe, with “80 to 90 per cent” of trade done online. “The next big challenge for BOLDR is to scale up\xa0and build a brand. Out\xa0of the micro-brand niche and into the mainstream market,” Tan explained.\nREVERIE\nFounder: Samuel Tay, 27\nLaunched: 2014\nWhat’s unique: “Reverie is known for elegantly proportioned watches which come with our signature guilloche dials,” explained Tay. “The textured nature of our dials add visual depth to the watch and leads to incredible light play. Put on one of our watches under daylight and you\'ll see what I mean when you flick your wrist!”\nTarget demographic: “Those who want a more classic and elegantly proportioned timepiece with interesting dial textures and subtle design flourishes.”\nA fan of cars and watches, Tay grew up wanting to start his own business. But, as he quipped, he couldn’t afford to start a car company, so he started a watch company instead. “I also started with the intention of creating watches I would be proud to wear myself.”\nReverie produces between 300 and 500 timepieces a year in China, and uses Japanese movements from Seiko or Miyota. Tay shared that he is considering using Swiss movements in his next collection, although that depends on availability and cost.\nNinety per cent of his business comes from online sales, with the bulk of orders going to the US. “As the US market accounts for the majority of our sales, we intend to double down on this area. Another area of interest is the Nordic countries, where we have seen surprisingly robust demand for our watches.”\nVILHELM\nFounders: Elshan Tang, 30; Nop Srinara, 35\nLaunched: 2015\nWhat’s unique: “The concept and vision I had when I started my watch brand was to design intricate case designs that showcased luxury watch detailing,” said Srinara.\nTarget demographic: “Those who own high-end luxury watches themselves, and hence, can appreciate the attention to detail I\'ve taken to the overall watch dial and case design.”\xa0\nSrinara was introduced to luxury watches by his colleagues in the IT industry, and he fell in love with the technical ingenuity and use of exotic materials perpetuated by brands like Audemars Piguet, Hublot and Richard Mille.\nIn his own watches, he strives for a high-end look and feel through features like forged carbon mid-cases, a combination of brushed and polished finishes on ceramic bezels, the use of high-grade stabilised bronze, and the use of multiple materials to build the watch cases.\nVilhelm’s annual production is around 300 to 500 watches, all of which are equipped with Swiss movements such as the ETA 2824 and Sellita SW200. Besides Singapore, the micro-brand’s fans reside in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Europe and North America.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Men ', '     Watches ', '     timepieces ']}"

      The 'Donald Trump of fashion': Why fans of Celine are so mad at Hedi Slimane's work
  </h1>, 'text': 'When LVMH announced in January this year that Hedi Slimane would succeed Phoebe Philo as creative director of Celine, there was immediate trepidation among the women who have\xa0loved Philo’s sleek, stealth wealth collections for a decade.\nBut it wasn\'t enough preparation to brace\xa0fans for what the new artistic and image director\xa0showed at his inaugural collection in September\xa0– which, by the way, has been “renamed” Celine by ditching the accent (it wasn\'t the first time he had changed the name of his employer, having shortened Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) to Saint Laurent when he was at its helm).\nBut that’s not all he ditched at\xa0Celine.\nSlimane had sent down the runway a collection that looked, well, exactly like Saint Laurent\'s, which he left in 2016. Of course, he is not the only designer\xa0guilty of major aesthetic\xa0shake-ups. His\xa0YSL predecessor Tom Ford had done it in 1999, much to the displeasure of founder Yves Saint Laurent himself.\xa0But it was a move that succeeded in bringing YSL into the mainstream – and money into the bank for the brand.\nWhile a predominantly black, rock-n-roll vision of a teenager isn\'t too far off the\xa0Saint Laurent mark, it was a different situation with Celine. For some, it is tantamount to sacrilege to replace Philo’s entire aesthetic with a much younger, much showier, much less-subtle collection without\xa0keeping a single element of her work.\nSlimane hasn\'t just scratched Philo\'s name off the wall\xa0– he\'s painted his portrait over it.\nMISOGYNY AND THE \'DONALD TRUMP OF FASHION\'\nOver her 10 years at Céline (accent intact), Philo had built up an army of followers who identified with her sartorial philosophy that reflected the lifestyle, personality and even conflict that a woman regularly experiences in real life.\nHer shapeless, crumpled dresses reflected the relaxed holidays she longed for. Her crisp, linen pants were sensible but maximally luxurious because\xa0working women want to feel and look good.\xa0Her bags were expandable –\xa0they could be tucked under the arm, and still hold a truckload of baby toys and a blanket. Her shoes?\xa0Why, she singlehandedly made white, rubber-soled slip-ons the must-wear/must-copy shoe. Céline fans felt understood and catered for.\nModel Stella Tennant said this to The New York Times when Philo\xa0departed the label:\xa0“There’s something a female designer does differently from a male designer… She knows how women want to dress.""\nBut now, Philo is gone. And in her place is the man who first rocked the world (and restored Karl Lagerfeld’s mojo) with very skinny suits for very young men.\nThe reaction to Slimane’s Spring-Summer 2019 for Celine was visceral. Cries of misogyny rang out.\nRobin Givhan of The Washington Post said, “Slimane doesn’t seem particularly interested in addressing the mundane issues in a woman’s life. His fashion is not here to solve your problems. Save your problems for your therapist. His designs are about his vision. They are not welcoming.”\nTIME magazine’s Cady Lang was not happy: “I am taking a break from my outrage at the racist/sexist men of the Kavanaugh Hearing to indulge in some outrage over Hedi Slimane’s entirely predictable, heinous Celine debut (Saint Laurent 2.0 on primarily emaciated white models). F***\xa0power-hungry white men.”\nHollywood Reporter simply asked, “Is Hedi Slimane the Donald Trump of fashion?""\nFans of Philo-era Céline took to social media to express their dismay at what they saw as a brutal male takeover of the most intelligent and relevant women’s luxury brand there ever was.\nNot only that, but in true Slimane fashion, stick-thin, barely legal, white models need only\xa0apply, it seemed. That he expects women to fit into his signature skinny pantsuit a la Le Smoking –\xa0now unisex! – is a statement in itself.\xa0\nSAME SLIMANE, DIFFERENT DAY?\nSingapore-born, New York-based fashion photographer Wah has been following Slimane’s career, initially with enthusiasm when he first helmed Dior Homme, and with increasing horror at every turn since.\n“After 2005, Hedi Slimane began to express his obsession with youth and it seems to me from that point, the models got thinner and thinner, and younger and younger,” said Wah.\xa0When\xa0Slimane\'s aesthetic started to be heavily influenced by the rock music scene, which relied heavily on thrift store aesthetics, the innovation stopped, he noted.\xa0\nWe don’t enter a fashion house to imitate our predecessor, much less to take over the essence of their work, their codes and elements of language. The goal is not to go the opposite way of their work either. It would be a misinterpretation.\nWhen Wah\xa0heard of Slimane\'s new appointment,\xa0his\xa0first reaction was ""despair”.\xa0\n""I was momentarily hopeful that he might surprise everyone –\xa0because it seemed ludicrous that he would repeat himself.\xa0But in the end, that was exactly what he did.""\n""The difference this time is that he is referencing himself at Saint Laurent. He was exploring something new with womenswear when he started there. Now, at Celine, it seems as if he doesn’t really have much more to say that he didn’t say then.”\n\n\nSlimane\'s self-concocted hype could have also brought on the disappointment, said XY, a luxury fashion insider in Singapore, who declined to be named for this story. Slimane\xa0had re-booted the brand\'s Instagram, re-designed the logo, and teased followers with monochrome images from his Celine campaigns.\xa0\xa0\xa0\n""After creating so much hype before his collection showed, he can\'t fault anyone for having high expectations of his inaugural show for Celine,"" said XY. ""But the collection was a disappointment to me.\xa0His womenswear is the same as what he brought to Saint Laurent; his menswear is a re-enactment of Saint Laurent hybridised with Dior Homme.”\nGiven the palpable despair, it was\xa0inevitable that someone would start a social media account as a tribute to Philo.\nI can’t imagine the formula succeeding... Especially without the heft of a historic brand like Yves Saint Laurent behind it all.\nCanadian fashion lover Gabrielle Bouchinha launched her Instagram account @oldceline on Sep\xa02.\xa0In a month and a half, it has\xa0attracted 97,000 followers, including highly influential personalities like Virgil Abloh, creative director of Louis Vuitton Men;\xa0lauded street fashion photographer Tommy Ton;\xa0and Man Repeller founder Leandra Medine.\nThe account features photos from the #oldceline community of their favourite Philo-era looks and items.\nIt\'s a lovely sentiment. But after all is said and done, Philo\'s not coming back. Slimane is here to stay (at least for now), so what will happen next?\nALL ABOUT THE MONEY?\nThe rumour was that Philo was unwilling to expand the Céline brand to include a men’s line, haute couture and perfume.\xa0“With that in mind, it becomes clear that\xa0as Slimane was available, they now had the opportunity to compete with the success Slimane himself built at Saint Laurent for Kering,"" said Wah.\nXY agreed: “From a business point of view, Slimane could possibly turn Celine into another Saint Laurent, which he had built into a juggernaut with double-digit, year-on-year growth.\xa0Saint Laurent is now the second biggest brand under the Kering luxury portfolio, accounting for 14 per cent of its sales.”\nWhat could fight the giant Saint Laurent better than another Saint Laurent, especially now that the “real thing” has resurfaced, albeit with another brand name slapped on that must-have bag?\nAnd if it is merely some sort of gambit to swing the luxury consumer’s dollar from Saint Laurent to Celine, with zero regard for what the brand is intrinsically about,\xa0it leaves one to wonder: How long can this go on?\n“I can’t imagine the formula succeeding,” said\xa0Wah. “The word is that while his tenure at Saint Laurent was generationally new enough to perform well, six years on, Slimane’s look might not have the same impact in the stores, especially without the heft of a historic brand like Yves Saint Laurent behind it all.\n""Celine’s significance comes only from the newly erased work of Philo, which Slimane is ignoring and restarting with an empty slate. So, the question then is, will his vision stand on its own merit without the backing of a storied brand?”\nHe should have his own brand already.\xa0It may allow him to take things to the next level without having to be concerned about an existing history.\nBefore his show on Sep 28, Slimane gave a rare interview to Le Figaro, in which he foreshadowed and defended the change he was about to bring.\n“We don’t enter a fashion house to imitate our predecessor, much less to take over the essence of their work, their codes and elements of language. The goal is not to go the opposite way of their work either. It would be a misinterpretation.""\n""Respect means preserving the integrity of each individual, recognising the things that belong to another person with honesty and discernment. It also means starting a new chapter. We arrive then with our own stories, our own culture, a personal semantic that is different from the ones of houses in which we create. We have to be ourselves, without any stance, against all odds.”\nSlimane could take his own suggestion\xa0by being himself. Surely the time is ripe for Slimane to go the way of Tom Ford and launch his eponymous line, one that’s all his, and not an unholy possession of an existing brand.\xa0\n“What I’d like to see is Slimane doing his own brand, instead of imposing the same aesthetic upon whichever brand he helms,” said\xa0XY. “I would also really like to see him return to photography.”\nWah agreed:\xa0“He should have his own brand already.\xa0It may allow him to take things to the next level without having to be concerned about an existing history.”\nPerhaps if Slimane does succeed in spinning Celine into a Saint Laurent – and the Generation Zers aren’t sick of him in six months\xa0–\xa0he might just have enough bargaining power to get his bosses to let him start his own thing.\nUntil then, we’ll just have to content ourselves with gazing at @oldceline.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      How to wear the winter floral trend without looking like grandma's bed sheets
  </h1>, 'text': 'Do you cringe at the mere mention of the word ""floral""? Well, there’s a lot more to the floral print trend this Fall / Winter 2018 season than the musky vintage options you have in mind.\nThis once-Granny-esque trend has been given a much-needed reboot by designers. Miuccia Prada boasted the art of digital-style prints while Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri turned to skilful artisans to fashion achingly beautiful flower appliques out of fabrics and colourful threads.\nMeanwhile, Vetement’s resident bad boy Demna Gvasalia took it upon himself to offer a grunge throwback that offered a good measure of insouciance and street cred.\nFlorals are now youthful and fresh. Do yourself a favour and update your wardrobe with the best of what the trend has to offer, stat.\nGARDEN VARIETY\nFloral prints don’t exist in just repeat patterns. An oversized flower on the waist or the hemline draws immediate attention as any impactful motif on a vast canvas would. Or mix it up with varying floral sizes for an unmistakable touch of bohemia.\nDRESS FOR SUCCESS\nSex sells. Take it from Tom Ford, the man who created a fashion empire out of this simple concept. Flash a little skin, if you\'re up for it. There\'s nothing dowdy about a\xa0flirty mini-dress.\n\n\nGO GRUNGE\nThis is one trend that requires a study in clever juxtapositions (aka some styling know-how). The fail-proof method is to mix a floral piece with sporting elements. Dad sneakers optional.\nBUDDING STYLE\nAh, the art of floral-esque embroidery. Floral appliques on gauzy chiffon and tulles speak\xa0volumes on delicate and immaculate handiwork. This artistic method of beautifying garments never goes out of style.\nDesigners are pushing the envelope by way of off-the-cuff layering or the draping of transparent fabrics over floral-printed outfits.

      It's not just diamonds – did you know your gold could be irresponsibly sourced?
  </h1>, 'text': 'So you’ve ditched plastic straws\xa0and you\'re\xa0thinking of switching to an electric car. You spend your weekends at\xa0farmers\' markets\xa0(toting your own reusable bag, of course), clothe yourself in fair trade fashion, and slather yourself in organic beauty products. You’re staying\xa0woke. Good on you.\nBut did you know your jewellery could be irresponsibly sourced?\n\n\nIf you were on the market for an engagement ring or a dress watch, and wanted to know where the raw materials came from, you’d likely encounter a few dead ends.\xa0\nWhile it’s possible to find jewellers and watchmakers that use ethical diamonds in their designs, the same cannot be said of the gold used to set the stones or shape the watchcases.\xa0\nThat’s because much of the gold mining industry is largely unregulated. Across the world, miners are often subject to poor and unsafe working conditions. You’ve probably read (right here on Channel NewsAsia) about cave-ins or miners being trapped underground for days before being rescued.\xa0\nAnd then there’s the issue of environmental degradation resulting from bad practices. In small-scale gold mining, mercury is used to separate the gold from the ore. In many cases, mercury waste ends up in rivers and lakes, poisoning the ecosystem.\xa0\nThankfully, some companies at the top end of the gold supply chain are taking the first steps towards positive change.\xa0\nChopard is one such firm. In 2013, the family-owned company announced that it would transition to Fairmined gold, a sustainably-sourced gold certified by South African mining NGO the Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM).\xa0\nFive years later, in July 2018, the Swiss jeweller-watchmaker declared that 100 per cent of the gold used in its production was now ethical. This meant all of its gold was sourced from one of two traceable routes.\nThe first is from small-scale mines certified by the Swiss Better Gold Association (SBGA), Fairmined and/or Fairtrade schemes. The second is from the Responsible Jewellery Council’s (RJC) Chain of Custody certification.\nA STRONG STATEMENT\nConsidering that Chopard uses about four tonnes of gold annually – no small sum by any measure – this move is a bold commitment to sustainability and a strong statement to the jewellery and watchmaking industry, and the consumers.\n“There are\xa0different stages of ethical gold,” Chopard’s co-president and artistic director Caroline Scheufele told CNA Lifestyle, at a recent media luncheon in Singapore.\n“For example there’s Fairmined, which goes (right to the source).\xa0Here we work with mines that have carried out due diligence. The mines are (structurally sound). The miners have a fixed salary so they can organise their lives, their families, and send their kids to school. They still use mercury because it’s the way they mine, but it’s not dumped into the rivers anymore.”\xa0\nSaid Scheufele:\xa0“To me, the ultimate luxury is knowing that a product you’ve fallen in love with – whether it’s a diamond ring or a watch – has been produced in a beautiful way, not just because it’s beautiful to look at or has value because of the diamonds and gold. There’s transparency. You know that there were no kids (working) in the mines. You don’t want to wear something beautiful knowing that a kid was working.”\nTo give customers the assurance, each piece of jewellery or watch made from Fairmined gold comes with a certificate, which states which one of the five accredited mines in Columbia, Peru and Bolivia the gold came from.\xa0\nFairmined gold typically costs five to 10 per cent more than standard gold, but Chopard made a commitment to absorb the additional cost from Day 1. “The consumer is not paying more. This is our… marketing expense. We will always support that,” said Scheufele.\xa0\nTHE JOURNEY’S JUST BEGUN\nScheufele’s quest began several years ago over a cup of coffee with Eco-Age director Livia Firth, wife of Colin Firth,\xa0just after he had won the Oscar for The King’s Speech.\nThe eco-evangelist had posed Scheufele a question. “Where does your gold come from?” It stumped her.\nFrom that point, Scheufele – who runs the business with her brother Karl-Friedrich\xa0– resolved to find a definitive answer. Knowing that she had a long road ahead of her, she termed her quest “The Journey To Sustainable Luxury”. The first fruits of her\xa0journey were revealed\xa0at the Cannes Film Festival (of which Chopard is a key sponsor) in 2013 – the same year that the alliance with ARM was struck. \xa0\nThere, Scheufele unveiled the Green Carpet Collection, a new range of high jewellery made only from materials that could be traced to their origins and assessed by the ethical and social benchmarking standards of the Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) Brandmark.\xa0\nThe GCC is an initiative spearheaded by Firth. French actress Marion Cotillard was the first celebrity to don these jewels – and fly the flag of sustainable luxury. Heavy hitters like Cate Blanchett, Charlize Theron and Julianne Moore followed shortly after.\xa0\nIn the years since, Chopard released its first watch made from Fairmined gold (the L.U.C Tourbillon QF Fairmined); tied up with a Swiss gold refinery company to establish a commercial export route for Fairmined gold; and began working Gemfields, a UK supplier of responsibly-sourced coloured gemstones.\xa0\nAt Milan Fashion Week in September, Scheufele took part in the second edition of the Green Carpet Awards by designing the Award statuette. The statuette was made from ethical gold, and presented to 13 winners at the ceremony.\xa0\n“Sustainability is something we all have to look at today,” Scheufele said. “And I think the luxury industry should be the first ones to make examples.”\xa0\nAs for how she feels now that 100 per cent of the company’s gold is certified ethical, Scheufele said: “I sleep a bit better! But it’s not over. There’s still a lot to be done in other areas. There’s all the coloured stones.""\n""It’s going to take a couple more years,"" she said. ""It’s a big field.”\xa0\nLooks like Scheufele has her work cut out for her.\n', 'related_topics': ['     jewellery ', '     timepieces ', '     fashion ']}"

      Why a navy blazer is your best investment for looking your best every single time
  </h1>, 'text': ""We know what you’re thinking: Does a navy blazer even\xa0have a place in Singapore's hot and humid weather?\xa0But don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.\nThe navy blazer is the hardest-working piece of clothing for a man, and this is one functional piece that can take you from boardroom to cocktail. (Also, the blazer comes off when you find yourself without air-conditioning.)\nJust like your suit jacket, the navy blazer should fit you right, from the shoulders to the length of the sleeves, size of lapel and placement of buttons.\xa0Once you've got the basics sorted, the unassuming, non-threatening navy blazer will serve you well, whatever the occasion. Call it an investment piece, if you will.\nHere are five ways you can rock one single navy blazer. You’re welcome.\nSLEEK AND ELEGANT\nOne of the most versatile colours in a man’s wardrobe, navy can be dressed up or down. Instead of a crisp white shirt, why not wear your navy blazer with a navy shirt and a pair of indigo trousers? The look is sharp and less predictable. Plus it’ll set you apart from the rest of the executives in the business district.\nTIP: Break up the monotony of a full navy outfit with a pair of brown or tan penny loafers. Add a pocket square for a touch of elegance.\nBOLD AND HANDSOME\nIf you consider yourself somewhat a risk-taker when it comes to your personal style, consider layering the navy blazer with a button-down checked shirt and a pair of chinos. The ensemble is still professional enough to meet clients without coming across as too casual. This look can also take you from work to a recital at the Esplanade.\nTIP: Cuff up your trousers and go sockless, whether you’re wearing it with a pair of white sneakers or brown laced-ups. As a rule of thumb, the slimmer the pants, the smaller the fold should be. A\xa0casual roll or cuff works especially well with chinos.\nCOOL NAUTICAL\nCan you really wear a blazer with tailored shorts? Absolutely. When the dress code is casual, there is room for you to take risks. Also perfect for when the wedding is outdoors on a weekend afternoon.\nTIP: Make sure the length of the shorts is proportionate to your body. Tall and lanky get away with baggy and slim cuts. Stout and short will do well with a loose cut that ends above the knees.\n\n\nUPDATED PREPPY \nDressing up for work need not be stuffy. Consider wearing the navy blazer with a button-down shirt, a pullover and pair of blue pants. The look is preppy yet sharp so you can waltz into the office without looking like you’re trying too hard.\nTIP:\xa0If your office isn't corporate in italics, pump up your outfit with a pair of designer sneakers or driving shoes in a bold colour. It is sure to liven up your ensemble instantly.\nTRUE COLOURS \nWearing your navy blazer with a long-sleeved tee in a bright hue is less formal than your stuffy collared shirt and more stylish than a polo tee.\nIt’s casual yet dressy enough to hit the sartorial sweet spot.\nTIP:\xa0Make sure your top is of a lightweight material. You don't want to add bulk to the look.\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, grooming by Lin Hongling, model Masato from Mannequin. \n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Master the art of the scarf print with minimal effort for maximum impact 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Say ""scarves"" and the mind autopilots to images of yellowing photographs of Jackie O and Audrey Hepburn winding down the Riviera with scarves in their hair. That was how women used to wear scarves.\nFast-forward to now, mighty style protagonists like Richard Quinn, Donatella Versace and Marine Serre are throwing their weight behind a new way to incorporate the scarf in non-Riviera\xa0dressing: The scarf print.\nQuinn, the biggest proponent of the scarf print, combined his penchant for chintzy wallpaper prints with the Queen’s love of scarves to take the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design earlier this year.\n\n\nDonatella went all out with clashing prints in unmistakable Versace style that\xa0would have done big brother Gianni proud. And breakout star Serre took upcycling into her own hands and rendered a trippy, futuristic spin on the once-staid foulard.\nInsipid slivers of scarves, these are not. Instead, this is a serious game-changing genre that spans sexy slinky dresses, conspicuous separates and dramatic accents.\n\n\nWant to try your hand at this hot new trend? Here are five ways to ace it.\nIN FULL GEAR \nDidn’t your mother tell you never to do things by halves? So go on and take the scarf print to the extreme. Head-to-toe dressing takes the guesswork out of looking for an alternative match.\nBELLS AND WHISTLES\nSure, your favourite black skirt suit has your back, but it’s still just a black skirt suit. This is a godsend for scarf-print virgins. Consider sending old skirt suits to a trusted tailor for a couture-esque makeover with your favourite scarves.\nSKIRTING THE ISSUE\nToughen up the delicate look of silk with a hint of leather. This nifty design schtick has endured throughout Hermes’ equestrian inspired history. With details this interesting, accessories are optional.\n\n\nMIX IT UP\nLayering prints is a breeze if you stick to the same family of colours. Green on green, blue on blue – you get the drift. Slip on a similarly hued jacket, whether printed or not, for cover-up, or simply to add that something extra to create a standout look. \xa0\nSUM OF IT\nWhat’s better than a sweater dress? An on-point sweater dress, of course. The body-skimming silk scarf detail instantly removes the bulk of this otherwise cuddly classic. Add sneakers for daywear or slip on wedge heels for a night about town.\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, hair by Sean Ang, makeup by Lin Honglin, model Dahee from Now. \n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ']}"

      Influencing the influential: The man who has Rihanna, Madonna and Beyonce selling for him
  </h1>, 'text': 'During his 12-year tenure ending in 2017 as creative director of Givenchy’s, Italian designer Riccardo Tisci was much feted for his contemporary yet romantic creations that seductively combined gothic subversiveness with luxed-up streetwear influences and uncompromising craftsmanship.\nAside from revitalising the 66-year-old French fashion house, which was then stuck in a “elegant but rather stuffy” rut since its Audrey Hepburn heyday in the 50s and 60s, Tisci quickly amassed a fan base that read like the who’s who of pop culture royalty.\xa0\nHe dressed\xa0Kim Kardashian in a form-fitting lace dress for her 2014 wedding to Kanye West; escorted\xa0Madonna, who rocked a Givenchy boob-and-butt-baring strappy black lace bodysuit, to the 2016 Met Ball; and sent\xa0Beyonce down the red carpet in a translucent, flesh-coloured latex gown with strategically placed crystal embellishments.\nOther famous A-listers sporting Givenchy during Tisci’s reign included the likes of Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett, Jessican Chastain, Rihanna, Natalie Portman, Rooney Mara, Nicki Minaj, Naomi Watts, Rosamund Pike and Anne Hathaway.\nThe designer’s appeal extended far beyond the runway and onto the red carpet — Givenchy’s revenues were reported to have increased sixfold during his time there, fuelled mainly by a growing millennial fan base who couldn’t get enough of his T-shirts, handbags and luxury sneakers.\nOf course the fashion world was shocked when Tisci announced last year that he was leaving Givenchy to focus on his “personal interests and passions”. And we had to collect our jaws off the floor when those ""interests"" was to take over the design reigns at the very British Burberry in 2018 following Christopher Bailey’s departure.\nNEW BRITANNIA\nHow different would his vision for the 162-year-old Brit fashion house be from that of his predecessor, who was credited with producing the consistent stream of wearable, modern takes on classic British wardrobe staples that Burberry had come to be associated with during Bailey’s 17-year tenure?\nHow would he inject a subversive, streetwear element that would capture the attention (and wallets) of Insta-happy millennials, while hopefully not drawing back the British football yobs and chavs who favoured the brand so much in the early 2000s that pubs and restaurants in the UK were known to turn away wearers of its distinctive tartan?\nHow would Tisci introduce sexy, edgy eveningwear to a label that was more associated with daywear?\nMost importantly, would his famous fans come along for the ride, now that he was chief creative officer at Burberry?\nALL ABOARD\nEven before he unveiled his debut collection for Burberry’s Spring/Summer 2019 ready-to-wear collection on Sep 17 during this year\'s London Fashion Week, Tisci was already making one thing clear: He still had plenty of clout left in him as a master influencer of the most influential A-listers.\nAs early as August, Beyonce was already wearing Burberry SS19, specifically, a bodysuit, cropped hooded trench and sunglasses, all in the brand’s signature plaid, at one of her Run II tour concerts in New Jersey. She then performed in Houston wearing a white, made-to-measure crystal-embroidered trench coat with a matching bodysuit and white heeled boots.\nJust 48 hours after the Burberry SS19 show, English rapper and producer MIA wore two key pieces from the collection — a fawn print trench layered over a matching blouse — for the London premiere of her documentary Matangi/Maya/MIA, no less.\nAt Paris Fashion Week, which took place right after London Fashion Week, Madonna stepped out in a camel-coloured, double-breasted Burberry SS19 trench coat,\xa0belted tightly over a khaki top, black denim jeans and the distinctive nude ankle boots with a red peep-toe detail that featured heavily in the Burberry SS19 collection.\nMeanwhile, in late September, pop princess Rihanna sported a caramel-hued satin trenchcoat-dress to a Fenty Beauty event held at Sephora in Dubai.\nIn early October, actress Carey Mulligan attended the SAG-AFTRA Foundation Conversations: Wildlife\xa0event in a white silk blouse featuring botanical prints of floral sprigs, paired with toffee-coloured gathered-waist leather trousers –\xa0yes, the very latest from Burberry.\nAnd two days later in London, Julia Roberts wore an ultra-feminine beige skirtsuit, sheer top and square-toed heels from the same collection to an event promoting her new Amazon series, Homecoming.\nOther sightings include models Anok Yai in a butterscotch satin coat dress worn over a vintage-inspired lace-edged silk slip, and Nadia Vodianova in a black trench over a floral dress.\nLET’S NOT FORGET THE CLOTHES\nThere’s no doubt Tisci’s loyal famous posse has his back.\nBut far from just catering to the elite celeb minority, he declared that his mission at Burberry is to dress everyone: “The mother and the daughter, the father and the son.”\nIndeed, the 134-look collection has been thoughtfully subdivided into three segments: “Refined”, “Relaxed” and “Evening"".\nTrue to Burberry’s longstanding reputation for elegant, wearable daywear, the “Refined” section takes centre stage, featuring trenches; separates such as blouses, skirts and trousers; and pantsuits in fluid fabrics such as silk and organza in a muted palette of mainly beige, caramel, camel, chocolate and black.\nOccasional touches of blush, mint, red and coral, and a scattering of prints such as the brand\'s signature tartan, stripes, polka dots and British-influenced motifs such as horses and portraiture, inject a sense of freshness. This is tastefully timeless stuff that any woman aged 16 to 76 can pull off – it\'s easy to imagine\xa0how good four generations of females from the same family would look if they all wore different ""Refined"" outfits for high tea or a wedding lunch with the family at a hotel.\nThe “Relaxed” segment was a lot more playful, subversive and street, with rebellious punk-inspired pieces (after all, London is the birthplace of punk, and Tisci had mentioned earlier that he was enlisting the help of grande dame of punk-inspired fashion Vivienne Westwood at some point).\nThe clash of everything from cow- and fawn-print, gingham, black leather, shiny stainless steel zips, lingerie, tracksuits, gothic Lolita mini frocks and chunky Mary Janes would definitely draw in a newer, younger fan base. In fact, the ""Why Did They Kill Bambi?"" slogan and fawn print is a less-than subtle reference to the fact that Burberry has just sworn off the use of real fur from this collection onwards, as well as to the much-beloved cartoon deer that has featured so heavily in Tisci’s past work for Givenchy.\nWhen it came to the “Evening” segment though, Burberry chose to tread with cautious baby steps, presenting a tiny selection comprising just seven full-length evening gowns, all in black. Some were so classic, you could see mums and daughters sharing them now and over the decades, while the gold-fringed one, as well as the one with a midriff cutout and a high slit up the leg, are definitely not for shrinking violets.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     celebrity ', '     Trending ']}"

      A Rolex Submariner for S$6 a day? The sharing economy hits the watch market
  </h1>, 'text': ""We reckon that you’re already an active participant in the sharing economy: You take a GrabShare to work, ride an ofo bike on the weekends and rent an Airbnb when you go on holiday.\nIt seems like you can lease or share practically anything these days – even a Rolex watch.\nThat’s right. Over the past 18 months, two subscription watch clubs – Acquired Time and TenTwo – have been offering watch rental services to horological enthusiasts, with a third, Specter One, set to launch this month.\nFor as little as S$6 a day, you could be sporting a Rolex Submariner on your wrist, to the envy of your coworkers and chums. At least for an entire month, until it comes time to swap out your Sub for a Cartier Santos.\n\n\nThis week, TenTwo will also launch a special rental collection comprising four Singapore micro-brands: Arcturus, BOLDR, Reverie and Vilhelm. All are startups founded by Singaporeans who are passionate about horology, and are known as micro-brands because they typically produce less than 500 timepieces per year.\nThe concept of subscription watch clubs first took off in the US in 2013 with the now-defunct website Eleven James. But for the founders of Acquired Time and TenTwo, the idea was sparked off by an initial fear of buyer’s remorse, and the consequent realisation that there was a gap in the market that could be filled.\n“My co-founder and I met… in 2017 and we got to talking about timepieces. I lamented the fact that there was no way I could try on a piece before sinking a hefty amount of money into it – my fear of buyer’s remorse,” Acquired Time’s Roy Tong told CNA Lifestyle.\n“My co-founder agreed that this was a problem faced by many people he met, and suggested that there was a void in Singapore’s robust watch market that we could fill with a simple solution – a service where people could lease timepieces and feel it on their wrist before making a purchase decision,” Tong added.\nA LEAP OF FAITH\nIt was a similar scenario for Dan Kruimel, one of the three co-founders of TenTwo (the other two being Ronald Chew and Dan Mills). In Dec 2016, he wanted to buy a Tudor Black Bay Black as a Christmas present to himself, but was hesitant about plonking down “that much cash”. It was “the other Dan” who spurred him on.\n“The other Dan helped me buy the watch. For me, it was a nervous step of spending a considerable amount of money. Having someone guide me through the process and recommendations just made me a lot more comfortable with what I was buying,” he said.\nSome of them aspire to be luxury watch owners but aren’t quite willing to spend that much money. Others are ready to buy, but want to try out a few options to narrow down their choices\n“We had the idea of starting TenTwo in May 2017 when I was looking for my next watch. We had a think, did some research, roped Ron in, created a list of watches that we thought would be good for the collection, and then spent six months tracking down those watches. We launched in Jan 2018,” Kruimel added.\nSpecter One, on the other hand, evolved from a joint business hackathon competition between Singapore Institute of Management’s Young Entrepreneurship Network and Singapore Management University’s (SMU) Real Business Club, held in Jan 2017.\n“The competition was called Real Business Weekend, where participants would come up with a business plan and idea over 52 hours, and on the final day we would pitch to a panel of judges (composed of) successful entrepreneurs,” explained Sendi Heng, founder and CEO of Specter One.\n\n\nIn Dec 2017, Heng pitched the idea to SMU’s Institute of Innovation & Entrepreneurship (IIE) Incubator programme. The Institute was apprehensive at first, but he convinced them of the platform’s merits, and they eventually agreed to back the venture. Specter One is now run by Heng and two partners, Lim Jing Yi and Lui Kinfung, the latter a former classmate. They plan to hold a digital launch campaign on social media this month.\nHOW IT WORKS\nAll three firms operate on the basis of tiered membership subscriptions. Essentially, members pay a flat monthly fee for a stipulated period, say, six or 12 months. During that time, they can choose a watch from a variety in their chosen tier, wear it for a month, and then return it at the end of 30 days in exchange for a different timepiece.\nAcquired Time has the most tiers – four, with the lowest (Nomad Tier) priced at S$125 a month and the highest (Wayfarer Tier) costing S$375 a month, for a six-month minimum. Higher value pieces, such as Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak Offshores, as well as popular models such as the Rolex Daytona, are grouped in the top tier.\nTenTwo currently has a single tier priced at S$179 per month on a 12-month basis. This gives members access to popular watches such as the Rolex Submariner, Tudor Black Bay, Omega Speedmaster, Cartier Santos, Panerai Luminor Marina 1950 and IWC Pilot’s Watch.\nBut the introduction of Singapore micro-brands to the collection will necessitate a secondary tier. “I’m thinking of a three-month Explorer package for S$149, which works out to be about S$50 a month,” Kruimel revealed.\nThe details of Specter One’s tiered membership are still being finalised, but Heng told CNA Lifestyle that the firm will offer a Reserve Membership in addition to a tier structure. “This is for those who do not want to commit to a subscription and (only want to wear the watch) for occasions or events. They will be able to rent watches daily or weekly, depending on how long they need it,” he said.\nWHO’S RENTING?\nHeng intends to target “either Millennials who are embracing the sharing economy, or affluent working adults who are looking to explore watches”.\nBoth Acquired Time and TenTwo declined to disclose how many members they have.\xa0\nTong's members include analysts, architects, bankers and chefs, three-quarters of whom are Singaporean, and an overwhelming majority – 85 per cent – of whom are men. “The higher income earners prefer the higher-end watches such as Audemars Piguet. White collar workers who earn a decent wage, but who think sinking S$10,000 to S$15,000 into a watch is still a large consideration, look at the Rolex sports tiers.”\n\n\nTenTwo’s members fall into three distinct categories. “Some of them aspire to be luxury watch owners but aren’t quite willing to spend that much money. Others are ready to buy, but want to try out a few options to narrow down their choices. And we also have a few watch junkies who have bought and sold a few watches in their time. They realise the value of getting a new watch every month rather than going through the exercise of buying and selling one,” said Kruimel.\nLike Acquired Time, TenTwo clubbers are largely male, forming 90 per cent of the cohort. Their age range is similar as well, spanning the early 20s to the late 40s. However, TenTwo has a slightly higher proportion of expats at around 33 per cent, compared to Acquired Time’s 25 per cent. This could be because the two Dans are themselves expats who have a corresponding expat social network.\nCHAMPIONING SINGAPORE\nDespite this, Kruimel, who is Australian, is keen on demonstrating Singaporean creativity through the micro-brands. “TenTwo being a Singapore-based company, we really wanted to showcase that local collaboration and local entrepreneurs working together to open up the world of horology to potential members,” he said.\nThe idea is to expose members to these micro-brands, the existence of which they might not have been aware. “There will be some people that come to the site looking for a Rolex or Panerai, and they’ll see these micro-brands which might not have been an option. Whether they decide to try out those watches on TenTwo or approach those micro-brands directly, that’s already a great success.”\nThe ultimate goal is to promote watches and meet like-minded people who are into it as well\nTravis Tan, co-founder of two-year-old micro-brand BOLDR, believes that the exposure will be mutually beneficial. “I think it’s a good collaboration between local startups. TenTwo will definitely help reach out to more people and gain exposure for our brand in the local community,” he told CNA Lifestyle.\nFor Alexander Ian Loh, founder of 18-month-old Arcturus, it’s exciting times. “It’s an exciting opportunity for more people to be exposed to micro-brands and to raise awareness about the different options that are available out there,” he said.\nWHAT’S NEXT?\nTong sees potential for Acquired Time in the women’s segment, which currently only has three models. He is also keen on taking the business overseas.\n“The women’s line is a work in progress and we are currently in the process of working on collaborations with strategic partners such as (dress rental firm) StyleLease to offer our women’s line to their clients as an upsize,” he said.\nThe firm is also putting together a programme that will work somewhat like an Amazon Prime or Privileged Membership scheme, where members who have been with the club for at least a year will have their existing memberships upgraded. They will also be offered certain perks not available to new clients. This is due to be piloted at the start of 2019.\nAs for overseas expansion, top of Tong’s list is Hong Kong, which is similar to Singapore in terms of having a sizeable white collar population within a small geographical footprint; a large number of expats; and a target audience that is accepting of the sharing economy.\nOver at TenTwo, the plan is to create a community of watch lovers and enthusiasts, through regular, informal get-togethers as well as planned events. “Earlier this year we did a watch-and-whisky tasting event, and in between talking about the whiskies, we started talking about the watches. We’ve also done a pop-up at a tailor’s, where we talked about pairing different watches with different outfits, such as a beach wedding, or a conventional black-tie wedding.\n“The ultimate goal is to promote watches and meet like-minded people who are into it as well,” said Kruimel.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     timepieces ', '     fashion ']}"

      Creative Capital: The Singaporean entrepreneur who tells stories through clever bags
  </h1>, 'text': 'Quanda Ong, the 32-year-old founder and CEO of leather accessories brand Gnome & Bow,\xa0likes to call himself a Master Talesmith. For him, books and storytelling are paramount, not just in business, but also in\xa0life.\xa0A literacy advocate, this 32-year-old entrepreneur spearheaded a project to build mobile libraries in Cambodia and teach kids to read.\nIn 2014, Quanda set up Gnome & Bow after\xa0a successful crowdfunding campaign\xa0– ""The largest fashion crowdfunding campaign at the time"" – he proudly claims.\xa0The products were billed as “cleverly crafted bags for the discerning gentleman”, and included a folio case, briefcase, duffel bag and backpack. He also sold bracelets, card sleeves and wallets.\nTo create a distinct identity for the brand, he used literary references. Each collection, for example, is called a new book, and classic tales inspire many of his pieces from the packaging to the design motifs. To date, there have been three collections as well as three special collaborations.\xa0\nOne such project was a fencing bag for Zzuma, a specialty store for elite fencers in Brooklyn, New York. It may be the single most beautiful way to carry a sword (or any other martial arts gear) we have ever seen.\xa0\nThe brand also launched women’s handbags in the fourth quarter of 2017. Reviews and sales have been positive, and this five-year-old local brand is now stocked\xa0in countries such as Sweden and Japan. It\'s also\xa0available to global customers through the Gnome & Bow\xa0site as well as other e-tailers.\nDespite the relative success, Quanda stays very grounded. In person, he’s cheerful, humble, well-dressed and charming, and oozes a sincerity that makes you want to root for his success. He unwinds with a good book, karaoke with friends, and hitting, as he puts it, “the salsa dance floor”.\xa0\nHere, in a new CNA Lifestyle series where we speak with creatives making their mark in Singapore, Quanda chats about how he incorporates messages\xa0in his products, and how he balances being both a creative and an\xa0entrepreneur.\xa0\nQUANDA ONG: When I first founded Gnome & Bow, everyone saw me as an entrepreneur, but on hindsight, the truth is I was more of a creative – an artist wanting to paint my stories using bags as my canvas. However, reality soon kicked in.\nAs I grew the business, I found myself becoming more and more of an entrepreneur – charting the future, analysing numbers and seeking commercial opportunities. Therefore, the not-so-straight answer to the question is that it will always be an act of balancing the two and finding the sweet spot where they synergise.\nDO YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE ""WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING?"" MOMENTS?\nMany times! It’s easy to get into the daily grind and be overwhelmed by work\xa0that comes your way. Then all of a sudden, one of those moments comes. It’s a blessing though; a wake-up call to rethink your direction and sharpen your strategies.\n\n\nWHAT\'S BEEN YOUR HERO PRODUCT SO FAR? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS ITS APPEAL?\nOur Strand Briefcase from Book II –\xa0Jekyll’s Hyde is probably our most iconic product so far. The bag boasts two distinct looks in one: A\xa0classic, work-friendly side and a more radical, creative side when reversed.\nAbove all, subtle details make this bag a standout, such as the inner voices of Dr\xa0Jekyll and Mr\xa0Hyde engraved on the base of the bag, and tasteful touches like our signature oxblood hand-stitching.\nIt’s easy to get into the daily grind and be overwhelmed by ‘work’ that comes your way. Then all of a sudden, one of those moments comes.\nWHAT\'S BEEN THE TOUGHEST CREATIVE CHALLENGE YOU\'VE FACED SO FAR?\xa0\nThat would be designing and launching that same collection, Jekyll’s Hyde. The idea was to create a series of reversible bags that showcases the two contending faces of human nature: The rational, reserved side versus the wilder, more spontaneous inner self. The question is: “Which side will prevail?”\xa0\nThe design brief was to create a bag that could keep up with the modern individual’s lifestyle, one that was not only adaptable to work and play, but also interactive and emotionally engaging.\nOne side of the bags features a classic and lustrous nylon which speaks of a distinguished Dr\xa0Jekyll. When flipped, the bags reveal a custom printed cotton canvas, each motif testament to the unconventional ways of Mr\xa0Hyde.\nDesigning it was only one half of the challenge. Then came the fabrication, which took an incredible amount of resolve and resourcefulness. The creative in me really pushed to perfect\xa0the collection. Meanwhile, the entrepreneur in me hoped for the best. I’m glad it turned out well.\nWHO IS YOUR DESIGN OR CREATIVE HERO?\nPaul Smith. His curiosity for all things around him, quirky personality and passion for life inspire me.\nTELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS THAT NO ONE WOULD EXPECT?\nWe plan our books (collections)\xa0at least five books ahead to ensure a seamless transition and story line. Each collection is inspired by stories chosen not randomly, but via a rigorous checklist to ensure both creative and commercial appeal.\xa0Every element of our design is thought through in detail, from the\xa0name of each product to the symbolic representation of our key messages. Finally, we tell stories through our goods on two levels.\n\n\nThe first is how our bags communicate the narrative or concept of the story through details, colours and textures. The second, which most people might not know about is how our products relate to the user in a personal or emotional way. What do they mean beyond the narrative and into the lives of the user?\nBook I: The Hare & The Flying Tortoise, for instance, represents the underdog in the rat race, the wings innovation and perseverance, characteristics of a victor. We designed it in a way to help consumers tell their story, in turn hoping to inspire positive change and energy in them.\nEach collection is inspired by stories chosen not randomly, but via a rigorous checklist to ensure both creative and commercial appeal.\xa0\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF RETAIL?\nThe future of retail is in onmi-channel, making sure that offline and online touch points work hand-in-hand. Further to this, the real pivot lies in how brands can differentiate themselves through a consistent and engaging brand experience.\nBrands need to get up close and personal with consumers or work with stores (the middleman) who can translate or replicate their brand experience without dilution. These are increasingly hard to find. Mass distribution and aggressive marketing is not just going to work anymore as consumers become more discerning.\nIS SINGAPORE A TOUGH PLACE TO BE CREATIVE?\nThe answer lies in what makes a creative tick. Singapore has grown leaps and bounds in the creative scene since my dad’s time, where engineering was the hot industry. Anyone can be a creative in his own right, but what’s really tough in being a creative is being a commercial one.\xa0It’s a constant challenge breaking through creative clutter while making business sense, understanding consumer needs and meeting them.\nSo, yes, it is very tough in my opinion as Singapore still has a herd mentality, especially when it comes to the arts and fashion, following mass trends, playing safe and fitting into popular stereotypes.\nWHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED BY RUNNING YOUR OWN BUSINESS?\nI’ve learned\xa0loads. I almost don’t know where to start when asked this question. I guess a key learning point is the importance of commercial creativity. Creativity and commercial reality have a strong symbiotic relationship that you need to harness to stay competitive and relevant in the business. Another is the importance of people. They are what make any business alive and thriving. Always invest in them.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     Accessories ', '     fashion ']}"

The zig-zag design keeps even the finest hair strands in place.\nSimply bun your hair up and slide the hairband on. Make like Gurung and move it a little towards the chignon as if to frame the knot.\nCLAW CLIPS\nSo mummy dearest had these claw clips back in the day and we did not think very much of them. And here comes Alexander Wang to make them cool.\nThey really are the easiest means to achieve a pull-backed look. Wear them stacked so it\'s ""a look"". Not to be mistaken for how you look when you\'re washing your face.\nPRETTY BARETTES\nShelve those boring bobby pins and bring out these dainty bejewelled hair barrettes for the\xa0easiest way to add a flash of glamour. Take a cue from supermodel\xa0Gigi Hadid, who has been spotted with sparkly slides on both sides of her centre-parted tresses.\nThink retro Greek goddess, not nerdy bookworm, so place the clips no higher than the temples.\nFLUTTERY FEATHERS\nLong before music festival goers appropriated the feathered headpiece, teens of the 90s were rocking less controversial dangly feather earrings with crop tops and bell-bottom jeans. This season, Dries Van Noten takes this boho aesthetic a step further by lining hair partings and side-swept bangs with thin, coloured feathers.\nIt is easy enough to DIY this with eyelash glue and some feathers from the craft store.

      Creative Capital: The Singapore artist who paints on Hermes Birkin bags
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the world of fashion and style, customisation has become the new buzzword. Brands, ranging from ultra-luxury to mass premium, have begun promoting ways for customers to co-create products with them. They’ve found that giving patrons this sense of ownership and co-creation is a very enticing and lucrative offer. But there are some bespoke touches that require an expert craftsman (or woman).\nIn these circumstances, it’s not uncommon for savvy brand and boutique managers to quietly recommend an artisan whose quality is on par with their marques and whom they know will deliver what the customer needs. One such artist is Cherin Sim.\nTo say that Cherin paints on leather is a bit of an understatement. That’s like saying Savion Glover is a dancer, or Aubert de Villaine made wine, or that Andre Chiang’s a cook. Cherin creates incredibly detailed, impeccably painted, humorous, witty and imaginative artworks, based on her patrons’ ideas on luxury leather goods – the kinds of which many of us save up for decades in order to afford.\nTake a look at her Instagram page and be prepared to be blown away, both by her artworks and the sheer amount of trust her customers have placed in her, especially when she won’t tell her clients what they’re going to get until she does her final reveal.\nCherin, who shuttles back and forth between homes in Japan and Singapore, has a Masters of Fine Art from Goldsmith London. She also won the Winston Oh Postgraduate Research Scholarship which brought her to pursue leather-working at Scuola del Cuoio, one of the world’s most iconic leather schools in Florence, Italy. She started her career as a bag maker and designer. The painting and customisation that she’s now known for came long later.\nYOU STARTED OFF DESIGNING BAGS. HOW THEN DID YOU END UP BECOMING AN ARTIST WHO PAINTS ON BAGS?\nCHERIN SIM: While doing my Master’s degree, I was offered a scholarship which allowed me to travel to Italy. I started offering bespoke leather goods services after I graduated. At that time, no one really was making bespoke bags, mostly just small leather goods. I love bags… they are the engine that drives luxury fashion houses, so I did that. As I wanted to make something truly bespoke, I offered my clients the option to have paintings done on these bag that I made from scratch.\nAs time went by, more and more people were picking up the craft of leather working. And, honestly, there are so many super skilled leather workers around the world, at a standard that I struggle to reach. I felt that if I can’t be the best, I should do something different. I’ve always been someone who prefers to do something that no one else is doing, I gradually transitioned into only painting on leather goods. The transition took about a year.\nI’m quite a crazy human. I believe that anything is possible and I love the impossible.\nNow thinking back, I actually enjoy painting so much more than I do making leather goods! After all, I studied painting half my life, and I’m blessed to be able to do what I truly love for a living.\nDID YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE ""WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING?"" MOMENTS?\nNever! I’m quite a crazy human. I believe that anything is possible and I love the impossible. If I love something, I do it with all my heart and to the extreme.\nIS SINGAPORE A TOUGH PLACE TO BE CREATIVE?\nTo a certain extent, yes. Although in recent years, I have seen the trend of “supporting local” emerge and become stronger. Mind sets of the mass population do not change overnight even with more education. There are always only a handful of people who appreciate local arts and really want to support local talent.\nI find that the majority of Singaporeans still prefer to look to the outside – and creatives, brands, or any sort of small creative businesses do better and can be more highly regarded if they go abroad and then come back in. Honest, sad truth.\n\n\nHOW ARE YOUR SINGAPOREAN CUSTOMERS DIFFERENT FROM FOREIGN CUSTOMERS, IF THEY ARE AT ALL?\nAt this point, I don’t think where they come from makes them any different! My clients are generally people who appreciate pop art and love the idea of being different and standing out. They all understand that it is important to trust the artist, and trust the process.\nWHAT\'S BEEN THE TOUGHEST CREATIVE CHALLENGE YOU\'VE FACED SO FAR?\nMy only priority is to make sure that the final product looks awesome. Sometimes clients come to me with ideas and images that either don’t look good, or don’t make sense, but it is something they relate to, and would like me to paint on their luxury item.\nThe truth is that no matter how technically good or skilled you are, your art will only be seen or appreciated if it’s being “sold” or shown. Art is a business.\nI will not turn them down or reject these ideas right away because I respect that everyone has their own story to tell. My job is to listen carefully, pick up the essence of the ideas that interest my clients, and work from there to create something they will still love but also create something contemporary and beautiful.\nANDY WARHOL IS ONE OF YOUR HEROES. TELL ME MORE ABOUT HOW AND WHY HE INSPIRES YOU.\nAndy Warhol was a master of making use of what was around him – day-to-day things like the Campbell soup can, or famous people like Marilyn Monroe – and presented them as “art”. I feel the relatability was what made his work a success.\nHe embodied the idea that “art is what you can get away with”. This gives me courage to do all things and makes me believe that anything is possible, that nothing is too wild, too crazy or too outrageous. You can get away with anything in the name of art, so just do it!\nI also love how Warhol was so superficial and honest about art being a business. He didn’t try to be anything else, didn’t try to be profound or philosophical. We often hear the term “struggling artist”. The truth is that no matter how technically good or skilled you are, your art will only be seen or appreciated if it’s being “sold” or shown. Art is a business.\nTELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS THAT WE WOULD NEVER EXPECT.\nMy clients never really know what they will be getting. It is always a surprise for them. I don’t show a sketch as the ideas are in my head. They tell me what they fancy, and I will do the rest!\nReceiving a hopefully pleasant surprise is part of the entire marquage process, and I believe it adds to making a better overall experience. Of course this trust and freedom granted to me also adds on to my stress as I not only need to make sure what I create is not just good – it has to be better than what is expected.\n\n\nWHAT\'S NEXT? WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON RIGHT NOW?\nMore Birkins! More unusual items such as trunks, cases, some vintage cars and motorcycles. I’m currently also painting the Hokusai Wave over and over again in different variations in a way that best suits the item I’m painting on, as well as the profile of my client.\nI never paint anything twice, because that defeats the idea of customisation in the first place. The Hokusai Wave (Great Wave of Kanagawa) is the only exception. It’s the only icon that I have painted many times in different forms… so technically they all still different. This piece of art is the most well recognised Japanese art and has been interpreted in many ways. It means different things for different people. It also means a lot to me, which is why I use it so much. Also because it is iconic. It has become a pop cultural icon – it is relatable!\nThe beauty of a wave is only appreciated upon its disappearance. It reminds me to always have gratitude and appreciate things and people while they are still there. Mount Fuji represents strength, and no amount of challenge – represented by the big wave – coming its way will cause it to waver.\nI’m looking to paint more of the Hokusai Wave, and maybe evolve it into my signature. When I have painted enough pieces, I might recall them all and have an exhibition full of waves. I’m actually kind of looking forward to this.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Voices ""]}"

      The striped tee is the single most versatile wardrobe staple — we have five ways to prove it
  </h1>, 'text': ""The nautical appeal of the Breton tee – or mariner striped T-shirt – dates back to the 1800s when the French Navy created it as part of its uniform. But it was Coco Chanel (yes, the Coco Chanel) who brought the seafaring ways of the striped tee to the mainstream,\xa0and it has since been adopted by designers such as Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier and Hedi Slimane, to name a few.\nOne of the most enduring trends on the fashion runways, this versatile classic is also favoured by men who have shaped pop culture as we know it:\xa0Pablo Picasso, James Dean, Paul Newman, Kurt Cobain, Andy Warhol, are just a few names that may ring a bell.\nWhile the pattern may be simple, you can always dial up the ways to wear the humble striped tee. Here's a little style inspiration.\nTIP: Instead of black jeans, try a pair of white ones instead. They’re less predictable and make you look dialled in and so darn cool.\nTIP: If you’re tall and lanky, consider a pair of high-waisted wide-legged trousers instead of slim-fit pants. Think artistic and romantic.\nTIP: If you’re new to clashing prints, remember the golden rule of mismatching pattern sizes if you want to ace that game.\nTIP: You can also opt for a longer military vest for a casual weekend night out. Pair them with a pair of slim-cut black jeans and boots for a stylish finish.\nTIP: Raise your style stakes with an unexpected finishing touch. A pair of socks in red, green or yellow will do the trick.\nPhotography by Aik Chen, styling by Damian Huang, grooming by Lin Hongling, model Masato from Mannequin.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      Why watch aficionados should collect niche brands, according to Arnold &amp; Son
  </h1>, 'text': 'For the most part, watch collectors go through a cycle when it comes to their prized collections. They typically start off with entry-level pieces from renowned name brands. They then progress to higher-end models from those brands. At the top of their game, they start acquiring rare watches, limited editions, vintage pieces, and unusual creations from niche or independent watchmakers.\nNiche brands like Arnold & Son produce only 600 timepieces a year – a far cry from the purported one million tickers that roll off Rolex’s factory floor annually. The chances of an Arnold & Son wearer bumping into a fellow aficionado are therefore\xa0pretty slim.\nNot all watch collectors are into niche brands though. Some bemoan the lack of after-sales service or customer support.\n\n\nCNA Lifestyle spoke to Arnold & Son’s COO, Florian Serex, who was in Singapore recently, to assuage collectors’ concerns.\nWHY SHOULD A WATCH ENTHUSIAST COLLECT NICHE BRANDS?\nWhen you want something that not everybody is wearing, perhaps it is better to look for a niche brand. And you do not need to spend too much money. For S$15,000, you can get our HMS1. The Nebula is S$20,000. And you will have something special on your wrist.\nWHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO A WATCH ENTHUSIAST WHO IS LOOKING TO START COLLECTING NICHE BRAND TIMEPIECES?\nHe or she should find out if the brand produces their own movements, or if it is a brand related to history. It could be something historically significant, or connected to the history of watch development.\nWith Arnold & Son, we have at least these two specifications. We are continuing the work that was started by John Arnold (1736 – 1799), a watchmaker who worked for England’s King George III. We now operate from Switzerland, so we are a Swiss manufacture.\nWe design all our products in-house. We produce, assemble and test the components; redesign them if there are problems; fix the problems; and then produce the decorations. We only work with suppliers for the cases, but even then it is a close partnership.\nWHAT ASSURANCE CAN YOU GIVE THAT A WATCH FROM A NICHE BRAND LIKE ARNOLD & SON WILL HOLD ITS VALUE? \nI cannot give any assurance of that, but I can say that our brand will not die tomorrow or in two years’ time because we have a huge group behind us (Citizen Watch). We can repair the watch if it stops or has a problem. We can refresh the movement. We have components. Our watches are not like electronic or connected watches. With those watches, it might be difficult to find components after two years. But you can restart our watches even after 200 years. Just add a bit of lubricant!\nSo many brands claim that they are manufactures, but not many of them have the machinery that can sustain in-house production.\nSOME CUSTOMERS OF NICHE BRANDS LAMENT THE LACK OF AFTER-SALES SERVICE AND/OR CUSTOMER SUPPORT. WHAT ASSURANCE CAN YOU GIVE?\nIf they bought the watch from a retailer, they can bring it in to the retailer and we will repair it. We have an international guarantee. If a customer in Singapore bought the watch in Hong Kong, he/she would need to go back to Hong Kong, return the watch, and we will repair it. If the customer returns the watch in Singapore, he/she would need to pay the GST first, and then we will repair it.\nWHAT SHOULD A POTENTIAL ARNOLD & SON CUSTOMER START WITH? ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR MODELS TO CONSIDER? \nThe HMS1, which has a central hour/minutes indication and a small seconds display at six o’clock. It is a beautiful watch, very thin, with a 90-hour power reserve and a see-through back so you can see the decoration on the manual-winding movement.\nIf he/she already owns a similar watch from a ""standard""\xa0brand, perhaps he can skip the HMS1 and jump on the Nebula. It is not a skeletonised watch. It was built to be completely exposed. From the top you can see the whole movement, the barrels, the gear trains, and the balance wheel. From the bottom, you can see the gear train that is used to set the time.\nAfter that, on this same line of architectural products that were specifically designed to show the internal functioning of the watch, you have some other models. The next one can be the Tourbillon Chronometer 36, where you can see the barrel, gear train, and a tourbillon. You can see how a tourbillon works, and the 50 pieces inside a tourbillon.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bWHAT IS THE MOST OVERRATED THING ABOUT WATCHMAKING TODAY?\nSo many brands claim that they are manufactures, but not many of them have the machinery that can sustain in-house production. But we do.\n', 'related_topics': ['     luxury ', '     fashion ']}"

      Meet the Indian designers who made Priyanka Chopra’s engagement outfit
  </h1>, 'text': 'Rack upon rack of finely embellished gowns fill the room. In one corner, display cases brim with diamond-set jewellery. Overhead, light from crystal chandeliers bathe the room in a warm glow, accented by\xa0big, white floral bouquets.\nI could be in the walk-in-wardrobe of a society maven. In reality, I am in the Crescent Ballroom of The Four Seasons Hotel, about to witness a trunk show put on by India’s designers-to-the-stars, Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla. Together, the pair have\xa0dressed many actresses and singers of note in Bollywood and beyond, from Priyanka Chopra and\xa0Aishwarya Rai Bachchan to Beyonce and\xa0Jennifer Lopez.\nThe annual event, organised by Singapore firm The Silk Root for the third year running, typically occurs just as the Indian social season gets underway. This is a time when the betrothed tie the knot and families throw lavish parties to celebrate. And, of course, they need custom frocks and spiffy suits to do so in style.\nThe creations shown in Singapore\xa0span three collections: The couture/bridal line Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla (AJSK); the Western-style brand Khosla Jani; and the diffusion label ASAL by Abu Sandeep.\xa0\nPrices range from S$1,000 for an ASAL casual dress to S$20,000 for a top-of-the-line, intricately handwoven ball gown from AJSK.\nAfter 32 years in the business, Jani and Khosla have carved a solid reputation for themselves. The company grew from a single showroom in Mumbai into a 300-man outfit with seven boutiques in India, and trunk shows that call at London and New York Fashion Weeks.\nBollywood’s biggest and brightest – the likes of Kareena Kapoor Khan and Sonam Kapoor, seen in the recent comedy Veere Di Wedding – need only place a call to the couturiers, and three days later, they\'ll be\xa0outfitted for a red carpet outing or festive occasion.\n\nSuch was the case with Priyanka Chopra, who opted for a radiant yellow\xa0sherwani to wear for her engagement to Nick Jonas.\n“Priyanka’s outfit took a long time to make – almost six months,” Khosla told CNA Lifestyle, adding that he was not aware of their engagement plans until three days before the event.\xa0\n“The sherwani\xa0was something we already had, to be honest. It was made specially for the Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla collection. So, it was not exactly a custom piece. But it had just come in (to the boutique), and she loved it, so it worked out really well.”\nThe chikankari embroidery used on the sherwani\xa0is painstakingly handworked by women in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. It is, Khosla explained, one of the few embroidery styles to be done by women; the vast majority are done by men.\xa0\nKhosla and Jani revived this ancient craft 25 years ago, introducing it to a new upmarket clientele. At any one time, there is a waiting list of 10 to 12 clients, who have to sit tight for a year or two, while their dresses are assembled.\nPrior to her own roka ceremony, Chopra wore another AJSK creation – a red sari – to Shloka Mehta and Akash\xa0Ambani\'s engagement\xa0party.\n“You build a certain amount of trust with certain actors and actresses, like Sara Ali Khan from the younger generation, and Sonam Kapoor, who’s a big fashionista in India. She’s a clothes horse. Whatever you put on her transforms magically,” said Khosla.\n\nThen, of course, there is Bollywood royalty – the Bachchans. Among their first notable clients was the screen legend Jaya Bachchan, wife of Amitabh. Today, they dress her daughter-in-law, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.\n“It’s a relationship based on mutual trust and respect. They just tell us, ‘Guys, I’m going (to attend a certain event), do whatever you want to do’. We already know their measurements. We know what colours work on them, what embroideries or appliques they like. And we have a team that goes to fit them out every time,"" said Kholsa.\nBy the time you read this, Khosla would have hopped on a plane. His next destination is Lake Como, Italy, where Isha Ambani (daughter of billionaire Mukesh Ambani) and Anand Piramal (a billionaire industrialist, philanthropist and social entrepreneur) are due to be engaged.\n“I can’t talk about it, but it’s more than one dress!” he said coyly, before excusing himself to attend to his clients – one of whom, a walk-in customer, was overheard claiming to be the future Queen of Dubai. She was shopping for a wedding dress, of course.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', ""     Women's Style "", '     celebrity ', '     fashion ']}"

      Ladies, here are the 7 designer bags to top your ‘pamper myself’ list this season 
  </h1>, 'text': 'This season’s bag offerings certainly lean towards eclectic and exuberant. It is delightful to discover that running through this variety is the unifying theme of brash youthfulness and energy, a sort of brazen spirit that you know will spark more revolutionary iterations in seasons to come – while staying conscious of preserving each brand’s aesthetic legacy.\nHats off to the genius creators behind these beauties, for finding new expressions of boldness for such an everyday, functional accessory. Multi-strapped, attention-grabbing, overtly decorated, loud and proud, these are the seven key bags to covet this season.\n1. NEW WAVE BY LOUIS VUITTON\nNicolas Ghesquiere’s love-child of luxury and pop culture gets its moniker from the 80s music genre we know and love. The unique wave design comes from the brand’s original heritage trunks that put Louis Vuitton on the world’s map in 1854. Those unmissable LV initials (in gold and silver), and that talking point shoulder strap don’t hurt either.\nIt is only the most emblematic bag in Dior’s 21st century history. If anything, the original Dior Saddle bag, launched in 2000 also marked John Galliano’s glory days as creative director at Dior. Fast-forward nearly two decades to 2018, and the Dior Saddle’s It bag status swells again.\nThe best prelude to the revival of the Dior Saddle? Supermodel sisters, Gigi and Bella Hadid toting their mother Yolanda Foster’s vintage Galliano pieces during an outing for the Dior Fall 2018 show in Paris.\nMaria Grazia Chiuri’s new Dior Saddle bag is sexier and even more body-conscious. She’s upped its ante with new fabrics, materials, and had the foresight to team it with rustic cross-body straps that are inter-changeable.\nNamed for the French phrase “se mettre sur son 31”, which means dressed to the nines at 31 (Rue Cambon, one of Chanel’s Paris boutique address), the Chanel 31 bag is a style chameleon – chic overnighter, semi-structured work tote, and largish evening clutch. This hardworking bag offers mileage and more bang for your buck, rising to every occasion.\nWhen Prada launched its first robot-embellished totes in the mid-2000s, it charmed the fashion world instantly. Women and men were snatching them off the shelves like freshly baked bread. Then came the robot charms for bags and phones that caused yet another buying frenzy.\nThis season, the whimsical robot returns with a minimalist look and takes pride of place on a classic flap handbag in typical Prada style – vintage-inspired and ladylike – transforming it into a purse that transcends age and style inclinations. It’s both serious and fun.\n5. LOGO BACKPACK BY GUCCI\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nThis has all the hallmarks of a Gucci collectible: The repeated Double-G logo, an emblem of the Italian brand’s status as the purveyor of fine jewellery, fashion, and leather goods since the 1920s; green and red webbing; leather trim; the sturdy structure of a fashion workaholic’s dream bag.\nDesign heritage aside, this bags carries a modern woman’s life. It has compartments for personal items, makeup, and even the larger digital devices we can’t seem to live without. A timeless investment that’s totally “Guccified” in a good way, it leaves your hands free to send out that last email while waiting for your Grab.\nInspired by Chloe’s Drew bag, the Tess Saddle bag takes on the auspicious horseshoe shape, and has the representative Chloe ring on its flap. This urban cowgirl bag comes with a short shoulder strap, as well as a longer one that turns it into a cross body – very West World. Just yummier, and without the terror and gore.\nAs milestone bags go, it has both gravitas and levity. If Dior’s Saddle is sexy and louche, Chloe’s is the polished and cultivated version. It’s very Chloe.\nAntiquated and precious, Francesco Risso’s version of the saddle bag is in some ways less of a bag, and more of a decorative accessory. Like what an Egyptian princess or a pharaoh’s queen might tote about.\nThe Marni Monile bag is also perfect for weekends and travel – versatile (another three-in-one: Sling, cross body, clutch), hands-free, and just small and flat enough to make one feel unencumbered. Sufficiently roomy for Saturday’s and Sunday’s fun essentials, and small enough to fit into a big shoulder tote for after-work soirees.\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', ""     Women's Style ""]}"

      An ode to the alluring moon phase watch, just in time for the Mid-Autumn Festival
  </h1>, 'text': ""Words like “lunatic” and “lunacy” come from the Roman goddess Luna, who is said to be the embodiment of the moon. While there is no scientific correlation between the appearance of full moons and instances of insanity, the same cannot be said of horological enthusiasts when it comes to moon phase watches.\nMoon phase\xa0madness has been around since at least the 14th century, when the first astronomical clocks appeared.\xa0Their function was to reflect as closely as possible the lunar cycle, which takes 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and three seconds – or one lunar month – to complete.\nSome watchmakers round down the lunar month to 29.5 days, and to compensate for this, users have to correct the moon phase setting every two and a half years. On higher-end watches, correction is not needed for at least 10 years, and in some cases, even a thousand or more years.\xa0\nWith the full moon expected during the Mid-Autumn Festival, this is an ode to 10 moon phase tickers that make our hearts swell.\nA.\xa0LANGE & SOHNE LANGE 1 MOON PHASE\nAs is typical of German marque A. Lange & Sohne’s watches, the devil is in the details. First released in 2002, the Lange 1 Moon Phase was updated with a new movement and new features in 2016. Chief among these was the moon phase indicator itself.\nComprising two discs – one housing the moon and the other, rotating behind it, the sky – the latter is decorated in vibrant, graduated shades of blue to represent daylight and twilight.\nAUDEMARS PIGUET ROYAL OAK RD#2\nTo fully appreciate Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak RD#2, you have to view the watch on its side. At just 2.89mm, it is the\xa0thinnest automatic perpetual calendar wristwatch in the world – and a good three times thinner\xa0than\xa0the “regular” Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar.\nThe RD#2's\xa0elegant moon phase display sits\xa0discreetly at 12 o’clock, a photo-realistic lune against a star-spangled night sky.\nBREGUET CLASSIQUE 7787\nThe Classique 7787 appears, at first\xa0glance, ultra-refined, but is\xa0at heart a quirky device rife with surprises. The moon phase aperture, for example, is shaped like a smile or a moustache. The\xa0moon face on the moon phase –\xa0a Breguet signature\xa0–\xa0references\xa0the mythical man on the moon.\nThe final surprise lies at the 7787’s core: A cutting-edge movement that boasts silicon parts. Breguet was among the earliest watchmakers to embrace this ultra-modern material in 2006.\nGLASHUTTE ORIGINAL SENATOR EXCELLENCE PANORAMA DATE MOON PHASE\nYou'll notice that the little crescent-shaped window, in which the moon appears, occupies the\xa0unusual position between 10 o’clock and 11 o’clock. But there is method to the madness: It visually balances out the big date display diagonally across from it.\xa0\nThe watch is otherwise a classy affair, with blued steel hands, a silver grained dial, and a finely finished movement that is visible through the case back. The dial and movement are both made in-house, at the German firm’s facilities in Pforzheim and Glashutte, respectively.\nH. MOSER & CIE ENDEAVOUR PERPETUAL MOON CONCEPT\nIndependent Swiss firm H. Moser & Cie takes minimalism to another\xa0level with this new\xa0September 2018\xa0release: The Endeavour Perpetual Moon Concept. No logo, no indexes, just three hands and the pure, graphic beauty of the satellite as it waxes and wanes across the six o’clock window.\xa0\nThe moon phase indicator happens to be one of the most accurate on the market, with no adjustment needed for 1,027 years. On the steel model, there is even a direct connection to astrophysics: Vantablack, the black coating on the dial, is used in telescopes. The carbon-based material absorbs more than 99 per cent of light.\nJAQUET DROZ GRANDE SECONDE MOON WATCH\nThe figure-eight display on Jaquet Droz’s flagship Grande Seconde\xa0has always reminded us of the adorably rotund BB-8 droid from Star Wars. Appropriate\xa0then, for the watchmaker to add a moon phase complication to the lineup.\xa0\nFirst seen on three models in 2017, the moon phase returned in four new guises in August\xa02018. Most alluring of these is the 39mm steel-with-diamonds ladies’ model, which comes with an aventurine dial resembling the night sky.\nThe moon and stars, tooled in white gold, and boasting a highly textured surface, deserve scrutiny under a loupe. Adjustments need to be made only once every 122 years.\nMONTBLANC STAR LEGACY MOONPHASE 42MM\nWhen Montblanc decided to give its 20-year-old Star Legacy collection a face-lift this year, it tweaked very little. Only the hour markers were redesigned as Breguet-style Arabic numerals as\xa0a hat-tip to vintage pocket watches from the Minerva manufacture, a facility that Montblanc acquired in 2006.\nThis is a watch for purists,\xa0who like their tickers fuss-free, with a well-proportioned moon phase indicator, and accompanying date ring anchoring the 6 o’clock position.\nOMEGA SPEEDMASTER MOONPHASE CO-AXIAL MASTER CHRONOMETER CHRONOGRAPH\nIs there a\xa0watch more closely associated with the moon – the actual celestial body – than Omega’s Speedmaster “Speedy” Moonwatch? Probably not. This relative of the timepiece that accompanied Buzz Aldrin during the 1969 moon landing was released in 2016. Nine references of this watch exist, varying in case material, bezel colour and dial treatment.\xa0\nOn the steel versions, the moon is depicted in a photo-realistic manner, albeit with the quirky addition of an astronaut’s footprint. The indicator needs adjusting every 10 years. But unlike other watches that require a stylus to reset a button on the case side, all it takes\xa0is a few turns of the crown.\nPATEK PHILIPPE NAUTILUS REF. 5740/1G\nPatek Philippe’s Nautilus line received its first grand complication this year. Reference 5740/1G plays host to a perpetual calendar, with indicators for the day, date, month, leap year, 24-hour time and, of course, a moon phase. That is a lot of information to take in on a 40mm dial, but the latter holds its own at 6 o’clock, charting the lunar path from left to right.\xa0\nThe date ring on its circumference is handy not only for the wearer’s daily reference, but also when setting and correcting the moon phase. (Patek’s website lists the dates of each full moon until 2021). Connoisseurs will also be delighted to know that at 8.42mm, the watch is Patek’s thinnest perpetual calendar.\nVACHERON CONSTANTIN FIFTYSIX COMPLETE CALENDAR\nVacheron Constantin has actively courted Millennial collectors for the past couple of years, with more wallet-friendly (relative to the brand, anyway) releases. This year, the Genevan manufacture unveiled a new line of watches, the Fiftysix, which is inspired by an archival piece from 1956.\xa0\nThe Fiftysix Complete Calendar – which has day, date, month and moon phase displays – comes in two guises, steel and 18K pink gold. At S$33,100 and S$52,000, respectively, they are not exactly bargain basement. But you get sophisticated wrist machines with in-house calibres that are certified with the Hallmark of Geneva, a highly respected quality seal.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     luxury ', '     fashion ']}"

      Colours are major this season – here’s how to wear the look at work 
  </h1>, 'text': 'The company handbook may frown upon short hemlines and blatant flashing of skin, but nowhere does it say that Crayola colours at the top of the fashion game are a no-no.\nAfter all, there is symbolism in colour. Red is power and implies confidence and leadership qualities, yellow symbolises optimism and clarity, while blue denotes wisdom and stability. And all of them are painting the runways a new trend, from Balenciaga and Dries Van Noten, to Dior and Louis Vuitton.\nHere’s how to create a captivating capsule of coloured workwear that says only the good stuff about who you are. HR can thank us later.\nHEAD-TO-TOE\nAce the look with a punchy hue rather than jinx it with failsafe neutrals. Leave a lasting impression with a chilli red double-breasted suit or a canary yellow sheath. Couture-esque touches like a nipped waistline, structured shoulders or tapered hems leave will leave the corporate competition in the dust.\nTONE-ON-TONE\nYour to-do list is long enough as it is, so why let colour coordination become a burden? Take a leaf from designers who make magic playing colours of the same family. Mint green on emerald green or baby pink on fuschia, anybody?\nKEEP IT ABOVE THE WAIST\nThe coloured top is a fashion designer’s secret drab-to-fab styling tip. So give your crisp white shirt a rest and reach for a coloured blouse or paintbox sweater to jolt that staple knife-pleat skirt back to life. Styling tip: Belt it to pull the look together.\nTHE COLOURED EXTRAS\nFor all the die-hard all-blacks out there – and there are a lot of us – this is a coloured trend you’ll be tempted to try. Trendy fashion fixes like Dior’s red plastic sunnies, Gucci’s Klein blue chain bag, Chanel’s canary yellow sandals give just the right tint of fashion love.\nPhotography by Aik Chen; styling by Damian Huang, hair by Sean Ang, makeup by Lin Hongling; model Jung Dahee/Now Model\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', ""     Women's Style "", '     fashion ']}"

      Style Icon: How the simple four-leaf clover became a symbol of elegance across the ages
  </h1>, 'text': 'Depending on how far back your memory stretches, you might recall seeing silver screen legend Grace Kelly, aka Princess Grace of Monaco, bedecked in a long, gold necklace studded with four-leaf clover motifs.\nThe necklace – or sautoir, to use the French term – is part of Parisian jeweller Van Cleef & Arpels’ signature Alhambra collection, and is one of the most recognisable jewels in the world.\nThe princess was such a fan that she had sautoirs in various guises: Yellow gold, coral, lapis lazuli and malachite. For most of the 1970s, they accompanied her at both public occasions and private events.\nActress Kelly Rutherford, famous for her role as high society queen Lily van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, and the inimitable Mariah Carey, are also big fans of the Alhambra. Both are often photographed sporting – besides sautoirs – earrings, pendants and/or bracelets from the collection.\nIt is easy to understand why they, along with many of the planet’s Louboutin-shod, Birkin-toting women adore the series. Elegant, feminine and easy to wear, the pieces are available in a multitude of different materials and colour palettes, making it a cinch to coordinate with existing wardrobes.\nSTROKE OF LUCK\nNo doubt the fact that the clover motif is also a lucky symbol contributed to its success.\nJacques Arpels, nephew of company co-founder Estelle Arpels, was a firm believer in serendipity. “To be lucky, you have to believe in luck,” he once said. According to company records, the second-generation owner would routinely pick four-leaf clovers from his garden to distribute among his staff and inspire optimism.\nIt was Arpels’ travels that inspired the birth of the Alhambra collection in 1968. Moorish quatrefoil patterns and architectural elements found on the Doge’s Palace in Venice reinforced his idea to use the clover motif. A delicate beaded contour was added to showcase the company’s artisanal skills.\nThe Alhambra’s debut was timely, too. Women’s fashion was undergoing a revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, reflecting sweeping changes in (mainly American) society at the time. Looser, liberated silhouettes prevailed as a result. And the sautoir’s fluid design was well-suited to such profiles.\nFAB AT 50\nThe Alhambra celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, with new takes on the classic style. There are 20-motif sautoirs, five-motif bracelets and two-motif earrings to choose from.\nIf your wardrobe is largely monochromatic, it is likely that you will be drawn to the pieces rendered in white gold, onyx and diamonds. Van Cleef & Arpels typically uses Brazilian onyx, which is prized for its deep black hue and mirror-like surface polish.\nFor a slightly warmer aesthetic, you may opt for the pieces hewn from pink gold, grey mother-of-pearl and diamonds. The grey mother-of-pearl comes from French Polynesia and is valued for its harmonious silvery-grey tones, regular surface and high-quality sheen.\nOtherwise, there is a version in yellow gold and rock crystal, the rock crystal displaying a milky, frosted transparency that is lifted by the radiance of the gold.\nMost vibrant of all – and imbued with a regal splendour – is the version made from yellow gold and lapis lazuli.

      Remember your old cassette tapes? They get transformed into beautiful accessories
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you grew up between the 1970s and\xa01990s, you would remember listening to cassette tapes. You might even have recorded your favourite songs on the radio, or made your own mixtapes – the equivalent of today’s Spotify playlists.\nCassettes were phased out by the 2000s. But for Jessica ""JJ"" Chuan, the 32-year-old Malaysia-born, Singapore-based founder of rehyphen, they\xa0served a purpose then and continue to serve a purpose now.\nWhen she was 17, her good\xa0friend moved to Australia to further her studies. To keep in touch, they would record what they wanted to say on cassette tapes, and\xa0mail them\xa0to each other. Chuan would also send over recordings of her piano compositions for her friend to critique.\nIn 2016, after working in business development in Shanghai for a number of years, the Parsons School of Design, New York alumnus hit upon the idea to give these forgotten – but still beloved – relics of her past a new lease of life.\n“I found some old cassettes and decided to take the tape out and weave it into a fabric,” she told CNA Lifestyle.\xa0She experimented with various techniques to fashion the material, including embroidery and knitting, but none worked. That was until she stumbled upon felting needles.\xa0Mimicking a traditional basket weave,\xa0Chuan produced what would come to be known as MusicCloth.\n“I sent this fabric to the Material ConneXion\xa0library (in New York), where my textile lecturer used to bring us, and the library accepted my material. They even asked me to send them 20 more pieces to display in their libraries worldwide,” she said.\nSince then, Chuan has handmade\xa0totes,\xa0notebooks,\xa0dresses and scarves using MusicCloth. In Singapore, these items are retailed at lifestyle shops such as Kapok, Supermama and Books Actually. Kapok’s two locations in Hong Kong also carry rehyphen\xa0designs.\nThe items range in price from S$10 for a Tweet Tape – cassettes with 140-character greetings – to S$3,900 for a set of three portraits of Michael Jackson, made using the late singer’s old cassettes.\nMusicCloth\xa0has also received critical acclaim, having exhibited at a TEDx event in Johor Bahru last\xa0October\xa0as an “idea worth spreading” as well as\xa0being part of Red Dot 21’s World Of Design.\nA LABOUR OF LOVE\nWeaving MusicCloth\xa0is labour intensive, so Chuan enlists the help of her mum. The pair works from their home in Bukit Panjang. Small items like EZ-Link card backings take around 20 minutes to complete; more complex designs, such as totes, require two to three days’ work. The most elaborate of all are the scarves, which take months to finish.\n“We need time to collect the patterns and match the colours. There\'s\xa0probably about five or six different shades of brown. And then, there’s the end tape. Mostly, they come in white, but sometimes, they come in neon pink, neon blue or neon yellow,” said Chuan.\nTo supplement her income – she earns about S$2,000 a month from wholesaling to Kapok, her biggest retail customer – Chuan conducts workshops for corporate companies and government bodies. Past clients include the Aliwal Arts Centre, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR), Singapore Art Museum (SAM) and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).\nChuan also runs a Ready, Cassette, Go! workshop for Airbnb Experiences, charging S$68 per person for a two-hour session. So far, the response has been positive, with a 4.93/5 rating from 29 reviews.\nBECOMING A FRIEND OF CORUM\nOn Aug 16, Chuan added another feather to her cap when luxury Swiss watch label Corum officially announced her as a Friend Of The Brand.\xa0“What she’s doing is so unique, and we’re about crafting your dreams, so we thought we could be a pillar of support for her,” Corum Marketing Manager Selina Ang told CNA Lifestyle.\nIn line with the brand\'s support for women entrepreneurs like Chuan, Corum is also the official timepiece for the Women Entrepreneur Awards (WEA), having invested\xa0a five-figure sum in the initiative, and sponsoring\xa0four timepieces for the winners.\nWould Corum feature\xa0MusicCloth in a future watch collaboration? Already, Chuan sports\xa0a\xa0Bubble 47 Mona Lisa at public events and on her social media platforms.\xa0“Selfishly, yes! We could do a musician (themed) collection. Music connects people, regardless of who you are or where you are,"" said Ang.\nThe Bubble 47 Mona Lisa\xa0has a dial designed by Italian-Canadian artist Elisabetta Fantone.

      Wanted: Singapore talent for Italian jewellery design and production atelier
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you are a budding jewellery designer or artisan with a taste for the high-end, there are not many workshops in Singapore where you can hone your craft.\nDanilo Giannoni is hoping to change that. The 47-year-old Italian national, who is married to a Singaporean, has been in the jewellery business for 30 years.\nHe first learned the ropes from master craftsmen in Valenza – the goldsmithing capital of Italy – before working with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Bvlgari, Damiani, Crivelli, Luca Carati and Leo Pizzo.\nWhen he relocated\xa0here from Hong Kong in 2016, he realised that there was a lack of upscale jewellery design and production ateliers locally. So, together with a business partner, he set up Arte Oro last year. The name means ""the art of gold""\xa0in Italian.\nThe 110 sq m facility in Jalan Kilang Timor now employs two craftsmen who use traditional techniques of jewellery making, as well as a designer who works with 3D printing and prototyping. All three are Singaporean.\nTogether with Giannoni, they conduct R&D as well as produce bespoke and/or custom pieces, such as wedding rings and tennis bracelets. They also perform restoration, resizing, repair, and repurposing\xa0old jewellery into new pieces. Customers include society ladies and entertainment personalities.\nGiannoni will be hiring two more jewellers by the end of September, but he told CNA Lifestyle that ""it is challenging to find craftsmen in Singapore”. He also runs a 45-man workshop in Valenza that handles larger orders, such as wedding sets for Saudi royals.\nAnd while it would be easy to parachute Italian craftsmen into Singapore, that is not Giannoni’s intention. He wants\xa0to find and groom young talents in Singapore, to give them the opportunities he had when he was younger.\n“We want to promote \'Made in Singapore\'. My wife is Singaporean, my kids are Singaporean. I want to leave a legacy that maybe my kids would like to continue when I retire.""\xa0Giannoni has a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son.\nAs for why he waited a year before announcing Arte Oro publicly, Giannoni said: “We wanted to be sure we were ready. In this industry, when clients give you a chance, you need to deliver. So we took our time. We’re not in a hurry. We’re here to stay.”\nOne of the things that Giannoni spent a lot of time on was ensuring the legitimacy of the supply chain. With ethical gem sourcing being a key concern, he personally travelled to the mines and met with the suppliers.\nThe company is also working towards using blockchain technology to track gemstones from mining to certification and after-sales. This is to assure clients that the precious stones used in their jewellery are procured from sustainable sources.\nIt is an ongoing process, just like Giannoni’s search for local craftsmen.\n“We were very low-key, but now we’ve decided to be (more) visible because we’re interested in developing the skills of artisans in Singapore. With this visibility, (hopefully) someone who wants to work with us will approach us,” he said.\nwww.arteoro.com.sg\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     luxury ', '     jewellery ', '     fashion ']}"

      Why Asia’s Next Top Model host, Cindy Bishop, says #DontTellMeHowToDress
  </h1>, 'text': 'Cindy Bishop is a model, mother and, more importantly, a supporter of women’s rights in Asia. The 39-year-old Thai-American model, who took home the Miss Thailand World title in 1996 and subsequently represented Thailand in the Miss World competition, started a campaign titled #DontTellMeHowToDress in June this year.\nThe movement\'s purpose is spelt out in its name — it aims to stop the thinking that all women must dress appropriately to avoid sexual harassment. “The main cause of sexual assault isn’t from the way a woman dresses or how she behaves,” says Bishop. “[It stems] from a sense of male entitlement, and [how perpetrators typically get away scot-free, looking at] the percentage of them who never have to face any justice, based on a comprehensive study from the UN women.”\nShe also learned from the Trial of Rape study in Thailand and Vietnam conducted by UN Women that an alarming 91 per cent of victims said they knew their attackers. But in reality, many of these victims never spoke up. That’s why Bishop partnered UN Women in June and July 2018 to organise an exhibition titled #DontTellMeHowToDress — Social Power Exhibition Against Sexual Assault.\n“This is to [promote]\xa0public awareness on this issue, and hopefully find ways to reduce both the culture of victim-blaming as well as encouraging victims to speak up and seek justice,” explains Bishop.\xa0\nThis month, Bishop will be back on our television screens as the host of Asia’s Next Top Model, which is into its sixth season. Ahead of the premiere on 22 August 2018, we spoke with her about empowering models, facing roadblocks and recommending the best places to visit in Thailand.\nHow has the modelling world evolved in the past decade?\nCindy Bishop (CB):\xa0Perhaps the most obvious difference is that everything is much more fast-paced and short-lived. Not just the actual production process, which is now all digital, but the length and nature of advertising campaigns are both much shorter and change frequently. As with almost every industry, knowing how to navigate this fast-paced industry can be a challenge.\nThe rise and influence of social media has greatly changed the modelling scene. Not only are there more opportunities for a model to be discovered, there are so many channels for him or her to establish their own brand, and use that to their advantage.\xa0\nThese days, modelling is not just about looks and performance on stage or in front of a camera — it is just as important to be able to represent who you are as a person, what you stand for and how you wish to be represented. In a way, this increases available opportunities, as well as competition, for an upcoming model. The important thing is how to differentiate yourself in a social media-saturated market; how to be unique and memorable.\nWhat is it like being a Thai-American model in the Asian\xa0fashion industry? Did you face any roadblocks?\nCB:\xa0When I first started out, I was told I looked too “farang” or Caucasian. I remember always having to wear brown-coloured contact lenses for my ad campaigns and shoots.\nThere was a period of time when the trend was more Asian and ethnic and I felt I didn\'t really fit any of the looks they wanted. However, my confidence and versatility on the catwalk seemed to help, and soon I started to make a name for myself.\nI believe it’s important for an upcoming model to realise that in this industry, there will always be someone saying you are not what they are looking for, or that you do not fit the “trend” of the moment.\nWhat can be done to empower models in their jobs?\nCB:\xa0I would recommend really taking some time to envision where you see yourself in the industry and what kind of model you want to become. There are so many areas that you can explore, from edgy-editorial to more lifestyle or commercial. I\'m not saying to just limit yourself to any one; however, it’s good to create your own unique brand if you can — and to bring an element of your personal identity to your work.\nSetting short-term and long-term career goals is always a good idea to make sure you continue to learn and expand your horizons. The more life experiences and knowledge you have, the better model you can be, because you can use those lessons and draw on those experiences for your craft.\nAnd do take the time to hone your craft as you would with any other career. If you need extra classes for walking or more practice in a certain area, then make time to do so. Also, make personal fitness and health an integral part of your daily routine. Good models are fit and healthy.\xa0\xa0\nWhat’s the heart-breaking moment you’ve had while working as a model?\nCB:\xa0There was one time I was just about to do the cover shot for a magazine, when I received a phone call notifying me that my friend had just passed away. It was the hardest thing to control my emotions till I had finished the shoot. Sometimes you have to power through and get the job done before losing it.\xa0\n""Sometimes you have to power through and get the job done before losing it.""\xa0\xa0\nWhat’s your top tip for posing in front of the camera?\nCB:\xa0Know your best light and angles and try to connect with the camera through your eyes. \xa0\nWhen it comes to beauty, what are some products you’re most obsessed with?\nCB:\xa0They are:\n- Shu Uemura cleansing oil to remove my makeup.\n- Philip B Peppermint Avocado Shampoo and Forever Shine Conditioner. I love how my scalp feels after using the shampoo. Great for stripping all the product build-up!\n- La Mer Moisture Soft Lotion. I love, love, love this one!\n- Lucas Papaw Ointment for my chapped lips and cuticles. I carry a tube with me at all times.\nWhat three must-dos would your recommend to travellers in Thailand?\nCB: Take a canal tour in Bangkok, with a stop at Bangkok Artist House to watch the traditional puppet show and enjoy a bowl of beef boat noodles.\nRailay Beach in Krabi is a haven for backpackers, rock climbers and pleasure seekers (make sure you climb the giant cave for some stunning views overlooking the bay).\nEnjoy a traditional Northern Thai dinner at Thai Lao Yeh restaurant at the Cabochon Hotel, followed by drinks and dancing at Sing Sing Theater which is just down the road.\xa0\nLastly, describe your typical work outfit.\nCB:\xa0Jeans, T-shirt, a jacket and sneakers.\nAsia’s Next Top Model, Season 6, premieres 22 August 2018, 9pm, on FOX Life, Singtel TV channel 301 and StarHub TV channel 501.\n', 'related_topics': ['     fashion ']}"

      Men: Clothes and shoes in stores don't seem to fit? Here's the solution
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: They say clothes maketh man. But what do you do if they aren’t maketh properly for you?\nWhile everyone knows that a good suit and a good pair of shoes are essential in a gentleman’s wardrobe, it can sometimes be a challenge finding the perfect fit – especially if your physique isn\'t exactly model sample size.\nIf you’re a serial sloucher, tall and skinny, have\xa0love handles, are flat-footed or have one foot larger than the other, chances are,\xa0you\xa0probably had to make do with off-the-rack\xa0offerings in stores. Which means you\'re not looking the best you actually can.\nConsider taking the\xa0made-to-measure or bespoke route.\xa0\nTo find out about the bespoke options available for men who may be a little odd-sized, CNA Lifestyle spoke with tailor Ryan Timothy Tay and shoemaker Joshua Leong, the men\xa0behind Seamless Bespoke, a local retailer at Circular Road that specialises in quality bespoke and made-to-measure menswear and footwear.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bCOMMON ODD-SIZE ISSUES\nHere’s the thing:\xa0The majority of men\xa0have\xa0asymmetrical bodies anyway. Even gym rats – who may consider themselves the perfect human specimen\xa0– are technically odd-shaped\xa0with their broad shoulders, wide\xa0chests, and too-narrow waists.\nAnd if they tend to skip leg day, well, you\'re looking at a pretty odd-shaped man.\nThere is also one issue that’s common amongst most people – even if we don’t notice it. “Around 80 per cent to 90 per cent of people have sloping\xa0shoulders,” said Tay. He explained that\xa0it\xa0is the result of\xa0being either right- or left-handed.\nWhen it comes to feet, Leong pointed out that having one foot smaller than the other is also quite common.\xa0""I would say 30 per cent of our customers have asymmetrical feet,"" he said.\nAccording to Leong, the typical Asian foot also tends to have a low instep (the\xa0top part of your foot) and is\xa0wider and more flat-footed than the typical Caucasian or\xa0European foot\xa0– which most shoes are made for.\nWHY THESE ISSUES ARE PROBLEMATIC\nBecause ready-to-wear suits, shirts and shoes are made symmetrically, what you buy off the rack or shelf will never fit right.\nFor instance, tall men might grapple with sleeves that are too short for them, big dudes might compromise on sleeve length for something that fits the\xa0torso,\xa0and even the athletic types may look chunky in an off-the-rack suit.\xa0Sloping shoulders also result in a bit of a crease in the lower shoulder – which you can’t un-see once you’ve seen it, Tay pointed out.\nWhen it comes to odd-sized feet, you have\xa0no choice but to buy the\xa0size that fits the bigger foot, which leaves you with\xa0one shoe that is a bit too loose.\xa0\nThose with flat feet don\'t have it easy either. These men\xa0often have to wear custom orthopaedic insoles, which makes it hard to buy off-the-shelf shoes, said Leong.\nBESPOKE OR OFF-THE-RACK?\nIf you aren\'t too odd-sized,\xa0Tay said that alterations can make ready-to-wear purchases work around 90 per cent of the time.\nWhen it comes to shirts,\xa0the cuts change depending on different seasons. You might find that the shirts from\xa0a certain brand are\xa0your go-to but after a few months, they don\'t fit like they\xa0used to, said Tay. In this case, you might want to consider made-to-measure or bespoke options.\nFor footwear, Leong said that the majority of men\xa0can get by with off-the-shelf shoes. To shop smarter,\xa0he suggested asking the retail staff if you can\xa0try\xa0on shoes made from the different lasts\xa0that the\xa0brand uses. The last\xa0is the mould on which the shoe is made, and it\xa0determines the fit.\n“It doesn’t matter if you’ve got 20, 30 or\xa040 designs. If the\xa0shoes are\xa0made based on\xa0one last, they\xa0will not\xa0fit properly,” he said. “If the retail staff doesn’t know what a last is, they’ve missed out the most important thing when it comes to the fitting process.”\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MADE-TO-MEASURE AND\xa0BESPOKE\nBoth involve a great degree of personalisation. In a nutshell, made-to-measure involves making a few choice tweaks to a baseline by the tailor, while bespoke\xa0is the ultimate made-from-scratch option.\n“If you have a made-to-measure shirt and your waist is cut to 36 inches, that shirt will measure\xa018 inches in front and 18 inches at the back,” said Tay.\xa0\n“For a bespoke shirt, your front panel may have 2.5 inches more than the back to accommodate the width of your chest. It’s still 36 inches in total but the proportions are fully accounted for.”\nIt’s more or less the same when it comes to shoes. Made-to-measure shoes are done with an existing shoe last, with the shoemaker adding a couple more centimetres here, and widening it a bit there. A bespoke shoe, on the other hand,\xa0begins with a blank last that is\xa0shaved down or bulked up based on your specific measurements.\nOTHER ADVANTAGES OF GOING CUSTOMISED\nAside from the fact that you’re wearing clothes and shoes that fit you to a tee, you’re talking about quality products – these are generally made to last longer.\nFor suits, it is\xa0due to the quality of the fabric and the construction techniques used. “Ready-to-wear and high fashion brands sometimes don’t focus much on fabric. It’s simply about looking at different colours, whether it’s a black\xa0or\xa0navy\xa0suit,” said Tay.\nHe added that instead of the more labourious process of handstitching the fabric layers together, many ready-to-wear brands “fuse” these with glue, which can come apart due to moisture and heat, resulting in the “bubbling” one sees in an older jacket.\nAs for shoes, Leong said off-the-shelf options are often not designed to be resoled.\xa0Sometimes, the leather used doesn’t even last long enough for you to have a chance to resole them, he said.\nLeong recalled an incident during his shoemaking apprenticeship in Italy.\xa0A customer had brought in a pair of shoes\xa0that was almost 20 years old and had already been resoled twice. “The shoe uppers were still in perfect condition and we resoled it for the third time. They looked brand new,” he said.\nBoth Leong and Tay point out another overlooked advantage in considering made-to-measure or bespoke: You get to know more about your body.\n“The tailor or shoemaker is\xa0giving you advice, telling you things you never knew about your own body or feet,” said Leong. “You leave the shop with more than just a suit or shoes.\xa0When you step into another store, for example, you’d know you have a high instep and can ask for off-the-shelf options with a high instep.”\nAdded Tay: “By\xa0going\xa0to a tailor, you learn a bit more about your physique and realise you can look better.”\nWHAT TO GET\nIf you’re considering getting a bespoke or made-to-measure suit, Tay suggested\xa0going for a navy suit for its versatility.\xa0“The first suit people go for is a black one.\xa0But in classical tailoring, that’s only meant for black tie events or funerals.”\nAs for shoes, Leong suggested\xa0the ever-reliable black cap-toe Oxfords. “If you want to get as many wears out of that first good pair, it’s the most versatile.\xa0You can use it for work, formal occasions and even get married in it. You will never looked underdressed in any situation.”\nWHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO PAY\nIt depends on\xa0where you\'re getting your suit or shoes customised. At Seamless Bespoke, a made-to-measure suit costs around S$850, while a full bespoke one starts at S$3,000. They don’t make made-to-measure shoes but a full bespoke pair starts at S$4,900.\n“It’s about understanding how\xa0good the fit\xa0can be,"" said Leong. Then, depending on your\xa0budget, you\xa0can\xa0see if you\xa0can find something that can get you\xa0a fit that’s as close as possible without busting the bank.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     style ', '     fashion ', '     Men ']}"

      What are calendar watches?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Counting the days with a calendar isn’t easy. Although our calendar marks complete days, the actual length of time the earth takes to revolve around the sun isn’t some convenient whole number, whether measured in hours or days. This difference accumulates over time and causes a divergence that necessitates occasional correction. As if that’s not enough, the modern Gregorian calendar that we use is the result of numerous revisions over the course of history. Case in point: August has 31 days simply because Julius Caesar wanted it to, as several of his achievements took place in that month.\nThe quirks of the Gregorian calendar begin with the uneven lengths of months – seven of them have 31 days, four have 30 days, and February alone has just 28 days. Leap years come next. On leap years, February has an extra 29th day, called the leap day. Contrary to popular belief, leap years don’t occur regularly either. Although a leap year generally occurs every four years, a year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year, unless it’s also divisible by 400. So, neither 1800 nor 1900 was a leap year, although 2000 was; looking ahead, 2100 will not be a leap year.\nKeeping track of the day and date is critical to society’s functioning, so one will expect watches to be capable of doing so besides telling the time. Indeed, the calendar complication is ubiquitous today, and modern timepieces are more likely than not to come with them, simply for convenience’s sake. Not all calendar complications are created equal though – the more accurate ones will obviously require fewer corrections over a year, but end up being more mechanically complex and costly.\nTHE SIMPLE CALENDAR\nThe simple calendar is the most basic form of the calendar complication, and is found in almost all quartz and most mechanical watches today. Its mechanism is straightforward – a wheel draws energy from the watch’s main gear train, and releases this energy to advance a disc (or hand) once a day at midnight. Because the simple calendar cannot account for the differing lengths of the months, it must be manually corrected by the wearer at the end of every “short” month with less than 31 days. Advancing the display to the 1st of the following month is thus done five times a year.\nTHE ANNUAL CALENDAR\nThe annual calendar improves on the simple calendar by requiring an adjustment just once every year, which also explains its name. At the heart of this improved mechanism is a cam with 12 notches of differing depths that correspond to the months of the year. Essentially, this cam stores the mechanical “programme” that a component called the finger “reads” to advance the dates correctly. Regular months with 31 days have shallower notches, so the date is advanced just once, from the 31st to the 1st. The short months with 30 days, however, have deeper notches that cause the finger to advance the date twice, from the 30th to the 1st, thus requiring no adjustments by the wearer. As the annual calendar cannot account for February’s extra short (and variable) length, the complication must be manually corrected every February.\nTHE PERPETUAL CALENDAR\nThe perpetual calendar sits at the top of the pecking order, by being able to account for both the differing lengths of the months, as well as leap years and their effect on February’s length. It is, however, exponentially more complex compared to the annual calendar, as an entire system of cams, wheels, pawls and levers is involved. Because of this, the perpetual calendar is considered a high complication – a complication that’s significantly more difficult to execute given its mechanical complexity. The end result however, is quite a marvel to behold: Assuming that the watch is kept running, the date will only require a manual correction in 2100, when the mechanism is unable to account for the lack of a leap day in February. Considering the average human lifespan, this is practically forever, hence its name. (In practical terms, however, mechanical watches require servicing every five to 10 years, so the calendar displays will be reset by the watchmaker anyway.)\nNUMBER OF DISPLAYS VERSUS COMPLEXITY\nIt is important to note that the astronomical information displayed on a watch does not necessarily correspond to its calendar’s complexity. Although the annual calendar tends to indicate the day and month, and the perpetual calendar tends to also have the year (and leap year) on display, there are watches that buck this trend. The triple/complete calendar, for instance, displays the day, date, and month, but is at its heart is a simple calendar that still requires manual adjustments at the end of every short month.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     timepieces ', '     fashion ']}"

      Everything you need to know about chronographs
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After the simple date display, the chronograph is probably the most common complication among watches out there. Essentially a stopwatch that’s integrated into a timepiece, the modern chronograph was invented by Louis Moinet in 1816, but took over a century to evolve into its present form(s). Be careful not to confuse the chronograph with the chronometer – the former is the complication being discussed here, while the latter refers to highly accurate watches that have passed certain criteria for timekeeping precision.\nCHRONOGRAPH BASICS\nThe typical chronograph is a series of wheels, levers, and other such components that are arranged to form a separate gear train which “branches off” from the main one. When activated, this second, parallel gear train draws energy from the main “chain” to drive its own independent set of hands and measure elapsed time. This independence is important – the chronograph’s ability to be started, stopped, and reset is what makes it so useful.\nThe chronograph’s seemingly straightforward function of measuring elapsed time belies its complexity. Watchmakers such as Kari Voutilainen have commented that it is actually more difficult to assemble than a tourbillon, the typical example of high watchmaking. The challenge lies in the adjustments necessary – separate chains of events are occurring in the watch movement simultaneously each time the chronograph’s pushers are actuated, and these can only happen smoothly with proper assembly.\nACTIVATION AND TRANSMISSION\nChronographs are defined by two important technical features: The actuation mechanism, and the coupling mechanism.\nThe actuation mechanism determines how a chronograph is started and stopped. Think of it as the on/off switch, if you will. The two main variants of this category today are cam actuation, and the column wheel. A cam actuation system engages the chronograph mechanism by moving a series of levers and cams horizontally when the pusher is depressed. The column wheel, on the other hand, is a component that’s shaped like a castle turret. Pressing the pusher causes the column wheel to rotate, and a little “finger” is alternatingly lifted and lowered to achieve the same effect.\nNaturally, each mechanism has its pros and cons. The column wheel offers better tactility, and feels smoother and more consistent to actuate, much like a good rifle trigger. It is, however, more expensive to produce and assemble. Cam actuation, on the other hand, tends to have more play – the pushers may feel “sticky” or require different amounts of force to start and stop. It is far easier to produce and more robust though.\nThe coupling mechanism, meanwhile, is like the transmission mechanism of a car, and refers to how the chronograph siphons energy from the “main” movement. Again, two main variants exist today. The horizontal clutch’s action takes place within a single horizontal plane – when the chronograph is activated, wheels are meshed together to transmit energy. Such a design is more aesthetically pleasing, but the initial contact tends to cause the chronograph seconds hand to jerk and/or stutter, in what’s commonly known as flutter. The vertical clutch, on the other hand, pushes two coaxial wheels against each other vertically, and uses friction to keep them turning in tandem. Although there’s no flutter with this design, it is more difficult to pull off due to the greater number of factors that must be accounted for, such as lubrication and surface finishing.\nCHRONOGRAPH VARIANTS\nChronographs come in various levels of complexity. The most basic is the simple chronograph, which is controlled with two pushers – one starts and stops the complication, while the other resets it. The beauty here lies in its ability to time consecutive events – after the chronograph is stopped, it can simply be started again, to continue measuring cumulative time.\nThe flyback chronograph behaves exactly like the simple chronograph, but can also be reset without first stopping it. Actuating the reset pusher while the chronograph is running simply causes all the hands to fly back to zero, then continue moving without any lag. For pilots who used chronographs to time their flight patterns in the past, this was an invaluable tool, as the new leg of a navigation pattern could be measured without accurately.\nThe next step up is the rattrapante chronograph, also known as the split seconds chronograph. This variation gains an additional chronograph seconds hand – the rattrapante hand – and an extra pusher to control it. During normal operation, the two chronograph seconds hands move in tandem. Actuating the third pusher, however, stops the rattrapante hand to allow an intermediate time to be read and recorded. Pressing the third pusher again sends the rattrapante hand flying back under the main chronograph seconds hand, to move together again. In terms of complexity, the rattranpante chronograph is a significant step up – its movement architecture demands an additional cam or column wheel, with one other shorter, parallel gear train for the rattrapante hand. Higher part count aside, assembly also becomes exponentially more difficult given the adjustments required.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     timepieces ', '     fashion ']}"

      Beyond cosplay: Hanfugirl explores ancient Chinese history through fashion
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: In May 2015, Gong Pan Pan and her husband flew to Beijing for their wedding photoshoot. For one of the sessions, they went to a studio to dress up in costumes from different periods in Chinese history – and she was promptly hooked.\n“It was the first time I had taken a proper photoshoot and I thought it was so nice. So I researched a bit more and found out there was this whole new world of hanfu in China, where people would argue about whether they were authentic enough. And I realised it wasn’t just about looking pretty,” she said.\nLOVE AFFAIR WITH HANFU\nFor the 31-year-old Singaporean, that brief cosplay moment was the start of an ongoing love affair with hanfu, the traditional clothing of the Han Chinese, and the history woven into these.\nKeen to find out more about these fancy clothes from the past, she began buying books on the history of Chinese fashion.\nShe started shopping, too. Today, she has around 50 sets of clothing, all bought from online shopping site Taobao. Her collection ranges from styles that date back to the Han Dynasty to as recent as China in the 1920s and 1930s.\nUnder the moniker Hanfugirl, she has been creating photographs of her and her friends dressed up in these clothes, which she posts on Facebook and Instagram.\nAnd she is now taking her personal hobby to the next level. Gong, who is a public servant working in a museum, is presenting a fashion show on Saturday afternoon (Sep 30) at the Esplanade Concourse, under the arts centre’s Moonfest event.\nTitled Before Cheongsam: 2,000 Years of Chinese Fashion, it features 20 pieces from her collection, which will be worn by friends. A small adjacent exhibition, which runs until Oct 4, will also feature five other pieces and photographic works.\nFor the artist and Han culture enthusiast, fashion has been a great way of breaking through the often confusing jumble of names, dates and trivia.\n“I never studied Chinese history before and my background was more of fine arts and English literature, so it really helped to open up this world to me,” said Gong, who was born in China but moved to Singapore at the age of seven.\nShe added: “That’s why I try to make my pictures pretty. When people see the photos, hopefully they’ll go: ‘Oh, they look pretty; I want to know more about this.’ That’s how I started to learn about Chinese history – because I saw a pretty dress.”\nA ONE-WOMAN SHOW\nBarring the occasional outdoor shoots at Chinese Garden or trips to China, most of her images are created at home.\nThe shoots are done in one corner of her condo, and make-up and dressing up are done in one room. Her dresses – for which she has spent “at least S$10,000” – are stored in another room.\nMost of the time, it’s a one-woman job. “I do the make-up, the hairstyling and the post-production. I would get my friends to take the photos or I would set up my camera and get a friend to snap it for me. Then I would edit the photos,” she said, adding that the process could take one to two hours.\nInitially the photos were all mostly of her, but she later invited friends and work colleagues to dress up as a form of bonding session.\nAs for her moniker, Hanfugirl, it was a friendly retort at her husband, a doctor, who would tease that that what she was doing was nothing compared to Gossip Girl, the TV show.\n“So I got fed up and said I was going to call myself Hanfugirl just to spite him,” she said, with a laugh.\nHer fashion exploits are not limited to just photoshoots for social media – she sometimes dresses up for formal occasions such as weddings and even goes to work in hanfu, minus the elaborate makeup and hairstyle, of course.\nGong added that she and her friends, who also wear hanfu, have occasionally been mistaken for being either Korean or Japanese. She reckons it's likely because people are only familiar with the cheongsam – or qipao – and earlier traditional Chinese attire are unknown to most.\nHANFU IN STAR WARS?\nBut Gong pointed out that the more familiar Chinese dress is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a fashion heritage that stretches back millennia and draws from many different influences.\n“While hanfu generally means that it’s anything that belongs to the Han Chinese, it’s not so clear-cut. The term Chinese is not insular and not a monolith. China has always been connected with its neighbours,” she said.\nShe pointed out how foldable fans, trousers and even belt buckles – which appeared throughout various Chinese dynasties – were all influences from Japan, nomadic tribes and Persia, respectively.\nAnd just as other cultures have made their mark on hanfu fashion in the past, the latter has also been making its mark on contemporary culture without us knowing it.\n“Actually, Queen Amidala from Star Wars seems very much influenced by the Chinese kind of makeup – the two red dots (on her cheekbone) can be from the Han dynasty. And then you’ve got those kinds of makeup on the fashion runways of high-end brands,” she said.\nHigh fashion and space opera movie characters, though, are quite different from everyday wear – but Gong believes it’s a matter of time.\nShe cited a growing hanfu movement in China, with cities holding their own hanfu festivals and even a prominent pop music figure – Jay Chou’s lyricist Vincent Fang – being an active champion of the fashion.\nIn Singapore, though, she admits it’s still very niche. “Even Singaporean Chinese wouldn’t really know or aren’t that interested in traditional Chinese culture these days. But hopefully, through aesthetics, more people will realise it’s really interesting to learn about it.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     fashion ', ""     Women's Voices ""]}"
