      She works in a bank in the day but becomes an expert rattan weaver after-hours
  </h1>, 'text': 'A few weeks back, my wife excitedly told me she discovered someone who could help her fix a broken antique chair that she treasures. It was a gift from her brother-in-law and while not especially functional – it’s a tad delicate – it is quite beautiful.\nShe asked me to bring the chair to the library@Orchard and drop it off with a young woman named Ng Si Ying, who is an expert rattan weaver. She was confident that Si Ying, also known as @atinymaker, would be able to reweave the broken rattan seat.\n\xa0\nSince then, I have been checking out Si Ying’s feed and have learnt more about her. While she works at one of Singapore’s top local banks by day, in her after-hours, she is one of our most interesting young creatives, passionately exploring a craft that she feels hasn’t evolved for generations. She is one of the few young creatives locally specialising in rattan, and definitely one of the very few trying to look for new ways to use the material.\nTELL ME ABOUT GROWING UP. WERE YOU AN ESPECIALLY CREATIVE KID?\nI definitely had a lot of chances to dabble in creative endeavours growing up. My mum used to do a lot of arts and crafts with us at home, and I also took a few years of art classes. I would spend quite a bit of time decorating my school journals and art class homework, and had exceptionally kind teachers who encouraged me to pursue the arts.\nBut at some point, I decided that I didn\'t want nor enjoy being graded for the “art” that I did, and didn\'t pursue it further in school. Perhaps I knew somehow I would go back to it in due time, but I wasn\'t really sure exactly when or in what form.\nIn fact, I actually spent many more years playing competitive netball than anything else. But then again, perhaps creativity isn\'t limited to the arts, and I was learning to be creative through other ways too.\nYOU SEEM TO DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF DESIGN WORK? CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU DO?\nHonestly, I just see myself as a designer. Sometimes I design in 2-D, sometimes in 3-D, sometimes with software, sometimes with rattan or clay, sometimes for different types of people, and sometimes for myself.\nI graduated with a degree as a visual communicator, and then worked as a graphic designer and now a UX designer – perhaps they are but labels that help others identify the mediums of which you are currently designing for. \nProfessionally, I\'m currently a user experience designer at a bank, and I design the digital experiences for banking services.\nAND YOU HAVE THIS WHOLE OTHER PERSONA, THAT OF A RATTAN CRAFTSPERSON. WHERE DID THE LOVE FOR RATTAN COME FROM?\nThe love for rattan was a natural development over time. Initially, I approached rattan solely as a material to study and a potential area of forgotten interest. It was only with deeper interaction with the material and reading that I also realised its beauty and cultural significance. It occurred to me that there was so much more to be explored with this mysterious plant, and even more to be investigated and loved.\nWHAT PROMPTED YOU TO WANT TO LEARN THE CRAFT YOURSELF?\nThe lack of formal materials and guidance forced me to learn it from whatever resources I could get my hands on: YouTube videos in various languages, and any other disciplines that teach weaving or knot tying, and just good ideas that I thought could be translated to rattan.\nWhen I had just graduated, and had some free time on hand, that was when I actually discovered rattan by accident. A good friend of mine wanted to buy some rattan furniture for a new place and I simply tagged along on the adventure and met Uncle and Aunty Zeng who own a rattan shop.\nTo cut the long story short, I went back about two to three times after the first visit, and they finally agreed to teach me. And so began a one-year rattan chair weaving restoration ""lesson""\xa0with them. \nWAS LEARNING THE CRAFT DIFFICULT OR EASY?\nThe interest in rattan grew and developed into a rather investigative one. I wanted to exhaust the material completely, experiment with it, and push its aesthetic, physical and cultural boundaries.\nRattan as a material feels like it has been forgotten and seemingly left behind in the contemporary world. But that is also a double-edged sword. I get to explore and experiment without any baggage, but that also means it\'s been difficult to find a rattan \'teacher\'. I have to learn through whatever materials I can find: \xa0books, YouTube videos, etc.\nNot a lot of my work is just reverse engineering on my own, to learn and understand rattan better. It gets difficult sometimes, but mostly enjoyable. Having many sources of learning points also means having many different teachers — anything and anyone can inspire!\nSOME OF YOUR PIECES ARE REALLY BEAUTIFUL. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE CREATING CRAFTS OR ART PIECES?\nI never really thought of my work as one or the other, I just make things. \nWHAT IS THE HARDEST THING ABOUT RATTAN WEAVING?\nLike every other material, rattan has its own characteristics. Whilst learning from many other disciplines and materials – such as bamboo, paracord weaving, knots, etc – not everything can be adapted to rattan.\nThis might get a little technical but rattan skin, also known as rattan peel, has a front and a back side. And working with them also means that you have to be mindful about the way you twist and turn it. Rattan is highly malleable and thus relatively forgiving, but only up to a certain number of times before it starts to fray and breaks.\nDO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE KEEPING PART OF OUR CULTURE ALIVE?\nWe know rattan as the furniture our grandparents used to sit on, as the punishing cane we feared as kids, and the basketry that we may have for laundry at home. There hasn’t been much exploration into new designs with rattan since. We still use the same pattern for weaving chairs.\nWhat I want to do is to look for new ways to use rattan, to introduce a new aesthetic to break out of what we commonly see. I\'m not sure if that is keeping our culture alive, but I hope to keep rattan alive! And evolve it.\nWHAT DO YOU HOPE TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH THESE WORKS?\nThe work I make is an investigative process. There is no inherent message outside of studying rattan as a material and investigating its process, form and materiality.\nWHAT INSPIRES YOUR WORK? HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO WORK ON?\nI never really know how to answer the question of what inspires me because I am inspired by so many things. It differs from period to period and is constantly changing. As for what to work on, since I make my own ceramic pots, the making sometimes begins there. I may have in mind something I want to test with rattan, so then I plan how to achieve it.\nOther times I just make the pots and then decide after. I also have ongoing projects such as 100 Rattan as Wrap and 100 Rattan as Weave that are solely rattan works to help me further learn and explore the material. I jump around projects all the time.\nARE YOU SELLING WORK? HOW CAN SOMEONE COMMISSION A PIECE AND WHAT KIND OF WORK DO YOU OFFER?\nMy works are for sale upon request. I rarely take on commissions unless it is in line with what I want to explore and/or if it pushes me to do something new. I try to keep to that because I want to enjoy what I make without being tied down by whether it sells.\nAll that being said, if anyone wants to get in touch, they can contact me through my Instagram account, @atinymaker, for any sale/commission requests.\n\xa0\nANY EXCITING PLANS FOR THE YEAR YOU CAN SHARE?\nI\'m currently having an artist residency at the library@Orchard until the end of March 2022, and working on a collaboration piece for the botanical design studio, This Humid House, which will be shown in Paris. There is also a group exhibition piece that I am working on. It\'s good busy-ness, but I\'m hoping to really start on my next 100 project!\nWHAT’S THE DREAM WITH YOUR RATTAN WORK? \nIt\'s a long way to go but I hope to explore deeper into rattan and be someone that understands it. I\'m not sure what might happen in the future, but I\'m enjoying where I am now and I\'ll take a step at a time!\n', 'related_topics': ['     Creative Capital ', '     art ', '     Culture & Trends ', '     Career ']}"

      This Malaysian artist makes small floral sculptures that are both beautiful and strange
  </h1>, 'text': 'The floral sculptural art pieces that dominate Noreen Loh’s Instagram page are hauntingly beautiful. Ethereal, surreal, elegant and fantastical. They capture and hold your attention.\nWhen I first stumbled across this 40-year-old Malaysian artist’s works, I thought that the floral works were her specialty. But as I learned more about her, I realised that she does not have one. Rather, she works across multiple mediums, adopting different styles and producing very different kinds of work. \nWhen Loh told me she began her art journey on a whim while working in the shipping industry, I had to know more. \nWERE YOU CREATIVE IN YOUR YOUTH?\nAccording to Google, a youth is someone between 15 and 24 years old. I came to Singapore when I was 19 but I only got into LASALLE College of the Arts when I was 25 years old. So, I am not sure I fitted the “youth” profile then. Creatively, I wasn’t exposed to a lot of art when I was growing up in Malaysia. But I think my creativity emerged as I got older. \nFunnily, when I was working for a shipping company (she stayed in the industry for four to five years), I did get comments from a colleague that I was more suited for the art and design industry, and that maybe, I should reconsider my choice of vocation. To be honest, I became an artist by accident.BUT YOU WENT TO ART SCHOOL?\nYes, and I’ve only completed my foundation year at LASALLE. One day, on the way to work, I passed by the school and I suddenly had this impulse to go in. Thankfully, I acted on it. \nI alighted at the nearest bus stop and serendipitously, it was their open day. After my visit, I took a leap of faith. I quit my full-time work, applied and got into LASALLE.WERE YOUR PARENTS SUPPORTIVE\xa0OF YOU MAKING THE SWITCH?\nMy dad passed away when I was two years old, so sadly, he wasn’t around when I made the switch. Besides, I was already an adult so really, it is not something\xa0you need your parents’ approval for. \nNevertheless,\xa0my mum loves me and she has been so supportive of\xa0my entire journey. That said, I think she still doesn’t\xa0understand how I make a living as an artist till today.\nHOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR WORK?\nI’m a multi-disciplinary artist, which means I love to explore different subjects and experiment with different mediums to create a wide\xa0body of work. \nFor example, if I were given a specific tool, I can produce\xa0many different results even though I’m drawing the same thing.HOW WOULD YOU SAY YOUR WORK HAS EVOLVED\xa0OVER THE LAST DECADE?\nAfter my foundation year, I deferred my studies to pursue a jewellery design course. However, it was cancelled two weeks before class even commenced. \nWhile waiting for the course to resume, I went job\xa0hunting and stumbled upon a creative assistant\xa0job at a floral shop. I ended up spending three years there. \nRight before I quit that job, and inspired by what I was doing, I created my first series of artwork (Beauty & the Beast) using fresh\xa0flowers as the medium. This artwork was created in 2009.\nWhen I went back to flowers as a subject again\xa0at a later date, I decided to create a floral sculpture\xa0instead. (It is part of the series, The Marriage, which features Lamitek laminates.)\nI was grateful that the years of being a florist, and the research\xa0and time I spent experimenting with flowers and foliage\xa0gave me lots of resources and an in-depth knowledge that allowed me to make something entirely new with this medium.\xa0That artwork was created in 2015.\nIt is actually difficult\xa0for me\xa0to explain how my work has evolved but I hope that this is a good example\xa0on how my work has transitioned\xa0through the years, even with the same subject matter.\nHAS THERE BEEN A DEFINING MOMENT FOR YOU SO FAR IN THE LAST 10 YEARS OF PRACTICE?\nThis year will be that defining moment. I’m revisiting my approach in making art.\nWHAT BROUGHT YOU TO SINGAPORE TO BEGIN WITH?\nMoving to Singapore is just something that many Malaysians think about. For many of us, growing up, we long to see the rest of the world. Greener pastures, you know?\nThankfully, given the profession I have chosen, it’s good to be here. The art scene and support in Singapore are definitely\xa0much better than back home.\nDO YOU FEEL ENOUGH LOCAL PEOPLE APPRECIATE\xa0AND SUPPORT THE ARTS HERE?\nI would say just enough to make a living. But you need to be a very hardworking artist to survive. It can be really tough.\nWHAT INSPIRES YOU AND YOUR WORK?\nSometimes, it is the material; sometimes, it is the subject. Ultimately, it’s the process. I spend a lot of time experimenting. It’s these experimentations that really contribute\xa0to the final work.\nYOU DABBLE ACROSS MANY MEDIUMS BUT IS THERE ONE YOU ENJOY THE MOST?\nI hate to stick to just one! Honestly, I do not have a preference. I feel stagnant and unmotivated if I keep doing the same thing over and over again without a breakthrough. Using different mediums challenges me\xa0and gets my mind going. And that is why I want to make art in the\xa0first place. I have so many ideas and thoughts that I want to translate them into tangible creations.\nWHERE CAN WE PURCHASE YOUR WORK IF INTERESTED?Most of my artwork is commission-based or project-based, so you can email me. But when I’m free to create personal works, I update my website, which my husband has created.\nWHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON THAT WE SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR IN 2022?\nI’ve recently unveiled a show called 36 x miun. It is a collaboration that was launched late last year. I worked with 8 Storytree to create 35mm films that have been pre-exposed with the eye illustrations I have done. You can buy the film from 8Storytree to make your own artworks.\nI am also working on something really personal this year. Can’t say more right now. Stay tuned.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Creative Capital ', '     art ', '     Culture & Trends ', '     Career ']}"

      IN FOCUS: Opportunities and risks? Singapore creators ride NFT wave as new source of income
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When 29-year-old Hafiiz Karim, known as The Next Most Famous Artist, first heard of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the jargon alone was enough to make him switch off.\nHe hadn’t imagined then that the concept would\xa0help him sell more than 100 pieces of art worth more than US$100,000\xa0– all in a day.\nIt’s a far cry from the S$1,000 he earned on average each month selling physical prints of his digital work, best known for placing classical art characters in familiar Singaporean settings.\nNFTs are one-of-a-kind digital tokens that most commonly take the form of art, music or collectibles. But they can digitally represent any asset, even real-life ones such as real estate.\nAt its heart -\xa0a proof of ownership that cannot be replicated, as it is secured and verified by blockchain technology.\nHe discovered the concept after an online art community touted it as the “next big thing” for digital artists. So far, this has rung true for him.\nMore than a year since he started selling his art this way, Mr Hafiiz has sold more than 200 NFTs worth about US$150,000. The logistics are also easier than for traditional sales, as digital transactions mean he no longer has to labour over printing and delivery.\nWhen someone resells one of his creations, he also gets a cut – previously unheard of in conventional art sales.\nYet the most valuable thing has been finding tribes of his own. “I\'m a part of a few (artist) communities and we all support each other.”\n“And the community with my followers … I give back to them, engage with them, they support me. It’s like a mini ecosystem,” he said.\nMr Hafiiz is part of a growing number of Singaporean creators who have entered the\xa0NFT space – and have found it rewarding in various ways.\nMass interest in crypto art was ignited in March last year when artist Beeple sold an NFT for an eye-watering US$69 million.\nThe hunger for such assets has exploded since then, with NFT sales volumes\xa0skyrocketing to US$25\xa0billion in 2021, compared to US$95 million in 2020.\nA plethora of players has joined in the action too, with luxury fashion brands, newspapers and even celebrities minting their own NFTs.\nDrawn by the medium’s novelty and its seeming viability as a source of income in a country where art is often judged as a precarious career, more local creators are choosing to give NFTs a shot.\nAn online art community founded in Singapore, NFTAsia, has grown to more than 3,300 members in the span of a few months,\xa0including people from other countries, said one of its founding members Jonathan Liu.\n“There is definitely an increase (in NFT artists in Singapore) … but slowly, because there’s still a high barrier of entry with needing to understand the background of blockchain and cryptocurrency.”\nThose who overcome these barriers claim that NFTs are upending the creative world, such as by allowing any work to be tokenised.\nThat includes things that are “not usually associated with being art” such as programme code, said Mr Liu.\n“Game designers, spatial architects, people who work with cinema 4D, new technology softwares now have an audience,” added the visual artist and lecturer at LASALLE College of the Arts.\nWithout gatekeepers to what constitutes art, it also “democratises” creativity, said Mr Hafiiz. Other benefits include provenance – you can verify a piece’s authenticity as it is tied to the creator.\nReceiving post-sale royalties also helps artists get more out of the value chain.\nEvery time an NFT is resold, the creator automatically gets a portion of the sale price – typically ranging between zero and\xa010 per cent.\nThis is a huge boon in addition to being able to track your work, said prominent local artist, Farizwan Fajari, known as Speak Cryptic.\n“If you sell the old or traditional way, maybe you get a cut from the gallery and you probably will never see it again. With NFTs, you know where the work is, you know who has it, you know how much it’s being sold for on the secondary market and it’s more transparent.”\nWhen he first dabbled in NFTs in March out of curiosity, decrypting the jargon was a mammoth\xa0task. But a day after creating his first NFT, it sold for 0.7 ETH, worth US$1,600 at that point.\n“(It wasn’t a lot) but it felt like something! Especially in that moment, where because of the pandemic, jobs were being cancelled and so on.”\nIt was initially hard to wrap his head around the concept because it just felt like “computer money”.\n“But when it (showed up in my bank account), I was like: ‘Oh, this is real money and this is something that I could use to put back into my practice and to potentially also put food on the table.\'”\nNFT sales now make up about a quarter of his projected income each month, with the rest coming from “more traditional art jobs”, such as commissioned murals, installations, workshops.\nFor others, it has become a viable living, he said. “(Some people I met a while ago) were trying to find a balance between their nine-to-five\xa0jobs and trying to be an artist. Now, a percentage of them have already made that jump.\n“NFTs have made it possible for artists to just do what they want to do,” he said, though he cautioned that there are still risks in committing oneself fully to such a new realm.\nAs NFTs become more mainstream, others are also exploring how they can help social causes.\nSpeaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin has had a few of his landscape photographs sold as NFTs, raising more than S$54,000 for the National Gallery and about S$50,000 for the NTUC U-Care Fund.\n""When you go online, it’s a global market. Anyone can (contribute), anyone who feels it’s a cause they’re prepared to support,"" he told CNA. And if the NFT is resold, the royalties can be another\xa0income stream for the charity, he said.\n“That’s not bad, I suppose, if you’re raising money for social causes and if that could be part of the landscape that they could tap on.”\nBut he said this was not “an endorsement” of NFTs.\n“With all these new platforms, for every individual, the caveat is you really need to know what you’re doing. If you’re not comfortable with it, don’t get near it. As you can see from cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, it is very volatile.""\nBeyond creators, more Singapore buyers are looking to get in on the NFT action too.\nAccording to NFT marketplace Mintable, which is headquartered here, the number of site visitors from Singapore grew from 0.72 per cent in September to 1.09 per cent in December last year.\n“A small increase, but it means thousands of Singaporeans every month are coming into blockchain and NFTs,” said its CEO and founder\xa0Zach Burks, adding that the site gets five to ten million monthly visitors.\nA\xa0report from comparison site Finder last November also showed that 6.8 per cent of Singaporean Internet users polled own NFTs. Another 11 per cent said\xa0they plan to acquire some – which is a “conservative forecast” given fast-growing awareness, said the team.\nThe burgeoning interest in NFTs rides on a “strong gaming culture” here and a growing acceptance that “digital goods are of genuine value”, said Mr Patrick Tan, CEO and general counsel for digital asset management\xa0firm Novum Alpha.\nSceptics may struggle to understand why some may pay eye-popping amounts for intangible items that can be viewed and shared online for free.\nIndeed, some of the most popular collectible NFTs, such as CryptoPunks or Bored Apes Yacht Club, which are launched in limited numbers, can trade for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nFor some, it comes down to the pride of ownership, said Mr Tan.\n“The whole human desire to own something, to the exclusion of others, is something that’s built into our DNA,"" he said.\n“If I get something that is scarce, I\'m somehow superior to others. That goes to the heart of it.""\nHe added: “It’s like a baseball card – it’s just a piece of cardboard, right? … But to the buyer, there is tremendous (intangible) value.”\nLike art collectors, some may also purchase NFTs because they simply appreciate their aesthetic qualities, he said.\nOwning these also signals membership to an exclusive community, which sometimes includes the rich and famous, such as television host Jimmy Fallon or basketball star Shaquille O’Neal.\nIn the gaming world, NFTs can also represent special items, such as skins or weapons, that are earned by players who then sell or rent them to others. This is a rapidly-growing industry in other Southeast Asian economies.\nBut for some NFT collectible buyers, the motivation is simple -\xa0to “flip” them for a profit.\nThis is the case for one buyer, who only wanted to be known as Ms Yong. The civil servant in her mid-20s has spent S$10,000 on NFTs on blockchains such as Ethereum and Terra in the past six months.\nOne purchase was because she genuinely liked the art and it wasn’t too expensive to collect.\nBut the others were for profit potential. To gauge if an NFT will appreciate in value, Ms Yong said: “What I take into consideration is the potential of the roadmap, the hype of the NFT, the utility.”\nThe “utility” refers to perks such as access to digital or in-person events, or even free subsequent NFTs.\n“Roadmaps” are the creators’ long-term plans for the token and its value. Creators often have to seek out their own buyers, drumming up business through platforms such as Twitter or creating communities through Discord servers.\n“I try to mint more than one, then I’ll flip one and keep one more for the utility,” added Ms Yong.\nDetractors have criticised the pervasive speculative buying in the NFT world, warning that valuations are unfounded and the frenzy is a bubble waiting to burst.\nThe digital gold rush has also drawn no shortage of junk projects.\n“It’s quite clear when you see the team’s roadmap. We call it a cash grab when prices are hitting very high and you can’t explain the high price, that’s one of the red flags,” said Ms Yong.\nSome artists\xa0also lament how some creators launch “knock-off collections” of popular NFTs just to cash in.\n“You need to understand what\'s unique for you and your experience in the digital space … Not just make (for the sake of it),” said Mr Hafiiz.\nMr Farizwan added: “I think as artists, we have to be very aware of that and not just jump on the so-called bandwagon because it seems like everyone\'s on it.”\nYet,\xa0NFTAsia’s Mr Liu noted\xa0that people buying collectibles motivated by profit may not necessarily be a bad thing.\n“With that, comes adoption … It gets them interested in NFTs. Once it stabilises and there are more wallets, more creators, it builds itself up,” he said.\nSome creators have also sparked a backlash by dipping their toes into the NFT space. That includes 28-year-old Alvin Juano, the artist behind The Square Comics, an Instagram account with 600,000 followers.\nHe launched his own collection to build capital to branch out into more types of content, with the NFTs allowing owners to propose and vote for what they wanted to see.\nBut the move polarised his fanbase, drawing many supportive direct messages – alongside a deluge of criticism. It also lost him about 5,000 followers overnight.\nDetractors took issue with the potential environmental impact of NFTs, noting\xa0that the\xa0blockchain technology behind them is an energy guzzler, requiring a lot of computing power to operate.\xa0\nIn response, Mr Juano said: “I think we have to take a step back and see what is the actual cause of greenhouse gas emissions … Everything you do has an environmental impact so it’s not like NFTs themselves are the only cause of the issue.”\nOther comments claimed NFTs were nothing more than “a speculative scam”.\nMr Juano acknowledged these concerns, given past cases of creators disappearing after cashing out,\xa0leaving buyers in the lurch with NFTs whose “value will never rise”.\nBut he said: “I think that behaviour comes with every new technology …. All I can say is it’s hard for me to scam, given all my personal details are already known!”\nDespite the initial flak, he said the project has since gained traction, with around 9,000 members on its Discord server.\nHe added: “Even if I don’t get on board, the ‘train’ will go on no matter what. So I\'d prefer to be involved in the new technology.”\nThe NFT world is complex and evolving, and both creators and buyers hoping to enter the space must do their homework, said experts.\nMr Liu stressed that wallet security is critical. “Definitely look into how to collect safely with wallet etiquette. Don’t share your seed phrase,” he said, referring to a key to a digital wallet.\n“Because it’s such nascent technology, there are a lot of opportunists, in terms of crime.”\nFor those looking to buy NFTs, Novum Alpha’s Mr Tan cautioned that they do not qualify as investments in strict technical terms.\n“An investment has to satisfy certain criteria like generate cash flow, has to be pegged to the economy, has to reflect growth in the economy, it could help to dampen portfolio volatility (and other fixed criteria).”\nIt is thus key not to “confuse NFTs with bonds, equities, other types of assets within a portfolio”, he said.\n“If you’re a speculator, do not speculate with anything you cannot afford to lose. The odds are very, very high you can lose some, if not all, of what you put in.\n“But again if you’re doing this purely for leisure, or as a hobby, that’s your prerogative,” he said, adding that collectors do not face the same “cost-benefit analyses” as speculators do.\nAs with any new technology, Novum Alpha’s Mr Tan believes there will be “a hype cycle”.\xa0\n“You’ll find no shortage of (people) who proclaim NFTs are the next gift to technology. No, they\'re not. They are\xa0still works in progress and there will be some degree of evolution that will be required before we get there.”\nBut their potential is crystal clear, as society increasingly flirts with the “metaverse” – or virtual world.\nMr Tan noted that the concept of physical ownership is already not as prized as it once was, which will fuel the acceptance of digital assets.\nNFTAsia’s Mr Liu agreed that NFTs are here to stay, though the realm will evolve. For one, valuations may not stay this high forever.\n“In my personal opinion, the prices that some collectibles are selling at are unsustainable. Over time, as more creators, people come in, prices might taper off into a more accessible level.”\nThe wide-ranging use cases for NFT technology will also continue to grow, said Mr Liu, citing an example such as tokenising concert tickets to verify them and root out scams.\nFor now, the NFT artists are enjoying their time in the sun. For Mr Hafiiz, who started making art as a hobby, the windfall is simply a bonus.\n“As long as I sell, I’m happy. To be honest, as an artist, that 100 people bought my work in a day, I’m over the moon ... I guess it just really validates my skill and artistry.”\nMr Farizwan also added that the biggest takeaway is belonging to such a like-minded online community with whom he can have deep discussions.\xa0\n“It feels very empowering in that sense because this (culture) is something so new … I feel that we have the opportunity to shape it the way we want it to be. I think that\'s the most valuable thing.”\n“Even if NFTs don’t stand the test of time, I’m more precious about the relationships I’ve made, the people I’ve met.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     cryptocurrency ', '     art ', '     In Focus ', '     NFT ']}"

      Banksy creates T-shirt to help anti-racism defendants
  </h1>, 'text': ""Hundreds of people lined up Saturday (Dec 11) in the English city of Bristol to get the latest work by elusive street artist Banksy – a T-shirt created to help four defendants charged over the toppling of a local statue of a slave trader.\nThe grey shirt features the word Bristol above the empty plinth on which the statue of 17th-century slave merchant Edward Colston long stood, with a rope hanging from it and debris scattered around.\nAnti-racism demonstrators pulled down the statue and dumped it in Bristol harbour in June 2020 amid global protests sparked by the police killing of a Black American man, George Floyd.\nFour people have been charged with criminal damage over the statue's felling and are going on trial next week. \n“I’ve made some souvenir shirts to mark the occasion,” Banksy said on social media Friday. “Available from various outlets in the city from tomorrow.

Some of his works have sold for millions of dollars at auction.\nColston made a fortune transporting enslaved Africans across the Atlantic to the Americas on Bristol-based ships. He was a major benefactor to Bristol, with streets and institutions named for him – some of which have been renamed since the statue-felling sparked a debate about racism and historical commemoration.\nCity authorities fished the Colston statue out of the harbour and say it will be placed in a museum, along with placards from the Black Lives Matter demonstration.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Banksy ', '     art ', '     racism ']}"

After all, it’s the only distillery that still tends its own barley fields, uses traditional floor maltings, and keeps both coppersmiths and coppers on site.\nAs part of a global campaign celebrating its legacy, The Balvenie will unveil The Makers Project from Nov 26 to Dec 5 at ArtScience Museum in Singapore, with seven artists extolling the process of ultimate craftsmanship with their commissioned pieces.\nRARE BLOOMS\n\nSummoning a botanical piece for Singapore, illustrator and artist Adeline Tan went retrospective and distilled the values of patience and perseverance from the country’s history in a painting titled The Tiger of Singapore.\n“What inspired me most about the tiger orchid is that it takes its own time. It blooms only once every few years but when it does, it delivers,” shared the artist. “In a fast-paced world, it reminds me that it is okay to take more time to get things right.”\nShe could have been describing the spirit of craftsmanship at The Balvenie. Indeed, she admitted: “I enjoyed the stories behind The Balvenie’s range of expressions. The stories of the craftsmen and how they’ve poured their heart and passion into their craft have really inspired me.”\nAdeline also holds malt master Stewart in high regard. “In this day and age where we are faced with a lot of distractions, it is inspiring to see how he’s remained focused solely on what he cares about. Just as he’s put years into honing his whisky nosing skills, I painted the tiger orchid as part of this collaboration because it, too, takes its time to grow and bloom.”\nThe final painting featuring the bloom is a lush, tropical piece, surrounded by an intricate paper orchid installation that invites the viewer into the magical world of dedication.\nARTISANAL ART\nSix other artists\xa0join Adeline in displaying their take of craftsmanship at The Makers Project, creating pieces that speak of their technique, interpretation and home country.\nThis unfolds in many ways. Fern Chua’s Freedom and Fluidity displays the beauty of batik, set abloom with Malaysia’s national hibiscus flower and Rajah Brooke butterflies. Vu aka Caubetho presents a bold\xa0statement with his fantastical Mice Wedding – a folk story retold through classical Vietnamese art and pop culture in a media mash-up. Thailand’s Phannapast Taychamaythakool takes a pilgrimage to find “that special something”, in a piece given whimsy with Victorian elements.\nMulti-disciplinary illustrator and designer Daryl Feril fuses polarising materials and methods together to present rare flora and fauna from the Philippines, while Diela Maharanie chooses the iconic dance form of the cendrawasih – or bird of paradise – to showcase Indonesia’s cultural art form. Graphic artist Yulia Brodskaya from the United Kingdom rounds up the series with Waves of Complexity, a precise handling of paper, swirled into a mesmerising piece.\n\nThe artists mirror The Balvenie’s Five Rare Crafts, bringing to light the exceptional investments the brand makes as it moves from grain to bottle.\nAt every point of the journey, the distillery has kept the process on site – making it the last of its kind to do so. Keeping the single malt whisky truly handcrafted is a team of passionate craftsmen, dedicated to retain tradition to give The Balvenie its complex profile.\nOn the thousand-acre The Balvenie Mains, farmers tend to the barley amid the unpredictable Scottish weather. As one of the only few distilleries in the Scottish Highlands to operate a working floor maltings, the workers here spread and turn the barley by hand until it is ready for the kiln.\xa0\xa0\nIn-house coppersmiths pass down their precise skills from master to apprentice, as they hammer copper sheets to make the ideal The Balvenie Ball shape, so important to achieving the honeyed taste of the whisky. From copper to casks, the coopers make the perfect barrels to hold the single malt and impart their distinctive character. These craftsmen are so seasoned, they can tell American oak from European just by feel.\nAnd finally, malt master Stewart is the longest-serving in the Scotch whisky industry, with 54 years of experience. He brings to The Balvenie an exceptional nose and honed acumen that have resulted in multiple awards and accolades.\n“At The Balvenie, we are continually striving to collaborate with like-minded people who share our passion to create, and our partnership with various makers across Southeast Asia is testament to this,” said Mr Brett Bayly, brand ambassador for The Balvenie Southeast Asia. “We hope that this specially curated exhibition will not only allow our guests to immerse themselves in the world of the brand and our five rare crafts, but also develop a new sense of whisky appreciation, and understand what it means to be ‘made by heart’.”\nFEEL THE CRAFT IN YOUR SIP\n\nThrough the imaginative art and immersive displays, The Balvenie wants visitors to deeply feel the stories and craft behind the single malt. For a fitting conclusion to satisfy all the senses, guests of The Makers Project are invited to a brand gallery where they can enjoy two drams of the spirit – The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old and The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 Year Old.\nBe immersed in the process with The Makers Project at ArtScience Museum. Tickets available at S$28 and include two drams of The Balvenie.

      5 things you should know about KAWS, the artist behind the sculpture at the heart of a dispute
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you were in the Marina Bay area over the weekend, you may have caught a glimpse of a monumental sculpture lounging by the waterfront at the floating platform.\xa0\nDecked out in shades of white and grey, KAWS’ 42m-long artwork depicts his signature character, COMPANION, embracing a miniature version of itself. Shortly after its launch, the exhibition came to an abrupt\xa0halt on Sunday (Nov 14) following a court order against its event organiser, AllRightsReserved. (Update: The exhibition was allowed to reopen on Nov 16.)\nCNA Lifestyle earlier had a chance to chat with Mr KAWS himself, Brian Donnelly. From celebrity collectors to Fortnite videos, here’s what you need to know about the cultural phenomenon.\xa0\n1. HIS WORK REIMAGINES POP CULTURE ICONS, FROM MICKEY MOUSE TO THE SIMPSONS\nYou’re not seeing double if COMPANION reminds you of a certain famed rodent.\xa0\nModelled after Disney’s Mickey Mouse, KAWS’ most iconic character originated from Donnelly’s work as a Disney animator, and his fascination with advertising.\n“I don\'t have anything against advertising. I just accept that it\'s everywhere. As I got into making sculptures, (it) led me more towards characters,” the American artist said. “I just became fascinated by how there\'s this ageless actor who just is there as a communique\xa0for people. I think I use my sculpture the same way, I use it to get my observations and ideas out to the world. So as I get older, they still stay the same.”\nHis series of larger-than-life characters draw inspiration from the likes of Peanuts, Sesame Street and even The Simpsons (playfully reimagined as “The Kimpsons”).\nAsk him which creation is his favourite, however, and you’d be hard-pressed to get an answer. “Each work is sort of just like a different chapter,” Donnelly said. “They feel like children almost, where you’re not supposed to favour them, you just appreciate how they all exist.”\n2. HIS COLLECTORS RANGE FROM BTS TO BIEBER\nDonnelly’s work has found resounding success in both the art and design world.\nThe artist’s works are highly coveted among celebrity collectors such as Suga, J-Hope and RM from BTS, Justin Bieber\xa0and Pharrell Williams. On top of which, his work has adorned products from some of fashion\'s biggest names such as Dior, Comme des Garcons and Nike.\xa0\nHere in Singapore, the artist made waves with the launch of his KAWS x Sesame Street merchandise with Japanese retailer Uniqlo, which drew snaking queues along Orchard Road.\nIn spite of his prolific career, Donnelly believes in the value of keeping his art inclusive and reaching a broad audience with his work.\n“As an artist, I enjoy communicating with a broader audience. I feel like art really should be for everyone,” he told CNA Lifestyle. “A lot of people talk about inclusion and diversity, but nobody\'s really doing that. I want to think about areas that I haven\'t occupied.”\n3. HE HAS ROOTS IN GRAFFITI AND TOY DESIGN\nGrowing up in New Jersey, Donnelly cut his teeth on graffiti art\xa0– developing a name for himself by tagging bus stop advertisements with his characters and the tag ""KAWS"".\n“When I was younger, I was doing graffiti and that led me into painting over advertisements,” he recalled. “I just thought there were a lot of parallels between (advertising) and graffiti art\xa0– because as a young kid in graffiti, you’d want to put your work in high visibility spaces.”\nLater in his career, his interest in sculpture brought him to Japan to work with toy company Bounty Hunter. “For me, that was the start of making toys,” he said. “Seeing my work in 3D immediately made me want to do a second and then third one… it just sort of grew within itself.”\nBut considering the work he puts out now, it’s little wonder that Donnelly doesn\'t seem keen on being referred to as a street artist anymore.\n“I haven’t done street art in 20 years but it seems like every article written about me mentions that in the first sentence of the first paragraph. And to me, (my current work) has nothing to do with street art,” he laughed, gesturing to his sculpture along the platform.\xa0\n“I feel like there\'s a lot of smoke and mirrors in all worlds, whether it\'s fashion or the gallery system, and museums or institutions. And I always want to kind of navigate around those and mix those things.”\n4. HIS WORKS SPAN ACROSS GENRES AND UNCONVENTIONAL MEDIUMS\n“I remember in the 90s it was really set: You could be a commercial artist, you could be a fine artist, but the two shall never meet,” Donnelly said. “I\'ve always ignored that, but now it\'s become accepted and common for people to do commercial projects.”\nEven now, the artist seeks to push the boundaries of his practice through new mediums - including those in the realm of video games.\xa0\n“Recently I did a project with Fortnite that brought the work to tens of millions of new kids,” he said. “And in the last two or three years, I started doing a lot of augmented reality work with Acute. That allowed me to do a lot of work that I could never imagine doing.”\nAsked if there were any projects he would like to work on, he disclosed that he was recently inspired to make a building. “(A recent project) made me think about the combination of art and architecture. For instance, what if something suddenly became functional? What if (my sculpture) was a library?”\n5. SINGAPORE IS HIS SEVENTH STOP FOR THE KAWS:HOLIDAY SERIES\nHOLIDAY has toured Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom and even outer space.\nDonnelly admitted that he didn\'t imagine having all these different iterations in different places.\xa0\nWith the HOLIDAY series, the artist explained that he wanted his sculptures to evoke the feeling of relaxing in a pool, laying and looking up with nobody around.\n“It’s a calm feeling,” he said, noting that the sculpture seemed apt at a time when people are emerging from the pandemic. “There\'s a lot going on in the world, and I think it\'s a good opportunity to just sort of space out and enjoy a piece of art.”\nIn the context of Singapore, the artist told CNA Lifestyle,\xa0“I\'m happy to have the opportunity to create a work that can invite people to come out. And I think having these works outdoors is a good way to sort of creep back into the art experience"".\n', 'related_topics': ['     celebrity ', '     art ', '     Culture & Trends ', '     KAWS ']}"

      Court orders KAWS:HOLIDAY exhibition at Marina Bay to stop
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A court has ordered organisers of the KAWS:HOLIDAY artwork at The Float @ Marina Bay to stop the exhibition of a 42m-long inflatable and sales of related merchandise.\nKAWS signature character COMPANION, created by international artist Brian Donnelly, was on display from Saturday (Nov 13) at The Float.\nThe free exhibition was set to run until Nov 21, and was organised by AllRightsReserved – a Hong Kong based studio – and supported by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB).\nBut an interim injunction, applied for by non-profit organisation The Ryan Foundation, has been granted. It orders that the exhibition stop taking place, as it is in breach of the foundation’s intellectual property rights and confidentiality.\nSales and distribution of merchandise related to the exhibition have also been ordered to stop. Merchandise includes vinyl figures, tank tops and camping sets.\nThe court order is between The Ryan Foundation and AllRightsReserved, and neither STB nor KAWS is\xa0party to the order.\nRyan Su, the founder of the foundation, told CNA that the injunction was served to AllRightsReserved at 4.20pm on Saturday.\nHe added that the foundation had been in talks with AllRightsReserved to bring a KAWS exhibition to Singapore back in 2019, but it did not materialise.\nThey applied for the court order after they found out that an exhibition would be coming to Singapore.\nThe Ryan Foundation’s director Adrian Chan said in a separate statement: “The injunction could have been averted if questions were raised and stakeholders consulted.”\nResponding to CNA\'s queries, AllRightsReserved said: ""In relation to the recent groundless allegations made by a third party who attempted to cause interruption to the KAWS:HOLIDAY SINGAPORE exhibition, our company is in the process of seeking urgent legal advice and will apply to court to challenge the prohibitory injunction order.""\xa0\nThe company added that it takes this incident very seriously and ""will take all possible steps to ensure that this exhibition can progress in accordance with the laws of Singapore"".\xa0\n""We apologise for any inconvenience caused,"" it said.\nThe organisers added that the artwork venue, The Float @ Marina Bay, is temporarily closed.\xa0\nIn a statement to CNA,\xa0Donnelly said that he is ""honoured"" to exhibit KAWS:HOLIDAY\xa0in Singapore.\nHe added that the reception from the people here\xa0has been ""overwhelmingly positive"" and that he is ""grateful"" to have this opportunity.\n""I have no contractual agreement with The Ryan Foundation.

      Architect Tadao Ando breathes life into new museum for Gucci’s billionaire boss
  </h1>, 'text': ""When billionaire entrepreneur Francois Pinault first tried to build a museum in Paris to display his contemporary art collection two decades ago, bureaucratic infighting and delays sank the project. In an emotional article in French newspaper Le Monde, he wrote at the time of his “immense disappointment” and announced that he would renovate the Palazzo Grassi in Venice instead.\xa0\n“I do not like to submit or quit,” said the self-made man whose fortune Forbes now values at US$55 billion (S$72.8 billion), to explain his reasons for decamping to Italy. “After Venice, I would like to add other cities in Europe, and one day I hope, France.”\nThe 84-year-old, who started in the wood business in his native Brittany and went on to build the luxury goods group Kering, which owns Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, has finally achieved his ambition.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Harper's BAZAAR Singapore (@harpersbazaarsg)\n\n\nOn May 22, Pinault presided over the opening of his museum at the meticulously renovated Bourse de Commerce, a pale stone rotunda in the heart of Paris. Located a short walk from the city’s temples to culture of the Louvre and Centre Pompidou, the venue adds to the French capital’s already rich offerings in art.\xa0\nIt also caps the ongoing rejuvenation of the Les Halles area, which had fallen into disrepair since a tacky shopping mall and transport hub replaced the city’s open-air food market in the 1970s. The museum now anchors the west side of a leafy park ringed by cafes – the area was bustling on a recent visit just after France’s six-month lockdown had eased.\nPinault has said he hopes the 7,000 sqm exhibition space, which will feature rotating exhibitions drawn from his collection of 10,000 works and from other institutions, can attract a wide audience and even win over contemporary art sceptics who prefer the classics.\n\n\n“Art from the past is interesting, but we must also pay attention to what is happening in the world today and also the future,” he said in a recent radio interview.\nThe new museum for the Pinault Collection is housed in a structure that has had several incarnations since the 16th century, all of which are still visible. There is the so-called Medici column that the French queen consort Catherine de’ Medici had built to observe the stars. A round stone floor dates from when the city used to store grain here to feed the population before the revolution.\xa0\nThen in 1889 for the World’s Fair in Paris, the building was rebuilt with a cast iron dome and glass ceiling. It was a dramatic backdrop for the business carried out here by commodities traders who hawked the sugar, coffee and cocoa that built France’s wealth during the colonial era.\xa0\n\n\nNow with a four-year, €160 million (S$258 million) makeover, Japanese architect Tadao Ando has injected a dash of minimalist cool to the structure by adding a nine-metre-high concrete cylinder under its light-filled cupola. It was the third commission Pinault has given to the Pritzker prize winner, following the Palazzo Grassi in 2006, and a second museum in Venice located in an old maritime customs building on Punta Della Dogana in 2009.\xa0\nAndo’s missions for Pinault have all refitted historical spaces with modern elements of cement, glass and light. At the Bourse de Commerce, his aesthetic effortlessly complements the site’s rich history.\nWhen you walk into the Bourse de Commerce, it does not feel like a typical museum. The ticket counter has been relocated outside the building, so you step into the central exhibition space with little transition, and no ornate lobby. The galleries are not the customary square, featureless white cubes; they loop around the central rotunda, and are punctuated with windows on both the inside and outside walls, allowing in a soft natural light. The windows also create a delicious interplay between the artworks and the building itself.\xa0\n\n\nAs a condition of the 50-year lease that Pinault signed with the city of Paris, he had to restore\xa0the Bourse de Commerce without wholesale changes since it is classified as a historical monument. That included restoring the panoramic oil painting, “Triumphal France”, that adorns the cupola. It depicts the glories of colonisation and technological progress – complete with stereotypical images of African warriors and Japanese geishas.\xa0\nThe art on display counters the mural’s racism of another era. On the second floor, a full-length portrait of a young black woman by\xa0British-Ghanaian painter Lynette Yiadom-Boakye hangs next to an interior window through which the colonialist mural is visible. It serves almost as a subtle visual rebuke, explained\xa0Martin Bethenod, managing director of the Bourse de Commerce’s Pinault collection. “The art can help us contextualise the past of the building,” he said.\xa0\nAnother example of the dialogue between the building and the art can be seen at a display of about 30 works from David Hammons, a prominent African-American artist whose work excavates the black experience in the US. Hammons asked for his installation, “Minimum Security”, to be placed in front of a mural depicting a map of the 19th-century maritime routes that generated the wealth of Europe.\xa0\n\n\nThe work resembles a rusty metal cage inspired by a jail cell at San Quentin State Prison in California, complete with a rusty metal bed and menacingly creaking door. “Hammons wanted to contrast his work with the map, and for it to be dark in here to convey fear,” said Bethenod.\xa0\nMany of the exhibits that Pinault has chosen for the opening carry such political messages, subtle or otherwise. (It was Pinault himself who chose the pieces, said Bethenod. “He was here every day during the renovation. Every detail, every artist is a reflection of his taste and his vision.”)\nSuch an overtly activist selection of works was an unexpected turn for the wealthy arts patron, especially in France where conversations about race remain taboo and complicated. France has long cast itself as colour-blind because it is a so-called “universal” republic where everyone is equal under the law. People are supposed to be citizens first, and not place too much emphasis on their ethnic, religious or sexual identities. When Black Lives Matters protests spread to Paris last year, they were greeted with confusion by the political class, and President Emmanuel Macron urged protesters not to knock over statues of slavers and colonialists as in other countries.\n\n\nBut at the Bourse de Commerce, Pinault is chez lui (at home) so he is free to provoke. “It was necessary for the selection of works to be serious, an echo of what the world has been through after more than a year of pandemic and protest movements,” said Jean-Jacques Aillagon, chief executive of the Pinault Collection.\xa0\nThe project is also a sign of how private money is changing a French cultural scene in which the state has long been the primary backer of museums, and is also a major funder of theatre and film. Several wealthy French families have created new arts institutions in Paris in recent years, and such foundations have an increasing influence over French arts. It remains to be seen how they will interact and compete with government-funded museums that often have budget constraints.\nThe most monumental of them was commissioned by Bernard Arnault, the billionaire founder of luxury group LVMH, who in 2014 opened the Fondation Louis Vuitton on the western edge of Paris in a dramatic building designed by Frank Gehry.\xa0\nArnault and Pinault, longtime business rivals, set aside that competition recently, albeit temporarily.\xa0Pinault invited Arnault to tour the Bourse de Commerce before the official opening, and the prominent collectors spent two hours visiting it together. Just as they had done in Arnault’s place before it opened.\nBy Leila Abboud © 2021 The Financial Times\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Paris ', '     art ']}"

      Why artist Cheong Soo Pieng’s works are so precious to these Singapore collectors
  </h1>, 'text': 'There are few art collectors today who can say they personally interacted with Singapore’s pioneering artists who came into their own during the country’s earliest years of nation-building. Influential architect Koh Seow Chuan, founder of lauded firm DP Architects and prominent heritage philanthropist, is one of them.\nAlso a renowned philatelist, Koh first met artist Cheong Soo Pieng (1917 – 1983) in 1968. Back then the young architect was part of an advisory group formulating stamp design policies for the newly sovereign nation and wanted to feature the artist’s work on a stamp. They met each other a few more times over the years and by the early 80s, Koh had already acquired a significant collection of Cheong’s works.\n\n\n“As I acquired more, I got increasingly fascinated and captivated by this artist and his philosophy and approach to art-making. When he came over from China to this part of the world in 1946, he wanted to get to know the environment of his new home so he travelled extensively within Southeast Asia and the region to capture the spirit of a place. He did it so well and so eloquently,” said Koh, a recipient of the Distinguished Patron of Heritage and Distinguished Patron of the Arts awards.\n“I identify with his philosophy of creating art that can uplift the human spirit. When I collect, I try to pick out pieces which I can learn something from and apply to my life, how I live and even the work I do,” said Koh. During his tenure at DP Architects, the now-retired architect spearheaded many of Singapore’s most iconic buildings, including Suntec City, the National Library Building on Victoria Street and the Esplanade.\n“In many of his paintings, the landscape is so intricately executed that you would admire the landscape first before noticing the people in the artwork. As his artistic career matured, his art embodied\xa0the ethos that ‘man must live in harmony with man, and man with nature’,” he observed.\nThis is something that Koh has incorporated into his projects, from one of his earliest, People’s Park Complex to Esplanade, one of his last. For instance, the former broke the mould of shopping malls of its time with a central atrium for people to interact while the latter was created with multiple foyers that those on the outside can look into the interior and those within the building can look out and enjoy the cityscape.\n\n\n“When I collect, I try to pick out pieces which I can learn something from and apply to my life, how I live and even the work I do.” – Koh Seow Chuan\nFor a glimpse at some of the works that have inspired Koh to leave an indelible mark on Singapore’s skyline, check out Tonalities: The Ink Works of Cheong Soo Pieng, the first known presentation to provide a retrospective survey of the artist’s entire body of ink work. Presented by artcommune gallery and curated by historian Tan Yong Jun, the exhibition, which runs till June 13, features over 100 ink works by the artist, which have been loaned from a vast array of collectors, including Koh.\nAnother collector who has loaned paintings to the exhibition is Dr Low Kah Boon, a radiologist. She began acquiring Singapore art a few years ago after reading up more about the topic. “I was surprised to find out there was so much I did not know about Singaporean art and this prompted me to go deeper into the subject because it is part of our collective culture and history,” she said.\nOne of her paintings at the show is Cheong’s 1981 Under The Banyan Tree, which features a group of people under a bough of this massive tree. “I was drawn to the atmosphere of the artwork and his portrayal of idyllic kampung life. The painting provokes feelings of nostalgia in me and leaves a profound effect,” she said.\nIf Cheong were still alive today, she mused, he would probably have been a “rockstar” in today’s art world. “He was really skilled in what he did, he produced so many high-quality works and painted so passionately. He showed in Europe and sold out while he was there. In my mind he is really our first successful international artist,” she said. “I feel strongly that we should advocate more and to speak up about our art history.”\nThis is a sentiment echoed by married couple Su-Yen Wong and Fermin Diez, who have spent the last 14 years building a lovingly curated collection of local art. “My father introduced us to Singaporean art and helped us to buy the very first piece in our collection, which just so happened to be by Cheong Soo Pieng,” said Wong, a professional speaker and board director, on the 1950s oil painting of a country road which became their first acquisition.\nSince then, the couple has focused on collecting pieces that “tell the Singapore story through the eyes of its first- and second-generation artists”.\n“As a young country that has witnessed dramatic change in a matter of decades, we believe artists have a critical role to play in documenting its evolution from both a historical and cultural perspective, and of telling this story through their own eyes,” said Wong.\nCheong, they say, is in many ways emblematic of what it means to be a Singapore artist. Wong said, “He brought together Eastern and Western techniques and sensibilities to create a body of work which is unique in its diversity, breadth and innovation. We also find Cheong Soo Pieng distinctive in the immense creativity he demonstrated, and, in contemporary terms, the boundary-spanning work he created. When you look at his work in totality, whether ink, oil, mixed-media, or sculpture, it is often hard to believe that they are actually by the same artist!”\nTo build their collection of distinctive Singaporean artworks, Wong and Diez make it a point to have a laser focus on picking works that contribute to telling the Singapore story.\nDiez said, “We also look for works that are distinctive in some form, and that complement the works in our collection. Artists have a way of making this vision their very own in the way they interpret what they see. We are endlessly fascinated with how a Singapore River scene or a Chinatown street painted by different artists can portray the same story yet look so different.”\n“We are endlessly fascinated with how a Singapore River scene or a Chinatown street painted by different artists can portray the same story yet look so different.” – Fermin Diez\nVisit Tonalities: The Ink Works of Cheong Soo Pieng at Artspace@Helutrans from now till June 13.

      The 29-year-old Singaporean illustrator who counts Chanel, Dior as clients
  </h1>, 'text': 'If you shop regularly at ION Orchard, you would have seen Grace Ciao’s illustrations around the mall. When the mall reopened after Singapore exited the Circuit Breaker\xa0last year, it collaborated with the Singaporean artist to produce a series of illustrations outlining\xa0enhanced safety measures. \xa0\nHer stylish and elegant drawings remind shoppers to check in with SafeEntry, wear a mask at all times, and to maintain a safe distance. They inject a sense of fun, and a human touch, into what would otherwise be dull and unexciting signage scattered around the mall.\nThe talented 29-year-old artist, and recent Forbes 30 Under 30 listee, has been illustrating professionally for eight years now. Her works have caught the attention of international luxury brands, including the likes of Bvlgari, Boucheron, Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Dior, Pomellato\xa0and more. She’s also a familiar face at VIP fashion, jewellery, beauty and lifestyle events in Singapore.\nHer journey, Ciao shared with CNA Luxury, was one that began on Instagram. “Since a very young age, I’ve always loved drawing. I used to doodle a lot on my school textbooks, or even on loose paper lying around the house. But I never went to art school,” she said.\n“Living in a pragmatic society like Singapore, I never knew that I could make a living out of becoming an artist, so it wasn’t a career path I even considered,” Ciao continued.\xa0 “When my mum saw me drawing too much, she would say things like ‘focus on your studies’, ‘go to university’ and ‘get a good job’.”\nAfraid to break the mould, Ciao took the more conventional path. “I studied in a junior college. Following which, I went to a local university and studied business. While I didn’t think of becoming an artist, I did want to be an entrepreneur.”\nThe pressure of having to keep up her good grades in her youth meant that her love for drawing took a back seat. But a university exchange programme to the Netherlands, and her subsequent travels around Europe, ignited her passion once again.\n“When you travel around Europe, you tend to see a lot of street artists around, something you don’t usually see in Singapore. For example, you can be having tea at a cafe, and an artist would be painting underneath the Eiffel Tower in Paris. I was very inspired, and it motivated me to pick up drawing again,” shared Ciao.\n“Living in a pragmatic society like Singapore, I never knew that I could make a living out of becoming an artist, so it wasn’t a career path I even considered.” – Grace Ciao\nGOING VIRAL\nBack in Singapore, Ciao would spend hours in her hostel room in school, drawing on her sketch pad. The subject of her drawings, she shared, are mostly women and girls. “It’s sort of like a representation of myself,” she reflected. “I used to draw mums with their daughters, girlfriends hanging out, and as I grew older, I started watching a lot of fashion shows. So I began drawing runway outfits.”\nCiao would upload her works on her Instagram account, eventually building a substantial following. One day, a wilting rose on her study desk, given to her by an admirer, caught her eye. “I started placing the petals on my drawing, and I got carried away.” She ended up creating a couture gown made entirely of rose petals.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\n“My likes on Instagram suddenly blew up to a few hundreds. I realised I must be doing something right, so the next day, I bought another flower and tried again.”\nThe flower girls, whom she affectionately calls Bloom Belles, have now become her signature. Ciao’s works on Instagram eventually caught the attention of US entertainment site Buzzfeed, which described her illustrations as “unconventional”.\nThe viral nature of the article started attracting more followers to her Instagram page, including those from the US, Singapore and around the region. Today, Ciao has over 78,000 followers on the social media platform.\n\n\nSCORING HER BIG BREAK\nCiao scored her big break in 2014, when she was still a student in university. Swiss watch company Jaeger-LeCoultre (JLC) had sent in an email, expressing their interest to fly her to Hong Kong for a timepiece showcase they were holding.\n“As a student, to have such a big brand approach you was quite amazing. I was even scared that it wasn’t real,” quipped Ciao.\nAfter a couple of meetings with the JLC Hong Kong team, Ciao flew over to the city to do a live art demonstration for the four-day press and VIP event, held at the International Financial Centre. “I did some drawings of gowns and cocktail dresses to pair with the timepieces showcased.”\nFrom there, Ciao says that her career began to blossom naturally. She soon caught the attention of other luxury brands, and quickly became a constant presence at VIP, press and customer events for Chanel, Dior, Elie Saab and more.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\nWith a list of notable names as clients, Ciao decided to take the plunge and pursue a full-time career as an artist after graduation.\nWhile there was concern from her mother that she would only be “famous for a while”, Ciao was certain that success was in her own hands. “It’s within my control to make sure that this career is sustainable. If I’m no longer famous, I would have to think of ways to branch out. I always felt that whether I am successful or not is on me, it’s not circumstantial,” she reasoned.\xa0\n\n\nEVOLVING THROUGH THE YEARS\nAs a Singaporean artist working with top international brands, Ciao says she feels “honoured and humbled”. “I see it as a validation of my work.”\nThese days,\xa0“people don’t see me as just an artist, but more of a business”, Ciao said.\xa0Over the years, she has taken great care to innovate. It’s where her business background, and knack for entrepreneurship, have certainly come in handy.\nAside from live art demonstrations and workshops, Ciao also does art licensing for advertisements and commercials, as well as merchandising and brand collaborations.\xa0\nOn hindsight, this has proven to be a shrewd move, considering how events are almost non-existent in a pandemic era. While Ciao used to fly to countries and cities like Japan, Shanghai and Beijing for events, the pandemic has put a stop to her travels. “Thankfully, I have evolved. You can’t be too fixated on one aspect of the business,” she said.\nIn 2015, Ciao collaborated with beauty brand Estee Lauder to create illustrations for a collectible series of liquid compacts. “When I saw my products on the shelf, and people wanting to buy them and own them, that really made me feel fulfilled as an artist,” she said.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\nA year later, she illustrated her Bloom Belles for a UK TV commercial for women’s personal care product company, Soft & Gentle. “They animated my girls and brought them to life. It was something I had never done before.”\nThere are\xa0also the illustrations she has done for ION Orchard, which Ciao said “helped to present information in a digestible way”. “This is the value that artists can bring, where they make things simpler and easier to understand,” she added.\nThrough the years, Ciao has also had the privilege of illustrating portraits of local celebrities, her favourite of which was JJ Lin. When the singer was announced as ambassador for OSIM in 2019, the brand engaged Ciao for a custom illustration.\xa0\n“I couldn’t give him the portrait in person, but I posted it on my Instagram. He actually commented on the post to say thank you, and then he followed me! That was quite cool,” Ciao chirped.\n\n\nA post shared by Grace Ciao Fashion Illustrator (@graceciao)\nOther celebrities and influencers she has illustrated include Rebecca Lim, Arissa Cheo and more. “I also did an illustration of a Singapore minister, but I wouldn’t consider him famous,” she laughed.\nFor those who’d like to get their hands on a custom illustration from Ciao, once a year, she takes in orders from the public, a service she describes as a “small access” to her works, which are usually reserved for clients and high-end brands.\nHowever, to maintain the exclusivity of her works, and to balance her demanding schedule, orders for custom portraits are limited, Ciao stressed. “Clients would also have to wait at least three weeks for the illustration to be complete,” she said.\nCHASING HER OWN DREAM \nSoon, Ciao’s dream of seeing her ethereal gowns worn in real life will come to fruition. She recently collaborated with a Japanese bridal company\xa0to design a collection of wedding gowns.\xa0\n“Some brands have used my illustrations on their apparels, but this is the first time that my designs are turning into ready-to-wear gowns,"" she shared.\xa0\nDetails are still kept under wraps as the launch of the collection has been pushed back due to the pandemic. But Ciao is excited to see her designs come to life. “I’m getting married soon, so I was thinking of asking them to ship one of my gowns to me!” she quipped.\nAs a creative in Singapore, Ciao admits that not everyone “understands what I do”. “People don’t really appreciate the value of art in Singapore. Last year, there was talk that artists are non-essential. But I don’t really care what people say. As long as I am happy by my standards, good by my standards, then that’s fine,” she stated.\nReflecting on her career, Ciao is thankful to be able to live out her dream. “Throughout my youth, I felt like I was always chasing other people’s dreams. I was trying to take the prestigious route, going to a local university, studying business, even doing an internship at a bank at one point. But now, I’m chasing my own dream and working hard for myself.”\nLooking towards the future, she hopes to one day see her signature Bloom Belles turn world-famous. “My idea is to make them so popular to the point that everyone knows who they are,” she said, before taking a pause.\n“I don’t know if it’s a good comparison, but they could be as famous as Hello Kitty or Mickey Mouse. I know it’s a bit farfetched, but why not, right?” she continued with a smile.\n""I don’t really care what people say. As long as I am happy by my standards, good by my standards, then that’s fine.""\xa0– Grace Ciao\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     fashion ']}"

      Tycoon's art trove unveiled in Paris, home to billionaires' culture contest
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: The reopening of Paris museums this week finally gives billionaire tycoon Francois Pinault the chance to showcase his vast contemporary art collection in the French capital, with works ranging from stuffed pigeons to slowly melting chairs.\nThe museum\'s launch in a converted 19th-century commodities exchange, blocks away from the Louvre, was put on hold twice due to the coronavirus pandemic after having suffered earlier planning mishaps, with an initial project abandoned in 2005.\nPinault, 84 - who made his fortune in timber trading before shifting into retail under the group now known as Kering, run by his son - joins rival French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault in trying to stamp his legacy on Paris\' art scene and landscape, with museums and renovation projects.\nBut the Bourse de Commerce - Pinault Collection, opening on May 22, will also give visitors a glimpse of the businessman\'s vast trove of art purchases since the 1980s, including pieces by photographer Cindy Sherman and painter Peter Doig.\nThe 200 works on display for the opening, many straight out of storage, feature artists who have never had restrospectives in France, such Kerry James Marshall, known for his paintings of Black figures and explorations of African-American history.\nAn ephemeral work by Swiss-born artist Urs Fischer will take centre stage at the launch, with wax sculptures installed in the central space, including of chairs and a marble-like statue, set to slowly melt over six months as they are set alight.\nOverhead, stuffed pigeons peer down into the gallery, in an art installation called ""Others"" by Maurizio Cattelan designed to give visitors a startling sense of being observed.\nThe project follows Pinault\'s attempt to build a new museum in western Paris on the site of a former Renault car factory, which became bogged down in wrangling with local authorities. The billionaire has since opened two museums in Venice, Italy.\nArnault, who is behind the LVMH luxury goods conglomerate, built his Louis Vuitton foundation in the west of the French capital, opening the futuristic ship-like Frank Gehry design to public exhibits in 2014.\nThe Cartier Foundation, linked to the jewellery brand owned by Switzerland\'s Richemont, has been a cultural hotspot for contemporary art exhibits in Paris since the 1980s.\nCROWDED ART\nMany museums in France are re-opening for the first time since October on May 19 as COVID-19 restrictions ease. The Bourse de Commerce - Pinault Collection will welcome 600-700 visitors a day, a reduced intake compared to its 1,700 capacity.\nIn Paris\' crowded art world, once dominated by public institutions, private museums now offer a fresh perspective, the Bourse de Commerce\'s managing director Martin Bethenod said.\n""Now it\'s a much more balanced art scene, it\'s a kind of ecosystem in which private and public can work together,"" Bethenod told Reuters.\nHoused in a circular former grain trading hall, the Bourse de Commerce\'s exterior has been restored, while inside old and new mingle. A cement walkway imagined by Japanese architect Tadao Ando gives visitors a closer view of the imposing glass dome, as well as a late 19th-century painting depicting an antiquated Europe-centric world view, with colonial stereotypes.\nPart of the concept was to keep the work, in a form of dialogue with contemporary artists, Bethenod said.\n""Mr Pinault\'s point of view is very much linked to issues in society, social issues, political issues, gender issues, cultural issues,"" he added.\n(Reporting by Sarah White and Michaela Cabrera; Editing by Pravin Char)\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     fine art ', '     France ', '     Paris ']}"

""This will be, you\'re buying the ownership to the file.""\nFor Murdoch, who is based in the central English city of Peterborough, the decision to immediately destroy his mural is a new departure from his previous projects.

      The NFT boom: Is digital art the next tech bubble?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A collage of digital images by the artist known as Beeple - sold, for US$69 million.\nThe first tweet by Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter - sold, for US$2.9 million.\nBut the individuals that bought these digital items received nothing tangible back.\nInstead, they got a digital token known as an NFT, which stands for non-fungible token.\nWhen something is fungible, it can be exchanged for something else. So if you have five S$1 notes, they can be exchanged for a single S$5 note.\nNon-fungible items are not mutually interchangeable, because they have unique qualities.\nExamples could include Pokemon cards, limited edition sneakers, or the Mona Lisa.\n\nIn the digital assets context, an NFT is essentially a proof of provenance, or details about the origin, authenticity, ownership and transaction details.\nThe underlying assets of NFTs can be anything from a meme to a digital self-portrait, and even an “online pet”.\nThat is how NFTs first went mainstream in 2017- with CryptoKitties.\nCryptoKitties was a blockchain-based virtual game that allows players to adopt, raise and trade virtual cats.\nBack then, some of these virtual cats were already trading for more than US$100,000.\nThe NFT market was worth about US$250 million dollars last year. From January to March 2021, turnover has already reached approximately US$200 million dollars.\n""NFTs support so many different industries, whether it’s digital art, or in-game items, or music, even domain names. I will say the potential is huge,"" said Ms Journey Li, APAC marketing manager at Elliptic, a blockchain consultancy.\nStakeholders in the crypto space say that NFTs are a new and different form of asset class.\nBut the underlying asset of an NFT, like a digital art piece, can be replicated easily the very next day.\nSo why pay so much for something that you can download for free on the Internet?\nMr Kelvin Goh, head of wealth advisory at OCBC Bank points out that as with any transaction, demand and supply comes into play.\n“At the end of the day, whatever price that I pay, I assign a certain value to that token. In order to sell it, I will need someone else to assign a greater value, or greater price to that token. So as things stand, there’s a lot of interest.\n""The debate is about whether or not the price you paid equates to the value that you’re deriving from it. I could pay a record sum. I would essentially need someone else to pay me a higher sum to derive a profit from it. So traditional methods of valuation may not work so well.”\nFor digital art collector Cao Yin, buying NFTs helps him to record the milestones of both physical and digital events.\nHe bought his first NFT in 2017, paying around US$1,000 to $2,000 in the cryptocurrency Ethereum. He says those items are now priced at around US$1 million.\nHe doesn’t intend to sell.\n""The original reason for collecting these items is to collect and not transact and not to buy low sell high and profit from it,"" said Mr Cao.\xa0\n""For me, I come from a collector’s point of view to record our crypto and digital era development at every milestone and I collect them in my vault,"" he added.\nFor now, NFTs can only be bought using cryptocurrencies.\nMany of the recent headline-making NFT purchases have been made by crypto investors.\nThis includes the US$69 million NFT by the artist known as Beeple. The sale makes him “among the top three most valuable living artists”, according to Christie’s, the auction house that handled the transaction.\nShortly after the sale, Beeple confirmed that the sale proceeds were converted into cold hard cash.\nWith the recent NFT trading boom, concerns have been raised that this is the newest crypto bubble.\n""If take the whole crypto or whole NFT as a whole, there’s a bubble. There are many bubbles and the bubbles are quite big. But the gems, the masterpieces are actually undervalued,"" said Mr Cao.\nOCBC\'s Mr Goh added: “I wouldn’t say it’s a bubble but I do think that there’s a level of trough in the markets and it’s adding on to itself because of the high prices and the increased attention.\n""The average investor should be mindful with regards to the platform that they are investing in and to just look at these assets for what they are.""\nMeanwhile, the advice from Elliptic\'s Ms Li: “The general rule of thumb is - do not buy it because you believe the value will go up. Just buy it like you collect any other things, like collectibles, Pokémon cards and don’t expect to make money out of it.”\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     investment ', '     Money Mind ', '     art ']}"

NFTs have exploded in popularity in 2021, with prices skyrocketing.\nMetakovan, real name Vignesh Sundaresan, plans to put the artwork on display in four virtual world environments.\xa0\nHe is working with architects to design gallery complexes that the public can enter via web browsers or virtual reality technology.\nBut art is just one part of a new economy of blockchain-based virtual worlds where land, buildings, avatars and even names can be bought and sold as NFTs, often fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars. In these environments, referred to as the metaverse, people can wander around with friends, visit virtual buildings and attend virtual events.\nMetakovan\'s plans are an ambitious undertaking, but he says he is the world\'s biggest NFT investor. His collection of NFTs and other crypto assets, the Metapurse fund, is valued at US$189 million, according to NonFungible.com, a site that aggregates sales history data from NFT marketplaces.\n""The current Cambrian explosion of NFTs that you see is all about acquisition – people want to buy up NFTs, gobble as many of them as they can,"" said Anand Venkateswaran, aka Twobadour, who runs the Metapurse fund with Metakovan.\n""But it\'s just the tip of the iceberg. The real explosion will happen when they\'re able to ... experience these NFTs as they were intended. If it\'s a plot of virtual land, you ought to move around in it, have an immersive experience in it.""\nIn what will be one of the biggest names to join the party, videogame maker Atari told Reuters it planned to launch its own blockchain-based virtual world and would soon announce details.\nOnline environments are going to be ""very very big"", regardless of fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, said Frederic Chesnais, head of Atari\'s blockchain division and the company\'s former CEO. NFT real estate could one day fetch millions of dollars, he added.\nInvestors caution, however, that while big money is flowing into NFTs, the market could represent a price bubble, with the risk of major losses if the hype dies down. There could also be prime opportunities for fraudsters in a market where many participants operate under pseudonyms.\nA PLOT OF VIRTUAL LAND: US$500,000+\nThe NFT frenzy has heightened interest in blockchain-based online environments. The best known are Decentraland, Cryptovoxels, Somnium Space and The Sandbox, where virtual real estate prices are hitting new highs.\nDecentraland has seen more than US$50 million in total sales, including land, avatars, usernames and wearables like virtual outfits. A patch of land measuring 41,216 virtual square metres sold for US$572,000 on Apr 11, which the platform said was a record.\nAnother Decentraland plot sold for US$283,567 on Mar 21, according to NonFungible.com, while Somnium Space said an estate on its platform fetched more than US$500,000 on Mar 16.\nMetaverse enthusiasts compare the rush to buy virtual land to the scramble for domain names in the early days of the internet. There are currently a few thousand unique landowners on each of the main blockchain-based platforms.\nTheir theory is that as more people congregate in these environments, plots of land in central locations will be highly sought-after because of the amount of visitor traffic.\n""All of virtual land and these virtual spaces are basically real estate on which experiences will start to centre, on which attention will start to focus,"" Twobadour said.\n""That\'s where all of the attention is and that\'s monetisable in a million different ways.""\nSo far, it\'s a relatively small number of people driving up land prices on these worlds.\nIn Decentraland there were 334 buyers in March, sending monthly land sales volumes past US$4 million, from US$767,400 in February with 184 buyers and US$246,134 in January with 111 buyers, according to NonFungible.com.\nAn NFT investor called Whale Shark, whose collection was valued at more than US$20 million by NonFungible.com in February, said he spent 200 of the cryptocurrency Ether on land in Cryptovoxels and another 200 in The Sandbox in 2018 and 2019.\nThose estates cost around US$60,000 each back then but are now worth more than US$400,000 apiece, he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nSome virtual worlds have their own cryptocurrencies: Decentraland\'s MANA has skyrocketed more than 3,500 per cent\xa0over the past year, according to Coinbase.\nVIRTUAL FESTIVAL, ANYONE?\nSome early virtual land investors who bought in early are now selling to companies, said Samuel Hamilton, community and events lead at the Decentraland Foundation.\nAtari, ahead of its plans to open its own blockchain-based world, has licensed a retro arcade within Decentraland and is due to open a casino, while an area called ""Crypto Valley"" is home to various crypto companies.\nDecentraland has hosted a virtual fashion exhibition in collaboration with Adidas, where designs were auctioned as NFTs. It is also attracting interest from musicians who can perform in the space, selling tickets and merchandise as NFTs.\n""We\'re going to have several well-known global festivals all doing stages, and when we get to that point we expect hundreds of thousands or even millions of people,"" Hamilton said.\nLast year, American rapper Travis Scott drew an audience of 27.7 million visitors to five concerts within Fortnite, the popular online game owned by Epic Games.\nIS ""CRYPTO WINTER""\xa0COMING?\nSebastien Borget, co-founder of The Sandbox, described the commercial activity within virtual worlds as a new nation forming and said the NFT-based economy would outgrow the real-world one within a decade.\nThere are, however, many in the fledgling industry who warn of dangers ahead for investors.\n""I expect that there\'ll be a crypto winter in the next couple of months, the whole NFT boom will explode and then all the value will absolutely collapse,"" said Ben Nolan, founder of the virtual world Cryptovoxels.\n""Doing NFTs as an investment or as a way to make money is really ill-advised.""\nHowever he does see a future for virtual worlds and NFTs.\n""Do I think most people will use virtual worlds? Probably not, but I think a lot of people will and I think NFTs are a big part of that growth,"" he said.\n""Actually walking around with another person in a virtual space and looking at art together is a really nice way to spend time,"" he added.\nWhale Shark said the vast majority of NFTs had no commercial viability, and expects only a small number to emerge as winners.\nBut some investors such as Australia-based Mateen Soudagar, aka DCL Blogger, have little interest in moving back into real-world investments.\nSoudagar says he has made millions of dollars through cryptocurrency and NFTs, but rather than cash out, he keeps around 75 per cent\xa0of his money in crypto assets and reckons many of his peers do the same. Other than upgrading his laptop, he hasn\'t changed his lifestyle.\n""If you\'re a believer in the movement then you think that the world will move into this space,"" he said. ""So when you\'re putting it into fiat you\'re going backwards.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     investment ', '     art ']}"

A digital artwork he created, named Everydays: The First 5,000 Days, sold for a whopping US$69.3 million (S$93 million) at a Christie's auction, a record amount paid for a booming art category called non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.\nThough there was initial speculation that the buyer was Justin Sun, a crypto whiz who once paid US$4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, Sun took to Twitter to clarify that he had been outbid\xa0in the last 20 seconds by US$250,000.\nThe buyer is a crypto asset investor who goes by the pseudonym Metakovan.\xa0\nSingapore-based Metakovan, whose real name was not disclosed, is the founder of Metapurse, the world's largest NFT fund, Christie's said in a statement.\n5,000 Days was the first completely digital NFT artwork sold by auction house\xa0Christie's, but what exactly is an NFT? How on earth can an artwork that doesn’t exist\xa0in\xa0physical form ultimately sell for millions of dollars?\nTo simplify it, an NFT provides proof of ownership of an asset, backed by blockchain technology. In this case, the asset is Winkelmann's digital artwork, with the NFT attached to the JPG file.\xa0It\xa0guarantees the originality, the traceability and the uniqueness of the\xa0digital artwork.\xa0\xa0\nEverydays – The First 5,000 Days is a digital collage consisting of 5,000 futuristic images. For 5,000 days, Beeple made one unique image a day, starting on May 1, 2007, to Jan\xa07, 2021.\nBut just who is Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple?\xa0\nHE’S A WELL-KNOWN DIGITAL ARTIST \nWinkelmann is a graphic designer and digital artist from the US. He is married to a schoolteacher and has two children.\nWinkelmann “makes a variety of art crap across a variety of media”, he wrote\xa0on his website. He shot to fame because of his Everydays project, where he created one digital artwork a day. Winkelmann shared every creation he made on an uninterrupted stream online via Tumblr, Facebook and more.\n\n\nA post shared by beeple (@beeple_crap)\nOn his\xa0Instagram account, where he goes by the cheeky handle @beeple_crap,\xa0Winkelmann has amassed over 1.9 million followers.\nHE HAS WORKED ON CONCERT VISUALS FOR JUSTIN BIEBER, ARIANA GRANDE AND MORE \nRemember when Shakira walked through a wall of fire at the Super Bowl? That was Winkelmann’s work. Aside from Shakira, Winkelmann has also created concert visuals for performing artists\xa0Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj and more.\nHE COLLABORATED WITH LOUIS VUITTON, NIKE AND COCA-COLA\nThe artist has also produced work for some of the biggest global brands, including Nike and Coca-Cola. In the fashion world, Winkelmann collaborated with Louis Vuitton for the house’s 2019 Spring/Summer collection, where some of his futuristic landscapes were transposed onto the clothes.\n\n\nA post shared by Louis Vuitton (@louisvuitton)\nAt first, Winkelmann thought that the brand would pick some of his abstract work. “But then they picked a bunch of robots and stuff, so I was thinking, ‘Hey, how are you going to put a robot on a women’s US$2,000 shirt?’ But, you, know, I don’t know anything about fashion,” he said in an interview with School of Motion. “I wear garbage clothes, so all of this was just so foreign to me.”\nHE'S NOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE LIVING ARTISTS\nFollowing the Christie's sale, Winkelmann has now cemented his position in the top three most valuable living artists in the world.

      Digital-only artwork by American artist fetches nearly US$70m at Christie's auction
  </h1>, 'text': 'A digital artwork sold for nearly US$70 million (S$93.7 million) at Christie\'s on Thursday (Mar 11), in the first ever sale by a major auction house of a piece of art that does not exist in physical form.\nEverydays – The First 5000 Days\xa0is a digital work by American artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple. It is a collage of 5,000 individual images, which were made one-per-day over more than 13 years.\nThe sale of the work for US$69,346,250 put Beeple in the top three most valuable living artists, Christie\'s said in a tweet.\nThe work is in the form of a new type of digital asset – a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) –meaning it is authenticated by blockchain, which certifies its originality and ownership.\n\n\nThe market for NFTs has soared in recent months as enthusiasts and investors use spare savings to buy up items that exist online. Last month, a 10-second video clip featuring an image of a fallen Donald Trump, also by Beeple, sold for US$6.6 million on an NFT marketplace called Nifty Gateway.\n""Without the NFTs, there just legitimately was no way to collect digital art,"" said Beeple, who makes irreverent digital art on themes such as technology, wealth and American politics.\nAsked what he thought of the multi-million dollar bids on his work, the 39-year-old graphic designer, who has created concert visuals for the likes of Justin Bieber, One Direction and Katy Perry, said he was lost for words.\n""I don\'t know... maybe you can put an emoji into the story,"" he said. ""It\'s so crazy.""\nFor NFTs, the artist\'s royalties are locked in to the contract: Beeple receives 10 per cent each time the NFT changes hands after the initial sale.\n""I do really think that this is going to be seen as the next chapter of art history,"" Beeple said.\nNFT FRENZY\nVarious digital objects can be minted as NFTs and traded as assets, including art, sports collectibles, patches of land in virtual worlds, cryptocurrency wallet names and even tweets. Twitter Inc boss Jack Dorsey is conducting a digital auction of his first ever tweet, in NFT form.\nArt NFTs make up around a quarter of the all-time NFT sales volume (US$415 million) according to NonFungibles.com, which aggregates sales history data for the Ethereum blockchain, the most commonly used ledger for recording these types of assets.\nMusicians are also getting in on the hype, with American rock band King\'s of Leon having launched an album as an NFT.\nBeeple says the explosion in NFTs is due in part to the increased amount of time people are spending online during the pandemic. Like many enthusiasts, he also believes they could represent the future of ownership.\n""Equities have been the predominant asset class for the last hundred years, or whatever. I don\'t think it\'s guaranteed that that\'s always going to stay like that. I think kids today hate corporations... So the idea that they\'re just going to automatically blindly give them their money to invest, I don’t know about that,"" Beeple said.\nBut, like many new niche investment areas, there is a risk of losses if the hype dies down. Many NFTs will eventually become worthless, Beeple added.\nAlthough NFTs can function as a legally enforceable contract, they also raise issues relating to insurance, tax and intellectual property, said Max Dilendorf, a cryptocurrency lawyer and partner at Dilendorf Law Firm in New York.\n""If you are a buyer of an expensive piece of NFT, you have to know what features and terms you are subject to,"" he said.\n""From my experience, participants in NFT markets are not really thinking it through carefully.""\nDilendorf said that he expects the entire physical art market to be digitised in NFT form in the next five years.\n(Source: Reuters)\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ']}"

In the first 10 minutes of bidding we had more than a hundred bids from 21 bidders and we were at a million dollars,"" said Noah Davis, specialist in post-war and contemporary art at Christie\'s.\nHis division has never seen an online-only sale top US$1 million before, he added.\nIn a decision that could help push cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream, the auction house that was founded in 1766 will accept payment in the digital coin Ether as well as traditional money.\n""I think that this moment was inevitable and whenever institutions of any kind try to resist inevitability, it does not work out very well,"" Davis said of accepting crypto payment. ""And so the best thing you can do is embrace the terrifying.""\nUS$208K FOR LEBRON JAMES SLAM DUNK\nNFTs could be benefiting from the hype around cryptocurrencies and blockchain, as well as virtual reality\'s potential to create online worlds. The growing interest also coincides with a surge in online retail trading during lockdowns.\nThe start of the rush for NFTs has been linked with the launch of the US\xa0National Basketball Association\'s Top Shot website, which allows users to buy and trade NFTs in the form of video highlights of games.\nFive months after its launch, the platform says it has over 100,000 buyers and nearly US$250 million in sales. The majority of sales take place in the site\'s peer-to-peer marketplace, with the NBA getting a royalty on every sale.\nThe volume is rapidly rising: February has seen sales totalling US$198 million as of Friday, heading for a fivefold increase from January\'s US$44 million, Top Shot said.\nEach collectible has ""a unique serial number with guaranteed scarcity and protected ownership guaranteed by blockchain"", the site says. ""When you own #23/49 of a legendary LeBron James dunk, you\'re the only person in the world who does.""\nThe biggest transaction to date was on Feb\xa022, when a user paid US$208,000 for a video of a LeBron James slam dunk.\nOne major NFT enthusiast, who goes by the pseudonym ""Pranksy"" told Reuters he had invested US$600 in an early NFT project in 2017 and has now built that up to a portfolio ""worth seven figures"" in NFTs and cryptocurrencies. He asked to be anonymous to protect his family\'s privacy.\nPranksy said he has now spent more than US$1 million on Top Shot and made about US$4.7 million by reselling purchases. Reuters was unable to independently verify the figures, although NBA Top Shot confirmed he is among the site\'s biggest buyers.\n""I see them as investments really, much like any other collectibles and NFTs that currently exist,"" he said in an interview conducted via Twitter. ""I\'d never watched a game of basketball before Top Shot launched.""\n\'EMERGENCE OF THE METAVERSE\'\nNate Hart, a Nashville-based NFT investor who, like Pranksy, has been involved in the market since it first developed in 2017, has seen some popular digital art NFTs such as Autoglyphs and CryptoPunk surge in value.\nHart said he bought a LeBron James Cosmic NFT on NBA Top Shot for US$40,000 in January, then sold it for US$125,000 in February.\n""We\'re in awe, it just doesn\'t feel real. We were in the right place, right time, got lucky, but we also took that risk,"" he said.\n""The space has been growing a lot. I do think that this is a little bit of a bubble. It is a bubble,"" he said. ""It\'s hard to predict what the top will be.""\nAndrew Steinwold, who launched a US$6 million dollar NFT investment fund in January, warned that the majority of NFTs could become worthless in future.\nBut, like many backers, he is confident that some items will retain their value and that NFTs represent the future of digital ownership, paving the way for a world in which people live, socialise and make money in virtual environments.\n""We\'re spending a lot of our time digitally, always online, always plugged in. It makes sense to now add property rights to the mix and suddenly we have the emergence of the metaverse,"" he said.\n""I think it\'s going to reach into the trillions of dollars one day.""\n(Source: Reuters)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Tech ', '     art ']}"

      Like an art gallery: A Singapore home that even has its own pottery studio 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Couple Theodore Chan and Delphine Sng’s home is hard to miss from the street. The 4,080 sq. ft. inter-terrace is flanked by a single casuarina tree, whose striking elegance is captured daily from the living room through an oculus\xa0specially built into a balcony overhang.\nThe two-and-a-half storey house is the first one that Chan, an architect for 30 years, built for himself and his wife. It reflects their preference for natural materials, whose raw beauty is showcased throughout the house, including a feature wall made from locally sourced, upcycled rainforest wood.\nThe former president of the Singapore Institute of Architects mused, “I would call it ‘industrial poetic’ as a lot of the materials that we use in this house are all in a very unadorned state. We want to express the natural tones and quality of the material.”\nFor Sng, who has been a full-time ceramic artist for 13 years since she left the corporate world, her ground-floor pottery studio at the back of the house is her creative sanctuary, where she works and teaches most of the day.\nIn the Tadao Ando-inspired concrete haven, her artworks hang on an off-form wall, alongside other local and international artists. A bubbling water feature next to her pottery wheel transports her to another world where she can create in quietude. The space was deliberately left void and flexible to allow for artists to gather and talk about their works.\n\n\nSng explained, “On some of my holidays, I visited a few master potters and saw how they set up their studios. Most of them have their workshops behind, and they have a home gallery where they show their work. I thought that was really lovely for any artist to be able to share their work with the public.”\nChan also wanted an “honest house” where all its services were exposed. He said, “Architecture is more than just about beautiful forms. I would see architects as healers of the built environment where you have to look at the considerations and use as little resources as possible.”\nHe took the unusual route of building the house in mezzanines where the floor plates do not meet and services on the front side of the house are separate from those at the back.\nThese were connected via the parti-walls at the sides of the house. The split stairs flanking both sides also gave the space a seamless connection, where each floor and its function are not compartmentalised, but rather flow from one level to the next.\nChan said, “The good thing about designing your own house is that you can push the boundary. You can do things which people will not conventionally accept.” For example, steel decking, similar to those used at construction site offices, was used for the flooring. It is a rarity in residential projects but relished by Chan for its industrial look.\n\n\nThe furnishings, which become softer as one moves upwards from the living to the study and the bedrooms, were not planned purchases either. Sng said, “I tend to go very natural with the materials like wood, metal and stone. I didn’t actually go out looking for a piece, they were collected over some years, and each remind you of a good place or a relationship.”\nThe intimate dwelling is one in which the couple enjoys hosting family and friends, especially in their favourite “kitchen-cafe”, where guests would sit around the long kitchen island to chat, eat and prepare food with their hosts. Chan also uses his home as a living lab to discuss architecture and design with budding architects.\nSng shared, “When we did [up] this space, we looked at it from a time perspective. That’s why it is important to have a space that is honest. When you are there, you can be yourself and just be.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3).

      Louvre in Paris gets rare chance to refurbish during pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'The 518-year-old Mona Lisa has seen many things in her life on a wall, but rarely this: Almost four months with no Louvre visitors.\nAs she stares out through bulletproof glass into the silent Salle des Etats, in what was once the world\'s most-visited museum, her celebrated smile could almost denote relief. A bit further on, the white marble Venus de Milo is for once free of her girdle of picture-snapping visitors.\nIt\'s uncertain when the Paris museum will reopen, after being closed on Oct\xa030 in line with the French government\'s virus containment measures. But those lucky enough to get in benefit from a rare private look at collections covering 9,000 years of human history – with plenty of space to breathe.\xa0\nThat\'s normally sorely lacking in a museum that\'s blighted by its own success: Before the pandemic, staff walked out complaining they couldn\'t handle the overcrowding, with up to 30,000-40,000 visitors a day.\nThe forced closure has also granted museum officials a golden opportunity to carry out long-overdue refurbishments that were simply not possible with nearly 10 million visitors a year.\xa0\nUnlike the first lockdown, which brought all Louvre activities to a halt, the second has seen some 250 of the museum employees remain fully operational.\nAn army of curators, restorers and workers are cleaning sculptures, reordering artifacts, checking inventories, reorganizing entrances and conducting restorations, including in the Egyptian Wing and the Grande Galerie, the museum\'s largest hall that is being fully renovated.\n""We\'re taking advantage of the museum\'s closure to carry out a number of major works, speed up maintenance operations and start repair works that are difficult to schedule when the museum is operating normally,"" Laurent le Guedart, the Louvre\'s Architectural Heritage and Gardens Director told AP from inside the Grande Galerie.\nAs le Guedart spoke, restorers were standing atop scaffolds taking scientific probes of the walls in preparation for a planned restoration, travelling back to the 18th century through layer after layer of paint.\xa0\nAround the corner the sound of carpenters taking up floorboards was faintly audible. They were putting in the cables for a new security system.\xa0\nPreviously, these jobs could only be done on a Tuesday, the Louvre\'s only closed day in the week. Now hammers are tapping, machines drilling and brushes scrubbing to a full week schedule, slowed down only slightly by social distancing measures.\nIn total, ten large-scale projects that were on hold since last March are under way – and progressing fast.\xa0\nThis includes works in the Etruscan and Italian Halls, and the gilded Salon Carre. A major restoration of the ancient Egyptian tomb chapel of Akhethotep from 2400BC is also underway.\xa0\n""When the museum reopens, everything will be perfect for its visitors – this Sleeping Beauty will have had the time to powder her nose,"" said Elisabeth Antoine-Konig, Artifacts Department Curator. ""Visitors will be happy to see again these now well-lit rooms with polished floors and remodeled display cases.""\nInitially, only visitors with pre-booked reservations will be granted entry in line with virus safety precautions.\nThose who cannot wait are still able to see the Louvre\'s treasure trove of art in virtual tours online.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ']}"

      A new exhibition in Singapore delves into the teachings of artist Wu Guanzhong
  </h1>, 'text': 'Wu Guanzhong (1919-2010) is considered one of the greatest contemporary Chinese painters. He was widely recognised as a founder of modern Chinese painting, whose works fused Western and Oriental artistic traditions.\nA new exhibition at National Gallery Singapore, which opens today (Feb 20) and runs till Sep 26, is the first of its kind to showcase works by students he taught. Wu Guanzhong: Learning from the Master features over 80 works of art and archival materials from both the painter and the students he taught at China’s Central Academy of Art and Design.\nAlongside the artworks, the exhibition also features photographs and study notes from the students’ outdoor drawing lessons. Wu’s handwritten manuscripts offer collectors and art enthusiasts a deeper, more intimate look at his thoughts, and afford a greater understand of his ethos on art.\nWu Guanzhong: Learning from the Master is the fifth in a series of exhibitions at National Gallery Singapore dedicated to the artist. It continues the gallery’s curatorial approach of teaching and educating the audience on modern Chinese ink art through an exploration of Wu’s practice and pedagogy, first seen in the 2018 exhibition Wu Guanzhong: Expressions of Pen & Palette.\n“Learning from the Master embodies an important new phase of a deeper exploration into the various facets of this profilic artist’s practice, and is the culmination of the gallery’s dedication to furthering research and discourse around Wu Guanzhong’s seminal role in the development of Asian modernism,” said Dr Eugene Tan, Director of National Gallery Singapore.\nIn addition to the exhibition, National Gallery Singapore will host a free panel talk on Feb 20, available online and onsite. The panel talk features students taught by Wu.

      Love Yip Yew Chong’s murals? See more of his works at this Singapore hotel
  </h1>, 'text': 'From Tanjong Pagar to Chinatown, street artist Yip Yew Chong has been beautifying the streets of Singapore with his vibrant murals that depict his childhood memories of growing up in the city.\xa0\nFans of his work will be glad to know that from Feb 26 to Mar 31, the artist, fresh off his\xa0first solo exhibition at Art Porters Gallery, will hold an intimate exhibition titled Stories From Yesteryear at Sofitel Singapore City Centre.\nThe exhibition will feature 24 canvas paintings and four digital artworks.

      A three-storey family home in Singapore filled with local, contemporary art
  </h1>, 'text': 'It is not often that when visiting a home, the owner hands you a printed brochure that details the art collection in his house. But it was the case for this detached bungalow that belongs to the CEO of a boutique advisory firm. He is a firm supporter of the local, contemporary art scene and wanted his new house to be a canvas for this cause.\n\n\nThe artwork in this home is varied, and not presented in a sterile manner like in a white box gallery. Instead, both art and architecture fuse into a sleek but also inviting environment. The house is designed by ZA Architects, who had also designed the owner’s former home.\xa0 \xa0\n“We got to know the owners well during the construction of the first house and realised that they were pretty open-minded about ideas on spatial design and materials. So when the opportunity came to design their next house, we were prepared to offer a different design approach, which reflects their improved standard of living and lifestyle,” said Stan Lee, a partner at the Singapore-based firm.\nFor the former home, he was engaged to renovate a semi-detached house. The exterior was pleasant – though none too exciting – with cream-coloured paint and timber accents.\nThis new house is a detached bungalow on 1,168sqm of land. Apart from larger rooms and communal areas, it also gives the occupants more space for exercise and relaxation amenities.\n“During the design process, the owner sought our opinion on the pieces of art and sculpture\xa0they intended to purchase for the new house. We then decided to use off-form concrete, steel and glass, hoping to create contrast and accentuate these art pieces where appropriate inside and outside the house,” said Lee.\nThe owner lives here with his wife and two teenage daughters.\n“I have a small family so I didn’t need to maximise the gross floor area. Half the land is for recreation,” he shared. The division of land reads literally in plan, with the built-up spaces running down one side of the land’s length, and the pool and garden down the other.\nAt the end of the garden is a swing set he built for his daughters. The pool has a 30m-long side for serious laps as well as a section that extends toward the house with a Jacuzzi and shallower ring. When the daughters were young, they spent plenty of time in the latter, looked upon by the adults from the pool deck.\n\n\nIn the garden is local artist Yeo Chee Kiong’s Pet sculpture from his Ideal Lady Series. The cluster of stainless steel bubbles appears to levitate, and can be seen from the street through glass balustrades. The metallic shine and rotund forms contrast with the lush landscape and boxy architecture. \xa0 \xa0\nThe garden and main parts of the house are raised above a basement that meets the road level. This gives the occupants more privacy. In the eight-car garage, the owner highlighted a gym corner.\n“My daughters are both basketball players and I do quite a fair bit of sports,” he said of\xa0this well-used part of the home.\nLee divided the house into a front and rear bock. The former stacks a basement entertainment room, the living room and master bedroom. The latter tucks a guest room into the basement, a dining and kitchen on the first storey and the daughters’ bedrooms and a shared study on the second storey.\nIn between the two blocks is a landscaped courtyard in the basement. The owner initially wanted to construct a large treehouse here for his daughters but the fengshui master said it was inauspicious so he changed it into a Zen garden with a chessboard aesthetic. It brings plenty of daylight into the facing guest room and entertainment room, as well as provides pleasant views to admire from above.\nA mesh-and-glass corridor separates the living room from the dining room on the first floor. This gives the occupants a dose of sunshine, green views and a panorama of garden art each time they traverse between the spaces. Two spiral staircases – one from the basement and another to the roof terrace – amplify this ambulatory movement.\n“The external steel spiral staircases are used to mediate levels and more importantly, to add interest as an external architectural element. Monochrome and greyscale marble and timber for the floors and cabinetry are used extensively in the interior,” said Lee on the minimal palette.\nIn the garage behind a screened foyer, heralded by April Ng’s whimsical drawing Creating Space, one door opens to the entertainment room, and another to a staircase that leads to the first storey.\nSingapore Cultural Medallion-winner Tan Swie Hian’s calligraphic work Dragon Cypress anchors the start of this staircase, complete with a plaque on the wall describing the piece like in an art gallery as part of the owner’s desire to share with guests his interests.\nIn the entertainment room is another work by Tan Swie Hian. Sinstral Conch Stupa is the first of many Buddhist art pieces that the owner would collect over the years for aesthetic rather than religious purposes. Its colourful palette enlivens the room, just like Yeo Chee Kiong’s anime-inspired Future Weapon, Missile Mazinger artwork across the space.\nWhile in the former home, the living room was a double-volume space and the master bedroom of single-storey height, the inverse happens here. The living room height is slightly compressed in order to comply with the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s guidelines on the overall height of the house.\nLee compensates this with reflections from a water feature in the balcony and reflective ceilings, both of which give\xa0the illusion of spaciousness. From the planter in the pond arises a large Bonsai plant that the owner views as another work of art, and which he took a long time to find.\nThis strategy of expanding space upward continues in the 5m-high master bedroom. Here, Lee inserted a loft containing the owner’s study. Next to the bed, a pond in the balcony reflects the sky through an aperture in the ceiling.\nWhile the placement of several water elements around the house was for fengshui reasons, this particular feature was purely for the owner’s appreciation. “I like water, and enjoy sitting outside to enjoy the feature,” he shared. The abundance of water gives the house a tranquil atmosphere.\nThe roof terrace is the best place to view another water feature with a mosaic artwork in the garden.\n“The idea came about after the owner visited Japanese architect Tadao Ando’s Kyoto Garden of Fine Arts. He selected Claude Monet’s Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies as [the image for] the underwater mosaic artwork. Its position just next to the pool and outdoor dining area is a conversation piece when the owners host dinners,” said Lee.\nThis water feature was the first piece of art in the home. “After the owner moved in and got a sense of the spaces, more sculptures and paintings were introduced at strategic locations,” said Lee.\nThe house is not filled to the brim with art, but each is thoughtfully placed and is an interesting commentary on Singapore’s social, historical and physical narrative. It is easy to understand how guests might arrive\xa0enticed by the bold architecture but leave with a deeper appreciation of local art.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     House ', '     Family ', '     property ', '     real estate ', '     art ', '     homes ', '     Residences ']}"

      Singapore street artist Yip Yew Chong’s first series of nostalgic paintings sells out in a flash
  </h1>, 'text': 'Cats may be the Internet’s favourite animal, but that is not why artist Yip Yew Chong paints them into his hugely popular murals that depict his nostalgic memories of Singapore.\nThe 52-year-old, whose oft-photographed life-sized murals can be found on the walls of buildings all around Singapore, including Chinatown, Tiong Bahru and even Woodlands, says he began painting moggies for historical accuracy.\n“In the old days, cats roamed the streets and were everywhere. My family even kept cats – not as pets but for catching rats,” said the youthful-looking Yip, who also depicts other commonly found domestic animals of early Singapore, such as dogs, chickens and ducks in his murals.\n\n\n“But after a while, I noticed that the people who enjoyed the murals specifically looked out for cats, so sometimes I even hide them in my paintings,” the self-taught artist added with a laugh.\nThis popular demand is one of the reasons why these cute felines can be spotted in five paintings in Yip’s first solo gallery show Something Somewhere Somewhen at Art Porters Gallery.\nThe ongoing exhibition, which opened on Jan 12 and runs till Mar 14, features vignettes inspired by his street art such as a sleeping cat painted directly onto a vintage wooden chair, a “flatlay” of a Chinese reunion dinner on a laminated table top as well as canvas paintings of traditional masks and lanterns.\nAll of these images – spanning 27 canvases and 15 sets of old-school objects like enamel plates and wooden washing boards – will certainly strike a chord among those who are familiar with Yip’s work. The paintings, which ranged in price from S$600 to S$11,000, have since sold out\xa0as collectors snapped up the opportunity to own a slice of nostalgia.\n“Yew Chong is a popular artist whose work has touched almost everyone, even in a city as diverse as Singapore, from locals and expats to the tourists who visit. You can enjoy the murals for free but they may disappear from the buildings some day and may eventually become very rare,” said Guillaume Levy-Lambert, co-founder of Art Porters Gallery.\n“Yew Chong is a popular artist whose work has touched almost everyone… You can enjoy the murals for free but they may disappear from the buildings some day and may eventually become very rare.” – Guillaume Levy-Lambert\nThe duo struck up a friendship after Yip began painting in the Spottiswoode and Everton Park neighbourhoods, where the gallery is also located. During Singapore’s circuit breaker period last year, Levy-Lambert approached Yip with the idea to hold a solo show – something that the latter had always dreamt of doing.\n“Because of the absence of tourists, we decided to focus on a theme that would resonate with locals. Plus, I wanted my first solo exhibition to be associated with how I became an artist – which is through my murals,” said Yip, who took about four months to paint the series.\nA former accountant, Yip began painting murals in 2015 as a hobby before leaving his job in 2018 to become a full-time artist. With his time freed up as he could not go out to paint murals during the circuit breaker, he jumped at the chance to take his work from the great outdoors to the comforts of a studio, he added with a laugh.\nInterestingly, while his works have a sense of familiarity about them – Yip says he often meets people who tell him that he has captured scenes straight out of their childhoods – they are all a product of his memories and imagination.\n“Most of the time, I draw inspiration from my memories, childhood and travels. To prepare for a painting, I sometimes look at Google for images to get the details of a specific item. But what I remember clearly and try to convey are the ambiance and mood of the scenes that I paint, such as evoking the sound of dripping water or the smell of the fabric that my grandmother used to sew,” he said.\nThis elusive “nostalgic spirit” is precisely why Levy-Lambert believes Yip’s work is worth investing in.\n“What I find exceptional about his work is that it is popular. I immensely respect the fact that everybody likes his art. Some may think it is simple but simplicity is a quality – it talks about the everyday in an authentic way and this exhibition also showcases the depth of his practice,” he said.\nThe title of the exhibition draws attention to this sense of capturing a moment in time. Yip added, “I would like people to come and view the paintings and ponder how and why they look familiar. Have you seen them somewhere and somehow from your grandmother’s stories? With Singapore developing so rapidly, I wanted to bring back that kind of poignant feeling that people have when thinking about the past.”\nThere is more up this painter’s sleeve. “Yew Chong wanted to offer a slice of what people know about him, but this is not the end point, it is his starting point and there is much more to look forward to,” said Levy-Lambert.\nYip is slated to launch another exhibition in February which will feature larger panoramic scenes of people.\n“I am an explorer and I like to travel, detour and go off course. It is the same with my art,” he said. Already a sought after mural artist – in pre-pandemic times, he travelled to countries like Malaysia, Cambodia and India to paint – he hopes to take part in more art exhibitions overseas in the future.\n“I would like to devote more time to painting canvases and installations and I may consider making videos. But the aim of my art is to relate to people and to explore local life.

      Singapore Art Week: Here's our recommended itinerary for an artful day out
  </h1>, 'text': ""If you’re running out of activities to do over the weekend, there's\xa0good news. The highlight of Singapore’s visual arts calendar, also known as Singapore Art Week (SAW), returns from Jan 22 to Jan 30\xa0for its ninth edition, bringing with it more than 100 programmes that take place all over the island.\nSpend a day\xa0to check out all that Singapore Art Week\xa0has to offer. Here's what we plan to do.\xa0\n10AM: BUS.STOP.ART\nStart off your morning by heading on an adventure. These days, art doesn’t have to be consumed the traditional way – in a gallery or museum. How about hopping on a bus, and checking out art installations along the way?\nCurated by Amelia Abdullahsani and Merryn Trevethan, Bus.Stop.Art is an innovative public art exhibition constituting art installations and interventions by Singapore-based artists along the route of bus 175.\nThe route begins at Lor 1 Geylang, before winding past\xa0Bugis, Orchard Road, Bukit Merah and Alexandra, terminating at Clementi Interchange. At 10 bus stops along the way, you’ll spot artworks by Singapore-based artists Alecia Neo, Rizman Putra, The Next Most Famous Artist and more.\n12PM: NETWORKED BODIES\nMake your way over to Gillman Barracks, Singapore’s contemporary art cluster where a number of exhibitions are taking place. Our picks include\xa0Networked Bodies (9 Lock Road, #02-21),\xa0an exhibition that seeks to investigate communication and intimacy through the Internet.\xa0This exhibition will feature digital works, media installations, and works that use social media as a platform.\n2PM: LUNCH AT MASONS, DESSERT AT CREAMIER\n\n\nA post shared by Creamier Handcrafted Ice Cream (@creamier_sg)\nIt’s time for a lunch break. You can dine in a pre-war, colonial-style building at Masons, a restaurant serving European cuisine with a strong French influence and a Singaporean touch, situated in Gillman Barracks.\nFor dessert, there's also Creamier, which serves up handcrafted artisanal ice-cream along with a range of coffees.\n3PM: SINGAPORE CERAMICS NOW 2021\nYour arty day continues. Also at Gillman Barracks is\xa0Singapore Ceramics Now 2021: Marking Making is one of the largest surveys of ceramic art in local art history since the 90s. This exhibition focuses on contemporary ceramics made by Singapore-based artists. There will be a line-up of engaging and immersive programmes with artists in conversation, live demonstrations, audience participatory performances as well as experimental sound performances.\n4PM: RESITUATING HOME(MAKING): HYPER-MATERIAL DOMESTICITY \nLeaving\xa0Gillman Barracks,\xa0make your way over to Cuturi Gallery on Aliwal Street. This exhibition, organised by Tekad Kolektif, centres itself around domesticity, craft and the feminine, working beyond the artifice of the art-versus-craft hierarchy.\nFour artists – Amirah Raudhah, Dipali Gupta, Fatima Bano, and Masuri Mazlan – will present works looking at the domestic realm as a means of elevated expression. The exhibition features a range of artworks from paintings, sculptures, new media, and installation art, as well as artist-run workshops on various craft-making techniques.\n5PM: TIPPLES AT ATLAS\n\n\nA post shared by ATLAS (@atlasbarsg)\nAs the evening comes around, how about\xa0a cocktail or two? Head over to ATLAS\xa0at Parkview Square, ranked No.4 on the World's 50 Best Bars list and home to the world’s largest gin collection. Opt for a Gin Tower Experience (a guided tour of the collection) or just sit back and enjoy a gin-based concoction. Reservations recommended.\xa0\n6.30PM: DINNER AT NATIONAL KITCHEN BY VIOLET OON\n\n\nA post shared by Violet Oon Singapore (@violetoonsingapore)\nThe facades of major art institutions, such as National Gallery Singapore and The Arts House, will once again be enveloped by art installations and light projections for the Light to Night festival, a key component of Singapore Art Week.\nBut first, dinner. Feast on local flavours at National Kitchen by Violet Oon, located within the National Gallery itself. Specialties at the restaurant include Buah Keluak Ayam, Kueh Pie Tee, Dry Laksa and more. Reservations recommended.\xa0\n8PM: LIGHT TO NIGHT FESTIVAL\nYou’re now fuelled for the night. Venture around the Civic District, starting with the National Gallery, of course, before making your way to the Padang, Asian Civilisations Museum and The Arts House.\nThis year’s theme, “____-in-Progress”, \xa0is inspired by current times and is set to explore “the idea of things evolving, growing and being in flux”, National Gallery said on its website. Change, after all, is the only constant in life, no?\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Activities ', '     Singapore ', '     Luxury Destinations ']}"

      2020’s most painstakingly-produced watch dials and why they matter
  </h1>, 'text': 'A lot of what makes a mechanical watch a luxury product is hidden inside, blinged out cases notwithstanding. But the value of a metiers d’art (loosely translated as artistic) watch is much more apparent. They’re beautiful, they’re handmade, and they’re often one-of-a-kind. As far as astronomically high-value items go, rare handcrafts don’t really need to justify their price tags.\nEven during a time when lavish spending isn’t at the top of most people’s minds, it’s comforting to know that art – yes, even the priced-out-of-reach kind – is still being made. And this year’s crop of tickers have given us some sumptuous masterpieces for our eyes to feast on.\n\n\nAmong the brightest to shine in the lineup is Dior. Splendid stones can stand on the strength of their cut and resplendence alone, but the art of gem-setting is not one to be dismissed. In the right hands, even the most mundane motifs can come alive in magical ways. Part of Dior’s 2020 high jewellery watches are a trio of one-off models featuring bejewelled bees.\nThe dial, already blanketed in snow-set diamonds (where stones of different sizes appear scattered in a random pattern with as little metal showing as possible), is further decorated with a bee made with a smorgasbord of gems, such as emeralds, pink sapphires, rubies, opals, and even feathers.\nInspired by Christian Dior’s rose gardens and the tireless bees that populate them, the fantastical recreations even have spring-set wings that will flutter whenever the watch moves.\nGardens are full of muses for jewellers, and Harry Winston has chosen the floral route in its Premier Hypnotic Chrysanthemum Automatic 36mm, choosing peacock opals for its multiple tonalities of blue and green.\nTo create depth, the gem-setters had to work in layers, the first of which is composed of 60 baguette-cut diamonds. On top of them come 32 marquise-cut and 160 brilliant-cut diamonds interspersed between the opals. Framing all of that is an 18K white gold case set with 161 baguette-cut diamonds using the challenging invisible setting that conceals the metal framework below.\nUnless you’re a man of very specific tastes, such high jewellery creations are usually intended for women. But the wonderful thing about metiers d’art is that there are techniques that transcend gender expectations.\nWhen Vacheron Constantin decided to add to its La Musique du Temps series this year, it chose to honour the musical theme not with minute repeaters galore like it did for 2019, but a quartet of unique dials, each featuring a different songbird.\nWith champleve enamel bringing the birds to life on the left side of the dial and hand-turned guilloche on the right serving as the backdrop to the wandering hours-style time indication, the Les Cabinotiers Singing Birds are artistry and horology combined. While everyone is welcome to appreciate their beauty, not everyone can lay claim to them, as there is only one of each made.\nYou’d stand a better chance obtaining one of Cartier’s artistic creations. The first is the Ronde Louis Cartier Straw and Gold Marquetry. Now that marquetry has enjoyed its moment in watchmaking in recent years, using everything from leather to butterfly wings, Cartier has decided to keep things interesting by piecing together two materials – straw and gold – to depict its beloved panther motif.\xa0\nThis wonderfully textured dial was created with 75 blades of straw in 11 colours, more than 65 pieces of satin-finished gold pieces as well as enamel in various shades. Of the 100 hours it takes to make one watch, 97 are spent on the dial alone.\nThe second watch is the Ronde Louis Cartier Enamel Filigree. Here a glittering panther prowls through a bamboo forest made of rods of enamel fastened to the case with strands of yellow gold. In the background, champleve enamel and miniature painting was used to create a dynamic nighttime background. Both panther watches are limited to just 30 pieces each.\nBut don’t be fooled into a thinking a simpler looking dial takes less time or effort. The two Hermes Arceau Cheval Cosmique watches, which feature the brand’s famous cosmic horse motif from Italian printmaker Gianpaolo Pagni, have now been rendered in white gold, taking craftsmen almost a week to complete. These too have a small run of 24 pieces each for the mother-of-pearl or aventurine dial.\nMetiers d’art watches aren’t rare for the sake of it. There just aren’t many people who are at the skill level these brands (and prices) demand. High-end mechanical watches cost what they do not just because of the precious metals they use (if even that) but because some processes are still painstakingly done by hand.\nWhile it’s true that there are some components and operations that need to be automated for the sake of precision, others, like finishing and assembling for instance, can be done by hand.\nBut when it comes to metiers d’art, anything short of the meticulous actions undertaken by an individual who has dedicated their life to perfect a skill most of the world has forgotten about would defeat its entire purpose.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     art ', '     Accessories ']}"

      'It's about artists helping artists': Art world star gives back by buying work of undiscovered
  </h1>, 'text': 'Painter Guy Stanley Philoche, a star in the New York art world, had wanted to treat himself to a fancy watch after a hugely successful gallery show. Then the pandemic hit, and he feared for all the struggling artists who haven\'t been so lucky.\nSo he gave up his US$15,000 Rolex dreams and went on a different kind of buying spree, putting out a call on Instagram in late March to any artist anywhere who had creations to sell. The submissions rolled in, hundreds at a time.\nHe’s spent about US$60,000 so far with plans to continue as long as he can, and Philoche\'s own patrons have taken notice and asked him to make purchases on their behalf as well.\n“It\'s about artists helping artists,"" said the 43-year-old Philoche, who came to America from Haiti with his family at age three, nearly nothing to their names.\n“I\'m not a rich man,"" he said, ""but I owe a big debt to the art world. Art saved my life, and I made a promise to myself that once I made it, to always buy from artists who hadn\'t gotten their big break.”\nPhiloche has a budget, seeking out works in the US$300 to US$500 range. He buys only what he loves, from as far away as London and as close as the studio next to his in East Harlem. An abstract mixed-media piece by Michael Shannon, his studio neighbour, was his first purchase, leading Philoche to include him and others he\'s discovered in an upcoming group gallery show.\nAbout half the artists Philoche has chosen are people he knows, many in New York. The others sent him direct messages on Instagram with sample work in hopes of being picked.\nPhiloche, who went to art school in Connecticut where his family settled, has lined the walls of his tiny apartment with his Philoche Collection During Covid, ranging from graffiti-inspired work and portraiture to pop art and a huge pistol done in bright yellow, red and blue paint.\nPhiloche\'s own work goes for up to US$125,000 a piece. During a recent interview at his studio, he slid out from storage large canvases from his breakthrough, Mark Rothko-esque abstract Untitled Series and a collection of female nudes with duct tape over their mouths. Often whimsical, he has also produced paintings inspired by Monopoly and other board games, as well as comics such as Charlie Brown.\nAmong his clients: Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch and Barclay Investments Inc, along with Uma Thurman, George Clooney and fellow artist Julian Schnabel.\nGiving back isn\'t something the affable Philoche just recently decided to do. Over his 20-plus year career, he has tried to stick to a simple rule to support other artists: Sell a painting, buy a painting. But it was a chance meeting with a friend and fellow artist who was anxious about the pandemic with a baby on the way that set him on his pandemic buying spree.\n“I\'m not on the first line, but my community was impacted as well,” he said. “It was just the right thing to do. I love waking up in my apartment every morning seeing the walls. There\'s paintings on the floor, all over. Some of these people have never sold a painting in their life.”\nHis feisty French bulldog Picasso at his side, Philoche recalled his own meager start in New York after he put himself through art school while working full-time as a bartender.\n“People didn\'t open the doors for me. I had to get into the room through the back door, or through the window,"" he said with a laugh. ""But now that I\'m in the room, with a seat at the table, I have to open doors for these artists.”\n(Source: AP)\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ']}"

      Kendo, Karate, Sumo: The rare Japanese whisky set with martial arts illustrations
  </h1>, 'text': 'In spite of a pandemic, the rare Japanese whisky market has performed exceedingly well. According to the Japanese 100 Index, which tracks the performance of Japanese drams, the prices of Japanese whisky surged 300 per cent from 2014 to 2020. In comparison, the price of gold surged by 60 per cent during the same period.\n\n\nOnline spirits retailer Dekanta has now unveiled a private bottling of rare Karuizawa single malt that’s sure to attract collectors, especially those interested in Japanese art and culture.\nEach\xa0bottle\xa0in The Budo Collection – Karuizawa 35 Year Old\xa0Japanese Single Cask Whisky features art from one of three Japanese street artists, individually hand-painted and inspired by\xa0Japanese martial\xa0arts – Kendo, Karate and Sumo.\nBudo is a Japanese term to describe martial\xa0arts, and translates to “The Martial Way”. The name was chosen to celebrate the dedication to craft, which is shared by martial arts practitioners, street artists and master distillers alike.\nThe streets artists all have a background in martial arts. PHIL, founder of SCA-Crew, a group of prominent streets artists who work between Tokyo and Kanagawa, painted a Yokozuna (a grand champion sumo wrestler) in stance for the Sharanui style opening ceremony.\nFATE, also from the SCA-Crew, represented Kendo with an abstract design that incorporates details such as the Shinai sword and the Japanese dragonfly.\xa0\nTwoOne, a Yokohama-born contemporary artist recognised globally for his large-scale mural works, painted the controversial karate master Masutatsu Oyama, founder of Kyokushin Karate.\nThe martial arts influence extends to the display on which the bottles sit. “Our stand takes influence from traditional outdoor Sumo Dohyo\xa0and traditional Japanese roof structures, but with a modern twist,” said Stu Cox, Head of Design at Dekanta.\xa0\n“We thought it was fitting to place these spectacular bottles, filled with liquid from the iconic Karuizawa distillery, at the centre of our arena; the place where the culmination of years of training and dedication are put to the test under the eyes of the attentive audience.”\nThis release from Dekanta\xa0is likely to be among the very final casks from Karuizawa to be bottled. Closed in 2000, the Karuizawa distillery has enjoyed increased interest since. Demand for stock from the distillery has increased dramatically, along with the price of the remaining bottles, which have reached\xa0tens and hundreds of thousands of US dollars on the secondary market.\n“This collection has been many years in the making, intended to celebrate the craft of Japanese modern martial arts, and draw parallels between the discipline of their practice and that of artists and master distillers in Japan,” said Makiyo Masa, Founder and Director of Dekanta.\xa0\n“With that in mind, the collection has gained new significance in light of a year in which so many sporting, art and cultural events have sadly been cancelled.”\nThe Budo Collection – Karuizawa 35 Year Old Japanese Single Cask Whisky is a limited edition of only 129 bottles, comprising 43 sets of three bottles each, available at dekanta.com. Bottles go on sale on Nov 19.\n""This collection has been many years in the making, intended to celebrate the craft of Japanese modern martial arts, and draw parallels between the discipline of their practice and that of artists and master distillers in Japan.""\xa0– Makiyo Masa\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ']}"

      Artist gives life to Belgian boot scrapers during pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'ANTWERP: Life can feel smaller, even tiny during the COVID-19 pandemic as public health restrictions limit social contacts to a bare minimum. But Belgian artist Elke Lemmens has found a way to build connections during the ongoing crisis.\nShe is using her artistic skills and a community-building grant from the city of Antwerp to bring ordinary lives - and extraordinary stories -\xa0out into the open by giving disused boot scrapers a second act. Lemmens will use the grant to install at least 50 miniature scenes in the old niches outside homes that families once used to clean off their shoes.\nThese dusty architectural remnants of an age when muddy roads and the absence of sidewalks made rubbing one\'s footwear over metal a prerequisite for going indoors blend into cityscapes from Europe to the United States, failing to attract notice since doormats replaced them.\n“So many people have so many stories behind their doors,"" Lemmens said as she uses tweezers to move miniature figures into cigar boxes. “Every one of these stories fits into one of these wooden cigar cases, and then I write the names of the (property) owners in chalk on the front.""\nShe plans to put her creations in various neighborhoods around Antwerp. One boot scraper depicts the prison cell of Belgian writer Roger van de Velde, who was held in a psychiatric prison because of a painkiller addiction. On a short street not far away, another ground-level scene conveys a message of diversity with people walking across a rainbow crosswalk.\nAnother household\'s scraper compartment shows people standing on a globe. Lemmens made it for a family that enjoys traveling and has relatives around the world.\n“Finding the figures is sometimes difficult” the artist said. “There are not a lot of models of people of color or people in different religious dress and other things. I often need to paint these myself.”\nOther niches hold stories that are deeply personal.\nDown a residential street lined with colorful houses, a white door has a message scratched onto it: “Here lived and played Tia -\xa0Apr\xa011, 2006 - Sep 12, 2015.”\n“This boot scraper scene is for this 9-year-old girl who used to sit on the doorstep,” Lemmens explained.\xa0\n“She unfortunately died in 2015. When I spoke with Tia’s mother, she mentioned that her daughter never stopped dreaming of another world. Her dream was to ride a horse on a beach. So, I created this scene in her boot scraper with the little girl riding a horse on the seaside surrounded by other children. The story was an inspiration to me that this little girl had the freedom in her mind to create her own ideal world.”\nCreating in miniature is something Lemmens has done since childhood.\n“I always played with Lego. I would put together a bakery, but then mold the croissants and breads and cakes out of clay myself and paint them different colors,” she said. “Then I started making things out of balsa wood because it’s easy to carve. My dad is a hobby carpenter, so I guess the influence always made me feel handy.”\nThe boot scraper project is certain to arouse curiosity during the months ahead in Antwerp, where a partial lockdown has residents not venturing far from home and keeping their distance from others. For some, a simple evening walk can feel like an adventure.\n“Soon, there will be a walking map so people can find these boot scraper scenes,” Lemmens said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Belgium ', '     art ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Sulap sampah jadi wayang, seniman Indonesia ini bercita-cita jaga warisan budaya Nusantara
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Ada sesuatu yang memukau dari wayang buatan Iskandar Hardjodimuljo yang sekilas tampak sederhana.\nWayang-wayang ciptaan seniman Indonesia ini\xa0jauh dari kesan elegan dan mewah\xa0layaknya wayang tradisional milik dalang-dalang kenamaan yang biasa berpentas di sasana-sasana besar nan megah.\nJustru sebaliknya,\xa0wayang-wayang Iskandar\xa0dihiasi dengan warna-warna cerah dan mentereng, dicat secara serampangan, serta diperuntukkan bagi anak-anak sekolah dan rakyat biasa.\nTetapi yang lebih\xa0menarik lagi, wayang-wayang uwuh (yang dalam Bahasa Jawa berarti ""sampah"") itu tidak dipahat dari kulit ataupun kayu, melainkan terbuat dari kertas kardus dan karton bekas, serta limbah botol plastik dan tempat makanan yang telah usang.\n“Lewat wayang uwuh, ada pesan lingkungan hidup, budaya dan sosial,” kata pria yang berusia 55 tahun ini kepada CNA.\n“Saya ingin memperkenalkan wayang kepada semua orang, terutama anak-anak. Saya juga ingin mengajarkan bahwa sampah bisa diubah menjadi karya seni dan sesuatu yang mempunyai nilai dan manfaat tinggi.”\nAWALNYA ""KARENA HOBI""\nIskandar memang sudah tertarik dengan wayang semenjak kecil. Ia lahir dan besar di sebuah kampung di pinggiran Yogyakarta, yaitu kota yang dikenal sebagai pusat kebudayaan Jawa dan tempat terakhir di mana seorang\xa0sultan Jawa masih\xa0bertakhta.\nNamun dia tak pernah bermimpi untuk menjadi seorang seniman, apalagi seorang pembuat wayang.\n“Waktu SMA, saya pernah membuat batik dengan motif wayang. Waktu kuliah, saya sama sekali tidak tertarik mengembangkan jiwa seni saya,” katanya.\nMalahan kecintaannya pada dunia seni tumbuh saat dia mulai\xa0bekerja sebagai seorang akuntan, sebuah profesi yang ditekuninya selama 25 tahun.\n“Saya melukis karena hobi. Saya belajar secara otodidak. Tetapi saya selalu melukis wayang dari dulu, untuk mengenang masa kecil saya. Waktu kecil, saya sering menonton wayang di kampung,” kata Iskandar.\nLambat laun, Iskandar mulai dikenal sebagai satu dari segelintir seniman yang menggeluti seni\xa0melukis wayang secara khusus. Di sekitar tahun 2000-an, dia mulai ikut pameran.\n“Prosesnya panjang. Tetapi, pada akhirnya saya memutuskan untuk menjadi seniman,” katanya. Iskandar berhenti bekerja sebagai akuntan pada tahun 2012.\nSaat itu, Iskandar hanya melukis tokoh-tokoh wayang di atas kanvas. Ia baru membuat wayang pertamanya di tahun 2013.\n“Saya ikut pameran Jakarta Biennale. Waktu itu temanya, ‘Seni di Antara Kita’,” katanya.\n“Saya waktu itu jadi relawan, mengajar di kampung seni di pinggiran Sungai Ciliwung. Tahun itu banjir besar. Jadi ada banyak plastik, triplek, botol yang hanyut ke kampung tempat saya jadi relawan,” kata Iskandar. “Saya langsung punya ide. Saya bisa bikin wayang dari benda-benda ini.” \xa0\xa0\nMeskipun awalnya\xa0wayang uwuh\xa0hanyalah\xa0sebuah proyek sampingan untuk pameran, karya seni ini kemudian menjadi sebuah obsesi bagi Iskandar.\n“Saya suka membuat wayang dari sampah. Saya bisa berinovasi dengan bahan-bahan yang berbeda. Kreatifitas kita jadi tertantang.

      Meet the Indonesian artist who turns household waste into shadow puppets
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: There is a rustic feel and charm to the shadow puppets produced by Indonesian artist Iskandar Hardjodimuljo. \xa0\nThey are far from being the\xa0exquisite, classical work of art meant for the hands of seasoned puppet masters who frequently perform in large concert halls and royal courts.\xa0\nInstead, they are crudely painted in bright and bold colours, meant to be sold to - sometimes gifted to -\xa0school children and members of the public.\xa0\nBut the biggest difference from\xa0the traditional version is that Hardjodimuljo’s wayang (puppets) are not intricately carved out of dried leather or wood, but\xa0old cardboard boxes, discarded plastic bottles and food containers.\n\n\n“Through my wayang, I want to convey environmental, cultural and social messages,” the 55-year-old artist told CNA.\n“I want to introduce people to wayang, especially children. I also want to teach them that waste\xa0can be transformed into works of art and something of great value and use.”\nHOW IT ALL BEGAN\nHardjodimuljo has always been fascinated with wayang since he was a child growing up in a village just outside of Yogyakarta City, the cultural epicentre of Java where the last reigning Javanese sultan resides.\nBut he never thought of pursuing a career as an artist, let alone a puppet maker. “In high school, I once made batik with wayang motif. In university, I wasn’t interested in art at all.”\n\n\nHis passion for art only blossomed after he became an accountant, a profession he held for 25 years.\n“I painted as a hobby. I was completely self-taught and my subject of choice has always been wayang to reminisce my childhood watching all the wayang plays performed at my village,” he said. \xa0\nSlowly, Hardjodimuljo’s reputation for being one of just a handful of artists who exclusively chose the subject of wayang for their paintings grew. He started getting invitations to participate in art exhibitions in the 2000s.\n“It was a long process. But I decided to become an artist full time,” he said, adding that he quit\xa0his accounting job in 2012.\nAt the time, Hardjodimuljo was only painting wayang characters on canvas. He made his first puppet in 2013.\n“I was participating in the Jakarta Biennale exhibition. The theme (of the exhibition) was ‘Art among Us,’” he said.\n\n\n“At the time I was a volunteer teaching art at a kampung on the banks of Ciliwung River. There was a big flood that year and the waters washed plastics, plywood and bottles to the place I was in,” the artist continued. “I thought to myself, I could make wayang out of these things.”\nWhat started as an exhibition project for Hardjodimuljo soon became an obsession.\n“I like making wayang out of trash. I can innovate with different materials. It pushes my creativity. Whenever I look at trash I immediately think, ‘What can I make out of this?’” he said.\nHIS UNIQUE SHADOW PUPPETS\nHardjodimuljo proudly displays a collection of his Wayang Uwuh - uwuh means trash in Javanese - in his studio, along with several canvas and glass paintings depicting his favourite subject -\xa0wayang.\nOn the floor of his tiny studio were puppets made out of flattened water bottles and corrugated plastic sheets adorned by nothing more than black, detailed outlines of their faces and outfits.\nThe more colourful puppets are usually made out of cardboard, food containers and paper boxes and painted with acrylic paints and permanent markers.\nWhile there are many artists creating art from recycled materials, Hardjodimuljo is the only one which transforms them into wayang.\n“I want to revive interests in our cultural heritage. Wayang is becoming less and less popular among youths. They care more about Western and modern music and art,” he said.\nPRESERVING CULTURAL HERITAGE\nHardjodimuljo said he wanted to show young people that wayang is just as exciting as modern art. For a start, there are hundreds of characters in shadow puppetry, each with its\xa0own physical and emotional traits and unique magical powers.\nThere are wayang characters who can fly and penetrate the earth. Some have toxic feet and are impervious to any conceivable weapon. \xa0\n“Wayang in Indonesia also has many styles unique to different places throughout Java, Bali, Lombok and Sumatra,” he said.\nAnd the artist tried to incorporate the different characters and styles in his work. “So people will appreciate our rich culture,” he said.\nHardjodimuljo said Wayang Uwuh has afforded him the recognition he longed as an artist. Through his efforts in turning waste\xa0into wayang, he has been invited to stage exhibitions\xa0across the world, from Thailand to Italy.\nHe also hosts workshops for children and aspiring artists, teaching them the ropes on how to turn waste\xa0into puppets.\n“Although I have been to many countries, nothing gives me more joy than teaching Indonesian children about wayang and the art of puppet making from trash,” he said. \xa0\xa0\n“Right now, I am the only one who consistently makes wayang out of trash. My dream is there will be many more people who are interested in turning wastes into works of art as well as preserving our cultural heritage.”\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia here.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     art ']}"

      Keeping it old school: A man's 40-year passion in lantern making for Mid-Autumn in Malaysia
  </h1>, 'text': 'TELUK INTAN, Perak: The living room of the Wong family was\xa0like a whimsical zoo of small fanciful animals.\xa0\nRabbits, fishes and mice crowded the floor, leaving little space to move about, as the majestic dragons kept watch.\xa0\nMade of iridescent cellophane paper, these are lanterns for the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration, a candle-lit companion as Chinese families admire the bright full moon and savour wedges of mooncakes.\nMr Wong Choo Koh, 76, makes each and every of these lanterns by hand.\xa0\nSeated cross-legged on the floor, he crouched over an aged wooden block that has nails marking the outline of a rabbit. His wrinkly hands guided strands of wires around the nails, and in no time, the frame of a rabbit lantern has taken shape.\xa0\n“This is one of the conventional lantern designs,” the grandfather of five\xa0said. Scribbled with measurements, the wooden block is among the oldest in his possession, dating\xa0back to some 40 years ago when he began to dabble in lantern making.\nIt was his wife’s family that was - and still is - in this cottage industry, churning out cellophane lanterns that are sold all over the country. By observing how she and the rest of the family members produce these lanterns, he started making his own in his spare time.\xa0\nToday, Teluk Intan - a town built around the oxbow meander of the Perak River and about two hours north of Kuala Lumpur - has 11 lantern making families, said Ms Wong Lih Jiun, the youngest of Mr Wong’s four children.\xa0Ten of the 11 families are related,\xa0she said. \xa0\nMr Wong, now retired, is giving his full attention to lantern making. Not satisfied with just producing the common ones, he has added new designs to his repertoire, with a few being introduced every year.\xa0\nWhat sustained him over the years are his creative flair and an almost mischievous competitiveness to outshine the rest.\nHANDMADE ALL YEAR ROUND\xa0\nLantern making is a year-round undertaking, not just when the eighth lunar month approaches. \xa0\nBefore he begins the actual making process, Mr Wong has to get the small parts ready. Wire strands are snipped and organised according to their sizes, so they are within easy reach as he assembles the lanterns.\nEach lantern design has a dedicated wooden block for Mr Wong to shape the wires into frames. Two frames are held together by connectors and a stick candle holder to become a three-dimensional structure.\nAfter each structure is assembled, he places it on the floor to check for balance, giving it a few gentle squeezes until he is satisfied with the overall look.\xa0\nSeveral part-timers, mostly housewives operating out of their own homes, will then glue the trimmed cellophane papers onto the structure, according to the colour combination picked by Mr Wong.\xa0\nNext, Mr Wong and his children will be adding on the final touches. Using brushes, they draw scales for the fish, teeny nose for the mouse, claws for the dragon and decorative strokes here and there.\xa0\n“Concentration is the key, my mum once said. We have to give our full attention, always planning where the next stroke should go,” Ms Wong said, recalling a conversation with her late mother.\xa0\nWhen lit with candles, these lanterns give a soft, atmospheric glow, their patterned shadow casting on the expectant faces of little kids.\xa0\nThe excitement of playing with candle fires probably explains why the cellophane lanterns have remained popular among the children. Even the battery-operated plastic lanterns, which play music at the flick of a switch, have failed to unseat them as a festival staple.\xa0\n“Lanterns dotted with gold glittering powder, such as fishes, rabbits, dragons and butterflies, are the most marketable styles,” Mr Wong said. \xa0\nHe wholesales up to 8,000 lanterns of about 30 designs every year, mostly to retailers in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. His lanterns have also reached as far as Singapore, Canada, Taiwan, China and Indonesia via resellers.\xa0\nIn Petaling Street, the “Chinatown” of Kuala Lumpur, handmade cellophane lanterns of varying sizes, models and intricacy are sold between RM10 (US$2.40) and RM40 in shops specialised in home decorations, party supplies and knick-knacks.\xa0\nEven though these cellophane lanterns do not come with a label or trademark, Mr Wong can instantly identify his own. His keen attention to details aside, it is his designs that stand out, he said.\xa0\nPIGLETS, SEALS AND KANGAROOS\nDecades ago, seven or eight lantern makers scattered in Kampar, Ipoh and Teluk Anson (now Teluk Intan) were among the pioneers in making these cellophane lanterns, Mr Wong said.\xa0\nThey referred to\xa0each other’s designs and made similar lanterns. Over time, more\xa0designs were created.\xa0\n“Today, the one who comes out with the most beautiful, and the most number of designs, is me,” Mr Wong said, as Ms Wong burst into laughter at his unabashed pride in his work.\xa0\nMouse, kangaroo, dolphin, and piglet, bee and tortoise are among the styles he has made. There is also a seal balancing a ball on its nose, a\xa0bead necklace on its neck exuding the circus vibe.\nA snake - an uncommon choice - is one of the latest that has yet to be marketed. The innovation process is slow-moving; it takes weeks for an idea to be sketched, perfected and transferred onto the wooden block.\xa0\n“The snake took me at least three weeks. I looked at it for a bit, then set it aside for a bit.\xa0\n“After I nailed the outline and made a wire structure, it didn’t feel quite right. It was out of shape, so I had to remove the nails and start all over again,” Mr Wong explained.\xa0\nEven though a particular animal style has been put into mass production, he still revisits the design and fine-tunes as he sees fit.\xa0\n“Can you tell how much time I spent? I am most satisfied and happy when I succeed in making a new design,” he said.\xa0\nWhenever a new design has been created, Mr Wong is in no rush to boast about it to fellow craftsmen. “They can see from the shops later,” he said. \xa0\nNaturally, he also obliges when his children and grandchildren ask for certain designs. Ms Wong, for instance, had asked for a unicorn while his grandchild had asked for a horse, both of which were delivered.\xa0\nINHERITING THE ART OF LANTERN MAKING\xa0\nHaving grown up surrounded by cellophane lanterns and helping to make them all these years, Ms Wong has developed a strong sentimental attachment to these Mid-Autumn toys.\xa0\nShe keeps a collection of about 30 lanterns in her room, and declares that each is her favourite. “They are equally meaningful to me. Each was designed by my father, and made with skills handed down from my grandmother and mother,” she said.\xa0\nAs the publication officer of a local university in Selangor, Ms Wong travels home almost every weekend. While at home, she busies herself with the lanterns.\xa0\n“I watched the adults make\xa0the lanterns when I was small, and I really wanted to be part of it. Finally one day, I was asked to help out. My other siblings were involved since primary school too.\n“It has become a habit. It’s something we have been making since young, it’s also about inheriting the folk art,” she said.\xa0\nThese cellophane lanterns are part of the childhood of many people in Malaysia,\xa0even though they might not personally know the craftsmen behind the seasonal items. “We may not have spent our childhood together but this item was once your companion. This, for me, is a different kind of ‘yuan fen,’” Ms Wong said, referring to the special bond in the Chinese concept of fate.\xa0\nFrom the business perspective, the trade is not a particularly lucrative one. Since it is a seasonal product, makers have to be supplemented by other income sources.\xa0\nMr Wong is also pragmatic about the future of this craft: “If one day no one is willing to carry on with the trade anymore, it only means they have better career pursuits.”\xa0\nBut for now, the Wong family will continue making the lanterns for as long as they can.\xa0\n“I feel blessed that this type of lanterns still exists and continues to be in demand, after all these years,” Ms Wong said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     Mid-Autumn Festival ', '     art ']}"

      As tourist flow stops, Bali’s craftsmen struggle to market their work online
  </h1>, 'text': 'BALI: It had been weeks since a customer last stepped inside Safira Klau Gallery, a small art and furniture shop in the Kerobokan area of Bali, Indonesia.\xa0\nThe area used to be buzzing with tourists and interior designers from all over the world looking to refurbish their apartments, houses and villas, or to buy statues and small ornaments to decorate their homes.\nBut since the pandemic, the area resembled a ghost town with very few cars passing the small, winding road, let alone stopping to shop.\nGallery owner Vincen Klau said last year he could make a gross income of between 40 million rupiah and 70 million rupiah (US$2,669 and US$4,670) a month selling chairs, dining tables, wall decorations and small statuettes - carved in the rustic and abstract style of Eastern Indonesian wood art.\n“Now, it is quieter than my quiet months,” he told CNA.\nKlau said he would count himself lucky if he could get 15 million rupiah a month, which is barely enough to pay rent for his store and house, salary for his employee and various bills.\nThe shop is chock-full of artworks he has not been able to sell in months, collecting dust and occupying almost every inch of the tiny property, down to the store’s parking space.\nSome of his unsold pieces, he said, were supposed to be for a buyer from Java who had abruptly cancelled his order.\n\n\n“My main clients are people who are building or renovating their villas. Now, all construction and renovation projects have stopped,” he said.\nAcross Kerobokan, many galleries that could not afford to pay the bills had to close their doors temporarily and Klau worried that his store could be next.\nNot wanting his store to go bust, Klau - a short, muscular man in his fifties who until recently did not have an email address - started the gallery’s Instagram account in late June.\nBut due to his unfamiliarity with the world of social media, his account has only attracted five followers as of mid-September.\nThe account was barely maintained with the latest post dating back to Jun 24 and the majority of the photos were amateurishly shot, depicting a cluster of random pieces with no clear focal point.\nNearly all of the posts had no caption and when they did, the captions simply read “mask” or “Timorese statuettes”.\nKlau said that he does not understand how social media works. As a result, there has not been many\xa0curious potential customers liking or leaving a comment on his Instagram posts, let alone expressing interests in buying.\nThe gallery owner is not the only one struggling with online marketing in Bali. Too used to walk-ins, the craftsmen find their source of income drying up in recent months.\xa0\nThe resort island, which\xa0economy is almost entirely reliant on tourism, has seen 59 per cent drop in the number of tourists in the first half of the year, according to the Indonesian Statistics Agency.\nWhen the pandemic hit Indonesia in March, the number of new tourists arriving to Bali was reduced to almost zero.\nIt rebounded when Bali eased restrictions for domestic tourists on Jun 31 but the number of arrivals in July was a mere 11 per cent compared to the same period last year. \xa0\xa0\nWith the central government suspending\xa0its visa-free and visa-on-arrival policies for international travellers, businesses such as craft workshops that\xa0cater mainly to foreigners take the worst hit.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nCHALLENGES ABOUND\nMany of the artisans who are reluctant to sell online are held back by their lack of exposure to technology and social media.\n“I don’t understand technology,” said\xa0Made Ariani.\xa0\nFor the last 15 years, she has been selling wooden boxes and souvenirs at the Sukawati Art Market\xa0- a half-hour drive from provincial capital Denpasar.\n“My children understand technology better than me, but they don’t have the time to help me. My daughter is already working and my son is still too little,” she said.\xa0\n\n\nAriani said her main clients are souvenir shops in tourist areas like Kuta and Denpasar. Before the pandemic, they could order up to 500 souvenirs from her in one transaction.\n“But they have all closed,” she said, adding that she now relies on the very few customers and locals who come to the art market.\nWayan Cedit, 37, also expressed little interest in selling his wood craft online.\n“I don’t have Wi-Fi,” he told CNA with a laugh.\n“(Selling online) is too complicated. Even my friends who do (sell online) said it is complicated.”\nAmong his worries\xa0is dealing with fussy customers online.\n“We sell handmade goods. We can’t make two products which are exactly alike. Customers will be disappointed if they get a product which is different from the pictures. They will want their money back. And that happened to my friends,” he said.\n“(Selling online) is just too difficult. It’s not like dealing with real people. Customers can see and feel the products in person. You can’t do that online.”\nCedit said he used to make a gross income of 70 million to 100 million rupiah a month and could employ up to 15 freelance workers at his workshop.\n“Now, it’s virtually zero,” he said, adding that his workshop had not produced anything in months and his freelance workers have now become farmers.\nOf the 68,000 small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) registered in Bali, only a handful have social media accounts.\xa0""The percentage is very small,"" chief of the Bali Cooperative, Small and Medium Enterprises Agency Wayan Mardiana told CNA.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\nThe Bali government has\xa0trained a number of SMEs selling food and beverages to go online, with the help of ride-hailing companies GoJek and Grab, but has not been able to do the same for handicraft SMEs.\n“Unlike food, their market is domestic and foreign tourists, not local Balinese,” he said.\n“There are many artisans who are not familiar with technology. They are not familiar with social media. We have to change their mindsets and we are trying to come up with a training programme so they can sell their goods online,” Mardiana added.\xa0\n\n\nPOWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA\nThe challenges cited by the artisans were mainly just excuses, said a workshop owner who has tasted success in using Instagram to promote his work.\xa0\nI Wayan Gede Mancanegara, who runs\xa0the Ganesha Art Gallery, said many of the business operators claimed they stay away from social media because they do not want their work to be copied.\xa0\n“Some said their Internet connection is not good. But these are all excuses. They just don’t want to learn new things,” the 32-year-old said.\xa0\nHis workshop in\xa0Kedisan village - a 20-minute drive from the nearest town\xa0Ubud - is\xa0among the few places that are still busy working on wood art orders and commissions. The\xa0fourth generation artisan has\xa0diversified his product line to offer\xa0sleek and modern designs alongside traditional Balinese\xa0style wood arts.\nOn a recent Friday, the workshop was abuzz with the sound of hammers and chisels as four workers carved a wooden sign for a cafe, an ornately decorated door and a statue of the mythical bird Garuda, the official symbol of Indonesia.\nLying on the floor at one corner of the hilltop workshop was a soon-to-be finished name plate, intricately carved for a high-profile politician from Jakarta.\nThe shop has only been around for less than two years, but it has already attracted the attention of President Joko Widodo, Bali governor I Wayan Koster and a number of high-ranking officials and politicians.\nIt also attracted international clienteles, with orders coming in from the United States, Germany and Singapore.\nPart of the reason for his success was his savviness to promote his work on Instagram, set up as soon as he opened his business.\n“I felt that having a social media presence was essential. It is especially relevant during corona where everyone could not or would not go out or travel,” he told CNA.\nMancanegara said he tried to upload at least one post or story a day to keep his 2,300 followers engaged.\nHe added that\xa090 per cent of his sales since the pandemic hit\xa0can be attributed to his social media efforts.\xa0Before, 40 per cent of his income came from locals, tourists and expatriates visiting his workshop in person.\nBut that does not mean business has not\xa0slowed down. A drop in walk-in customers and a devastated global economy that discourages people from spending on arts and crafts have caused his revenue to drop by 30 to 40 per cent.\xa0\nCHANGING MINDSETS\nMancanegara is trying to convince artisans from his village to at least try selling and promoting their work online.\n“I told them,‘There are no customers coming\xa0to our workshops now. Why don’t you promote your work on social media? I got many orders from social media. Why don’t you ask your kid to set up for you?\'” he said.\nHe has helped three neighbouring workshops to set up their own social media accounts, besides sharing\xa0tips and tricks on how to get their audiences engaged.\n“I also set up a different (Instagram) account for those who don’t know how to start social media. \xa0Some don’t have galleries of their own. So I act\xa0as the account’s administrator and promote their work,” he said.\nOnly two people have agreed to be featured at the collective account so far. ""But I want all of the workshops in my village to join so they can realise the power of social media,""\xa0Mancanegara said.\nThe\xa0potential reach of social media, for instance, should not be underestimated, especially when one has quality goods to offer. ""If you deliver quality products they will order more, recommend us to their friends or tag us on their own social media accounts,” he said.\nMancanegara\xa0is not afraid that the fellow artisans could one day be his competitors.\xa0\n“I want people in my village to be able to have some income. For every workshop that can stay afloat during this hard time, there will be a dozen artisans who can continue to be productive,” he said.\xa0\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Bali ', '     art ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Renaissance master Raphael did a nose-job in self-portrait, face reconstruction suggests

""His nose was, let\'s say, slightly more prominent.""\nRaphael died in Rome in 1520 aged 37, probably from pneumonia, and was buried in Rome\'s Pantheon.\nThe self-portrait, which normally hangs in Florence\'s Uffizi gallery but is currently in Rome for an exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of his death, was done about 15 years earlier, when he was clean-shaven.\nIt features the more aquiline nose that Raphael also included in other works in which he painted himself.\nThe reconstruction is of the way he may have looked closer to his death, when he wore a beard.\nFalconi, along with forensic anthropologists and other experts, reconstructed the face with tissue layering techniques used by crime investigators.\nThe result was a face similar to that of the master on an engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi, one of his students.\n""When we finished, I said to myself \'I\'ve seen that face before,\'"" Falconi, 57, told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nAnother similarity is with the subject of ""Portrait of a Man,"" painted between 1512 and 1515 by Sebastiano del Piombo, a Raphael contemporary and rival.\nFor centuries there has been speculation that the bones exhumed in 1833 and reburied in a re-styled crypt may not have been Raphael\'s because some of his students were later buried near him.\nBut Falconi believes the research points to an around 85 per cent chance that the skull is Raphael\'s because of similarities with most of the artist\'s face as depicted by him and his contemporaries.\nNot everyone was pleased with Falconi\'s research. An art critic for the Rome newspaper La Repubblica said it had produced a cheap ""videogame version"" of Raphael.\nFalconi said he hoped the tomb can be opened again someday for direct tests on the skull.

The last self-portrait by Rembrandt to appear at auction was sold for 6.9 million pounds in 2003, Sotheby\'s added.\nThe painting sold Tuesday was one of only three self-portraits by the painter to remain in private hands, and ""the only one ever likely to come to auction."" It measures about 22 by 16 centimetres.\nThe sale was part of a live-streamed global auction featuring dozens of pieces of artwork spanning five centuries of art history, from Rembrandt to Picasso, and from Joan Miró to Banksy. The event saw staff from the auction house\'s New York, London and Hong Kong offices furiously gesticulating and whispering into phones as bidders vied to outdo each other.\xa0\nThe top-selling item was Miró\'s ""Peinture (Femme au chapeau rouge)"" (Woman in a Red Hat) from 1927, which fetched 22.3 million pounds.

Presented in elaborate traditional frames, it features seascapes dotted with orange life jackets and alludes to the lives lost at sea during the European immigration crisis. The paintings fetched 2.2 million pounds – almost double the top estimated price – and the proceeds are meant to raise funds for a hospital in Bethlehem.\xa0\nHelena Newman, chair of Sotheby\'s Europe, said the wide range of art on sale caters to ""a new generation of collectors (who) show less concern with the traditional art market categories of the past.""\n""With the global art world calendar having shifted, we too have seized the opportunity to do things differently,"" she said.\nSotheby\'s London said some two-thirds of the works on sale have never been at auction before.

      To re-engage the global art-buying crowd, auction houses turn to livestreaming
  </h1>, 'text': 'It started in Hong Kong at 9:25 in the evening, moved back eight time zones to Paris and London in the afternoon, and then finished in New York at 11:15 Friday morning. In just under four hours, US$420.9 million (S$580.7 million) had been spent.\nThis was the back-to-the-future format of Christie’s livestreamed “ONE” sale, the latest attempt by an international auction house to demonstrate that, thanks to the latest technology, the multimillion-dollar top end of the art market can still sparkle in the gloom of a pandemic.\nChristie’s four-venue “global 20th-century art sale” replaced the company’s live evening auctions of contemporary, impressionist and modern art in New York in May and in London in June. It followed Sotheby’s pioneering livestreamed US$363.2 million “clicks and bricks” auction on June 29 and an equivalent hybrid offering at Phillips on July 2 that raised US$41 million.\nThe COVID-induced shift from live to online-only sales has severely dented turnover at the major auction houses. During the second quarter of 2020, Christie’s auction revenues were down 60 per cent from the same period last year, according to London art analytics company Pi-eX. Christie’s, like Sotheby’s and Phillips, has had to come up with compelling new auction formats to reengage the 0.01 per cent of the population that buys and sells big-ticket art.\n“Everyone was holding their breath before Sotheby’s sale,” said Abigail Asher, co-founder of Guggenheim Asher, an art advisory company in New York. “There had been no public transactions of this value since February.” Sotheby’s had shown that there was “absolute confidence in art as an asset class,” she added. “This is a global buying market.”\n“Everyone was holding their breath before Sotheby’s sale. There had been no public transactions of this value since February.” – Abigail Asher\nThat was certainly the thinking behind Christie’s ONE sale, a relay of four auctioneers seamlessly “passing the gavel” in real time, “crossing borders to create one vision, one sale.” Unlike Sotheby’s “multicamera global livestream” predecessor, which featured one auctioneer in an empty studio fluently fielding telephone and online bids from screens, Christie’s sequence of live sales had a lot of moving parts, some of which moved better than others.\n“It seemed to be a great thing, but access was a little complicated, and when the Hong Kong auction was not starting half an hour late, I lost interest,” said Nikolaus Barta, a collector and art insurer based in Vienna.\nThe sale eventually started 56 minutes late. The live feed was prone to freezing and breaking, and viewers were at times confused as to which auctioneer was actually selling the work in question. “No, I’m selling it,” said a frustrated Cecile Verdier, Christie’s auctioneer in Paris, as Jussi Pylkkanen, the company’s global president, conducted a miniauction in London for the impressive 1963 Jean Dubuffet painting Pourleche Fiston. It eventually topped the Paris session with a price of €6.5 million (S$10.5 million).\nThe sale was meant to have been kick-started in Hong Kong by a large red “Hurricane Period” abstract from 1963 by Zao Wou-Ki, Asia’s most coveted postwar international artist. Estimated to sell for at least US$10 million, it failed to find a buyer.\n“I was surprised,” said Christian Ogier, a Paris-based dealer who specialises in modern Asian art. “I thought someone in Asia would go for it. The size, colour and date were good. But it was incredibly expensive.”\nIt was left instead to the 1989 Gerhard Richter abstract Frost (1) to lead a less-than-effervescent 10-lot Hong Kong session with a price of US$10.3 million, just above its high estimate.\n“It was an incredible live experiment, which allows one to feel and realise the width and breadth of the art market as well as judge the depth of it on a specific artist or artwork.” – Christian Ogier\nOver in London, Rene Magritte’s quintessentially enigmatic 1962 painting L’Arc de Triomphe, depicting a tree standing in front of a wall of foliage, inspired serious competition, almost doubling its estimate to sell to a telephone bidder in New York for £17.8 million (S$31.5 million).\nMost of the sale’s major-name trophies were clustered in the concluding 33-lot New York session. Pablo Picasso’s Les Femmes d’Alger (Version F) from 1955 and Barnett Newman’s 1948 abstract expressionist rarity Onement V were museum-quality masterworks that appealed to an older tradition of collecting. The Picasso was pushed by three bidders to US$29.2 million, but the Newman, estimated at US$30 million, sold to a single bid of US$30.9 million.\nRoy Lichtenstein’s iconic 1994 pop canvas Nude With Joyous Painting, valued at US$30 million, proved to be more in tune with billionaires’ current collecting tastes. From the series of nudes that the artist painted during the last five years of his life and never seen at auction before, this piece sparked a nine-minute battle between telephone bidders before falling to a client in Hong Kong for the sale’s top price of US$46.2 million.\nMost remarkable of the seven new auction highs set in New York for individual artists was the US$30.9 million given for Complements, an admired 2.4m-wide, two-panel abstract of colourful intertwining threads painted by in-vogue American minimalist painter Brice Marden, the subject of a sold-out show at the Gagosian Gallery in New York last year.\nPainted between 2004 and 2007 and guaranteed to sell for a minimum of US$30 million, Complements more than tripled the artist’s previous auction high. Such are the dynamics of the market for contemporary art that auction prices for Marden are now almost as high as those for an old master like for Rembrandt, whose current auction record is US$33.2 million, according to Artprice.\n“Christie’s was trying to set a whole new load of records for artists because they thought they had the whole world looking on,” said Michael Short, an art adviser in Berlin, who noticed the measured nature of the bidding on many of the lots. “It didn’t have the animal energy of a live auction.”\nBut others were impressed. “It was an incredible live experiment, which allows one to feel and realise the width and breadth of the art market as well as judge the depth of it on a specific artist or artwork,” said Ogier, the Paris-based dealer.\nOverall, Christie’s inaugural ONE sale raised US$420.9 million from 79 offered lots. “It’s a great result in the circumstances of the market,” said Guillaume Cerutti, Christie’s chief executive, at the post-sale Zoom news conference. “As a global concept it worked very well.” He added that more than 20,000 people followed the sale on various digital channels.\nBut as was the case the previous week at Sotheby’s, year-on-year sales figures were significantly lower. Last May, Christie’s evening sales of impressionist, modern and contemporary art raised US$937.8 million, more than double the proceeds of the ONE auction.\nBy Scott Reyburn © 2020 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     auction ', '     Hong Kong ', '     London ', '     New York ', '     Paris ', '     investment ']}"

      Singapore chefs and bartenders are creating art to raise funds for charity
  </h1>, 'text': 'Perhaps it is the ethos of hospitality that underpins their business, but despite being one of the hardest hit industries in the current pandemic, folks from Singapore’s food and beverage community keep finding ways to give back. The latest among their initiatives is a charity auction featuring artworks by well-known chefs and bartenders in Singapore.\nTo be held on June 20\xa0at 4pm on Facebook, Perrier’s #LockdownArtists Charity Auction hopes to raise S$10,000 for The Food Bank Singapore through the sale of works by the likes of Janice Wong, Rishi Naleendra, chef-owner of Cloudstreet; Petrina Loh, chef-owner of Morsels; Jorge Conde, head bartender of Smoke & Mirrors; and Naz Arjuna, head bartender of Bitters & Love.\nAs the event’s title suggests, the works of art were created during the circuit breaker by the chefs and bartenders who used the medium as a form of expression during this difficult period. Director of PR company Food News, Ivy Woo, conceived the idea after seeing pictures of Naleendra’s paintings on his Instagram account.\n\n\nA post shared by Rishi Naleendra (@rishinaleendra)\n“It got me thinking about how chefs and bartenders are inherently artists, and if their creativity could transcend their menus and help a greater cause at the same time,” she said.\nAfter approaching several F&B professionals about sharing their art, Woo took the idea to carbonated mineral water company Perrier, which\xa0immediately agreed to lend its weight as presenting sponsor. They are supported by Nestle’s #AlwaysOpenForYou initiative that aims to provide aid to business partners and communities.\n""It got me thinking about how chefs and bartenders are inherently artists, and if their creativity could transcend their menus and help a greater cause at the same time.""\xa0– Ivy Woo\nARTISTS ANYWAY\nThe multi-layered works of art for sale are impressively wrought. Arjuna’s acrylic and watercolour on canvas titled When Will I Be King Again?\xa0depicts the humility that comes with an uncertain future expressed in the form an irresolute face of a lion.\xa0\n\n\nA post shared by Naz Arjuna (@naz.arjuna)\nThe same uncertainty is parsed in more abstract form in Mire, an acrylic on canvas piece by Phoebe Oviedo, sous chef of Open Farm Community.\xa0Naleendra’s If Thoughts Had Shapes\xa0is a futuristic Dali-esque depiction of the inner workings of the elements that shape the lives of humans. \xa0\xa0\nWithout doubt, the works of art display another creative facet of the inventive F&B professionals, showcasing a side of them seldom seen. Head chef of Open Farm Community, Olivier Truesdale-Jutras, who contributed a glazed clay plate he calls Bogzarad, said, “Sometimes as a chef people expect you to stay in your lane and not have creative pursuits outside cooking, but that only limits you as a person, and to some extent, as a chef as well.""\n""Sometimes, it’s hard to display works of creativity because there is fear of judgement. But as chefs, we put forward one of the most harshly judged creative mediums daily, so it’s easy to overcome that fear in other creative forms.” \xa0\xa0\n""Sometimes as a chef people expect you to stay in your lane and not have creative pursuits outside cooking, but that only limits you as a person, and to some extent, as a chef as well.""\xa0– Olivier Truesdale-Jutras\nFOOD FROM THE ART\nThe event’s organisers chose The Food Bank Singapore as its beneficiary as the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a 70 per cent drop in donations. “Operations and distribution activities have also been affected with dwindling volunteer involvement,” said Mathieu Marchal, senior business development manager of Perrier-Nestle Waters Asia Oceania.\xa0\n“Keeping in mind Nestle’s commitment to providing solidarity aid to business partners and communities through the #AlwaysOpenForYouInitiative, we want to do our part to help the vulnerable population by ensuring their most basic needs are taken care of.\n“At the same time, we hope this initiative serves as a reminder for our friends in the food and beverage industry to continue to fuel their passion and express their creativity in the most positive way.”\n""We hope this initiative serves as a reminder for our friends in the food and beverage industry to continue to fuel their passion and express their creativity in the most positive way.""\xa0– Mathieu Marchal\n#LockdownArtists Charity Auction will be held on Saturday, June 20 at 4pm on www.facebook.com/PerrierSG.

      UOB's new art therapy programme: A boost to mental health in uncertain times
  </h1>, 'text': 'Looking forward to the reopening of art galleries and museums in Singapore? You may have to wait a while, as these venues are likely to reopen only at a later stage in Phase 2. In the meantime, engage in art activities from the comfort of your home with the newly-launched UOB Art Explorer programme, with activities suitable for both kids and adults.\nThe programme, comprising art therapy workshops, painting and drawing tutorials, resources and exhibitions, is part of the bank’s COVID-19 relief programme.\xa0\n“While the COVID-19 pandemic has kept most of us home, art has the power to release us into the openness of other worlds and experiences. By making art accessible to all, the UOB Art Explorer aims to promote mental well-being especially in this time of isolation and uncertainty. We also hope it will inspire creativity within the community,” said Lilian Chong, Executive Director of Programmes and Partnerships, Group Strategic Communications and Brand.\n“For this digital programme, we are drawing on the talent of Southeast Asian artists and their winning artworks in UOB’s 38-year-old Painting of the Year (POY) collection. By doing so, we also hope to showcase the richness and vibrancy of the region’s art cultures to a global audience in the comfort of their homes.”\nHere are some of the\xa0activities available.\nART THERAPY SESSIONS\nTo promote mental wellbeing during these tough times, UOB is offering 16 art therapy sessions as part of its\xa0Art As Therapy\xa0programme. The sessions are conducted by Yoko Choi, a professional art therapist and UOB POY winning artist. Activities include making an eco-friendly journal, and creating artwork from materials found at home.\n“The process of creating art can help people practice mindfulness and encourage self-awareness. These in turn help manage stress and anxiety. During each of the 16 Art As Therapy sessions, participants will be encouraged to explore through the art making process a range of themes and causes that may be affecting their thoughts, emotions and actions so that they can understand themselves better in order to manage their mental well-being,” Choi said.\n“The process of creating art can help people practice mindfulness and encourage self-awareness.

A new tutorial will be released every fortnight until December 2020.\nExisting tutorials that have already been uploaded include step-by-step and video guides on how to draw\xa0a three-dimensional apple using coloured pencils, floral drawing techniques using oil pastels, and\xa0splatter painting using toothbrush and natural dyes.\nFor those with a higher level of art skills, the\xa0Art In Colours\xa0programme\xa0offers eight line art adaptations of artworks from the UOB POY art collection. These line art adaptions can be printed out or uploaded onto most digital colouring apps for aspiring artists to experiment with different colouring mediums and to define their own interpretation of the artwork through the colours they choose.\xa0\nVIRTUAL ART EXHIBITIONS\nThe bank will also continue to champion Southeast Asian art with Art Virtually, a virtual showcase\xa0of selected artists and artworks from the region. The virtual tour will be uploaded on UOB\'s website.\nThe bank will also select an artwork from its collection every month to feature on its Facebook page. The social media post will dive deeper into the stories of each artwork.

      How this 26-year-old entrepreneur and art collector is supporting young artists
  </h1>, 'text': 'Clad in a navy suit paired with a white T-shirt and matching sneakers, Lorin Gu looks every bit the millennial entrepreneur. His boyish good looks is a sharp contrast to the urban industrial surrounds of our shoot location, a former ship repairs factory on 2 Cavan Road, which was transformed into a pop-up art destination, Twenty Twenty, by the\xa0Singapore Arts Club\xa0in January.\n\n\nThe camera loves Gu – the 26-year-old is the founder of Recharge Capital, a growth and private equity investment fund headquartered in Hong Kong and operating in Beijing, New York and Singapore – and so does our art director, who extols the way his face catches the light oh so naturally.\nPerhaps this innate ability, along with the painting he is pictured with featuring a lone figure with striking turquoise hair by British artist\xa0Lisa Wright, and the diamond-encrusted Cartier Rotonde de Cartier timepiece on his wrist – both from his own collection – provide reference points for our ensuing conversation about his passions: Jewellery and art.\nBoth passions form the basis of his non-profit\xa0Recharge Foundation, which he founded in 2014 to promote the cross-cultural preservation and conversation of visual and bejewelled arts. Besides building his family’s interdisciplinary collection of art, antiques and jewellery, Gu is offering grants to support artisans who are turning traditional craftsmanship on its head – just the kind of disruption that one has come to expect of his generation.\nGrowing up, Gu would often follow his mother to jewellery boutiques and workshops around the world. He later became interested in the idea of what jewellery means to people of different times and societies.\n“Jewellery is probably one of the oldest forms of cultural narration – from an indication of men’s power to women’s trophy status to women’s independence and ambition today,” he expounded. “This corresponds to the theme of the Recharge Foundation’s collection, which explores cultural narration and value evolution. We look at the convergence and divergence of values, customs and materialism in the world.”\nCovering a time period from 1905 to the present, the collection explores three main threads: Race and ethnicity, female and minority empowerment, and the rise and demise of consumerism.\nAccording to Gu, “The narrative, cultural and aesthetic merits of jewellery are often overlooked because people couldn’t quite fathom the rich history and stories behind them. Art serves as almost an easier medium to bring out the story in the jewellery pieces, especially when you pair them together.”\nThe foundation currently has over 400 jewellery pieces, from big names such as Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Graff, to no-name designers lost in the 1940s and\xa050s,\xa0whose creations were found at shows, auctions\xa0and boutiques, and acquired as part of the collection. While jewellery was the starting point, the art was collected almost simultaneously, and there are now over 450 works.\n\n\nARTS AND CRAFTS\nGu offered connoisseurs in Singapore a look at this unique juxtaposition between jewellery and art at Twenty Twenty, with the\xa0HumanMakes: Treasures in the Rough\xa0exhibition.\nHe personally selected artworks by contemporary artists such as Wright, Canadian painter\xa0Anna Weyant\xa0and American sculptor\xa0Genesis Belanger, and showcased them alongside a 1966 vintage jewellery piece by Harry Winston. The Recharge Foundation also presented workshops by local artists and makers showcasing various creative expressions such as hand-weaving.\nThe foundation first launched the HumanMakes programme during the Frieze New York art fair last May with a cross-disciplinary exhibition of Chinese art, looking at contemporary interpretations of ancient techniques such as feather marquetry, alongside Graff high\xa0jewellery pieces.\n“The HumanMakes programme is really about encouraging young artists who have taken pride in their\xa0own local traditional techniques and are modernising them to be new forms of artistic expressions,” enthused Gu.\n“We try to find ways to give the artists not just exhibition opportunities, but also commercialisation opportunities to create pieces in collaboration with big brands to get them exposed to a greater audience,” he explained.\nThere are two upcoming exhibitions with French jewellers Cartier and Chaumet. “It will be a collaborative project. With the Chaumet exhibition, for instance, we’re creating special-edition jewellery boxes to contain jewellery. It’s a very interesting yet subtle way of pushing this curiosity to the audience, and the jewellery brands also\xa0realise the need for elevating themselves beyond being just a consumer product.”\nEYE ON SINGAPORE\nThe HumanMakes exhibition at Twenty Twenty is only the start of the Recharge Foundation’s strategic partnership with the Singapore Arts Club, which is helmed by gallerist\xa0Audrey Yeo, to invigorate the local arts scene. They hope to bring together artists and artisans from around the world to create a synergistic experience for both local and international audiences to experience something that is not traditionally proposed by brands, galleries and\xa0museums.\nMeanwhile, Gu is currently looking for a permanent home for the foundation in Singapore that will serve as a museum and a hub to influence the Southeast Asian region in terms of arts and crafts. There are plans to showcase its permanent collection, and with space dedicated to curatorial programmes and special exhibitions featuring local and international artists. The Recharge Foundation currently has a museum in Beijing, with plans to open one in New York in 2022.\nFor all that he is doing to bring new perspectives to craftsmanship, Gu himself is walking the talk with\xa0PlanetBeyond, a tech-enabled accessories and jewellery line crafted from reclaimed metals, including those from discarded mobile phones. Its first jewellery-inspired earbuds was launched last December.\n“PlanetBeyond is a way of expressing my love of jewellery design – not everything has to be about high jewellery,” said Gu, a Harvard graduate with degrees in applied mathematics and arts history.\n“What I found interesting is how people have been talking about sustainability from purely a marketing or material perspective, but nobody has really thought about sustainability from an operational perspective. I came across this old factory in China that was making pagers back in the 90s, and because it’s such a small factory, it didn’t really catch up with the technological progress and was quickly rendered redundant. So I thought, why not take this opportunity to create something that’s new and futuristic, and has no trace of how dated the factory is. I really enjoyed the ironic contrast of it.”\nClearly, Gu is the epitome of a Renaissance man, one who has his eye on the future, but his heart firmly in the past.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     art ', '     Philanthropy ']}"

Even when we exit the circuit breaker on June 2, social distancing measures are still in place, meaning a visit to an art exhibition is still a long way off. Thankfully, museums around the world are offering virtual exhibitions for people to visit from the\xa0comfort of their homes.\nOne such museum is the Daelim Museum in Seoul, South Korea’s first photography museum. The museum is now hosting a large-scale exhibition powered by Gucci, titled No Space, Just A Place.\nOrganised by Tunisian writer and curator Myriam Ben Salah, the exhibition is inspired by Alessandro Michele’s reflections on ""eterotopia"",\xa0a concept by philosopher Michael Foucault that describes spaces as having more layers of meaning or relationships with other places than immediately meets the eye.\nIt aims to propose a new definition of what an “other place” might be – a place to build a different, more desirable future with new ways for humans to relate to each other and their surroundings. Apt, considering the current climate.\xa0\nSpanning across three floors, the exhibition features artworks of both international and Korean artists from over ten art galleries. Examples of works on display include a surrealist intervention by Olivia Erlanger, which turned the first floor of the museum into a laundromat inhabited by mermaids.\nArtist Sungsil Ryu tackles the idea of artificial paradises with a piece titled\xa0Psychedelic Nature,\xa0shedding light on humans’ physical connection to our surrounding greenery.\nAs most people around the world are unable to fly out to Seoul to check out the exhibition, Gucci has created\xa0a free 360-degree virtual tour that lets you visit all the installations. The best part is, EXO member and Gucci ambassador Kai is lending star power to the virtual tour by narrating the Korean audio guide.\xa0\nEven if you don\'t understand the language, Kai\'s soothing voice is the perfect complement to the virtual tour.\xa0\nKai as well as fellow Gucci ambassador and singer IU previously visited the exhibition, where they explored the art pieces and reflected on the exhibition\'s themes.\nGucci\'s No Space, Just A Place\xa0virtual and physical exhibition runs till July 12, 2020.

      Performers look to online platforms to engage their audience, as Malaysia’s COVID-19 curbs make people stay home
  </h1>, 'text': ""KUALA LUMPUR: Sporting smokey eyes and side-swept hair, Malaysian indie singer and songwriter Bihzhu dolled up in an emerald dress for a recent Instagram Live session. \xa0\nShe twirled in front of the handphone when an Instagram user complimented her outfit at the start of her hour-long performance hosted on the account of Jao Tim, a cafe and event space in the heritage enclave of Petaling Street in Kuala Lumpur.\n“A lot of my songs are sing-alongs\xa0and this one definitely is\xa0so get your sing-along muscles ready and we’re gonna do this,” the cheery jazz performer said, before launching into a soothing song of hers titled Bright Veins.\nAlone in her own room without the presence of a captive audience, Bihzhu relied on the instant comments and bursts of colourful hearts at the bottom right corner of the app for real time feedback.\nThis was her second Instagram Live performance since Malaysia imposed a movement control order (MCO), barring social gatherings and public events from Mar 18 onwards. The MCO - and the subsequent extensions until May 12 - has dealt a great blow to musicians, artists and theatre performers alike whose livelihoods depend on live shows.\nCooped up indoors like everyone else, some of them turned to online platforms to bring themselves right to the homes of their audience. There was no stage lighting, sound system and elaborate stage design, but the interactions felt personal and fun - even if they were interrupted by technical glitches or patchy Internet connection.\xa0\n\n\nThe audience, whose entertainment options and social interactions were limited by the MCO, could afford to give their undivided attention.\xa0\nWith social events still barred even as many of the COVID-19 curbs were eased on Monday (May 4), the performers are not optimistic that they can play in their usual performing venues when the MCO is slated to be fully lifted next week.\nSome are exploring uncharted territories to bring their creative work online, making the best out of the coronavirus crisis while waiting out the storm.\xa0\nPERFORMANCES LIFT SPIRITS DURING STAY-HOME ORDER\nJao Tim, the cafe which attracts patrons with its Art Deco glamour, has shifted its jazz concerts and jam sessions to Instagram Live, featuring one musician a day from 9pm to 10pm.\xa0\nThese sessions kicked off on Apr 10 with Tay Cher Siang, the pianist from WVC Malaysian Jazz Ensemble who appeared in the Hollywood hit Crazy Rich Asians.\n“Music, right now, is a need for everybody. To me, music heals the soul,” Jon Teo, the owner of Jao Tim, told CNA.\xa0\nThrough contacts and referrals, Teo reached out to the musicians. Instagram Live turned out to be a new experience for many of them, who are used to live gigs. \xa0\n“They tell me it feels like playing for the first time. It kind of opens everyone’s eyes, it makes them feel positive when they get ready, practise and do sound check, almost as if they are doing a real performance,” Teo said.\xa0\n“This initiative gives them a light to look through a tunnel, to play again,” he added.\xa0\n\n\nMany of the musicians have their own home studio, but not the equipment needed to go live on social media. To solve this problem, a wooden box containing Teo’s microphone for mobile phones, some tech accessories and a book for the performers to sign has been on the road since Apr 10, being passed from one musician to the next via delivery riders.\xa0\nEvery night, music lovers from near and far tuned in to these live sessions to bask in the music and encourage the performers. Some also responded generously to Jao Tim’s call for contributions to a fund for musicians affected by the pandemic.\xa0\n“(Facebook and Instagram Live) are definitely a great way to connect with people, to still be able to share and perform and give,” Bihzhu told CNA.\xa0\n“But one thing I’ve had to come to terms with, I don't think life is ever going back to the way it used to be … I’m learning to accept that change is here, and I will need to flow with it, whatever it is.”\nMOVING WITH THE DIGITAL TIMES\nMoving with the times and leveraging social media has been one of the key takeaways during the MCO for accomplished Penang-based Teochew opera actress Ling Goh. \xa0\nIn one of her latest videos posted on Facebook, she and her brother Elvis Goh picked a cat filter for their duet. The pink cat ears and whiskers are an adorable contrast to the traditional art form, which is celebrated as a synthesis of singing, drama and puppetry.\xa0\nFor the past seven weeks, Ling Goh has kept Teochew opera fans entertained with scores of Facebook Live, from putting on elaborate stage makeup to maneuvering the Teochew opera puppets.\nTo add more flavour, the founder of Teochew Puppet & Opera House also invited local as well as foreign opera performers from Singapore and China to join her online.\xa0\nPre-MCO, she had been streaming her stage performances live. But using Facebook Live during the MCO allowed her fans to interact in real time with her.\xa0\nOne of her live sessions for fans to request for songs even chalked up more than 17,000 views, an indication that the folk art still has a loyal following. \xa0\xa0\n“Unlike performers of pop songs and oldies, we cater to a niche audience. For our Teochew numbers, only those who understand the dialect will tune in,” Ling Goh said.\xa0\n“When we performed at temples, there were perhaps 10, or even five, people watching. With Facebook Live, at one time I could have about 200 viewers online, but maybe this is because everyone is just sitting at home and has nothing else to watch.”\nGoing on Facebook Live is both to keep herself occupied and to promote Teochew opera, an art she inherited from her family of opera practitioners. The hair pieces she is using, for instance, were made with real hair and passed down to her.\xa0\nBefore MCO, Ling Goh performed an average of 10 shows a month. If live performances are still restricted after MCO is fully lifted on May 12, she said she would continue to share more online.\xa0\nLikewise, Linda Ang Siew Kim, founder of kids’ theatre Hongjiejie Work Station, has taken to Facebook to read a story book a day, with her 12-year-old son doubling as her cameraman and technical director.\xa0\n“I am an active person and I cannot sit still at home. If I have to face my kids for 24 hours a day, I will go crazy,” she said with a laugh. “That’s why I am doing this, for parents to take a rest while their kids listen to a story.”\xa0\nA voice actress and former deejay, Ang has found her calling in storytelling. Fondly known as Hongjiejie, she ventured into kids’ theatre to bring stories alive to the young audience.\xa0\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bBRINGING THEATRE ONLINE\nAll four of Hongjiejie Work Station’s planned shows this year had to be cancelled, as the conoravirus began to show signs of upending everyday life.\xa0\nA straw poll on her Facebook page showed that parents would only start bringing their kids to theatres next year.\n“The live atmosphere cannot be duplicated on social media live. People can leave comments, can press the ‘love’ button and there is interaction, but I really want to see their faces and hug the kids. I don’t know how long we have to wait for,” Ang said. \xa0\nBut she knows she has to face the reality and plan for the months ahead. Bringing her shows online is the only way.\xa0\nThe proposal is to present one or two online theatre shows a month, co-produced by Hongjiejie Work Station and Poco Fun Play, for a period of 10 months. Sponsorship was set at RM38 (US$8.80) a month or RM150\xa0for five months to fund the production and filming.\xa0\n“I wrote the post and sat on it for three days. Is it too expensive? Is it hard for people to part with this amount of money?\xa0\n“I was thinking, people perhaps need food and warmth more than arts at this time. I was very nervous,” she recounted.\xa0\nTo her surprise, they reached the goal within a day and collected close to RM27,000 as of May 4, with encouraging messages pouring in.\xa0\nThey are planning to begin the production as soon as it is permitted to do so. For now, she is busy learning the language and tools of the digital era.\xa0\n“Just two days ago I took a class on TikTok. My friends have been showing me lots of videos and teaching me what to write for the description and what hashtags to put to increase the searchability.\xa0\n“I want to have a better understanding of the trend. How do I penetrate the online market? People in the theatre industry have been resisting moving online - we want live performances. But when this is not feasible, we have to move online,” Ang said.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     art ']}"

      Livelihoods hit by COVID-19, Indonesian mural artists channel efforts towards positive messages
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: Ray Andree had thought that the month of March would be the busiest time of the year for Indonesian mural artists like him.\nRamadan -\xa0when\xa0demand\xa0for people to break fast at hip eateries is usually high - was nearing. He expected a lot of jobs from\xa0cafes and restaurants looking to attract\xa0Instagram-loving customers with colorful works of art and installations.\nBut the COVID-19 pandemic and Indonesia’s large-scale social restrictions measures - \xa0which mandate children to study at home and ban eateries from serving dine-in customers - put these projects on hold, costing artists their livelihoods.\nFor weeks, Andree\xa0stayed at home with nothing to do but watch the\xa0news of how fast COVID-19 spread across the country.\nThe disease has infected\xa0more than 12,000 people and killed at least 850.\nThe 40-year-old artist noted that many of those who died were health workers.\nHe felt uncomfortable about how some Indonesians appeared to take the disease lightly, breaking the social restrictions order by not staying\xa0home and refusing to wear face masks.\n“I felt that I had to do something,” Andree\xa0told CNA. He added that\xa0he wanted to contribute in the only way he knows how, by\xa0drawing\xa0murals.\nSPREADING POSITIVE MESSAGES\nIn late March, Andree\xa0reached out to\xa0his friends, seeking suggestions for\xa0a blank canvas for his creations.\nOne of his friends suggested a wall near his store in Depok, just south of Jakarta.\n\n\nThe wall separates a busy street and an empty plot of land. It is often passed by motorists and pedestrians\xa0en route to a nearby\xa0train station.\n“It was very strategic and the locals (at the site) supported the idea,” he said.\nHe decided to depict the coronavirus as a tyrannosaurus rex breaking out of the wall in an\xa0unexpected manner.\nThe dinosaur's\xa0presence dominated the composition, obscuring the blue sky. This symbolised\xa0how the pandemic was\xa0standing\xa0between people and outdoor activities.\xa0\nImages of the virus appeared\xa0to spread out of the dinosaur. With a gagging mouth, the beast appeared to be either roaring loudly or ready to devour its prey.\n“Beware of COVID-19 ... stay at home” read\xa0the text on the upper left corner.\n“I imagine the coronavirus as an animal which will eat anyone regardless of who they are. So stay at home and practice social distancing,” he urged.\n\n\nAndree\xa0later posted photos of himself\xa0in the process of painting\xa0the mural on social media. This prompted his mural artist friends to ask if they could join in as well.\nTwo weeks later, he\xa0and two other artists went back to the same site to paint more murals.\nAndree\xa0said he was so excited to have his friends for\xa0company. He\xa0felt motivated to paint\xa0a second piece.\nIn his second\xa0work, the artist paid homage to health workers on the front line which he depicts as a doctor in full protective suit with\xa0wings of an angel.\nThe doctor held an unconscious man in one hand, while his other hand fended off a\xa0barrage of coronaviruses depicted as\xa0meteors coming out of nowhere. \xa0\n“Thank you, medical workers,” read\xa0the text on his second piece “fight COVID-19”, “stay at home”.\nAN IMPROMPTU MOVEMENT\nAt around the same time Andree\xa0finished his second work, another mural artist\xa0Bayu Rahardian independently had the idea of creating his own COVID-19 themed mural in south Jakarta.\n“I was thinking about what a professional muralist like me can do to contribute to society,” the 36-year-old told CNA.\n\n\nIt just so happened that he had extra paint at home leftover from a previous project\xa0and the exterior wall of his house was in need of a new coat of paint.\n“The wall was dirty and unsightly, filled with graffiti. My house sits on a border between two neighbourhoods, so many people pass it,” he said.\nRahardian said he wanted to keep his messages simple: “wear a mask” and “give extra masks to others”\n“They are easy things which many of us can do. I didn't\xa0want to convey complicated messages which I myself don’t understand. And the simplest thing we can do at\xa0this time of pandemic is to wear a mask,” he said.\n“People in my neighbourhood do wear masks. But people\xa0sometimes forget and there would be two or three people who don’t. I want my murals to serve as a reminder.”\nRahardian depicted\xa0the pandemic as a band of grim reapers, unleashing coronaviruses onto\xa0the world.\xa0But the viruses appear to leave a mother and her child unscathed, as they were\xa0both wearing face masks.\nFor his second work, which stands directly next to the first piece, Rahardian\xa0painted layers of clouds with different arms sticking out, ready to receive a face mask given by one generous hand.\nIt took him\xa0three days to complete his two works. Throughout the process, neighbours with little or\xa0no talent for art also lent a hand, while others brought him snacks and coffee.\n“The neighbours were very supportive because I am doing something positive for the neighbourhood,” he said.\nHe\xa0said\xa0more artists across the city and the rest of the country have made COVID-19 themed murals of their own, be it independently or inspired by the work of others.\n“We all felt we had to do something, be it to remind others to practice a healthy lifestyle, to warn people of the dangers of COVID-19 or to express our appreciation for medical workers on the front line,” he said.\nAndree also\xa0said that at least seven of his personal friends had created murals of their own in various locations across Jakarta and its surrounding suburbs.\nSPEAKING THROUGH ART\nAndree said the government should be engaging muralists to promote a healthy lifestyle and encourage social distancing.\n“The government should hire mural artists to craft such messages. Not only will it help mural artists who have lost their livelihoods but also because murals are\xa0more effective than the social media campaigns or banners the government has been relying on to convey their messages,” he argued.\nRahardian\xa0also shared the same view.\n“People respond to murals better than banners. Banners tend to be ignored. Murals are visually enticing. People can stop and take pictures or selfies and post it on their social media accounts. Thus, many more people can see the message,” he said.\n“But perhaps the government is too busy trying to contain the spread of the virus or busy handing out social aid.”\nRahardian said the experience has been rewarding with his mural adding pressure to neighbours who normally go out without a mask to start wearing one. “They feel they are constantly reminded to do so by my work,” he said.\nOn the other hand, Andree\xa0said he has not seen\xa0similar success in changing people’s attitudes and behaviour. “Perhaps it is\xa0because my work sits on a busy street, so people pass it without really paying attention,” he said.\nBut it doesn’t mean that the experience has not been rewarding for him.\n“I have received messages from medical workers thanking me for my work and said that their friends and families have been forwarding photos of my work to them,” he said.\n“I just want the medical workers to feel appreciated through my work and get other people to appreciate them too.”\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     art ']}"

      Singapore art gallery holds charity auction, raises S$60,600 for COVID-19 relief
  </h1>, 'text': 'The coronavirus crisis is a difficult time for many, but amid the struggles,\xa0these trying times have\xa0sparked an outpouring of generosity and kindness among some Singaporeans.\xa0On April 14, local\xa0art gallery Ode To Art\xa0held a charity live auction in a bid to extend a helping hand to low-income families\xa0badly affected by the pandemic.\xa0\n“As a proud Singaporean, I have been deeply affected\xa0hearing of the effects that the spread of COVID-19\xa0has had on different groups in our community. Thus, I felt a strong urge to help out in any way possible to aid efforts during this pandemic,” shared Jazz Chong, Director of Ode To Art.\n“I recalled how some of my friends told me that their artworks, such as the words in their calligraphy paintings, have inspired them to move forward during tough times, and decided that I wanted to organise a fundraising effort centred around\xa0art.”\nThe auction was held online\xa0via Facebook Live. A total of S$60,600\xa0was raised and proceeds will go to Singapore-registered charity Methodist Welfare Services (MWS) to support low-income families impacted by COVID-19.\xa0\n“We have all been impacted in some way by this pandemic, however, for families in the lower-income bracket, the effects of\xa0reduced wages, retrenchments and the shift to online learning for children, are even more strongly felt,” Chong explained.\nWhile the initial plan was to put up\xa0six artworks for bidding, overwhelming support for the initiative motivated the gallery to expand the auction offering to\xa022 works, which included original paintings, sculptures, drawings and limited-edition prints.\nThe selection included artworks by some of the gallery’s most popular artists, such as Eva Armisen, Wu Qiong and Ronnie Ford, as well as newer artists like Elisabeth Langreiter and Patrick Rubinstein.\n“We hoped that with a wide range of works at varying price points, we could appeal to a broader range of art enthusiasts, so that everyone could find something they liked and take part in the auction,” Chong said.\nChong shared that while bids were received from art enthusiasts from countries as far as Europe, buyers were mostly Singaporeans. “It was extremely heartwarming for us to see how the local community came together to support this cause,” she expressed.\nChong acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a trying time for the gallery. “Many people are simply focused on tiding through this difficult period with their families and thus buying art is not a priority,” she shared.\nBut Chong believes that it is in these trying times where art is needed the most. “All art forms have the power to inspire, elevate and strengthen in times of need. I believe this is what we need to remain hopeful and inspired, especially when the world seems to have turned upside down.”\n“All art forms have the power to inspire, elevate and strengthen in times of need.

      Old Chinatown and satay men: Why this couple collects nostalgic Singapore art
  </h1>, 'text': 'Pop quiz: Do you know what drawings are depicted on the back of Singapore’s S$50 note? Some might vaguely recall seeing Chinese ink images of “monkeys”, others may not have even noticed any art on the note. But rare is the individual who can name and identify Chen Wen Hsi’s Gibbons. Even rarer is the person who might point out that there is in fact another work of art printed on the same S$50 bill – Drying Salted Fish by Cheong Soo Pieng.\nUnfortunately, although Chen and Cheong are two of Singapore’s most lauded pioneering artists, they are far from household names in the country. It is something that husband and wife duo Su-Yen Wong and Fermin Diez hope to change with their art collection they have lovingly built up over the past 13 years.\n“I feel that this group of first and second generation artists are a bit under-appreciated. People who know art will recognise these names but ‘non art people’ wouldn’t because we do not have this knowledge of Singapore art history and appreciation embedded in our culture,” said Wong, a professional speaker and board director. “I would say that if we were to add a piece to the Singapore art ecosystem, that would be education.”\nTo encourage this appreciation for art by Singapore’s pioneering painters – and to offer the public the opportunity to indulge in a nostalgic walk down memory lane in these times of COVID-19, the couple have loaned 27 pieces from their collection for an exhibition at The Private Museum.\nTitled Silhouettes: Collecting Singapore Modern, the exhibition features modern masterpieces by Chen, Cheong as well as other Singapore greats including Chua Mia Tee and Lim Cheng Hoe. The chosen works depict daily life and street views of an old Singapore that have now been replaced with skyscrapers and glittering malls.\nTo comply with the latest measures by the Singapore government, the museum will be closed until May 4. There are plans to implement a virtual viewing experience and the exhibition will be extended when government directives are lifted.\n\n\n“Art is not a high-falutin’ thing, it is about exposing people and preserving culture in an accessible manner.” – Su-Yen Wong\nFor the couple, both of whom are long term art collectors, this tightly curated approach to their joint art collection is a way for them to safeguard a piece of Singapore’s history.\n“I have always had a fascination with old scenes, like what you might see on [photos that line the basement\xa0of]\xa0The Fullerton Hotel as I think these images give us a sense of roots,” said Wong, whose father was an avid Chinese art collector and instilled in her a love for art. As a child, she and her sister studied under Singapore artist Liu Kang. Her sister is now a professional artist but Wong says with a laugh that she prefers to be a “spectator”.\nHuman resources professional Diez, who is originally from Venezuela, first saw these old scenes of Singapore in a postcard book that Wong owns and was amazed that they no longer exist today.\n“I was fascinated by how quickly history was being overrun by modern Singapore,” he said. “Then I found out that there were various artists who had captured this old Singapore by going out there and painting it. What is so fascinating to me is that each artist has his own way of interpreting the same place.”\n“I was fascinated by how quickly history was being overrun by modern Singapore. Then I found out that there were various artists who had captured this old Singapore by going out there and painting it.” – Fermin Diez\nThey co-acquired their first work, Country Road by Cheong in 2007 and have since been acquiring a diverse selection of art that showcase these nostalgic scenes of the country. “Our focus has been around first and second generation artists who captured the life and times of Singapore as it was at that time,” said Wong.\nSince then, their art acquisition journey has led them on an adventure of sorts through Singapore’s past, where they have even had the chance to hear tales about the origins of their art from the artists in person.\n“We have a picture with Ong Kim Seng with one of his paintings, where he talked to us about trying to preserve these scenes of Singapore. Another time, we met Tong Chin Sye, who told us what happened on the day he went to Tanjong Rhu to work on another painting,” Diez said.\nThese vignettes are what makes the art come to life for them. With many of the second generation artists already in their 80s and 90s, the couple are aware that time is running out for these painters to tell their stories. This is why one of their bucket list goals is to write a book that chronicles these memories for posterity.\n“Art is not a high-falutin’ thing, it is about exposing people and preserving culture in an accessible manner,” said Wong.\nThey are already in a good position to make this happen. While they do not know the exact number of artworks in their collection, they do own unique pieces that are highly sought after. In 2018, they loaned four paintings by watercolour artist Lim Cheng Hoe to the National Gallery for an exhibition. One of the pieces, Boats in the Singapore River, set an artist record for the highest amount paid for his work, when they acquired it at a Christie’s Singapore auction for HK$200,000 (S$37,000).\nStill, in comparison to contemporary art from other countries such as Indonesia or China, prices of Singapore art are “not at the same level”, they observed. Plus, they had the foresight to start building their collection more than a decade ago when there were even fewer Singapore art aficionados. “Prices have come up quite a bit since then,” Wong observed.\nRegardless of the price tag, their pieces are more than pretty pictures to them. Said Diez, “If you look at art as a wall decoration, then it would be an expensive decoration. But this is owning a piece of Singapore history.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Singapore ', '     history ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Singapore artists comment on man’s impact on nature and the environment
  </h1>, 'text': 'One of life’s greatest ironies is how human beings clear vast tracts of land to build concrete jungles on one hand, yet install terrariums, air plants or some form of landscaping in our urban spaces for a semblance of the outdoors within.\nSingapore is no exception to this, and Mizuma Gallery, which aims to promote East Asian and Southeast Asian artists, looks into the constant tension between human intervention and the natural environment in its latest exhibition The Seeds We Sow, featuring four Singaporean visual artists: Ang Song Nian, Marvin Tang, Robert Zhao Renhui, and Zen Teh.\nAng Song Nian, whose works often subtly depict human behaviours in nature and landscapes, presents two works: An ongoing photographic series entitled As They Grow Older and Wiser (2016), which documents plant nurseries found in the outskirts of Bangkok, and an installation of 10,000 biodegradable pots arranged into an undulating terrain called Artificial Conditions (2019). Together, they show the irony of plants being transplanted from their natural environments for man’s beautification purposes.\n\n\nAn interest in botanical gardens established during the colonies of the former British empire led to Marvin Tang’s series The Colony – Archive (2019 –\xa0), which examines the impact and agenda of colonial botanical institutes. At first glance, the smaller postcards look aesthetically similar, but they are actually of different gardens that were each artificially created for the sole purpose of cultivating viable crops in colonial plantations.\nRobert Zhao’s photographic works Monitor, Swimming (2019) and Laughing Thrushes, Scolding (2019) are part of a larger recent project, where the artist has been taking time to observe how plants and animals share the same space as humans. In these two, he saw how animals quickly moved in to make use of rainwater collected in containers left over from an abandoned illegal squatter.\n“Humans and nature are not very far apart,” Zhao shared. “What we do will always be visible and evident in nature. We affect one another and leave effects on each other, just like how seeds that we sow take a long time to become trees.”\nThe refurbished wooden cabinet with landscape motifs adorning its multiple surfaces is symbolic of domestic and mind spaces within each person, where there is a yearning to be connected to a larger environment.\nInterestingly, the works, decided upon separately by the artists, complement each other to form a textured conversation where one inevitably asks: Where do we draw the line of human control over nature? And in the answers lies the crucial role of artists in keeping the important man-versus-environment debate in the foreground.\nThis is particularly important in the context of Singapore, said Tang, because there is a certain pressure to upkeep its image of being a “Garden City”.\n“We’ve this strange tension between us and nature; we need it yet we want to exploit it for the limited space we have. So for me, it is important, practice-wise, to be able to ask the questions that one else is asking, especially questions that are derived from political decisions or any form of human decision that would affect nature.”\nTeh feels that people need to remember that everyone has an innate desire to connect with open spaces and its elements. “Especially when we read news of how animals and plants are returning to the cities in a time like this, we’d start to see how cutting back our impact on the environment can enable nature to flourish.”\nWhile science is usually the main authority for conveying facts about nature, artists can use alternative ways to present encounters with and thoughts about the subject. In a thought-provoking observation, Zhao points out that the human race rarely thinks about non-human species until it becomes an inconvenience – such as getting a mosquito bite, or finding cockroaches and rats in our city.\n“We tend to think that almost everything on this planet is made for us and our consumption. But when you talk about nature, the starting point is to realise that every inch of this planet is shared among human and non-human species. As artists working in nature, we have the responsibility to show that fact in our art every second and in every space we’re at.”\n“A lot of the things that we do to the natural environment are always a result of us placing it at a lower priority. Hopefully, in this COVID-19 situation, we are reminded that the decisions we make to play around with nature has consequences.” – Ang Song Nian\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     sustainability ', '     Singapore ', '     Community ']}"

      Polka dots forever: Yayoi Kusama’s artworks are returning to Singapore

Works of the celebrated artist was last publicly displayed in Singapore in 2017, when a blockbuster exhibition was held at the National Gallery. \xa0\nGood news for Kusama fans then, because her\xa0artworks are returning to Singapore at the end of this month. This time around, you’ll have three months to explore the collection. Mucciaccia Gallery, located at the arts enclave Gillman Barracks, is set to hold an exhibition of Kusama’s works starting March 27.\nThe exhibition is a highly curated selection of her earlier paintings and work on paper, created between the years 1951 to 1981. A total of 28 works of art will be on display, including Kusama’s trademark infinity polka dots paintings.\nKusama began painting as a child, at a time when she began experiencing hallucinations that often involved fields of dots. Those hallucinations have since inspired her art.\nKusama also once said, “In the universe, there is the sun, the moon, the Earth and hundreds of millions of stars."" In turn, that inspired her to portray her life as one dot among\xa0thousands of others. She associated the polka dots with the sun and moon, as the dots have the same shape. The sun represents energy, while the moon represents tranquility.\xa0\nMucciaccia Gallery, Block 6\xa0Lock Road, #02-10 Gillman Barracks\nUpdate: Due to the current COVID-19 situation, this exhibition has been postponed till further notice.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Singapore ', '     Luxury Destinations ']}"

      7-year-old Thai artist unleashes imagination through colourful fabric
  </h1>, 'text': 'TRANG, Thailand: When Typhoon Mangkhut hit southern Thailand two years ago, six-year-old Winny saw it differently from most people in her country.\nHer tropical cyclone was purple, like the colour of a mangosteen or “mangkhut” in the local language. Its blustery force tore through her peaceful hometown of Trang unleashing colourful chaos. Local homes in pink and white all bore the brunt of the angry storm. Torrential rains brought blue floods to the streets, where the yellow lights of lampposts shone bright.\nKeziah ‘Winny’ Chumpuang captured the whole experience on canvas. Her vivid memory sharpened by rich imagination created a vibrant palette of “Typhoon Mangkhut” – an abstract acrylic painting that has recently made its way onto\xa0linen under a new business label, Keziah.\nIt is the latest achievement of Winny, now seven, making her one of the youngest entrepreneurs in Thailand.\nIn just four months since its launch last October, Keziah has already brought the Chumpuangs more than US$3,000 dollars. Its Facebook page is fast gaining followers, currently counting more than 2,500. And orders keep coming in.\n“(The sale) is very good; mama doesn’t get to sleep,” Winny said with a big laugh. “Right now, we’re running out.”\nKeziah is all about printed linen. What sets it apart from others is the unique patterns taken from Winny’s abstract paintings. Each tells its own story, from a tropical cyclone to a mysterious snow forest and a rainbow fishnet. Together, they offer a fascinating glimpse into her colourful life and the big imagination that defines it.\nBesides painting, Winny also loves fashion. She likes posing for photos and dreams of becoming\xa0a supermodel. One day, she decided she wanted to wear her own art, not knowing her request would soon pave the way for a thriving business.\n“I told mama I wanted a skirt with my painting on it. So mama looked for a factory but nobody agreed to do it. Eventually, we found the factory of Uncle Max. This is the first pattern to get printed,” she told CNA, pointing at her painting “A Snow Forest”.\nThe picture is her portrayal of a dark wood covered in snow – something she has never seen in real life. Probably unrecognisable by others, it shows luminescent fireflies amid thick layers of dark green trees. Some of them drop their saliva, she said, glittering red and yellow spots among blueberries and white snow.\n“This is inside the mysterious Amazon forest. It snows there because this is a wintry land,” the young artist said with a big smile.\n“I saw a picture of a snow forest and wanted to paint it because it doesn’t exist in Thailand. We’ve only got rain,” she added.\nBesides “A Snow Forest”, Winny also had a few of her other paintings screened on linen and ended up with a lot of printed fabric at home. Not knowing what to do with it all, the family decided to sell it under the label Keziah.\xa0\nThe product was showcased at one of the leading international trade fairs in Thailand last year – Style Bangkok. Winny was the youngest entrepreneur to participate and all the linen featuring her artworks was sold out.\n“Her art is her happiness, her love and her identity. For our family, this is the most important thing about art. We don’t focus on the business or the brand. They’re just by-products of joy and love in our family,” said her mother, Yupawan Yongpu.\nART – IDENTITY\nWinny became interested in art when she was three. Her biggest inspiration was eight-year-old watercolour artist Wajana ‘Hero’ Chumpuang, her brother. He is well-known in the art circle in Trang. Some of his works have been auctioned and a few others have been on display at art events in Thailand.\nTogether, the siblings have created more than 1,000 artworks. Many of them are filling up their home – on the walls, different floors and easels. Yet, one can tell a clear distinction between their styles. Hero’s subjects are recognisable. Winny’s are not.\n“Hero became interested in watercolour at the age of two. Winny tried it too but it wasn’t her style. Her flowers aren’t flowers and her trees aren’t trees. She likes art but just didn’t know how to begin,” their mother said.\nYupawan and her husband are both lawyers. Neither of them can paint or know much about art, let alone abstract painting. But when the couple brought their children to an art workshop a few years ago, they got to discover a hidden talent in their little girl.\nIt was the National Artists Tour project in Krabi, which Hero was\xa0invited to join. While her brother painted with other children, Winny played by herself on a spare canvas nearby. Her picture was colourful but unrecognisable. It depicted, according to her, the Garden of Eden, with an unusual-looking tree bearing “a special fruit that knows what is good and what is bad”.\nBut as it turned out, her painting won silver and Hero’s won gold.\n“We were so puzzled they announced her name, ‘Keziah Chumpuang, Kindergarten 3’,” Yupawan said. Her husband, she added, went to ask one of the judging artists why their daughter won the award.\n""The artist said Winny had freedom. That’s what he wanted to see in the workshop – freedom – not portraits, beautiful paintings, or by-products of some rigorous training.""\nAnd that was when Yupawan and her husband first heard about abstract art. For their young daughter, the silver medal and recognition ignited a passion in her.\n“The fire in her was lit. She was so proud,” Yupawan said.\xa0\n“Papa bought her paints and canvases, and she just kept painting and creating artworks that are filling up the house. She started to have her identity, transforming from a child who always walked behind Hero – the younger sister.”\n‘THINK, PLAY AND CREATE’\nThe siblings’ artistic skills are gaining more popularity in Thailand. Many of their fans call them geniuses. But to their parents, they are simply children who have space to do what they love.\xa0\nTheir early paintings were not perfect.\xa0But regular practice has helped develop their skills and firm support from their parents has made them confident\xa0to express themselves.\n“These two children simply have space to think, play and create,” said their father Kornkamol Chumpuang.\n“We’re not experts in raising children but we know we love them. Our love makes us want to listen to them, to read into their mind and learn what they want to say, and give them space for that.”\nFor the Chumpuangs, time is the most valuable asset in the family. Despite their busy work schedule, the couple make sure they have the evening and weekends free for their children. They play with them, listen to their stories, and bring them to different places where they can be with nature and enjoy outdoor activities instead of video games or social media.\nThe result is shown in their children’s paintings. Despite their different styles, both Hero and Winny share their love for nature on the canvas.\n“I like painting the sea and, sometimes, forests. I don’t like painting cities – they hurt animals,” said Hero, sitting on his new skateboard in the living room. Behind him, rows of paintings show beautiful rice fields, a wetland before sunset, blooming flowers in a garden and birds in the sky.\nNearby, Winny’s acrylic painting “Carp” was propped against an easel. There are 25 carp in the picture, she said, and they are all eating “dry human food”.\n“I saw carp in a pond and wanted to paint them. They have many colours – yellow, red and black. It was night time then, so they had to turn on the white light. That’s why the water is invisible,” she said, pointing at the colourful shapes on the canvas.\nFor the Chumpuangs, art is a great mode of communication. Winny and Hero often tell their parents the stories behind their brushstrokes. Subjects can be as simple as a crispy pancake they got to eat or meaningful thoughts they have processed and conveyed through pictures.\n“Of course, children can’t communicate as well as adults. We can write, talk and be understood. Still, children have their own way to tell society how they feel about this world or what they want to see,” their father said.\n“Our children do so through artworks.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Trending ']}"

      How this sleepy island became one of Japan’s most exciting destinations
  </h1>, 'text': ""A three-hour drive from Osaka to Uno Port, followed by a 20-minute ferry ride, takes travellers to Naoshima Island, a rather unlikely but notable destination for art aficionados.\nJuxtaposed against small traditional fisheries and laid-back vibe of the island, you’ll find contemporary museums, colourful galleries, giant sculptures, charming cafes and old Japanese houses transformed into stunning, often bizarre, fine art installations.\nIs it any wonder that Naoshima made it to National Geographic’s Cool List of Must-Sees 2019?\nOnce a thriving fishing village and home to Japan’s oldest operating copper smelters, the island’s economic decline was due in part to its younger inhabitants leaving for employment opportunities in the city.\nIn the hopes of reviving the livelihood of its 3,000 inhabitants, the mayor at the time wanted to develop the island. He sought the financial backing of Soichiro Fukutake, the chairman of Fukutake Publishing (now known as Benesse Holdings) – a Japanese education and publishing powerhouse – who purchased the south side of the island.\nTo transform Naoshima into a utopia for art lovers, they enlisted Pritzker Architecture Prize Winner, Tadao Ando, who worked over the next two decades building several beautiful museums that have become part of the artistic landscape.\nKnown for designing buildings that follow the natural terrain, Ando's structural works on the island blend into, or are built into the earth, some even opening up to the sky.\nHis first masterpiece, built in 1992, was Benesse House, the island’s main attraction which is both a hotel complex and contemporary art museum. By having living accommodations, guests can fully appreciate Ando’s striking designs and the natural beauty of the island, at their own pace. The hotel also offers guests special access to the museum’s galleries outside its opening hours.\n“Benesse means ‘living well’. We not only want our visitors to stay but also want them to get interested in art and feel a sense of attachment,” quipped Ryoji Kasahara, president of Naoshima Cultural Village.\nBenesse House carries an impressive collection of contemporary art, the likes of Yves Klein, Cy Twombly, Richard Long, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Hiroshi Sugimoto.\n“Sugimoto’s artwork is about the sea and the horizon. In our museum, there are 14 pictures of horizons he took around the world. It is special how the Seto Inland Sea is presented in the display of this artwork,” said art manager, Masanori Saito.\nTo encourage art to flourish on Naoshima, Benesse gives out awards and bursaries every two years to international artists who wish to create art to reflect the island’s identity. The latest recipient to win the Benesse Prize is Singapore’s very own Amanda Heng. The\xa0prize\xa0was presented in collaboration with the Singapore Art Museum, as part of the Singapore Biennale.\xa0\n“We will ask the artist to create an original artwork of that specific place. Instead of just appreciating the scenery, we add commissioned art installations to a location as we want visitors to enjoy them and also appreciate the history and culture of the island,” explained Saito.\nA short stroll from the hotel is the Lee Ufan Museum, the island’s newest attraction that opened in 2010. It’s dedicated to the contemporary work of Korean-born artist, Lee Ufan.\nOn display in the Ando-designed semi-underground structure are large installations made of stone, concrete and huge slabs of iron, as well as a number of paintings from earlier in his career. His work resonates with Ando’s architecture, giving visitors an impression of both stillness and dynamism.\n“When you say art, it is usually displayed on white canvas. But when you come to Naoshima, our art is not like that at all,” shared Kasahara.\nThe Chichu Art Museum opened in 2004, featuring bunker-style galleries built into a hillside, is probably one of his Ando’s true masterpieces. Here is where you’ll find a dedicated gallery to Claude Monet and his famed Water Lilies series, housed in a pure white underground chamber with tens of thousands of tiny white tiles, dimly-lit only by natural light.\n“I’d like visitors to feel the strength of the light and atmosphere of the place. These would make their experiences different when viewing the artworks,” attested Kasahara.\nThe best way to enjoy the island is by bicycle, combining art with stunning ocean vistas set against traditional fishing villages. Being outdoors is where you get to see famous giant sculptures that dot the island, such as Yayoi Kusama’s Pumpkin\xa0and Shinro Ohtake’s Shipyard Works. “The scenery of Seto Inland Sea is beautiful. However, instead of just seeing it as it is, by adding in art, the ordinary scenery becomes something special,” he added.\nMaking a trip here is well worth adding to your\xa0Japan itinerary\xa0for something a little different, even if you are not an arts buff. “I really hope we can continue working to make this place special where people who came here once in the past would want to come back to see the same artwork again,” concluded Saito.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Why fashion's fairy grandmother Agnes b wants 'to have nothing to do with fashion'
  </h1>, 'text': 'French designer Agnes b really doesn\'t like the fashion world of which she is one of the great survivors.\n""I don\'t like fashion. I have nothing to do with that world where everyone is in a bubble,"" said the veteran creator, a lifelong activist for progressive causes.\n""Some people like to go out and be seen,"" said the 78-year-old who dressed her friend David Bowie for decades and who made the famous black jacket with the leather collar that John Travolta wore in the movie Pulp Fiction.\nLike her, Bowie would run a mile from the ""celebrity scene"", she told AFP.\nBoth, however, shared a passion for all kinds of modern art. And now Agnes b – whose real name is Agnes Trouble – is opening her own gallery in an up-and-coming corner of the French capital.\nFab will not only house her eclectic private collection of more than 5,000 works – half of them photographs – but will also, she promised, be a ""factory of culture and social solidarity"".\nNext to Station F, the world\'s biggest startup incubator in the shadow of France\'s national library, the designer wants to put some fizz into what was a soulless corner of French capital.\nHer idea is to bring the art, music, fashion and publishing worlds together with the neighbourhood\'s young tech crowd and its multi-ethnic working-class residents.\nEven as she approaches her eighth decade, the grandmother of 16 and great-grandmother to 19, has lost none of the daring, drive and curiosity that helped her build a fashion empire of 300 boutiques, largely in Asia.\nART AND ACTIVISM\nIndeed, Fab\'s first show is called La Hardiesse, or The Audacious One, a nod to the self-taught designer who started out in fashion as a penniless young single mother with twin boys to look after.\nBack then, after marrying a much older man straight from school, the young Agnes Bourgois (hence Agnes b) dreamed of being a museum curator.\nNow, she has a collection of Basquiats, Warhols, Nan Goldins, Martin Parrs and paintings by Gilbert and George all of her own that many institutions would mortgage themselves for.\nBut Agnes b sees herself more as a motherly custodian than a collector of artists who can fall rapidly out of favour.\nThe art world can be just as ruthless and as capricious as fashion.\n""Suddenly, no one cares about what these artists have done, and they drop them. I don\'t like that,"" she told AFP.\nFor her, an artwork becomes ""an orphan when it leaves an artist\'s studio. It needs to be adopted, loved, seen and understood,"" the designer insisted.\xa0\nBorn in Versailles, near Paris, into a genteel, but impoverished Catholic family, Agnes b\'s adolescence was marked by abuse by her uncle.\nIt took her more than 60 years to tackle the subject with the film Je m\'appelle hmmm (""I\'m called hmmm""), which she wrote and directed, although she insisted it wasn\'t actually her own story.\nAgnes b married the future publisher Christian Bourgois – who was 12 years her senior – when she was 17.\n‘78-YEAR-OLD GRETA THUNBERG’\n""After I had my twins at 19, I left Christian at 21 without a penny. I was lucky to be very poor without being very unhappy. I would buy ham from the shop with the money they gave me for bring them empty bottles.\n""One day, one of the twins said to me: \'Aren\'t you lucky Mammy\xa0to have us!\'""\nThe experience helped forge her social conscience that has seen her support innumerable liberal causes in France and beyond.\n""I really feel for the Rohingyas, the Uyghurs and the climate,"" the designer declared, adding that she is ""very afraid of Trump"".\nWith France hit by strikes sparked by government pension reforms, she worried for those who have been ""forgotten"".\n""Nobody talks about the cleaners or the artists who have nothing. Who is defending them?\n""I am a bit of a 78-year-old Greta Thunberg,"" she joked, referring to the teenage Swedish climate activist.\nHer liberal Catholic faith, however, is a comfort. ""It\'s pegged into me,"" she said. ""I don\'t have that doubt even though I really like people who doubt.

      'Pre-school Picasso' shakes up German art world

We turn down a lot of requests,"" said the elder Akar.\n""He only paints when he wants to. Sometimes that is once a week, sometimes once a month.""\nSUCCESSFUL BRAND\nYet Akar senior also admits that his life has changed dramatically since discovering his son\'s talent, and that he and his wife now ""live for art"".\nA former salesman and recruitment agent, the 38-year-old has since switched to managing Mikail full time.\nHe has founded his own agency, and helped to establish his son as a successful brand.\nAt the event in Berlin, young Mikail rummages through a box of freshly ordered baseball caps adorned with his official logo.\nHe now has more than 40,000 followers on Instagram, and will exhibit his work abroad for the first time in the spring.\n""Our next exhibition is in Cologne,"" said the boy\'s father.

      How one Singaporean artist is trying to make the world a happier place
  </h1>, 'text': 'What do you normally do when you’re in an elevator?\nChances are, you’d look down – at your mobile phone, or at your shoes. Carefully avoid eye contact with other passengers. Critically appraise your reflection made ghastly by harsh elevator spotlights. All the while wishing the lift would just hurry up and get you to the right floor, pronto.\nA ride in the recently-opened hip boutique Hotel Soloha’s indoor, glass-panelled elevator, however, feels more like a whimsical and unexpected adventure.\n\n\nStep in, and you’re greeted with a brightly-backlit floor-to-ceiling mural situated within the lift shaft.\nAs the elevator makes its slow ascent all the way up to the fourth floor, enchanting tropical scenes featuring animals such as a hornbill, an orang utan, a leopard and a snake luxuriating within a lush jungle, unfold vertically, culminating at the top with the image of a bird breaking free from the confines of its cage.\nIt made this writer want to go up and down the lift over and over again, evoking the long-lost excitement and pleasure kids derive from an activity most adults consider unspeakably mundane. If she had been a millennial “influencer”, she would probably have video’d and uploaded it onto InstaStories.\n“I really believe in the power of colour to create positive emotions, to transform and lift the atmosphere and mood of a space,” said Danielle Tay, the 29-year-old Singaporean artist commissioned by the hotel’s owners to create the (size) artwork based on the property’s tropical nature decor scheme.\nAs the property was undergoing extensive renovation work at the time of commission, Tay studied the hotel’s branding images and swatches of its custom-designed carpets for each of its four animal-themed floors.\nShe painted nine separate panels that would make up the 13-metre-long work offsite, leaving them “about 10-20 percent uncompleted, because I like to add the finishing touches at the last moment to site-specific pieces”.\nShe rode, crouched above the lift – accompanied by safety supervisors – to install the panels, then added on the final touches of paint there and then.\n“I like my work process to feel spontaneous … it’s not much fun to plan every last detail out beforehand, and go down a checklist ticking all the boxes,” she explained. “I tend to work on several pieces simultaneously when creating a series for a collection. How one artwork develops can influence how I then approach other pieces.”\n“I like my work process to feel spontaneous … it’s not much fun to plan every last detail out beforehand.” – Danielle Tay\n“It’s also why I’ve been gravitating away from painting to collage,” she added. “The thing about working two-dimensionally on a piece of canvas, is that its shape and dimensions are fixed. As a result, the placement of each brush stroke has to be considered carefully. It makes me hesitate and deliberate too much, which I find limiting. With collages, I work with separate pieces of wood cutouts and move them around to experiment with their placement, before finally deciding what works best.”\nIndeed, one of her other semi-public works, Creators of Tomorrow, which was commissioned in 2018 by JTC to mark its 50th anniversary, and which\xa0 is displayed at Fusionopolis One@One-North, features cutouts of buildings and colourful organic shapes that portray a lively cityscape brimming with optimism.\nShe was recently roped in by SuperHero Me, a ground-up inclusive arts movement that empowers children from diverse backgrounds through the arts, social mixing and purposeful programming, to do her first community project.\xa0\nThe collaboration saw her create a series of house-like pop-up installations at Rainbow Centre Margaret Drive that would serve as workshop and activity-spaces over a one-month period for children with special needs, and their caregivers, as well as an ""adventurous floor mural"" that not only livened up a bare courtyard, but which could be used as games stations during classes.\nOver the years, she’s been making a name for herself for her whimsical, expressive, vibrantly-coloured creations. Among others, she earned a Highly Commended Award in the reputable Rise Art Prize 2018 and was named Artist of the Month by The Artling in April 2017.\nHer journey towards becoming an artist began much, much earlier. “I already decided I wanted to become an artist when I was in secondary school – even though art was considered a non-examinable subject, and even though I enjoyed humanities subjects such as history and English literature, I found myself always putting in the most time and effort in my art projects, especially when it came to painting,” she recalled, confessing that she dropped out of junior college.\n“I already decided I wanted to become an artist when I was in secondary school – even though art was considered a non-examinable subject.” – Danielle Tay\n“My parents and teachers had advised me to at least get my A-levels so as not to close off my options, but after five months, I decided I really just wanted to go to art school”, she explained. She went on to get a diploma in Fine Arts at La-Salle College of the Arts, then did her Bachelor in Fine Arts at Slade School of Fine Art at University College London, graduating with First Class Honours.\nShe then headed back to Singapore and worked was an art teacher for two years, teaching six- to-eight year olds, before deciding to become a full-time artist.\n“It was very rewarding, seeing how open and expressive kids are, how they view the world, the ideas they come up with, their positive energy and enthusiasm, the way they experiment with colour,” she recalled.\nTay names Pods, an interactive installation she created with curators of Garage Museum of Modern Art and a production team based in Moscow in 2012, as one of the works she considers the most significant so far.\nA series of domes, suspended at different heights and featuring different interiors “inspired by the beauty and extraordinariness of nature, invite visitors to enter and discover different ‘worlds’ through the senses of sound, touch and sight. “It was my first time working remotely with a team at the other end of the world, and we even had to communicate through translators,” she recalled.\nHer biggest inspirations are nature and travel. “It brings up all sorts of metaphors: How we evolve, how our lives are basically about exploration, how we affect our surroundings, and how our surroundings affect us,” she said.\n“I love beach and jungle vacations the most,” Tay shared. Recent trips involved chilling in Ubud (“Such a calm, peaceful energy, and so many, many shades of green, and in different shades from what you find in temperate climates”), and hiking in Transylvania with her husband of two years, who works in IT – he’s Hungarian, but grew up in Transylvania.\n“My trips help me disconnect from the sensory overload of modern life in an urban environment, and I find myself reflecting a lot about the duality of nature: The tranquil beach versus the destructiveness of a tsunami; the beauty of flora and fauna in a jungle or a forest, versus, say, being the Singaporean that I am, ‘what if I get dengue from a mosquito bite, or get attacked by some wild animal?” she quipped.\nShe loves yoga classes, which she attends thrice weekly, for “the way it helps recalibrate mind and body, and how it teaches me to be okay with slowness, how it makes me confront and overcome discomfort – which is a good philosophy to have in life”.\n[I love yoga for] how it teaches me to confront and overcome discomfort – which is a good philosophy to have in life.” – Danielle Tay\nAnd what about her plans for the future?\n“I’d like to transform the entire interior of a building; maybe create a print for use on textiles and surfaces,” she said. “And finish renovations for my first home, which are ongoing. One key design feature is something I’ve always had in my bedroom: An ‘Inspiration’ wall completely loaded with postcards and posters of my favourite artwork, whether from a world-famous museum, or from my artist friends’ exhibitions. There’d definitely be a few postcards of Kandinsky’s work. And a quote by Paul Klee that goes:\xa0 ‘A line is a dot that went for a walk. Art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible. One eye sees, the other feels’.”\n“I really believe in the power of colour to create positive emotions, to transform and lift the atmosphere and mood of a space.” – Danielle Tay\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Singapore ', ""     Women's Life "", '     Profiles ']}"

The hammer price, however, is the highest achieved for a Nara work at auction.\n\n\nKnife Behind Back was created in 2000. Despite the title, the picture’s little heroine does not appear to be brandishing a knife – making the painting all the more sinister in its hidden intent. That the little girl towers over viewers at larger-than-life dimensions makes it extra menacing.\n“I kind of see the children among other, bigger, bad people all around them, who are holding bigger knives,” said Nara in a statement.\nAccording to Sotheby’s, the knife’s deliberate concealment “underscores the unexpected insurgent power of children and the associated radical potentiality of the insignificant…”. The artwork captures the essence of Nara’s “sullen, disgruntled, yet endearing and captivating youth” – which we think is a sure sign of the times, given the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     auction ', '     Hong Kong ']}"

      Traditional shadow puppetry with a modern twist revives dying interest in Malaysia
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Princess Leia bends down and slips a disk containing the plans for the Death Star battle station into R2-D2.\xa0\nAnd next comes C-3PO, bursting onto the scene looking for the astromech droid. Startled, Princess Leia leaves in a hurry.\nThis classic Star Wars scene was reenacted recently at a shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, except that the characters were portrayed in traditional wayang kulit (shadow puppetry) style and were conversing in Malay.\xa0\nTheir names were also given a localised twist - Princess Leia was known as Puteri Leia, R2-D2 as Ah Tuh, and C-3PO, Si P Long.\nPresented by Fusion Wayang Kulit, the Star Wars-inspired performance is a modern take on Wayang Kulit Kelantan, a form of traditional art that has lost its appeal over the years, no thanks to changing times and a ban imposed by the state government.\xa0\nDuring the recent performance, the audience watched in delight as the silhouettes of the\xa0lead characters Perantau Langit (the Sky Voyager, referring to Luke Skywalker) and Sangkala Vedeh (the Powerful General Vedeh, Darth Vader) battled on the translucent white screen.\xa0\nAt the other side of the screen, accredited dalang (master puppeteer) Mr Muhammad Dain Othman was solely in-charge of breathing life into these colourful, two-dimensional puppets.\xa0\nHe orchestrated the characters’ movements across the screen while narrating\xa0the story.\xa0A puppet made its entrance, another exited, \xa0their shadows grew\xa0larger as they moved further from the screen, casting a theatrical feel to the performance.\xa0\nBehind Mr Muhammad Dain, a musical ensemble took cues from him to weave rhythmic tunes to accompany the show.\xa0\nA WINNING FORMULA\nFusion Wayang Kulit, a\xa0brainchild of Mr Tintoy Chuo and Mr Teh Take Huat, has carved a name for itself with its wayang kulit depictions of pop culture icons.\xa0\nBesides Star Wars characters, Marvel and DC superheroes were also given a wayang kulit makeover, often eliciting oohs and aahs from fans and non-fans alike.\nIt all began with a lightbulb moment when Mr Chuo was looking for a unique idea for an art exhibition in 2012.\nA character designer by profession, the 46-year-old thought of creating wayang kulit characters enhanced by futuristic elements.\xa0\n“I am a big fan of Star Wars, so I wanted to combine Star Wars and wayang kulit. That’s how everything started,” he said.\nTraditionally, the storyline of Wayang Kulit Kelantan centres on the triumph of good over evil in the Seri Rama tales based on the Hindu epic. It recounts the journey of Seri Rama to rescue his wife Sita Dewi, who was captured by the evil Maharaja Rawana.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nStar Wars also has a classic good versus evil theme, Mr Chuo said, drawing a parallel between both.\xa0\xa0\nWith zero experience in making traditional wayang kulit puppets, he laser-cut his Star Wars-inspired characters out of art board for the exhibition. Little did he know that a much bigger project would ensue.\xa0\nBy chance, Mr Muhammad Dain caught wind of Mr Chuo’s search for a master puppeteer and reached out to him on Facebook. The two met up at Mr Muhammad Dain’s workshop in Kelantan, and it turned into a crash course of sorts for both.\xa0\xa0\n“I learned about the process of making a wayang kulit character, and he was introduced to all these sci-fi characters. He was very open-minded. It was a good experience for us,” said Mr Chuo.\nIn this partnership, Mr Chuo designs new characters and plans the storyline, while Mr Muhammad Dain focuses on puppet making and performance.\xa0\n“He is an expert in the history, format and characteristics of wayang kulit. I want to make sure what we do is correct, because when we talk about introducing Star Wars, there are many modern elements such as laser guns. How should we get it right?”\nWhen designing the puppets, Mr Chuo makes sure they adopt the posture of the traditional puppets. Each is\xa0embellished with\xa0traditional elements.\xa0\nA wayang kulit figure usually has one moveable arm for the master puppeteer to manoeuvre during performances. The other arm holds a tool associated with the character, such as a lightsaber for the jedi.\n“I imagine Perantau Langit (Luke Skywalker) to be a person who walks in the sky, so I add feather - a Seri Rama feature - to his legs,” he explained.\xa0\nOnce Mr Muhammad Dain approves the design, his puppet crafters will then cut the character out of cowhide (or plastic for certain characters) and chisel motifs onto the puppet with hammer.\nOn stage, computer-generated special effects are\xa0introduced to enrich audience experience.\xa0\nIn the Star Wars-inspired wayang kulit show, Sangkala Vedeh has a\xa0hoarse, menacing voice, while a fiery sky hangs over the characters in dark\xa0scenes to evoke\xa0a spine-chilling mood.\xa0\nMr Chuo believes Fusion Wayang Kulit has\xa0found a winning formula to make wayang kulit appealing for the public, especially the younger generation.\xa0\xa0\n“I think the formula works, because people cannot relate to the traditional wayang kulit - it is beautiful, don’t get me wrong - but when you have characters like ours, which the young people recognise, it is easier for them to accept,” he said.\nNonetheless, despite it being known for its modern characters,\xa0a prominent space of its newly-opened gallery in Kuala Lumpur is dedicated to the figures in the\xa0Seri Rama repertoire.\xa0\nVisitors are first walked through the traditional characters, before they are introduced to those created by\xa0Fusion Wayang Kulit.\xa0\xa0\nSTATE BAN HITS WAYANG KULIT POPULARITY\xa0\nWayang Kulit Kelantan has its roots in the eastern state in Peninsular Malaysia. Yet\xa0ironically, it was banned by the Parti Islam Se-Malaysia-led state government in 1998 along with other forms of traditional art including the Mak Yong dance\xa0for containing elements deemed “un-Islamic”.\nUnder the ban, wayang kulit can only be staged openly once a week at the cultural centre, Mr Muhammad Dain said.\xa0The effect of the ban\xa0was detrimental.\xa0\xa0\n“We used to have 50 wayang kulit troupes in Kelantan, but the total declined to just 12 today.”\xa0\nMr Muhammad Dain, 67, began learning the art form in 1980 from three masters.\xa0\nHe said it was a natural path to take because wayang kulit was flourishing back then. He performed wayang kulit on the side, while holding a day job as a government officer.\nThe subsequent state-imposed ban, coupled with the fact that people were getting more educated and technology was becoming increasingly\xa0advanced, led many to see wayang kulit as outdated and irrelevant.\n“As a master puppeteer, this phenomenon saddens me, not because of (its effect on) puppeteers, but the art,” Mr Muhammad Dain said.\nA United Nations special rapporteur in the field of cultural rights\xa0had in March said it is a shame that these arts are banned in the\xa0state where they were actually born.\xa0Malaysians, especially the Kelantanese, would lose a part of their culture if the art forms were left to die, Ms Karima Bennoune said.\nUniversiti Sains Malaysia’s (USM) Associate Professor Dr AS Hardy Shafii described the ban as a blow to one of the genius works in the field of performing arts and literature.\xa0\n“It is like destroying your own heritage without understanding the concept and philosophy of life and the importance of aesthetics in our lives.\xa0\n“In truth, fear, ignorance and insecurity may see the demise of other forms of art as well,” the director of USM’s Dewan Budaya (Cultural Centre) told CNA.\xa0\nOn Wednesday (Sep 25), Kelantan Deputy Chief Minister Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah said\xa0the state guidelines should not be viewed as a hindrance to art performances.\xa0\nHe said artists should be creative,\xa0instead of seeing\xa0the rules as something that limit their involvement in the art forms,\xa0Sinar Harian reported.\nMr Mohd Amar said the Mak Yong dance\xa0and wayang kulit are permitted as long as elements that run against Islam are eliminated.\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\nREVIVING THE ART\nIf Malaysia wants to revive this old form of storytelling, the government and relevant agencies have to give some thought to marketing the art, Mr Muhammad Dain said.\xa0\n“Right now, wayang kulit puppeteers and musicians cannot rely solely on the art for livelihood, there isn’t a market for wayang kulit.”\xa0\nThe Education Ministry and the Tourism Ministry, in particular, can work together\xa0to teach the younger generation about Malaysia’s own culture and heritage, USM’s Assoc Prof Hardy said.\xa0\n“Our education system should emphasise on the importance of culture from pre-school onwards. Concentrate on good moral values and ethics.\xa0\n""Nurture our younger generation on why we should value our own heritage, with folk songs, dance and local stories embedded into our curriculum,” he said.\xa0\nFor wayang kulit, an emphasis should also be put on the traditional characters in the original repertoire, the academician opined. “The characters are unique, interesting and contemporary enough to be highlighted. By redesigning it, the image on the screen should be spectacular and colourful.”\nAs for Mr Muhammad Dain,\xa0the original Seri Rama tales are still close to his heart.\xa0\nThe moral and life lessons they convey are essential elements of wayang kulit, he said.\xa0\n“But perhaps we can first attract the younger generation to appreciate wayang kulit, and then later, add these values to stories that are suitable to our society.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     art ', '     Kelantan ']}"

      Two artworks unveiled to commemorate Singapore's bicentennial
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: If you are visiting East Coast Park, look out for a\xa04m-high sculpture of\xa0a giant body with many faces.\nCalled Crossing Shores, it was one of two artworks unveiled on\xa0Wednesday (Aug 28) to commemorate Singapore\'s bicentennial.\xa0\nThe second artwork is a 3D-printed installation called The Time Tree, featuring a giant tree stump and a fallen part of the tree.\xa0\n“As we commemorate Singapore’s bicentennial, the launch of these new public art will help showcase the different facets of our Singapore Story while revitalising public spaces around Singapore,"" said\xa0Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.\xa0\nCROSSING SHORES\nThe sculpture Crossing Shores, with its many faces, pays homage to the diversity of early migrants who crossed Singapore\'s shores in search of better futures and made Singapore their home, said the National Arts Council (NAC) in a media release.\xa0\n""Set against the backdrop of the sea at East Coast Park, in a space that many Singaporeans have shared memories of, the artwork serves to remind us of how a nation of diverse faces from different lands worked together to build a home, and calls for stronger social integration in contemporary times,"" it added.\xa0\nThe sculpture was created by\xa0Singaporean artist Farizwan Fajari, professionally known as Speak Cryptic.\xa0\nTHE TIME TREE\nThe Time Tree by Robert Zhao imagines what a tree older than 200 years might look like in Singapore, and\xa0is modelled after the dimensions of the Changi Tree - Singapore\'s tallest tree recorded which stood at about 76.2m. It was also the tree which the British feared would serve as a ranging point for enemy artillery during World War II.\xa0\nThe artwork, which lights up at night, is one of the largest 3D-printed\xa0public art installation in Singapore, said NAC.\n""The age of the imagined tree, beyond the 200 years of Singapore’s bicentenary, is an acknowledgement of Singapore’s pre-modern history and the plurality of narratives that go beyond the colonial era – reflecting the tenacity and resilience of Singapore, and the myriad of possibilities in imagining a nation through the lens of natural history,"" it added.\xa0\nThe installation will be displayed at\xa0three public sites, starting with Fort Canning Park this month before moving to Jurong Lake Gardens in November and finally at Raffles Place Central Square\xa0in January.\xa0\n“The challenge put forth to the commissioned artists was not only to push their artistic boundaries and further their craft through a different medium, but to also draw reference from bicentennial themes such as multi-culturalism, openness and self-determination to commemorate this historical milestone,"" said\xa0NAC\'s chief executive\xa0Rosa Daniel.\xa0\n""We are confident the public artworks will enliven community sites, stimulate imaginations and delight visitors of all ages with their sense of play.""\nThe artworks were\xa0commissioned by the Public Art Trust, an initiative by NAC.\xa0\nA third artwork will be launched in Punggol in November.\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ']}"

      ‘I hope the deceased will receive these items’: Penang paper effigy apprentices passionate about their craft
  </h1>, 'text': ""GEORGETOWN, Penang: Dozens of bamboo sticks were spread out on the floor within the reach of paper effigy maker Lee Teik Joo, while more were propped against the wall.\nUsing a small knife, he deftly sliced the sticks lengthwise and cut them into shorter pieces. Sound of the sticks shuffling against the floor filled the workshop, where Mr Lee and his co-workers were rushing an order.\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“I’m used to having splinters in my fingers,” the 25-year-old told CNA.\xa0\nMr Lee was crafting the roof structure of a paper mansion for a funeral. The order had just come in and all hands were on deck to make sure that the items – usually a\xa0house, a car, a butler and a maid – were delivered on time.\nChinese traditional customs have it that these paper paraphernalia, when burnt, will be delivered to the deceased in the netherworld. Hell notes, paper clothes, and an array of everyday items are commonly offered during the Qing Ming Festival (Chinese All Souls’ Day), funerals and death anniversaries of the deceased.\xa0\nThe Chinese Hungry Ghost Festival, which falls on Aug 14 this year, also contributes to a spike in orders for the “da shi ye” (guardian god of the ghosts) effigies, as well as that of his four subordinates.\nEntering the industry six years ago, Mr Lee was a rare young face in the trade. He recounted\xa0knocking on the doors of paper effigy master Koh Beng Hock to seek employment, but was turned away.\xa0\n“I came back again just several hours later, and this time, he agreed to take me in,” Mr Lee said. “A few months later, I became his disciple. He told me to get him a box of five nuts mooncakes for Mid-Autumn Festival every year, that’s it!”\nHARD WORK, PATIENCE AND ARTISTIC FLAIR NEEDED, SAYS THE MASTER\nMr Koh, 63, taught Mr Lee all he knew about paper effigy making, without withholding any secrets. While his friends in the same trade do not have successors taking over their businesses, he has two - his elder son Mr Koh Eng Keat, 35, and Mr Lee.\xa0\n“This is me when I was younger,” he said while gesturing at Mr Lee, a tinge of pride and affection in his voice. The older Koh first dabbled in paper effigy making in his teens, following a friend to help out at a workshop after school, and a lifelong career in the trade ensued.\xa0\n“To be a paper effigy maker, you need to be hardworking and patient, with a strong attention to detail. Talent and artistic flair are also needed. Not everyone can do this,” he said.\xa0\nHis young disciple evidently met all the requirements. Sitting on a small stool on the floor and bending over the bamboo structure, Mr Lee said the most important lesson he learned from Mr Koh was the need to be flexible and innovative.\xa0\n“Our master teaches us the basics, but it is up to us to chart the path ahead. We observe (our master’s craft), and then we adapt,” he said.\nTHE APPRENTICES INJECT\xa0A TOUCH OF CREATIVITY\nConcurring, the younger Koh, who was in-charge of making the paper butler and maid, said a touch of creativity is also appreciated. For the maid’s hair, he let the ponytail rest on one side of the shoulders, and added a flower as adornment.\xa0\n“We can improvise a little bit so it’s not too boring. Change the facial expression slightly, and the overall feel will be different. To quote Spongebob, we have to think out of the box and have imagination,” he said, flashing a cheeky grin.\nAbout a decade ago, the younger Koh set aside his passion for baking and music to work for his father. “I thought my dad didn’t have anyone to inherit his business… and then this young man came along!” he said with a laugh.\xa0\nMr Lee was unfazed by the fact that this trade is closely related to deaths and bereavement services.\xa0\nHe attributed it to his late grandfather, who was the chairman of a local charitable organisation that helps to make funeral arrangements for deceased whose bodies are\xa0not claimed by family members.\xa0\n“The general hospital will contact us when there are such cases, and we will take care of the cremation.\n“I followed my grandfather since I was nine or 10 when he made arrangements for the deceased. He was very passionate about this. He considered helping them a merit-making deed,” he said.\xa0\nPEAK PERIOD IN LEAD UP TO SEVENTH LUNAR MONTH\nThe seventh lunar month in the Chinese calendar is the busiest period for paper effigy workshops. It is the month where, according to Chinese folklore, gates of the lower realms are thrown open for spirits to roam the human world.\xa0\nWhile individuals offer food and burn candles and joss papers at roadsides after night falls, big-scale celebrations feature a grand “da shi ye” paper effigy to preside over the ceremony. Standing at several metres tall, the king of ghosts cuts an imposing figure.\xa0\nFor master Koh’s workshop, orders for “da shi ye” come from as far as Langkawi and Kuala Lumpur. Each takes about two weeks to complete, from building the structure to putting the final touches.\n“Depending on the customers who place the orders, the faces of the ‘da shi ye’ effigies can be in green, red, blue, white or black,” Mr Lee explained.\xa0\n“The most time consuming part is getting the details right and fixing on the ornaments. For instance, the collar of a ‘da shi ye’ has three layers made of six pieces of paper, and he holds a ‘ling pai’ (authority token) in his hand.”\nUpon completion, the stern eyes of the “da shi ye” paper effigies are covered with a piece of paper, only to be removed when the celebrations begin at the respective sites.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nAt the end of the celebrations, the “da shi ye” effigies will be burnt, signalling the return of the god to the underworld.\xa0\nNo matter how delicate and elaborate they are, these handcrafted effigies will eventually be reduced to ashes. Despite so, Mr Lee said they treat every item with respect and care.\n“I am most satisfied when customers say my paper effigies look very real. I’ve made a paper tiffin carrier that is stackable, just like the real thing, and a paper sewing machine with a lid that can be lifted,” he said.\xa0\nLast year, Mr Koh’s workshop received an order for a 3.7m paper mansion. It was so big that it took one month to complete, and could only be assembled when delivered to the customer.\xa0\xa0\n“And then it was burnt down in less in two minutes. I looked at it and thought: Wow. Our sweat, the splinters and cuts that we suffered... We worked so hard to make this and it is now being razed by fire.\xa0\xa0\n“My only hope is that the deceased will receive these items,” Mr Lee said.\xa0\nHe added that he will be in this trade for as long as there are still demand for paper effigies.\xa0\n“This is part of the Chinese culture. If there are younger people willing to learn and take over, the trade will still exist. But like my master said, it’s not every day you have a ‘siao gia' (crazy young boys)\xa0turning up, saying he wants to make paper effigies.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     art ']}"

      The Japanese artist reinventing the family metalsmith trade he once hated
  </h1>, 'text': 'Growing up in a family of metalsmiths, Koichi Io recalled how much he hated the smell of copper.\xa0\n“When I was a child, I didn’t like it actually, because my father’s hands [always]\xa0smelled like copper metal,” said the 32-year-old Japanese artist. “But after I started practising, I became fascinated with how I can form the metal and how it appears after. And now my hands smell\xa0the same!”\nWhen your late grandfather and father have both dedicated their lives to banging away with a hammer, perhaps it’s inevitable that you end up doing the same.\n\n\nFor the past 12 years, Io has been creating exquisite metal pieces in a second-floor studio in Tokyo, which he shares with his father. It’s a cramped place oozing with history – there are shelves full of hammers, many of which date back to the 1920s and 1940s, the family tools of the trade.\nBut while his father Kenji follows the old school way, making tea kettles, incense burners, tea pots and frying pans, Io has taken a detour with contemporary pieces that are less functional and more art. It’s been tough-going, he admitted. “My market is Europe. I’ve only sold three pieces in Japan for the past 10 years. People here prefer more functional craft pieces,” he shared.\nThat may all change soon for the young metalsmith bent on reshaping a traditional Japanese practice.\n\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON CONTEMPORARY CRAFT\nIo was one of the finalists at this year’s recently concluded Loewe Foundation Craft Prize. His work was a mix of old techniques and new forms: A three-legged copper vase painstakingly hammered from a single sheet of metal.\nIt’s the kind of exposure many artists hope for – especially for those working in the field of contemporary craft.\nLaunched in 2016, the brainchild of Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson may be one of the newest international art prizes given by fashion and luxury brands, but its reputation is slowly growing as the most important one in in a relatively overlooked creative field.\nThe 2019 edition, its third, comprised works by 29 artists and craftspeople from 12 countries – which were all chosen from an astounding 2,500 submissions in over 100 countries.\nAt last week’s award ceremony, another Japanese artist, Genta Ishizuka, won for his lacquer sculpture and brought home the €50,000 (S$77,000) prize.\xa0\nTwo special mentions, which come with €5,000 consolation, were also given to the UK’s Harry Morgan for his concrete-meets-glass totem and Japan’s Kazuhito Takadoi for a sculpture made of intricately tied Hawthorn twigs.\nAn exhibition of all the pieces are currently on display at the Sogetsu Kaikan building in Tokyo until Jul 22.\n“What’s so interesting about Loewe’s Craft Prize is that it has\xa0made crafts mean something to the wider world and has shown how relevant craft skills are,” shared Deyan Sudjic, one of the jury members and director of London’s Design Museum.\nHe added: “People assume that craft is only about safeguarding tradition but if you look at the winning project this year, it’s about lacquer, which is paying homage to something which is a thousand, two thousand years old – but it’s done in a way that couldn’t have been done at any other time. So it’s paying respect to the past but it’s also liberating itself from the burden of following entirely in the footsteps of the past.”\n\n\nINNOVATION FROM ORANGES TO FEATHERS\nWhile the Craft Prize is a nod to the Spanish luxury house’s roots as a craft workshop in the 1800s, it’s also fast becoming an event where one can see glimpses of where the future of craft is heading.\nFrom the playful and ingenious use of materials such as gold, concrete, wood and metal to combining age-old techniques with technology, many of the artists on display are putting their spin on craftsmanship.\nLike Io, two other Japanese artists played around with another craft tradition: Urushi or Japanese lacquer.\nFor this year’s winner, Ishizuka, it was his fascination with the lacquer’s glossy sheen and finding the best form to highlight it that led to his sculpture – and the globular result was inspired by a regular trip to the supermarket.\n“I found oranges sitting in a mesh bag [and found it]\xa0interesting that the oranges make a kind of construction and mesh bag is making the surface,” he said.\nMeanwhile, finalist Masanori Nishikawa shared how he’s been combining urushi with Japanese washi paper and linen cloth to create sculptures – a technique he’s been using (and teaching to students) for the past 30 years.\nAnd it’s not just about being inspired by one’s own traditions. Spain’s Henar Iglesias and New Zealand’s Sophie Rowley both looked to other cultures for inspiration.\nIglesias, who was born into a millinery family, employed bird feathers in both making hats as well as for her work as an artist. It was an ancient practice in Mexico way before Columbus had arrived in the Americas and she started to use it in her pieces a decade ago.\nFor Rowley, a year-long stay in India introduced her to Khadi textiles, which she used to create a wall piece series for the prize. And with the techniques came a deeper understanding of the culture. “It’s a modest, everyday traditional Indian fabric but it also played an important role for independence in India because it was basically the first handmade fabric in the country,” she said.\nAnd while many often assume craftsmanship is about a single individual hand painstakingly creating something, collaboration is sometimes key. For Israeli artist Michal Fargo’s ceramic sculpture, the surface is covered by velvet-like fabric through a technique called “flocking”. For this, she collaborated with a third-generation master flocker.\nCollectively, the works on display at the exhibition stands as a kind of rebuttal to the trends of the modern life.\nWe live in a world in which material qualities, touch, owning things, objects, they’ve all been abolished in some ways by the digital revolution. So that’s why people actually still look for comfort of craft objects, of things that they can touch and feel and smell,” said jury member Sudjic. “The crafts that are shown here by Loewe are all about immense patience, of taking time and trouble, and thinking things through.”\nFor\xa0third-generation metalsmith Io, it’s back to the studio he shares with his father, where he’ll continue hammering away in pursuit of acceptance.\n“My field is not as big as the traditional craft field in Japan and not as big as the art market or art field, but we have our own language in contemporary craft. To preserve is not good enough – you have to apply what you know as your own way of expression.”\nCNA Luxury was in Tokyo at the invitation of\xa0Loewe. \n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     art ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Malaysia’s artists pledge to continue pushing boundaries of political expression
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: The signature hairdo, which curls outward at the ends and attached with a price tag of RM1,200 (US$288); and a Sapuman (Man of Steal) character who hails from a planet called Kleptocrat -\xa0a\xa0play on the fictional hero Superman from Krypton.\xa0\nThese were\xa0recurring elements in the political cartoons of Zunar, who used his work to draw attention to the claims of abuse of power and the corruption allegations that gripped the Najib Razak administration. Last May, the Barisan Nasional government was ousted by Pakatan Harapan (PH).\nIntimidation, detention, book\xa0bans and court charges through his career have failed to silence the 57-year-old, whose real name is Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque.\xa0\nAfter all, “How can I be neutral ... even my pen has a stand” was his motto.\xa0\n“People say (we should) draw until we manage to kick out the corrupt, but it was not an easy job. Not many cartoonists do it, but we keep doing,” Zunar, who has 30 years of political cartoon experience under his belt, told CNA.\xa0\nWhile the initial euphoria at the change of government may have faded more than a\xa0year down the road, what are Zunar and other politically aware artists up to these days? Are they enjoying more freedom of expression?\xa0\nZunar, for one, has no intention of easing off the pedal. Likewise, artists who have long been highlighting social issues and injustice say it is more important than ever to expand the room for free expression, educate people and keep the government on its toes.\xa0\nPOLITICAL CHANGE THROUGH ART\xa0\nLooking back, Zunar felt he contributed towards the outcome of the general election with the cartoons he\xa0produced.\xa0\n“I can say that I played a part, based on the feedback from the people,” he said. \xa0\n“One of the most important things is (that) cartoons cut across age groups, demographic groups and social classes. There are people in the rural areas, maybe they don’t like to read or are unable to read, so visuals are very attractive to them. My mission is to educate them.” \xa0\nAt the time when some media shied away from the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal, Zunar drew cartoon\xa0after cartoon featuring Najib and his wife Rosmah Mansor, who had once lamented that she had to pay RM1,200 to stylists to make house calls to dye her hair.\nCourt filings by the United States’ Department of Justice, which detailed the purchase of a 22-carat pink diamond necklace worth US$27.3 million for the wife of “Malaysian Official 1 (MO1)”, raised more than just a few eyebrows. MO1 was widely believed to be referring to Najib.\nAll these, and Rosmah’s penchant for expensive bags such as Bijan and Hermes Birkin, gave\xa0Zunar inspiration to compare her lifestyle to that of an ordinary housewife in his cartoons.\xa0\n“She got Prada, but you got prata. People got very angry,” he recounted.\xa0\nIn his book “Ketawa Pink Pink” published in March 2018, Rosmah was the main character. Taking aim at her supposed lavish ways,\xa0Zunar wanted to get the attention of female voters and expose them to the jaw-dropping corruption allegations and the 1MDB scandal.\xa0\n“Corruption is a very complex issue, especially 1MDB. I once attended (an event, where they gave a presentation) on the money trail.\xa0I saw the map that showed the flow of the money, I went back and had migraine for three days.\xa0\n“It’s so complex. So I thought, why don’t I use Rosmah and the things that people understand, the ring, the bags?” Zunar said.\n“I make my cartoons simple. I want people to laugh and at the same time, make sure they do something about it.”\xa0\nThings seemed to be looking up for Zunar after PH came to power. His travel ban was lifted, and so was the ban on some of his books. The nine charges of sedition against him for allegedly insulting the judiciary were dropped\xa0too.\nSCRUTINISING THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT\nAlthough his goal of helping to bring in a new government is now achieved, Zunar thinks his job is not done yet. His pen is still standing upright, scribbling across the canvas as he keeps a close eye on the current administration.\nOne of his latest works depicted Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad driving a road roller, flattening two characters labelled as “Cabinet” and “Parliament Select Committee” while crushing a sign that read “Reform”.\xa0\nIt was a reference to Dr Mahathir’s recent admission that he did not consult his Cabinet nor the parliamentary select committee on public appointments before naming Latheefa Beebi Koya as the new chief of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.\xa0\n“In Malaysia Baru, let’s not give so much power to any government from now on. That’s the job as a political cartoonist that I will definitely do,”\xa0Zunar said. \xa0\nMultidisciplinary artist Sharon Chin added\xa0that the election of the new government\xa0was not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter.\xa0“It is a new start, it is a blank page but it matters what we do with it. People would think that it’s the end, but it’s actually the start. The work is just starting!” the 38-year-old said.\xa0\nTwo pieces of her 2014 work that said “Writers Against the Sedition Act” and “Artists Against the Sedition Act” were recently exhibited in a group show titled Rasa Sayang at A+ Works of Art, an art gallery in Sentul, a suburb of Kuala Lumpur.\xa0\nThe two posters were originally created for the “Walk for Peace and Freedom” event organised by the Malaysian Bar on October 16, 2014. Calling for the repeal of the Sedition Act 1948, the event protested against oppressing dissidents and advocating instead for a robust debate, diversity of opinion, freedom of speech and expression.\nWhile repealing the Sedition Act was part of PH’s election manifesto - along with the Prevention of Crime Act, Universities and University Colleges Act, Printing Presses and Publications Act, National Security Council Act and mandatory death by hanging in all Acts - it has yet to be abolished.\xa0\n“I am not disappointed, my expectations were not that high. Process takes a long time. We are working towards that, that’s the reality. It’s important for me to look at it straight,” Chin said.\xa0\nThe yet-to-be-fulfilled promise was also a concern for Zunar. In the past, he was probed under the Sedition Act, the Printing Presses and Publications Act, the Communications and Multimedia Act, the Penal Code for activities detrimental to parliamentary democracy, and the Immigration Act.\xa0\n“In the bigger aspect, we can’t say we have the freedom yet. Maybe a bit better, for the first two years of course when you change a new government, but we need indicators,” he said.\xa0\n“What I worry now, all the laws still exist, especially the Sedition Act and the Printing Presses and Publications Act,” he said.\xa0\nZunar said he is yet to be fully convinced that the PH government has the willpower to abolish the acts, unless the prime minister makes a clear statement on the matter.\xa0\n“For Malaysians, we can understand if you talk about the government needing some time to overcome the damage done on the economy by the previous government. But to abolish laws, you don’t need money, you just say you want or don’t want,” he said.\xa0\nLast month, de facto Law Minister Liew Vui Keong was quoted as saying that the Sedition Act was expected to be abolished this year. A new formula would be introduced to replace it, he added.\xa0\nAnother artist whose work was seen as a symbol of defiance against Najib, Fahmi Reza, also called for the abolishment of laws that can be used against the artistic community.\nHe was charged in June 2016 under the Communications and Multimedia Act for uploading a caricature of Najib on his social media account with the intention to offend. The caricature that mocked Najib portrayed him as a clown with red lips and a big red nose.\nIn February 2018, the Sessions Court found Fahmi\xa0guilty and sentenced him to a month\'s jail and a fine of RM30,000.\nThe High Court later in November upheld the Sessions Court\'s conviction against him, but reduced the RM30,000 fine to RM10,000, in default of a month\'s jail.\nFahmi is seeking to overturn the conviction at the Court of Appeal.\n""All of the clown related artwork and items that were confiscated by the police during my arrest under the Sedition Act in 2016 are still in their possession. The case is still open\xa0today,"" he said.\nHe noted that even though he sees PH as an improvement compared with previous administration, almost all of the\xa0laws that they pledged to abolish are still in place.\xa0Most of the election promises for democratic reform\xa0have not been fulfilled, he said.\nThe laws that were used to arrest, investigate and charge him, especially the Sedition Act and Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act are still being used by PH to probe\xa0activists, Fahmi added.\n“Until they abolish these laws, I have little confidence that they would not take similar oppressive action against artists, activists and dissidents during their rule"".\nMORE ROOM NOW FOR EXPRESSION\nCensorship in the local art scene is not unheard of.\nIn 2014, the National Visual Arts Gallery removed two artworks by the finalists of the Young Contemporaries 2013 contest. One by Cheng Yen Peng featured the words ABU = ASHES spray-painted across image of condom-like balloons, while the other by Izat Arif Saiful Bahri featured black T-shirts with Arabic alphabets of “Fa” and “Qof”.\xa0\nABU is widely known as\xa0the acronym for\xa0Asal Bukan Umno (Anything But UMNO, the\xa0United Malays National Organisation).\xa0\nThe gallery had said that the action was prompted by negative feedback from\xa0visitors.\xa0\nIn November 2017, the police confiscated several pieces of installation art from the inaugural Kuala Lumpur Biennale for allegedly containing “elements of communism”, following complaints.\xa0\nUnder the PH government, concerns over censorship still linger, despite there being more room for expression, said those interviewed.\nLast August, pictures of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activists\xa0Nisha Ayub and Pang Khee Teik with the Malaysian flag were taken down\xa0from a photography exhibition at the George Town Festival 2018 on the orders of a federal minister.\xa0\n“The mechanics of censorship and self-censorship are complex. One of the major problems still prevalent in Malaysian arts is the lack of transparency,” said Mr Joshua Lim, director of A+ Works of Art.\nHe noted that there have been instances in the last few years where complaints were made about artworks in exhibitions, and then the works were covered up or taken down, or the artists were asked to change their works.\n“There is no due process, no transparency, no discussion, and what this means is that there is both censorship and the hiding of censorship,” added Mr Lim.\nA+ Works of Art’s “Rasa Sayang” is a group show by Malaysian artists, writers and poets to commemorate the first anniversary of the historic 14th general election. \xa0\nIn the show, which ended on Jun 15, the\xa0flag of Malaysia\xa0received an artistic facelift by Sabah-based art collective Pangrok Sulap.\nIn place of the red and white stripes were little images of catchphrases, promises or hot button issues that surfaced every election, like media freedom and political “frogs” (those who jump from one political party to another). This artwork was given the title of “Siaran Ulangan (Repeat Broadcast)”.\nThe exhibition’s curator Mr Eric Goh said: “This work raised the question of how much has changed since the general election? One of Pakatan Harapan’s criticisms of Najib was spending a lot of money on frivolous projects and yet these continue after they took over. It’s quite ironic.”\n“This work, made of woodcut printmaking, isn’t saying that nothing has changed, but it’s just asking what really has changed and asking the audience to reflect on them.” \xa0\nThe gallery’s director Mr Lim said regardless of the outcome of the election, the exhibition would have been held anyway. While he noted more\xa0room for expression in Malaysia Baru, he said more work still needs to be done.\xa0\n“One of the very important changes since last year’s landmark election is that the media and news are more independent than before. This contributes to a sense in the larger culture that there is more room for free expression, and the arts benefit from this. But there are still issues that are neglected, topics considered too sensitive, so more changes are still needed,” he said.\xa0\nMOVING FORWARD\nIt has only been slightly more than a year since Dr Mahathir led PH to a shock victory, and the general sentiments are that the PH leadership still needs more time to set things right.\n“I don’t agree with people that oh, nothing has changed, because it is a real change, but we need to be more honest about the nature of that change,” Chin said. \xa0\nShe is now working on her upcoming project, “In the Skin of A Tiger: Monument to What We Want”, an installation art commissioned for Singapore Biennale 2019.\xa0\nThe National Visual Arts Gallery in Kuala Lumpur has agreed to host the first public participation event for the project, which would be followed by the second at the National Gallery Singapore ahead of the opening of the Biennale on Nov 22.\xa0\n“This artwork is about the historic change of government,” she said.\xa0\nAt the participation events, members of the public will be invited to sew something on the banners made of the various political party flags\xa0Chin had collected in Port Dickson during the election.\xa0\n“While it’s always been possible for local artists to engage the National Visual Arts Gallery, the nature of the engagement is perhaps now more open. It’s easier to have dialogue,” she said.\xa0\xa0For Zunar, space for political cartoons in Malaysia\'s mainstream media remains limited, and he is not one who will tone down his cartoons to toe an editorial line. Editorial cartoons should not just illustrate the headlines, but convey the cartoonists’ perspectives on the issues, he insisted.\xa0\nBut one thing is for sure, he will miss Rosmah, who now mainly stays out of the limelight. \xa0\n“People hate Rosmah but they love to see her. When she spoke, she spoke out of her heart. I once had an exhibition and the visitors did not respond much to my other cartoons on 1MDB, judiciary, etc, except the section on Rosmah.\n“For that aspect, she has more character. The thing I miss Rosmah is about that. She is very cartoonable,” Mr Zunar said with a laugh. \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     art ']}"

      Cosmic bridges, music with plush balls and more at this year’s Children’s Biennale
  </h1>, 'text': 'Thinking of where to bring the young ones this weekend? How about dropping by the museum and having fun with art.\nFor the second edition of the National Gallery Singapore’s popular Children’s Biennale, kids – and adults open to embracing their inner child – can walk across a bridge and peer down into the cosmos, throw balls at metal tubes to make music, or explore a lush garden made of paper cut-outs.\nThe Biennale, which opens on Saturday (May 25) and runs until December, will feature 11 interactive works by 13 artists from Singapore and Southeast Asia revolving around the theme Embracing Wonder.\nAmong these are two works by artists who are currently also showing at the prestigious Venice Biennale in Italy. Singaporean artist Song-Ming Ang’s Chance Operations features various coloured metal tubes arranged like huge wind chimes, which audiences can throw plush balls at to create music.\xa0\nMeanwhile, Filipino artist Mark Justiniani has remade his popular bridge-of-mirrors at the museum basement to create a piece called Stardust: Soaring Through The Sky’s Embrace.\n“Art is a place for children to learn about themselves, trust their ideas, and explore what is possible, all of which are important in enabling children to become confident, independent thinkers. Hence, we are always looking at innovative ways to engage with young learners to nurture an early interest in art by showcasing how it can be fun, inspirational and educational,” said Suenne Megan Tan, the museum’s director for audience development and engagement.\nOther works on display by Singapore artists include Every World by Donna Ong, an immersive space recreating\xa0underground, underwater and garden landscapes with intricate paper cut-outs; Milenko and Delia Prvacki’s Big Hug, featuring a series of rooms; a 3D motion-activated wall artwork by Hazel Lim-Schlegel and Andreas Schlegel titled The Oort Cloud and the Blue Mountain; Zainudin Samsuri’s Dayung Sampan, which features sculptures such as a giant foot resembling a sampan; and writer Lorraine Tan and illustrator Eric Wong’s The Story of Karang Guni Boy, which sees a children’s story come to life.\nFrom the region, the Biennale also features top Indonesian artist Eko Nugroho, who has created six life-sized traditional paper lanterns depicting Javanese life, and Myanmar’s Nge Lay and Aung Ko, who have recreated traditional Burmese homes featuring a selection of the country’s folk tales.\nAside from the exhibition, the Biennale will also feature events such as poetry readings, music performances and film screenings.

      The artist who brought the sound of Singapore to the Venice Biennale
  </h1>, 'text': 'With its iconic gondolas, water canals, quaint bridges and Renaissance buildings, Venice is eye-candy for the tourist – a city so visually packed with details you can’t help but look and look.\nBut for Singaporean artist Song-Ming Ang, it’s also a place you listen to. \n\n\n“When you’re by the coast, you hear the waves all the time, crashing against the shore. In spring, you hear the whistling of strong winds and rattling window shutters. When you’re in the very narrow alleys, the sound is slightly claustrophobic and you hear people talking upstairs,” he shared – before being interrupted by a helicopter roaring overhead.\n“It’s coming from the top, too!” said Ang, with a laugh. “How can you not listen?”\nWHAT IS ‘MUSIC FOR EVERYONE’? \nSounds – and the act of listening – play a huge part in the 38-year-old Singaporean artist’s practice. And as the country’s representative at the prestigious Venice Biennale art event, it’s no surprise Ang has included music in his exhibition.\nAt the Singapore Pavilion, located on the second floor of one of the buildings at the Italian city’s old Arsenale complex, the quirky and melancholic tune of recorders is one of the first things visitors will notice upon entering. It’s the sound coming from a three-channel video of Singaporean children playing and having fun with a very familiar instrument from childhood.\n\n\nPart-child’s play and nostalgia, part-Singapore music history lesson, Music For Everyone: Variations On A Theme, which was presented by Ang and Singaporean curator Michelle Ho, explores what this phrase could mean to different people.\nFrom the top-down efforts of the government (the title was taken from a popular concert series in the 70s and 80s by the then-Ministry of Culture to promote nation-building) to more organic ways of approaching music (children creating their own music, recorders playfully reassembled into sculptures and music manuscripts folded or crumpled), it’s a deceptively simple show with some nuanced views about the role of music in people’s lives.\nWhich is something that Ang, who received the Young Artist Award in 2011, has been preoccupied with for quite some time. “I think a lot about contexts in which we consume music, how music reaches us.”\nLOOK MA, I’M IN A BAND\nAs a teenager in the late 90s, Ang recalled listening to Britpop and indie music bands like Sonic Youth. “There was a fertile scene in Singapore, too – Livonia was around, Concave Scream was still playing, Humpback Oak was releasing really great albums. I remember going to the Substation a lot,” he said.\nHe was also part of an experimental band called Hearing Hill, while also creating solo music on his laptop under the moniker Circadian.\n“Our first concert was at Mountbatten CC,” he recalled. “We were playing a punk and noise gig. That was our crowd – people who made extreme underground music.”\nThat said, their improvisatory rock music was occasionally too much for some. “There was once, we played at the Substation and got flamed at an online forum after that. Like, ‘What was this band doing?’ or “Like that, my mother can also do!’. Which was our point, thank you very much!” he recalled, with a laugh.\nFROM MUSIC TO ART (AND PING-PONG BALLS)\nFor Ang, the turning point from making music to making art about music came in the early 2000s. “I started checking out jazz and classical music, and I got interested in world or ethnic music,” he said.\nAs a literature major at National University of Singapore, he was also exposed to critical theory. “I realised that actually, apart from performing, composing, listening and consuming music, it’s something you can think about from an anthropological perspective.”\nHis first ever artwork was in 2003, where he installed a proper band set-up – and encouraged people to grow ping pong balls at them, creating amplified sounds when these hit the plugged-in instruments.\n“I just thought it was interesting to do something with the language of rock music, with electric guitars, and at the same time make it accessible,” he shared.\nIncidentally, a new version of that work will part of the National Gallery Singapore’s Children’s Biennale, which opens this week. But this time, instead of band equipment, he’s installed thousands of steel pipes of different colours and sizes – onto which visitors can throw 350 ping pong balls to make music (or noise).\n‘BOLIAO’ ART ABOUT BIEBER AND BACH\nTo date, his music- or sound-inspired artworks have run the gamut. Ang has taken on the world of classical music by, for example, trying to play a Bach piece backward (on a harpsichord for the first time), assembling a piano from scratch and recreating a music stand with glass.\nHe’s looked at the participatory nature of music by holding listening parties, creating a mobile karaoke installation that went around Singapore or doing a video about adults singing their primary school songs.\nPop and alternative? He once did a series of watercolour paintings based on Belle & Sebastian album covers, and once had a project where he tried to learn Justin Bieber’s autograph over three months – before fake-signing a poster.\nA lot of his works can be seen as light-hearted, often humorous or as he himself described them “boliao – very silly, pointless and borderline absurd.” \xa0But the light tone of many of these belie the serious nature of his practice.\n“I think part of my job (as an artist) is to see how I can bring a new perspective to an old subject. How can you re-perform an old school song in an interesting way? How can you look at a recorder in a new way? How do you understand Justin Bieber in a new way – who is Justin Bieber, anyway? He’s a construct, a packaged idol but he’s also blood and flesh.”\nA LOT OF MUSIC – IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK\nWhile Ang now mostly makes art about music, he occasionally still plays and creates music in the conventional sense.\nFor a piece he did for the President’s Young Talents exhibit in 2015 – a video of his parents bringing him a guitar from Singapore to Berlin, where he’s half-based with his wife and child – he created the soundtrack with that same guitar.\nLast year, he was part of a collaborative project in Melbourne called A Song To Change The World, where he played live, which is also making its way to Japan’s Aichi Triennale in August. “I did it as part of the art that I make so I don’t do it as a musician – although I’ve been thinking about going back to making music or re-releasing some of my old stuff.”\nAng might not be playing music that much these days, but he’s still plugged into the scene. When asked if anything has changed from the days of the Music For Everyone concert series that he tackled in the Venice Biennale,\n“There’s a lot of music and a lot of art in Singapore – if people spend their time not just on the surface. You’ve got the Esplanade, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Chinese Orchestra, but also concerts going on in very underground venues that people don’t know about. There are events, initiatives, infrastructure put in place by the government, but at the same time, things that are just independently created – if you know where to look.”\nOr perhaps, more importantly, listen.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     art ', '     Profiles ']}"

      Singapore puts the humble recorder in the celebrated Venice Biennale spotlight
  </h1>, 'text': ""When the prestigious Venice Biennale opens to the public this weekend (May 11), the playful sounds of the humble recorder played by Singaporean children are set to lure curious tourists and art lovers to one corner of the Italian city like a Pied Piper moment.\nThe music they’ll hear (and see performed) is part of Recorder Rewrite, a three-video installation by Singaporean artist Song-Ming Ang, who is representing the country at the 58th edition of what is\xa0often regarded as the international art world’s version of the Olympics, which runs from May 11 to Nov 24.\nAng’s 15-min\xa0video piece – which features 20 children either performing or playing (or both at the same time) at various locations at the Singapore Conference Hall – is the main component of the five-part show Music For Everyone: Variations On A Theme.\nThe show was unveiled on May 9\xa0at the Singapore Pavilion, located in the Arsenale complex. At the opening, a group of children from Venice also fittingly performed a new composition on recorders, which was inspired by the video piece.\nThe exhibit takes its cue from the Music For Everyone series of public concerts organised by what was then Singapore's Ministry of Culture back in the 1970s and 1980s.\nConceived by Ang together with Singaporean curator Michelle Ho, it also includes a series of poster reproductions from the 1970s: Huge textile banners of old Music For Everyone concerts as well as watercolour paintings of lyric and songwriting contests of the time.\n\xa0There are also sculptures of reassembled parts of the recorder and a series of blank music manuscripts that have been turned into quirky paper art through folding, crumpling and splicing.\nThe 38-year-old contemporary artist is known for making works that are music-themed, which has previously included everything from reassembling an old piano to holding “listening parties”.\n“You can go to many places with music, and in my practice, it has an anthropological aspect. Most of the time I don’t even make music. I make art about music, so there’s a bit of distance. I think a lot about contexts in which we consume music, how music reaches us,” said Ang, who incidentally, will be presenting another separate work back in Singapore this month during the National Gallery Singapore’s Children’s Biennale.\nThe presence of the recorder – whether\xa0reconfigured as sculptures or played by children in the video installation – is a nod to the musical instrument’s ubiquitous presence in the lives of Singaporean children.\n“In Singapore, we inherited the recorder as part of our music education due to the legacy of British colonialism,” he added. “But if we look beyond the instrument’s history, what we see is that many people around the world actually share a common experience through it. Ideally, the audience [watching the video]\xa0should walk away feeling excited, thinking, ‘Ah, I didn’t know you could do that with the recorder!’”\nCurator Ho, meanwhile, pointed out how the show offers two perspectives of what the idea of “music for everyone” can be.\nCiting how the\xa0Music For Everyone series began during Singapore’s early nation-building years, she said: “From the Ministry of Culture’s point of view, music has been put into somewhat neat categories [such as]\xa0the genres of instruments or types of performers. And when we start to look at Song-Ming’s works, there’s a much lighter sense of free play going on. There’s a lot of improvisation techniques;\xa0how to expand on the possible forms of a music instrument that turn into sculptures.”\nIn his opening speech, guest-of-honour Baey Yam Keng, senior parliamentary secretary for the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and Transport, announced there are plans to bring the exhibit to Singapore next year.\n“It is fascinating to see how historical archives are given new life through this exhibition,” he said, referring to the show’s posters and banners.\nHe also highlighted the show’s use of the recorder, recalling how he and his children had also learned it in primary school. “Today, it is still taught in primary schools in Singapore as well as in many other countries as one of the earliest introductions to music.”\nPaul Tan, deputy chief executive of the National Arts Council, which commissioned the show, added: “It shines a spotlight on a humble and familiar musical instrument and through it, retells Singapore’s cultural history and the story of music education.”\nSingapore has been participating in the Biennale since 2001, and Ang follows other previous artist representatives, including recent ones such as Zai Kuning (2017), Charles Lim (2015), Ho Tzu Nyen (2011) and Ming Wong, who won a Special Mention prize back in 2009.\nSince 2015, Singapore has been presenting at a space in the Arsenale’s Sale d’Armi building, where it has a 20-year lease.\nAng isn’t the only Singaporean or Singapore-based artist in town. Elsewhere, sculptor and painter Kumari Nahappan is exhibiting a huge sculpture of entwined chillies titled Talktime at the Giardini Marinaressa as part of the Personal Structures international exhibition.\nIt’s Nahappan’s second consecutive participation at Venice Biennale parallel show. In 2017, she exhibited giant saga seeds at an indoor venue, but this year, her sculptures are out in the open.\n“So far, everyone’s been taking a lot of photos,” she said, with a laugh. “Two years ago, (my work) was in a closed space where the impact was intense, whereas this is free and open, and it kind of draws people’s attention while they’re walking.”\nAlso participating in shows running parallel to the Biennale are new media artist Urich Lau, performance artists Adeline Kueh and Lynn Lu, photographer Teo Chai Guan, painter Laila, as well as curators Annie Jael Kwan and Erika Tan.\nElsewhere, there was news of artist Shubigi Rao being was appointed curator of the fifth Kochi-Muziris Biennale, India's largest art event, which will be held in 2020.\nEarly this year, Rao was part of a joint exhibition with actress-artist Lucy Liu held at the National Museum Singapore.\nThis year’s Venice Biennale features a slew of events including a main exhibition that revolves around the theme May You Live In Interesting Times. There are also 90 national pavilions, including a handful from the region.\xa0\nAside from Singapore, other South-east Asian countries present include the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, who will be participating for the first time.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     art ']}"

      Forget Ari or Thong Lo – Bangkok’s coolest neighbourhood is Charoenkrung
  </h1>, 'text': 'Housed in Bangkok’s Grand Postal Building, the Thailand Creative & Design Center (TCDC) spans five storeys and across 9,000 sq m. The state-of-the-art facility boasts a library with over 70,000 books dedicated to art and design, a material and design innovation centre with over 8,000 materials, and a comprehensive range of equipment that designers can utilise for prototyping.\nBesides its immense variety of research and production resources, the centre also plays host to a plethora of design-related workshops and exhibitions. The most important zone in the building, however, may just be the Creative Space on the topmost floor, which comprises a co-working area and a business centre where staff is on hand to help creatives deal with industry issues and also to connect them with one another.\nImpressive as all these facilities are, they aren’t all that the TCDC has brought to Charoenkrung when it moved to the historic district in 2017. It’s also played a central role in rejuvenating the old town by drawing a creative community to it – a group that is steadily growing.\nThe TCDC was established in 2004 as part of the Thai government’s initiative to transform the nation’s economy. Facing an economic crisis at that time, the government realised that it cannot rely solely on low-cost production and decided to shift its focus to design and encourage innovation among its people.\n“Fifteen years ago, when we talked about design or creativity, [the Thais will] think that it is ‘luxury’ work and not ‘related’ to them,” explained the TCDC’s managing director, Apisit Laistrooglai. And that is where the centre came in, showing them how to use design to improve their business and their quality of life.\nNow that Thailand has a thriving design industry, the TCDC still has a mission to fulfil – to continue inspiring creative thinking and help the next generation of designers grow. Relocating to Charoenkrung is also a strategic move in seeding the transformation of the old town into a creative district in Bangkok.\n“TCDC is just a small part of this creative district, but I think TCDC kind of became a place that unites design people and that’s how we grow the community. I wish everyone, not just designers, can come and experience this kind of community,” said Laistrooglai.\nContemporary art galleries, hip cafes and bars now dot its streets, while young people and creative professionals who came to be immersed in the culture have formed part of the local community. In the two years since the TCDC moved in, Charoenkrung has become one of those rare places in Bangkok that has managed to retain its heritage while transforming into one of the coolest spots within the vibrant Thai capital.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Inside the home of the Singapore architect who built a love letter to his wife
  </h1>, 'text': '“Spaces that evoke emotion and spirituality – I think that’s what good architecture is all about,” said architect Edmund Ng, principal of Edmund Ng Architects. His clean designs and artistic sensibilities can be seen in projects built in Singapore and abroad.\nRecently, Ng took on a project of particular significance – his own home. Using the narrow width of the land plot to his advantage, Ng deconstructed rooms and integrated functions to create a unique space.\n“It’s a house that is my work of art,” said Ng, an art lover who has been married for seven years to Jazz Chong, an art collector and founder of gallery Ode to Art. “Of course, it’s an extension of ourselves. Interestingly, there was no discussion [with my wife] about how the house should look like.”\nThankfully, his wife’s initial reaction to the space was a favourable one. “When she first walked through the door, I could see a big smile on her face. And that’s the best reward that any architect building their own home can get. It fell into place, and everyone’s comfortable,” he said.\nNg embraces a Japanese design philosophy called wabi-sabi. “It means to celebrate imperfection as a form of beauty,” he explained.\nThe bungalow features an austere facade that belies a warm, inviting interior designed to showcase their mutual obsession, art.\nAs such, the home’s basement features an in-house art gallery that displays his wife’s extensive contemporary art collection, which features an eclectic mix of paintings and sculptures. The gallery walls are made of fair-faced concrete, which Ng considers “the most perfect canvas whereby anything can be hung, removed, with nail marks that are not patched up, and it’s still a form of natural beauty”.\nUnusually, the living room does not feature any large glass windows or sliding doors; instead, the only views come from two tiny slits of glass within a large concrete block which resembles a bunker. “It’s a curated decision,” explained Ng, “We wanted to frame the view, to look into a curated landscape of trees being planted. So this is an inward-looking sort of architecture.”\nHe considers the dining room one of the most important spaces in his home.\n“Dining is always one of the main activities in the house, and we do entertain quite a fair bit, so it has to be the main focus of the house,” explained Ng, who enjoys cooking up a storm, and co-hosting large parties, with his wife. “And if you were to know my wife, you know that she’s always in pants instead of skirts. Her persona is masculine, yet with a little feminine touch,” he said.\nIn order to reflect their tastes and personalities, the dining room was designed to be a masculine yet warm space. It is decked out with black metal overlays, light wood flooring and a candle chandelier. The overall effect is somewhat medieval, yet modern.\nElsewhere in the house, standout features include a staircase composed of floating concrete slabs, a most unusual walk-in wardrobe, a master bedroom that sprawls across 1,000 sq. ft., and a painting of his wife hanging above the bathtub, which Ng calls “his own Mona Lisa”.\nAll in, this architectural ode to love is a home that speaks of a couple in sync with each other.\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Prints, patterns and preservation: How Indonesia’s batik artisans draw a younger generation
  </h1>, 'text': ""BEKASI: Peni Cahyaningtyas belongs to a younger generation of hand-drawn batik artisans.\nThe 33-year old was tracing a floral pattern on a piece of cloth when I met her at her home in a housing complex in Bekasi, West Java province, about an hour outside Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.\nThis is where she works, making batik\xa0shawls and scarves. She also sells clothing on her online store, retailing from about US$10 each.\nIt is affordable, given the time and effort needed to create a piece of batik. However, attracting buyers remains a challenge.\nMaking batik, Indonesia’s national fabric, is no easy feat.\nThe ancient craft requires artisans to draw patterns on fabric by hand using hot wax and a pen-like copper tool called “canting”. It has a snout on one end, through which the hot wax is filled up and made to flow out of the nib.\nOnce the design has been traced, the cloth is repeatedly dipped into a variety of coloured dyes in order to achieve the desired final colour.\nBatik can also be made by stamping. Large stamping blocks made of copper are used to transfer the desired patterns onto the fabric.\nWith her steady hands and\xa0swirling motions, modern patterns are made, peppered at times with pop-culture references.\xa0Peni hopes this will\xa0introduce the country’s cultural heritage to the younger generation. She also hopes to encourage millennials to appreciate the works of art, which they can wear.\n“I felt like I should do something so that I can be an influence to other young people. And show them that, hey, batik-making is fun. You can make it everything you want and just create something – but with wax and the canting,” she said.\n“You can create any image or design you want, whether it’s Star Wars\xa0or\xa0flowers, you can create it all.”\xa0\nTHE ABSENCE OF A YOUNG GENERATION \nFor Peni, her motivation to take up the craft came from a visit to the royal city of Yogyakarta, one of Indonesia’s main batik centres. There, she met\xa0batik artisans at a village.\n“I asked them:\xa0‘Madam, how old is the youngest batik artisan here?’ And she said that all the artisans at that village were aged 40 years and above,” said Peni.\n“I then asked her: ‘Where are the young people?’”\n“They answered saying:\xa0‘The youth these days were not interested in making batik because it was boring and perhaps it has little monetary reward and perhaps the youth are of the opinion that making batik lacks in prestige.’”\nAuthentic batik is expensive and making it is time-consuming. Some pieces take days, sometimes even months, to create. It is also why preserving the heritage is challenging, especially when it comes to the younger generation.\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF BATIK-MAKING\nPeni’s mother, Indra Tjahjani, is a batik enthusiast who has been conducting cultural workshops, including batik-making, in the country for the past 18 years.\n“I don’t actually come from a family of batik artisans, but we have been made familiar with batik since we were little,” she said. “So for us Javanese, usually, from the time you are little, you already have to learn how to do the Javanese dance. Now, when you do this dance you have to wear a piece of cloth and you have to be able to wear the cloth of your own making and recognise the motif on it.\n“In Java, every piece of batik has its own philosophy. So for me, it was important to convey to the younger generation or whomever else what the philosophy that was behind the décor.”\nShe said Indonesians must understand the complexity of batik making in order to appreciate the art better, because batik isn’t just about\xa0tracing a design with a “canting”.\nOne such philosophy is the one behind the classic Wahyu Tumurun motif. The main design is shaped like a crown with flowers inside, but there is also one that resembles a pair of roosters or birds. These are surrounded by various plant or herb-like drawings close together.\nThe Wahyu Tumurun should not be used inside out, and the crown-like motif should be facing upwards when worn.\n“When people used this in the old days, it meant they hoped to have a good career. In the past, people making batik would accompany the process with prayers and fasting so the person who would wear the cloth would receive the makers’ blessings,” Mrs Tjahjani explained.\nPRINTED VS HAND-DRAWN BATIK\nWhile Mrs Indra's workshops could help raise awareness, educating consumers about different types of batik could ensure the survival of the craft, according to young batik artisans like Bagus\xa0Priyono.\nMr Priyono is a third-generation artisan. His grandmother began making batik in 1975. Later, the knowledge would be passed on to his mother, who started teaching her children in the 1990s.\nToday, Mr Priyono handles the marketing for the family batik business in Jambi province. They produce two types of batik -\xa0one that is solely hand-drawn, and another that's hand-drawn and stamped.\xa0\nWith more than 50 workers, the company produces 200 pieces of combination stamped and hand-drawn batik each month, and between 50 and\xa070 pieces of hand-drawn batik.\nMass-produced print batiks are also now widely available throughout the archipelago.\nWhile they are much\xa0cheaper, there are concerns that imitation batiks undercut the value of hand-drawn pieces, which could take months to complete, and hurt the income of batik artisans.\xa0\nDepending on the material the batik is drawn on, some fabrics or garments with authentic hand-drawn designs can cost hundreds, even thousands, of dollars.\n“We often get customers who come and they say:\xa0‘How come it's expensive?’ And we have to explain because for us, batik is a cultural product. So we can't let go of stories behind the fabric’s history and we tell the customer so that they understand that.”\n“And this understanding must continue to grow so that the customers realise that what they are buying are not just textiles but they are buying art, buying culture and there is a long process behind creating a piece of cloth,” Mr Priyono said.\nWhile there is a market for the cheaper textile, it is important for consumers to discern when they should be willing to pay premium prices for authentic batik, said Mr Priyono, who believes that batik makers should be responsible for educating consumers on what they are paying for and should be paying for.\n“First, there is absolutely no error, the patterns are exactly alike and second, the two sides are different. These factors show that the fabric has been printed on,” he explained.\nA fabric created by stamping is relatively neat, but each motif would not be identical.\xa0\n“When batik is drawn by hand, between one motif and another, even though they’re both the same design, they’re not exactly alike and do not have the same precision,” said Mr Priyono.\nPRESERVING CULTURAL HERITAGE\nTogether with Mr Priyono, Mrs Indra and her daughter Peni are members of Perkumpulan Wastra Indonesia. It\xa0groups fabric lovers, artists, collectors and\xa0researchers, and has\xa0been working to raise awareness about the country’s rich textile traditions.\xa0\nEstablished in 2017, the organisation not only mentors artisans to improve their lifestyle, but also creates and hosts programmes and workshops to introduce traditional fabrics, in the hopes of building a stronger community.\n“Many Indonesians are still ignorant, especially the youth who do not recognise batik, woven fabrics and so on,” said Diah Koesnidar, a member of the organisation.\n“We are trying to not only familiarise them with more, but also introduce fabric with more youth-friendly motifs. So not too many colours, and not too bright colours as well.”\nShe said\xa0their efforts are slowly paying off.\n“We try to begin with the programme which introduces traditional fabrics, then we are also cooperating with textile museums and with various parties, for example we collaborate with Binus University for interiors.”\nBesides fashion, batik designs can also be incorporated into furniture such as cushion covers and table runners, or even jewellery.\nAnd as trendier designs are created, the expectation is that more young Indonesians will become interested in batik, giving hope to many that it is only a matter of time before a stronger community emerges to preserve this ancient and precious art form.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     art ']}"

      Meet Ryan Su: Art collector, philanthropist and admirer of cockatoos
  </h1>, 'text': 'The mark of a true collector is when he or she says that they’ve lost count of the number of items in their collection(s).\nTake Ryan Su, for instance. As the lawyer, philanthropist and recipient of the 2017 patron of the arts award put it, “I think I have too many collections. Each collection is a little haywire, eclectic and kind of crazy. I don’t have a number (to my art collection), but I have enough for me and also enough to share.”\nAnd sharing is what Su does best. In 2012, he started the nonprofit The Ryan Foundation, to share his passion for contemporary art with the public. It is his hope that the Foundation promotes art awareness and develops art projects to build communities.\nSu’s journey into the world of art started at a young age. He held a deep fascination for the natural world, especially plants and animals. He first collected orchids before moving on to different types of plants. Over time, he grew to become such an expert on plant life that he even sat on the Singapore Gardening Society committee for 12 years.\n\n\nSu also collected tropical fish, and later, birds, a possible influence from his grandfather, who reared birds as well. He remarked: “I like cockatoos, which are a type of parrot with a crest – like my hair today! Cockatoos are particularly interesting because they are from [our part of the world]. They’re extremely intelligent and I like to observe their relationships with human beings.”\nSu explained that given his legal background, he likes to conduct research on individual artists. He said: “When I invest my time in that research, I like to look at the works that they were creating when they were very young, and throughout the trajectory of their career.”\nThe first exhibition he mounted was a series of Polaroids taken by the late Andy Warhol. Said Su: “It turns out that his photography was not that expensive and perhaps even more valuable and meaningful than his paintings and prints, because he used these photographs of celebrities that he took to create the bigger works.”\nSince then, Su has gone on to helm a collaborative exhibition between Hollywood actress Lucy Liu and Singaporean artist Shubigi Rao. He said of Liu: “She has over 180 individual books where she cut holes in them and put in little objects that she finds on the streets. It gives people a glimpse of Lucy’s life but also gives them a sense to discover themselves and to make their own stories by looking through these objects.”\n\n\nBesides being famous for his art collection, Su is also known for his flamboyant dress sense. He has a penchant for Jim Thompson fabrics, and shared that each time he looks at the different designs, he is intrigued, and as a Singaporean, he believes he “should wear these outfits, perhaps be somewhat of an ambassador to places I go”.\nWhile his admiration for the “silk king’s” aesthetics started since young and has not waned, Su also looks to “what other people collected before me, and to see their inspirations and their ideas”. He added: “What drew me to all these things perhaps was rarity, but also beauty. I am very determined to build good collections in whatever areas I’m interested in.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      How art galleries and museums are tackling climate change and social justice
  </h1>, 'text': 'Saving the planet. It’s not just the subject of passionate political debate. It’s at the heart of a growing number of museum exhibitions this year, including the works of old masters and exhibits built with high-tech innovations, designed to inspire artistic appreciation and a desire to respond to environmental challenges.\nAmong the shows: The much-anticipated Hudson Rising at the New-York Historical Society; Nature’s Nation: American Art and Environment, in Salem, Massachusetts, which looks at 300 years of American art through an environmental lens; Documenting Change: Our Climate (Past, Present and Future) in Boulder, Colorado. And more.\n“There’s a crescendo of interest in both art that is itself about the environment and art that is self-consciously environmental, and I think that’s entirely understandable and good, because it draws attention to these dire situations we’re facing,” said Karl Kusserow, curator of American Art at the Princeton University Art Museum.\nKusserow is a co-curator of Nature’s Nation: American Art and Environment, which includes paintings, artefacts, sculpture, prints, photographs and decorative art. It started at the Princeton University Art Museum and is now showing at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem until May 5. It will end at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, from May 25 to Sep 9.\n“The impetus grew out of my concern for climate change, and my recognition and realisation that I could bridge my concerns as a citizen with my work as a scholar,” said Kusserow, who spent seven years developing the show with Alan Braddock, associate professor of Art History and American Studies at the College of William & Mary.\nThe goal of the exhibition, he said, is to view famous and lesser-known art through ecological glasses: how the environment is represented in images and how humans’ place in the world is depicted.\n“It asks people to think in new ways about iconic works,” Kusserow said. For example, the famous 19th-century painting by Albert Bierstadt, Bridal Veil Falls, Yosemite – a lush painting of one of the national park’s waterfalls – is hung alongside a work by artist Valerie Hegarty from 2007, Fallen Bierstadt, which shows the same painting askew, burned and ripped.\n“There’s a crescendo of interest in both art that is itself about the environment and art that is self-consciously environmental, and I think that’s entirely understandable and good, because it draws attention to these dire situations we’re facing.” – Karl Kusserow, Princeton University Art Museum curator\n“Bierstadt presents a certain way of understanding nature as beautiful and unpeopled and full of animals and grain and enduring and static, and Hegarty takes that same image and literally dematerialises it,” he said.\nAnother painting – Prisoners From the Front, by Winslow Homer – is an image traditionally interpreted as a confrontation between a Union officer and Confederate soldiers. But the surrounding landscape looks barren, and the show focuses on the environmental effects of the Civil War on the land, which included deforestation and the burning of crops. It was a strategy of the North and South and “it really had dire environmental consequences,” Kusserow said.\nThe New-York Historical Society’s major spring show, Hudson Rising (through Aug 4), intertwines famed works of art, as well as aquariums, political leaflets, music and videos.\nThe show offers one of the most comprehensive exhibits ever on the Hudson River, with the goal of not simply looking at ecological changes, but understanding how the river “became an incubator for environmental activism,” said Marci Reaven, the museum’s vice president for history exhibitions.\nThe exhibition proceeds chronologically and geographically from the 1800s and the building of the Erie Canal through today. It displays the beauty of the Hudson through the museum’s extensive collection of Hudson River School paintings, as well as photographs and tourist memorabilia, such as posters from the 1930s encouraging people to take a day trip on the river. But it also shows the toll that tourism and industry have taken.\n“All of its uses and passions come into conflict with each other,” Reaven said. “There is a growing awareness the region may not be able to be all things to all people.”\nThe show highlights activism over the years to save the Hudson.\nIn the early 20th century, organisations such as women’s clubs and preservationist societies protested the rock blasting of the Palisades cliffs overlooking the river from New Jersey and helped create Palisades Amusement Park, which became one of the most visited in the country.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s activists fought, and ultimately defeated, a plan by Con Edison to build a plant on Storm King Mountain on the river’s west bank in New York. Visitors to the exhibition can see a yellow political button with the slogan, “Dig they won’t ... Save the Hudson,” and hear folk singer Pete Seeger’s song My Dirty Stream, a mournful ode to the polluted river.\nThe end of the exhibition will be a look toward the future and how to reclaim the Hudson River in response to climate change, showcasing projects already underway, such as reef-like structures, known as “living breakwaters,” that can decrease the impact of waves, and help restore the shoreline.\n“The idea is to look at what has been resolved and what are the new challenges,” Reaven said. “What is the river teaching us, how will climate change unfold in the region and how are people preparing?”\nThe University of Colorado Art Museum, using resources at its doorsteps, is showing Documenting Change: Our Climate (Past, Present and Future), until July 20. It encompasses 70 works of art by 30 artists.\nIt includes pieces by Tali Weinberg, who incorporates climate change data and drought data into the textiles she weaves, and a four-hour video by Peggy Weil, 88 Cores, which connects images from 88 ice cores from the nearby National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility.\nThe Climate Museum in New York City will hold an exhibition at its temporary home on Governors Island from May 4 through Oct 31. The museum last year installed 10 solar powered traffic signs that looked like digital highway messages, but issued warnings such as “Climate Change at Work.”\nFrom Mar 16 through Jun 14, the museum, in partnership with the New York City Department of Education Office of Sustainability, will present Climate Speaks, a training program and competition focused on spoken word and poetry related to climate change and social justice. The finalists will appear at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Jun 14.\n“We’ve got a tremendous desire on the part of scientists to engage with different audiences and a desire on the part of humanists and artists to grapple with the immensity of the problems we’re facing right now.” – Erin Espelie, the University of Colorado co-director\nAlthough very different, the exhibitions have one thing in common: using a mixture of chronology, geography, materials, ideas and collaborators to express something that can at times seem indescribable.\n“We’ve got a tremendous desire on the part of scientists to engage with different audiences and a desire on the part of humanists and artists to grapple with the immensity of the problems we’re facing right now,” said Erin Espelie, co-director of the Nature, Environment, Science & Technology Studio for the Arts at the University of Colorado.\nOne way to do that, she added, is through the art museum “bringing people together outside political affiliation and into a different environment that allows for more empathy.”\nBy Alina Tugend © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     sustainability ']}"

      What happens when a watchmaker teams up with a comic book illustrator
  </h1>, 'text': 'Perhaps no other watchmaker has quite as much fun as Ulysse Nardin. When they’re not pushing the boundaries of chronometry and silicon use, they’re building watches with no crown, hands or dial and calling them Freaks, or directing their mastery of repeater technology to crafting jacquemarts getting freaky in the biblical sense.\nThe Le Locle-based brand is quite adept at the latter; for years Ulysse Nardin has been making erotic watches that are mechanical and artistic masterpieces, featuring sculpted figures in precious metals moving in time to a loud and clear striking mechanism set against highly detailed engravings. This year’s sensual novelty continues the tradition, but this time with the help of notable comic book illustrator Milo Manara.\n\n\nManara’s 50-year career includes artwork for Italian filmmakers Federico Fellini and Alejandro Jodorowsky, writer Neil Gaiman and covers for Marvel comics, and he’s built his reputation on his erotic yet elegant style. This style has been manifested in the Ulysse Nardin Classico Manara watches, a limited-edition series of 10 different dial designs that together tell a story of a woman named Nadia and her steamy love affair with the mermaid Ulyssa. A voyeuristic shark is also involved. “The clock lends itself particularly precisely to this theme because in eroticism there is eternity,” said Manaro in a press statement.\nThe fantastical tale unfolds sequentially through the dials but Manara has ensured that each design, realised in stunning watercolour detail, can stand alone. Ulysse Nardin then enlisted the help of some of the best miniature painters in the industry to reproduce Manara’s design onto watch dials. Given how the dials are about 10 times smaller than Manara’s original drawings, each one took approximately 50 hours to complete, and required the use of single-hair\xa0brushes as thick as an eyelash.\nSince the art takes centrestage, only hours and minutes are offered, via luminous leaf-shaped hands. It is powered by the in-house automatic UN-320 movement, which is equipped with a silicon hairspring and the brand’s signature anchor escapement, and comes with a standard 48-hour power reserve. The collection consists of 10 pieces per drawing, in stainless steel or 18K\xa0rose gold, making a total of 200 pieces.\nAs far as artistic watches go the Classico Manara collection is certainly stunning, and the fact that they’re all hand-painted means no watch will be identical. But it could be disappointing for long-time fans who valued the technical prowess of Ulysse Nardin’s previous erotic watches. Miniature painting in watchmaking isn’t quite as rare as little figures whose amorous activities could be brought to life on demand.\nBut these changes are in line with CEO Patrick Pruniaux’s plan to have the brand channel a more youthful energy. With a new (if slightly cheesy) tagline of “We Xplore, We Xcite. We Xist. We are Ulysse.”, the introduction of the entry-level Freak X watch this year and now a collaboration with a comic book legend, Ulysse Nardin is clearly trying to make its luxury watches more accessible to a new generation. But as long as the team keeps the fun alive with radical, brow-raising innovations, that’s just fine and dandy with us geezers.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     art ']}"

      Inside the home of a Singapore-based designer who likes it 'a little disturbing'
  </h1>, 'text': 'French designer Isabelle Miaja loves transforming spaces in her constant pursuit of evolution. The founder of Miaja Design, a Singapore-based interior design firm, works tireless to provide interior consultancy for hotels and resorts across Asia and the South Pacific. She has been doing so for more than 20 years.\nKnown for her interplay with unique art forms in her design style, Miaja enjoys collecting art and artefacts, which she picks up on her frequent travels. “Each time I travel to a country, I make it a point to go and visit galleries, craftsmen or artisans. I’m always curious,” she said.\nHer home is a reflection of this. In her living room alone, artworks and curios from over 25 countries are displayed and thoughtfully curated. Her appreciation for art is natural and runs in the blood: She hails from a family of artists. Her granduncle was a poet and her father, a celebrated jewellery designer.\n\n\nMiaja is particularly drawn to art that makes her smile, as well as to sculptures. “Sculptures are what I go for first. The fact of being able to go around an object that is three-dimensional is something that is quite appealing to me. I love the shadows it creates. A sculpture can add a lot of intrigue to a room, and tell a story, which is also very powerful,” she explained.\nKissa Castaneda, Editor-in-Chief of Singapore Tatler, said of Miaja’s style: “Usually if you enter a collector’s home, it can feel like a gallery, but what I really liked about Isabelle’s house is how you enter and you immediately feel at home. It has a really good lived-in quality. She has a sense of adventure in her choices. So things that normally won’t go together, she’s able to weave them together seamlessly.”\n\n\nThere’s no magic formula when it comes to interior styling. In fact, Miaja suggests moving things around to give them a new life, a new “pizzazz”. In the 14 years she has lived in her home, she has changed the look thrice – simply by rearranging the furniture and artworks, juxtaposing them in different contexts.\nBesides her design firm, Miaja also runs two art galleries, Miaja Gallery and Miaja Art Collections. And the art that she acquires for her home and business are intrinsically linked. For example, work from artists she admires is exhibited in her galleries. Currently, Miaja Art Collections is showing the work of famed nature photographer David Yarrow.\n\n\n“I’ve always been a collector of art. It’s just that it has spilled out of the house, basically. I remember discovering this and that, and then after that introducing it to my business or in my business to my clients,” she said.\nBut for Miaja, home is ultimately where the heart is. “My home is pretty much me, who I am.”\nAdapted from the series Remarkable Living.

      Art Basel’s Asian art gets to Hong Kong – via galleries in New York and Los Angeles
  </h1>, 'text': 'There you are in Hong Kong, making your way through the convention centre and this newest iteration of Art Basel. Ah! There’s a group of bamboo and rattan sculptures by Sopheap Pich, the Cambodian artist, inspired by trees in his homeland. And there, at the same booth, a new map – she’d call it a cartographic work – by Tiffany Chung, the Vietnamese artist. Maybe it’s a new addition to The Vietnam Exodus Project, whose images Holland Cotter described in The New York Times as “personal, political and ineradicable.”\nThe gallery name may be a surprise. These works didn’t come from an exhibition across the harbour in Kowloon or from Tokyo, Jakarta or Saigon. Pich and Chung (who now lives in Houston) are represented by Tyler Rollins Fine Art in New York, a gallery in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan, half a block or so from the West Side Highway.\nIt’s no longer unheard-of for artists from one end of the Earth to be represented by dealers from the opposite end.\n“Huge kudos to Tyler for doing this,” Adeline Ooi, Asia director of Art Basel, said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. “His sole commitment to Southeast Asia and Asia Pacific is unparalleled.”\nThe Rollins gallery, which specialises in mid-career artists, will also be exhibiting the work of Pinaree Sanpitak and Agus Suwage at Art Basel Hong Kong.\nPinaree, born in Thailand, often uses images of the female body – especially breasts – and domesticity as themes in her paintings, drawings, sculpture and installations. She also likes candle wax as a medium. Jason Farago of The New York Times has compared her work to that of Louise Bourgeois.\nSuwage, an Indonesian of Chinese and Javanese heritage who often uses watercolour, ink and tobacco juice in his work, has also been praised by The Times. Cotter called his work remarkable and summed him up as “a born satirist, which means a born moralist.”\nRollins, the gallery’s American namesake, said in an email that he had “noticed a huge change in the market” since the gallery opened in 2008. Collectors now seem to have a broader interest in Asia “beyond the most familiar countries,” he said.\nRollins is not the only New York gallery with a thriving and highly focused Asian art program. At Fergus McCaffrey, a few blocks north in Chelsea, one specialty is the Gutai group, the avant-garde Japanese artists who gleefully challenged artistic tradition after World War II.\nAt Art Basel Hong Kong, McCaffrey is showing the intense dark colours and bold strokes of several Gutai artists, including Kazuo Shiraga (who has a solo show at McCaffrey’s new Tokyo gallery at the same time), Sadamasa Motonaga and Toshio Yoshida.\nAmericans may have been slow, McCaffrey said, compared with their European counterparts, to appreciate Japanese postwar art, but that has changed since the gallery opened in 2006.\n“Collectors quickly came to realise that something special happened in Japanese art and culture after the horror of the war,” said McCaffrey, who was born in Dublin and studied at Kyoto University in the early 90s. They also realised that its best artists were “equal to the leading innovators in the Western canon.”\nOne sign: When Epic Abstraction opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art late last year, curators put a Shiraga (“an extraordinary untitled 1958 painting,” The Times said) right in the middle of the Jackson Pollocks. McCaffrey called that decision “an indication of how things have changed.”\nWhen 47 Canal, the downtown New York gallery founded by Margaret Lee, a Korean-American artist born in the Bronx, notes that many of its Asian artists are immigrants or Asian-Americans, Ooi adds: The diaspora counts.\n“There are so many ties that bind,” Ooi said. Many people today, she pointed out, have “hybrid identities,” defining that as “when you’re half-this, half-that and growing up somewhere else.”\nShe cheerfully describes herself as Malaysian-born, Malaysian-Chinese by heritage (with grandparents from mainland China), “living in Hong Kong, running an event for a Swiss company.”\nAt Art Basel Hong Kong, 47 Canal is showing works by Cici Wu, Anicka Yi and Trevor Shimizu – as well as by Josh Kline, Elle Perez and others.\n“I feel like the fluidity within the sense of the Hong Kong show is really beautiful, and it works,” Ooi said.\nThat fluidity is particularly apparent at Commonwealth and Council, a gallery in Los Angeles’ Koreatown neighbourhood, with Korean-American owners and an artist roster that is about 25 per cent Asian-American. The work they’re bringing to Art Basel Hong Kong this year is by Clarissa Tossin, an eco-conscious multimedia artist born in Brazil.\n“We do give thought to regional tastes in deciding on which artists to bring,” said Kibum Kim, a partner, but “we feel that generally Asian collectors are eager to learn more and increasingly interested in expanding their collections to include more international emerging artists.”\nThe terribly British, practically parliamentary gallery name? It’s from the early days, when Kim’s partner Young Chung founded the business in his apartment living room – at the corner of Commonwealth Avenue and Council Street.\nBy Anita Gates © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Hong Kong ', '     China ', '     Asia ']}"

      Southeast Asian art galleries set their sights on Art Basel Hong Kong this weekend
  </h1>, 'text': 'Next to a row of luxury hotels in a bustling business district in Bangkok, the art gallery Nova Contemporary occupies a former storage area at the base of a high-rise apartment building.\n“There’s no gallery area per se in Bangkok, so this is fairly normal,” said Nova’s cheery owner, Sutima Sucharitakul, of the location of her sleek space. “Everything is fairly spread out.”\nOn view at Nova through Sunday is a conceptual exhibition called The Uncertain, featuring works by Thai artist Jedsada Tangtrakulwong.\nBy design, the show changes depending on the weather: On sunny days, some of the works are not available to be seen, remaining hidden in various ways, and the response to that offbeat approach has been mixed. Some visitors have been angered and have shared their feelings emphatically with Sucharitakul and her staff.\n“This is pretty advanced for Bangkok,” she said with a shrug.\nHer hunt for an appreciative new audience for her artists is precisely why she will show her wares for the first time at Art Basel Hong Kong, alongside about 240 other dealers, from Friday through Sunday at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.\nNova reflects the stronger Southeast Asian presence at the fair, now in its seventh edition, demonstrating the event’s status as a market hub in a vast and diverse region.\nThere is no shortage of collectors with money or artists with ideas; they simply need a place to find each other.\n“The presence of the Southeast Asian dealers is quite remarkable this year, and quite varied,” said Adeline Ooi, the Asia director for Art Basel.\n“It’s wonderful — but I’m biased since I’m from Malaysia,” she said, laughing.\n“The presence of the Southeast Asian dealers is quite remarkable this year, and quite varied.” –\xa0Adeline Ooi\nTHE ASIAN PUZZLE\nIn addition to galleries from mainland China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan — already known as market forces — the fair this year includes Richard Koh Fine Art, with spaces in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore; Artinformal and Silverlens, both from Manila; and Nadi Gallery and ROH Projects from Jakarta, Indonesia.\n“People think the Asian market equals the Chinese market, and that’s not true,” Ooi said. “Asia is a puzzle. But every year at the fair, we peel back a new layer and it gets deeper.”\nPart of the issue is vast geography. The fair features six galleries that have exhibition spaces in India, which is more than 3,200 km from Hong Kong.\n“Asia is so massive,” Ooi said. “People think we know each other, and we don’t. We’re all still learning about each other.”\nShe added, “It’s one of the things that makes me hopeful — the show can be a platform for movements that don’t always catch the attention of the art world.”\nMarc Spiegler, the global director of Art Basel, said he was in awe of the “unparalleled diversity” on hand.\n“It’s been a voyage of discovery to do a fair in Asia and dig into the real complexity,” Spiegler said. “You have countries that are Buddhist or Christian or secular, colonisers and the colonised, and dozens of languages.”\nBy contrast, Europe — where Art Basel started and where it stages a fair in Basel, Switzerland, in June — “is so small that cultures bleed together,” he added. (There’s also a Miami Beach fair in December.)\nLike Ooi, Spiegler said he thought the contingents from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries were significant.\n“The Southeast Asian element is often underestimated by the market in terms of the collectors, galleries and the artists,” he said.\nThat was certainly the opinion of Jun Tirtadji when he founded ROH Projects in Jakarta six years ago. “We felt there was a need in Indonesia,” Tirtadji said. “There’s so much talent here.”\nROH has been participating in Art Basel Hong Kong for five years, and the fair has helped shape the business beyond just the few days of the event.\n“We have learned so much from Adeline and Marc,” Tirtadji said. “I attribute a lot of our success to them. They took it upon themselves to provide a guiding framework for how a gallery should be run.”\nROH specialises in emerging Asian contemporary talents, and this year it features eight artists including Arin Dwihartanto Sunaryo, an abstract painter based in Bandung, Indonesia, who works with pigmented resin and ash, forming paintings with his hands instead of a brush.\nTirtadji said that the scene in Jakarta, in all its contradictions, had to be viewed through a different lens from that of New York or Hong Kong.\n“The art world in Indonesia is quite cosmopolitan,” he said. “But many of our collectors are buying their first piece of art with us.”\nIsa Lorenzo, the founder of Silverlens, has been showing at the fair since it was called Art HK, before it was bought by Art Basel’s parent company.\n“There’s definitely a north-south division,” he said of the Asian market. “The north is much bigger economically, but fewer items are bought and sold. In the south, it’s more chaotic, but a lot more is bought and sold, at lower price points.”\nAt Silverlens, Lorenzo changes exhibitions regularly, “and every opening is packed,” he said. “It’s a vibrant arts scene and very community-oriented in the Philippines. We have zero government funding for the arts. We have to all hold hands and make it happen ourselves.”\n“It’s been a voyage of discovery to do a fair in Asia and dig into the real complexity. “You have countries that are Buddhist or Christian or secular, colonisers and the colonised, and dozens of languages.” – Marc Spiegler\nWESTERN PRESENCE\nHong Kong’s reputation has also been attracting Western galleries.\nOoi said organisers were excited about the “heavyweights” taking part for the first time this year, including New York dealers Paula Cooper and Matthew Marks.\nDealer Almine Rech, who has galleries in Paris, London, Brussels and New York — and will soon open one in Shanghai — has had a booth at Art Basel Hong Kong since the first edition.\n“For us, the Asian market is ever more important — especially in the last two or three years,” Rech said.\nAs a dealer accustomed to far-flung transactions, Rech said that the Asian market was still “a very different world.”\n“Collectors often want to have an adviser on hand, and they want to have a dialogue about an artwork right in front of a piece,” she said. “They take time, they have a long discussion and then they make a decision.”\nBy contrast, Rech said, “Americans feel they know a lot already.”\nHer selection at the fair will include works by Picasso, Peter Halley and Tom Wesselmann.\nFor her part, Sucharitakul’s Nova Contemporary booth will show sculptures and videos by artist Moe Satt, who lives and works in Myanmar, in the fair’s Discoveries sector.\nThe centrepiece of the booth is “Dove With Revolution Hand,” a sculpture by Satt that addresses the 1988 civil uprising in Myanmar.\nAs Sucharitakul has learned, the reaction of collectors to a given work is anyone’s guess. But shortly before the fair, she was hopeful not only for sales, but also for the biggest Thai collectors back home to know that she was a part of Art Basel Hong Kong.\n“It will get me a lot of respect,” she said. “People know what this fair is, and that it means something.”\n“Collectors often want to have an adviser on hand, and they want to have a dialogue about an artwork right in front of a piece. They take time, they have a long discussion and then they make a decision.” – Almine Rech\nBy Ted Loos © 2019 The New York Times\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Hong Kong ', '     China ', '     Southeast Asia ', '     Asia ']}"

      A serving of luxury Thai condo or immersive theatre to go with your main course
  </h1>, 'text': 'I looked about apprehensively at the strange faces around me. It was Valentine’s Day at the Telok Ayer Arts Club, where the final installation of 11, an experiential performance piece by Dawn Ng, was about to take place. I was one of 22 participants that would be paired up to read out 11 different scripts while moving through 11 confessional booths, musical chair-style.\nI had previously lunched at the space when it first opened last August and thought of it as another CBD diner, only differentiated by arts-related events. That night, the familiar feeling was turned on its head. The dining area had been transformed to accommodate the circular arrangement of the confessional booths, leaving only a holding area of several seats near the bar where everyone was milling about pre-event.\nEven before taking on 11 different personas, I was already freaking out in my own introverted one.\nMy fears turned out unfounded. By the second script, my booth partner and I were giggling so much that we could barely finish our lines. By the end of the experience, everyone was discussing the experience with newfound friends over drinks and bar snacks.\nA curious camaraderie had somehow sprouted out of the 90 minutes of us fleshing out fictional lives, and new perspectives were being bandied about between the comforting clink of glasses and bites of chilli crab mantou, spam chips and chicken wings with homemade smoked honey garlic sauce.\nAt the newly opened Siri House at Dempsey, a myriad retail temptations – a swanky condo sales gallery and quirky lifestyle accessories from street cred t-shirts to sculptural home decor items – already assault your senses before you lay eyes on the delicious modern Asian plates and bespoke cocktails at JAM.\nJAM is run by Park Bench Deli co-owner, Ming Tan, Jeremy Cheok (previously of New Ubin Seafood Garang Grill), and Sunday Punch’s Mark Tay and Yap Hwee Jen. Need more food for thought? Pop into the art gallery, which currently houses Thai artist Gongkan’s exhibition Another Dimension.\nMulti-concept venues incorporating lifestyle, arts and food such as Siri House and Telok Ayer Arts Club have been opening in succession in Singapore for the last five years, reflecting a global retail-dining trend that seeks to attract a more discerning crowd.\nSiri House is Thai luxury property developer Sansiri’s maiden foray into the multi-concept lifestyle space in Singapore. Its second outlet will open this month on home ground in Bangkok.\nIts chief global branding officer Mai Timblick says that Siri House represents the brand’s philosophy to go beyond constructing buildings to shape and contribute to a lifestyle that bring together design, the arts, Thai culture and hospitality. Prior to its opening in Singapore, the brand had already been infusing lifestyle events such as a flea market festival and an exhibition showcase on Spanish contemporary artist Miquel Barcelo in its residential projects.\nTimblick said, “Siri House represents this Sansiri manner of living, where good food, communities and culture all come together in one space. Food is always the best way to reach people.”\nPrior to TAAC, The Supermarket Company had opened multi-use restaurant space SPRMRKT with locations at STPI at Robertson Quay and Cluny Court.\n“When SPRMRKT was first introduced in 2012, it was the group’s first cultural-culinary concept and it made the arts less intimidating and more accessible by combining it with food and retail in a single, multifaceted experience,” explained TAAC’s arts manager Anmari Van Nieuwenhove.\n“When SPRMRKT moved out of the McCallum Street premises into Cluny Court, and coupled with an observed growing appetite for more after-work options in the CBD, Telok Ayer Arts Club is our response to create a space that re-envisions the idea of the Singaporean community centre while meeting the desire for culture and nightlife not just for the CBD, but the F&B industry as a whole.”\nUnlisted Collection restaurateur and hotelier Loh Lik Peng believes that this multi-concept trend will persist and get even better, and cites the example of Cafe Kitsune, the coffee-design-fashion space by Parisian music and fashion label Maison Kitsune located in Seoul, Tokyo and Paris, as an attractive concept that draws sophisticated shoppers.\nHe added, “The retail scene is changing so rapidly that it’s now all about multi-modal offerings. Retail is not compelling enough on its own. Food and drink, if done well, is convivial and social, and is a good way to draw a different crowd to your venue.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     food ', '     gastronomy ', '     art ', '     Luxury Destinations ']}"

      Christie's George Michael collection includes Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin
  </h1>, 'text': ""George Michael’s collection of 61 works will be the subject of a live auction at Christie’s London this evening (3am on Mar 15, Singapore time). Another 112 works, smaller in size, are in an online auction that ends on Mar 15. The most affordable lot is expected to fetch between £100 and £200 (S$178 and S$356), while the top lot could rake in as much as £1.5 million (S$2.67 million).\nSince premiering as an exhibition in New York in early February, The George Michael Collection has visited Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Shanghai, before returning to London earlier this week in preparation for the auction.\nSpeaking to The New York Times, Michael’s former partner Kenny Goss revealed what drove his passion for art. “George and I discovered our love of art when we got together,” he said of their meeting in 1996. “The art we collected was based on our interest and our friends in the YBA movement. We bought what we liked from artists we knew and respected.”\nThose artists include the most influential names of their time, such as Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Chris Ofili and Gary Hume. The YBAs began exhibiting in the late 1980s, and were famous for their shock tactics. Think Hirst's\xa0The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living – a tiger shark preserved in\xa0formaldehyde – and Emin’s\xa0My Bed, a slept-in bed surrounded by rubbish.\nMichael’s assembling of the bold works of the YBA outline a rebellious attitude that he sought to characterise throughout his musical career.\n“He found… something familiar with the Young British Artists, and that was rebellion,”\xa0Cristian Albu, Christie's\xa0Co-Head of Post-War and Contemporary Art, told Yahoo Entertainment. “All the parties were rebels at heart and a rebel in imagination, and so was George Michael when he was writing his lyrics, when he was choreographing his videos and when he was doing his concerts.”\nMichael rose to fame as one half of the British pop duo Wham!, and died at home on Christmas Day 2016, aged 53.\xa0\nGEORGE LOVES KENNY – TRACEY EMIN (LOT 47), 2007\nThis unique work by Tracey Emin in soft pink and pale blue neon was first exhibited in Dallas in 2007 by The Goss-Michael Foundation in\xa0A Tribute to Tracey Emin. Estimates place its final bid between £40,000 (S$71,280) and £60,000 (S$106,920).\nTHE INCOMPLETE TRUTH – DAMIEN HIRST (LOT 5), 2006 \nFirst exhibited in 2007, the formaldehyde-preserved dove encapsulates the crux of Hirst’s Natural History works: “That failure of trying so hard to do something that you destroy the thing that you’re trying to preserve,” wrote Hirst in 2005.\nThe work is akin to the artist’s most famous formaldehyde work, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living. It’s estimated to fetch between £1 million (S$1.78 million) and £1.5 million (S$2.67 million) at the evening auction.\nCOMMISSIONED PORTRAIT UNTITLED (GEORGE) – MICHAEL CRAIG-MARTIN (LOT 105), 2007\nA portrait of the singer on an LCD monitor that changes colour, this commissioned work has already broken the upper limit of the £60,000 (S$106,920) bid with a current online bid of £85,000 (S$151,472).\nSpeaking to The New York Times, Michael Craig-Martin recalled his initial excitement when Michael first reached out to him. “I don’t know how Kenny and Michael became aware of my portraits, but they were immediately excited. George did not have time to sit, but he came to the studio at one point and I was quite taken by him. He wasn’t starry at all, just a wonderful person.”\n“He was a real collector of the YBAs: Damien [Hirst] and Sarah Lucas and Tracey Emin. There was a real spirit among that generation, and I think he and Kenny both really liked that: The excitement of it, the ambition of it.”\nYET TO BE TITLED – CECILY BROWN (LOT 12), 2008\nThe work by British painter Cecily Brown is very much in the same vein as her larger body of works: The use of large canvases and an Abstract Expressionist gestural style seen most commonly from more than half a century ago. The New York-based artist once remarked: “People say to me, you paint like a man from the 1950s; and I say, someone’s got to do it.”\nThe piece is estimated to fetch £350,000 (S$623,710) to £550,000 (S$980,110) at the evening auction.\nCARELESS WHISPER – JIM LAMBIE (LOT 10), 2009\nStrongly influenced by pop culture, the work by Glasgow artist Jim Lambie is characterised by colourful\xa0sculptural installations made from everyday modern materials, including\xa0pop culture\xa0objects such as posters and\xa0album covers, and household accessories.\nNamed after Michael’s 1984 hit of the same name, Careless Whisper sees painted flowers on a black and white George Michael poster and is expected to fetch between £12,000 (S$21,393) and £18,000 (S$32,090).\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     auction ']}"

      Kampong spirit and kaypoh intentions: 10 years of letting strangers into our homes
  </h1>, 'text': ""Back in 2009, artist-curator Alan Oei had a crazy idea: What if you could convince\xa0a bunch of people to open up their homes for random strangers to come on in and see some art?\nAs it turns\xa0out, it isn't such a crazy idea after all.\nA decade later and the art walkabout OH! Open House has become a fixture on the arts calendar, bringing 20,000 people into 61 homes in various neighbourhoods in Singapore – from Marine Parade and Tiong Bahru to Potong Pasir and Joo Chiat.\nThese days, the tour format has also become so popular that it’s not surprising for any festival or big event to employ a similar format.\n“We had a simple agenda of taking art out of the gallery and putting it into everyday spaces where it will have a different kind of life,” said the OH! co-founder.\nFROM A FACTORY TO SHOPHOUSES\nOei had already experimented with showing art in unusual spaces with Blackout, an exhibition that was held in a factory in Tai Seng. But coaxing people to open their homes was another matter altogether.\nFor the first OH! edition, held at the shophouses along Niven Road, homeowners needed quite a lot of convincing. “We went knocking on neighbours’ doors and while the foreigners were open to doing it, the Singaporeans were very antsy,” he said.\nAnd even those who attended that first event were sceptical about the project. “I remember people saying... 'Now you’ve shown us rich people can own art',” quipped Oei, who is currently also the outgoing artistic director of The Substation.\nTo prove naysayers wrong, Oei and his collaborators next set their sights on the HDB flats of Marine Parade two years later, where things slowly picked up.\n“I remember the queues were ridiculous and that gave us the confidence that we’ve hit something we can go forward with.”\nTHE PEOPLE IN YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD\nAnd it wasn’t just about showing art anymore – the neighbourhoods they chose became just as significant.\nIn 2012, OH! went to Tiong Bahru at the peak of its gentrification conversation while the following year, it went on a detour to Marina Bay just after the global financial crisis.\xa0\nWhen they decided on Potong Pasir in 2016, it was just transitioning from being an opposition ward. Last year, they decided Emerald Hill was the perfect place for a tour to kickstart discussions about the Singapore Bicentennial.\nBeyond the themes and issues, however, it is simply a way of rediscovering Singapore’s neighbourhoods.\n“We have this assumption that Singapore is boring and it’s all the same but each [neighbourhood] has its own stories and the people are different,” said OH! assistant director Lim Su Pei.\n“In Potong Pasir, you felt the kampong spirit, the people were friendly and some would even invite us to regular gatherings or have karaoke in the void decks;\xa0while the Holland Village people were very private.”\nOH! community manager Aletheia Tan recalled being invited into countless tea sessions while preparing for the Emerald Hill edition, while Joo Chiat proved to be the most surprising neighbourhood she’s worked at, with affluent residents living side by side with migrant workers.\n“There were so many types of communities – the migrant workers in particular were so sweet and welcoming and they’d help me out when they saw me working late at night,” she said.\n'ART' GETS THE DOOR\xa0SLAMMED IN YOUR FACE\nDespite the success of the tours, what hasn’t changed is the fact that it’s still pretty hard convincing homeowners to get on board.\n“The moment they hear ‘art’, they slam the door on you,” quipped Lim, who said it’s not unsual to go door-to-door, walking up and down entire blocks, only to get rejected by everyone. “Out of, say, 600 households, you’ll get maybe one [to agree].”\nBut at the end of the day, getting that one person is worth it. “These days, everyone’s staying behind their closed doors, watching Netflix, especially in HDB flats. But there are still people who are house- and neighbourhood-proud who are willing to share their stories,” said Lim.\nWhile preparing for Potong Pasir, Tan recalled how one participating artist, Hafiz Osman, distributed flyers telling people he wanted to paint their walls for free.\n“And a lot of them were super suspicious of him! But the ones who said yes were those who hadn’t upgraded their homes for 30 years, and he had an amazing opportunity to talk to these people and see their homes that hadn’t changed much in 30 years,” she said.\nTHE OCCASIONAL PROPERTY AGENT\nAnd what of OH! guests – do they really go to these tours to look at art? Or are they simply kaypoh about other people’s houses?\n“I think it’s both,” said Oei. “By and large, majority go for the art and also learn about the stories in the neighbourhoods – there’s a hunger among Singaporeans to connect to these stories.”\nThat said, there are some attendees who really just want to see the houses. “During the Emerald Hill walk, there will be people who’ll come to us specifically asking which tour goes to the houses,” said Lim.\n“And for Potong Pasir, there was actually a property agent who came because she was more interested in the houses – she wanted to go into bedrooms and wanted to open cabinets. Our guide really gave it to her!” she shared, but added that the majority of visitors are usually very polite.\n“They self-police and sort of have like a ‘class monitor’ who’ll say you’re not supposed to do this or that.”\nAnd given the foot traffic and logistical nightmare of people moving around a home, it’s perhaps a surprise that only one mishap has taken place. Way\xa0back during the Marine Parade edition, a guest broke a vase.\n“But it was meant to be. The vase was from the homeowner’s ex-boyfriend,” quipped Lim.\nBEYOND NEIGHBOURHOODS\nAfter arguably popularising this kind of tour format, OH! is slowly changing its strategy\xa0– last year’s Emerald Hill edition was the last “neighbourhood” tour.\nBeginning next year, OH! tours won’t be revolving around places but starting a new trilogy of tours that looks at the themes of “wood, earth and water”. For 2020, said Oei, it will be “wood” and audiences can go explore a timber\xa0factory and there are plans to work with carpenters and furniture makers.\nMeanwhile, this year’s OH! events have become more intimate. For a new ongoing series called Singapore Calendar, a select group of participants gets to interact and follow an artist as he or she creates a work, which culminates in a final exhibition.\nThis month, there’s also an event called Passport, where artists actually collaborate closely with a homeowner to create something for audiences to see. And it’s not just in one neighbourhood – these pop-up experiences are spread around places such as Telok Blangah, Marsiling and Tanjong Pagar.\nSaid Oei: “Our Singaporean houseowners are much more adventurous than we give them credit for. They might be performing, leading tours or taking questions – we wanted them to be involved in a much bigger way.”\nFor more details about OH!

The aim is to spark conversations around sustainability.\n""The idea of combining things together – in this case art and tech – has been something that motivates my work.""\nThis second edition follows\xa0last year’s inaugural event, and showcases the works of Singapore artists who participated in the Foundation’s artist incubation programme, Please Insert Human, which works in conjunction with the Foundation’s media studio arm, MeshMinds.\nWee’s A Better Tomorrow series of digital drawings for Meshminds 2.0 is an augmented reality (AR) experience celebrating SG75 – and the sustainable future Singapore can behold with positive individual and collective action.\nVisitors can use their smartphone cameras to scan QR codes and watch an animation of how the landscapes come to life with the adoption of greener practices through their mobile devices.\nIn another interactive exhibit, Wee uses the artificial intelligence (AI) engine Animaker to create Animaker Asia, a large-scale projection of an Asian jungle where visitors can use Duplo bricks to build endangered animal species found in Southeast Asia, such as the pangolin and orangutan.\nThe creations are then brought to life by AI-powered robots incorporating 3D scanning technology and an AI-powered search engine that understands 3D content.\nThis project is a partnership between The MeshMinds Foundation and The Tech Museum of Innovation in Silicon Valley, with support from the National Arts Council. Wee and Austria-based artist collective OMAi have been working together remotely to create a series of illustrations of Southeast Asia’s endangered animals to raise awareness of the need to protect them.\n“I grew up surrounded by technologies that were always getting more advanced, and was exposed to the world of video games and world building,” said Wee, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in fine arts from the Rhode Island School of Design.\n“Without thinking of it as an art form where art and technology were actually coming together, I was making small and silly video game worlds and environments at a young age.”\nCELEBRATING FLUCTUATING IDENTITY AND \'IN-BETWEENESS\'\nArt and technology have always been part of Wee\'s life. His father was a computer engineer who enjoyed making dioramas, and his mother\xa0a piano teacher who loved to paint.\n""I try to keep working on my personal [projects] which don’t always have any other purpose save for enjoyment and curiosity.""\nThe self-described ""introverted and quiet kid” started dabbling in digital art when he enrolled as an Art Elective Programme student at Nanyang Junior College. He got his first break in 2012 as a freshman when he posted his first hybrid 2D and 3D tech-art piece, Forming And Fragmenting, online. It was quickly picked up and shared across blogs, Tumblr, and Facebook posts.\n\nWee started to receive commissions and his portfolio, which started with fine art prints, now include website design for marketing agency Goodstuph, a stop-motion social media post for Macallan’s Concept Number 1, and exhibitions at Apple and Mulan Gallery.\nBesides sustainability, themes of belonging and fitting in as he travelled between countries for education and work are alive in Wee’s works.\n\n“I\'ve been very fortunate to meet many people in our globalised world who identify with this \'fluctuating identity\', and who realise that instead of constantly trying to cater to each facet, there is a middle ground that we could create and be ourselves in. A lot of my personal work deals with this ‘in-betweenness’ and the idea of combining things together – in this case art and tech – has been something that motivates my work.”\nIn May, Wee will be participating in a two-week residency at The Tech Museum’s prototyping lab where he will take part in their year-round programme of exhibits, education programmes, and special events that inspire the next generation to use technology to tackle global challenges.\nIn the meantime, he continues to work on personal projects such as merging his MeshMinds 2.0 illustrations into a bigger isometric city.\n“Alongside professional projects, I try to keep working on my personal [projects] which don’t always have any other purpose save for enjoyment and curiosity and sometimes selfish personal achievement.

      Dye dye must try: Singapore’s batik culture gets a fashion and art makeover
  </h1>, 'text': ""Last December, Oniatta Effendi spent three days in Yogyakarta and Solo, barging into people’s homes looking for batik.\nThe Singaporean theatre actress was on one of her regular trips to Indonesia, where she makes it a point to visit villages of batik makers. “I went to three different kampongs and just went\xa0inside someone’s house,” she said, with a\xa0laugh. “They’d show us their wares, and I would buy and bring them back.”\nA hardcore batik enthusiast, Oniatta has a bunch of paintings hanging at home, a stack of books in her library and a collection of more than 40 pieces of fabric. She also creates batik outfits for her three-year-old label Baju By Oniatta.\n“To me, batik has a life – there’s a soul and a heartbeat in it, when you actually go to a kampong and see the precision, craft and why they do it,” said the 44-year-old. “And now, everybody seems to want a piece of it.”\nA CULTURE OF WEARING BATIK\nThe past couple of years has seen a resurgence in interest in batik in Singapore, with\xa0Baju By Oniatta\xa0being just one of a handful of labels championing batik, which include the likes of YeoMama Batik, Pakai and Gypsied.\nThere have also been pop-up events, such as those from The Batik People and Oniatta’s own My Kain Of Batik last year.\nAnd it’s not just in fashion but in the arts as well, with batik-making classes and the occasional exhibition springing up.\nOver at the Malay Heritage Centre is one such show about batik. Of Wax, Dyes And Labour, a show under Singapore Art Week, features works of young artists that put a spotlight on it.\nAmong these is a 5m-long piece of batik with the phrases “Culture Of Batik” and “Wear Batik To Be Asian” written on it.\nElsewhere, there’s a batik dress similar to the iconic Singapore Girl's sarong kebaya; and ceramic versions of the canting, the metallic tool used to create designs on the fabric. There’s even a performance by one of the artists, who will be folding pieces of batik fabrics.\nThe show aims to explore what the identity of batik is in Singapore, said curator and artist Fajrina Razak, 30, who also made the manifesto-like fabric installation.\n“Batik is so close to us. We use it on a daily basis, we wear it for weddings, formal events, at home and even in funerals in the Malay culture. We have a culture of wearing, buying and trading batik – our ancestors did that a lot in the past and it’s still happening now,” she said.\nNO BATIK INDUSTRY IN SINGAPORE\nThe ancient technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to cloth is perhaps one of the region’s iconic trademarks and very popular in Malaysia and Indonesia. It was even designated an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO.\nBut while many in Singapore love to use it, there’s not much in terms of batik production\xa0here.\n“We don’t have a culture of production, no batik industry. While there are artists who run batik studios, it’s solely for art-making;\xa0not for fabrics or mass production,” said Fajrina, who cited the lack of manpower and proper facilities as some of the main reasons.\n“It’s labour intensive, and the labour cost is cheap\xa0in Indonesia and Malaysia. To do batik, you also need a big outdoor space. In Singapore, I don’t think people would want to go through all that trouble.”\nThat means many batik proponents here just turn to neighbouring countries to procure them, like Oniatta, who also pointed out that not all batik are made equal.\xa0While she sources hers straight from batik-making villages, the market is also full of lesser-quality stuff using digital prints.\nAnother hurdle batik lovers have is its reputation of being culturally specific to the Malay community.\n“Batik belongs to everyone – it’s a medium. What we ‘own’ are the motifs that reflect us,” said Fajrina, citing, for example, how the cloud motif called batik megamendung is Chinese-inspired, or how the Dutch were influential in the mass production of batik, using the copper implement called tjap.\nShe added: “Even in India and Japan, you find similar techniques, even if they don’t call it batik.”\nArtist Yang Jie, who is contributing an interactive, umbrella-like batik sculpture to the exhibition, shared how he discovered there was a Yunnan tribe that did something similar as well while researching for the show. “The idea of a single craft restricted to a single type of person is something that’s a bit outdated,” he said.\nBATIK FOR THE FUTURE\nAnd speaking of outdated, one of the challenges that\xa0Singapore’s batik lovers has always faced is to push it into the contemporary space.\nWhile a handful from the older generation of artists use batik – including the late Jaafar Latiff and Sarkasi Said, who had a big show a couple of years back – there aren’t many from the current generation who do so, said Fajrina.\nShe reckons it might seem a bit “old school” for younger artists, who are more excited about\xa0mediums like digital art, to want to explore it. But silk screening or digital printing might actually be a way of reinventing the batik wheel in the art-making world.\nWhen it comes to her fashion designs, new label Pakai’s Ida Supahat prefers to use a minimal touch of batik.\n“Some would think using batik means creating something ‘in your face’ with the traditional brown or batik prints all over, but I would use it in a subtle way,” said the 28-year-old, adding that she would also try to keep in mind other communities and create\xa0cheongsam- or kurti-style designs in her collection.\n“I think it’s not only open to the Malay Muslim or Javanese community.\xa0I’ve a lot of customers who are Chinese or Indian, so I try to design them in a way that\xa0fits any wardrobe.”\nFor Oniatta, it’s all about balancing today’s needs and doing justice to its heritage. “It’s not about reinventing the batik but reinventing the way it is worn,” she said.\n“Batik is completely sensorial;\xa0it’s not fast fashion for me. For many, batik is just a pattern but there’s a massive ecosystem that we are supporting when we buy one – the people who make them have their little stories to tell.”\nOne of those, perhaps, is of a Singaporean woman who went all the way to Indonesia to visit them in their kampong homes.\nOf Wax, Dyes And Labour runs from Jan 19 to Feb 9 at the Malay Heritage Centre.

      From mysterious felines to comic book characters: Watches with artsy dials
  </h1>, 'text': 'Thanks to advanced CNC machines and 3D printers, we live in an age where just about anything can be made, reproduced or replicated. Except, of course, art. For now, at least, machines can’t quite mimic artists’ hands to a degree that inspires awe, even if auction houses are trying to convince us otherwise.\nFor this reason, artistic dials remain very much in demand in watchmaking. The range of skills is vast, and includes everything from “common” techniques like enamelling to\xa0engraving, gem setting, guilloche, and\xa0rare traditions like embroidery, granulation, lacquerwork and marquetry. The results are just as extensive – and often, exquisite.\nWith Singapore Art Week kicking off this weekend, here’s a look at the watch world’s equivalents of blue-chip paintings and auction-house darlings.\nTECHNIQUE: 3D MICRO-PRINTINGWATCH: ARMIN STROM ANIMAL INSTINCT BY ARTGERM\nIf you’re a comic book fan, you might already be familiar with Stanley “Artgerm” Lau’s work. The Hong Kong-born, Singapore-based co-founder of Imaginary Friends Studios has produced artworks for the likes of Capcom, DC and Marvel Comics.\nIn this collaboration with Swiss brand Armin Strom, Artgerm has created an original character called Animal Instinct, who represents courage in the face of adversity.\xa0\nHis artwork comes alive on the dial, thanks to the technique of 3D micro-printing. The steel watch, fitted with a camouflage-patterned rubber strap, is limited to 15 pieces, and is available for pre-order on sincerewatch.com.\nTECHNIQUE: MINIATURE PAINTINGWATCH: BOVET AMADEO FLEURIER 39 “FAN”\nThere is\xa0only a handful of watchmakers who\xa0have mastered the art of miniature painting on dials, and Bovet is one of them. Fans, which are the subjects of this watch series, have been realised in extraordinary detail, thanks to the use of the polished lacquer method.\xa0\nLike an 8K TV, this technique gives the highest definition compared to other methods. A\xa0layer of translucent lacquer is first applied to a mother-of-pearl base. Then, the main design (in this case, a fan) is drawn on using a fine brush.\xa0\nA layer of clear lacquer is applied between each operation to set the colours, and the dial must be fired and polished after each layer is administered. The result is an illusion of depth, almost like a 3D artwork.\nTECHNIQUE: MYSTERYWATCH: CARTIER REVELATION D’UNE PANTHERE\nThis watch might have the word ""revelation""\xa0in its name, but Cartier would not reveal the technique used to achieve the fleeting glimpses of Cartier\'s icon, a panther\'s face. With every flick of the wrist, the beads briefly coalesce\xa0to form the\xa0outline of a feline face.\xa0\nWhat we do know is that 900 gold beads\xa0float freely in a liquid medium sandwiched between two sapphire crystals. And that it took five years to perfect this party trick.\xa0We suspect that micro-magnets are used, though half the fun lies in guessing what makes it tick.\nTECHNIQUE: EMBROIDERYWATCH: CHANEL MADEMOISELLE PRIVE\nIt’s fitting that a fashion powerhouse like Chanel produces watches with embroidered fabric dials. This is done in partnership with Maison Lesage, a studio owned by Chanel\xa0that specialises in the woven arts. Its artisans craft Chanel’s signature tweeds, as well as the embellished, textured confections that come down the couture runways twice a year.\nThese craftsmen are also responsible for weaving pearls, glass beads, diamonds and gold spangles onto the dials\xa0using gold thread. Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel’s favourite flower was the camellia, so the blossom becomes a leitmotif. To highlight the artistry of the dials, the bezels are typically ornamented with diamonds.\nTECHNIQUE: LEATHER MARQUETRYWATCH: HERMES ARCEAU CAVALES\nLeather is to Hermes what tweed is to Chanel. And it wasn’t rocket science for Hermes, of course; its workshops brim with the expert knowledge of leather craftsmen and saddle makers.\xa0\nThe Arceau Cavales sports horse-head motifs, a nod to Hermes’s equestrian roots.\xa0The watch\xa0is\xa0offered in two colourways, Hermes Red or Indigo Blue. To create the patchwork, camouflage-like pattern on the dial, the leatherworkers must first cut the full-grain calfskin into the desired shapes and trim them down to a uniform 0.5mm thickness. They then spend around six hours carefully assembling the pieces together.\nTECHNIQUE: ENAMELLING AND ENGRAVINGWATCH: JAEGER-LECOULTRE REVERSO TRIBUTE ENAMEL\nThree watches make up Jaeger-LeCoultre’s Reverso Tribute Enamel series. Each one is dedicated to a master artist: French post-Impressionist painter Georges Seurat; Chinese ink painter Xu Beihong; and Japanese printmaker Katsushika Hokusai. Even if you don’t recognise their names, you’ll probably recognise their art.\nThe artworks are depicted on the reverse of each\xa0watch\'s case\xa0–\xa0which came with challenges. The art had to be miniaturised, with all details reproduced as faithfully as possible. The respective styles of the artworks – pointillism, ink wash, and woodblock printing – also had to be recreated in enamel, despite not having the same material qualities.\nJaeger-LeCoultre also wanted to showcase its expertise in engraving, so the dials were guilloched before being covered in a layer of enamel. The Seurat dial sports tiny lozenges under a deep-green enamel; the Xu Beihong dial comes with geometric strokes under ivory enamel; and the Hokusai dial features small waves under a deep-blue enamel.\nTECHNIQUE: ENGRAVINGWATCH: PATEK PHILIPPE SKELETON WATCH REF. 5180/1R-001\nThe art of engraving is inherently risky business. One wrong move with the chisel and the artisan could destroy the entire surface of the dial. But Patek Philippe’s artisans love pushing the limit, such as on Ref. 5180/1R-001. The movement of this watch is skeletonised, leaving very little room to work with, let alone a margin of error.\nOn this tiny canvas, 27.5mm across and 2.53mm high, the engraver must decorate all the available surfaces with an abstract pattern of arabesques, spirals and scrolls. The tools at their disposal? An arsenal of burins. There’s no fixed template of how the decoration should look, so the engraver must come up with the final design in his or her own mind.\nTECHNIQUE: GEM-SETTING, LAPIDARY, GOLDSMITHINGWATCH: PIAGET POSSESSION\nPiaget has one of the most expansive repertoires of artistic crafts in the industry, thanks to its twin strengths as a jeweller and watchmaker. And those strengths are best exemplified in collections like the Possession. You might know the name from the brand’s bestselling rings, which feature a playful rotating band that invites fidgeting.\nThe outer, diamond-set bezels of the watches shown here rotate with the same whimsy. The dials – in minerals like cornelian, lapis lazuli, malachite and turquoise – showcase Piaget’s lapidary skills. The stones have to be cut into wafer-thin slices, polished and drilled to house the hour and minute hands.\nOn the cuff watch, which has a woven chain bracelet in 18K rose gold, Piaget’s mastery in goldsmithing comes to the fore. The bracelet has to be strong yet light and supple enough so that it behaves like fabric. The individual links also have to be polished to bring out the metal’s inherent beauty.\n', 'related_topics': ['     timepieces ', '     Watches ', '     jewellery ', '     art ', '     Accessories ']}"

      Creative Capital: The naked artist who thinks contemporary art can be really dumb
  </h1>, 'text': 'I have a lithograph by Singaporean contemporary artist Heman Chong hanging in my dining room. It was part of a series produced in collaboration with the Singapore Tyler Print Institute. It is a grey scale geometric work with four words emblazoned in large san serif type across the top of the print, “Advanced Studies In Totalitarianism”.\nGiven our geographical context, it’s a piece that always makes people stop, and, more often than not, chuckle. My wife and I also have another piece, this one representative of a trope that has engaged Heman for over a decade – redesigning and painting book covers. Ours depicts Dr Seuss’s Green Eggs and Ham, and was a present to us when our eldest child was born.\n\n\nHeman is a friend and one of Singapore’s most significant contemporary artists. The 41-year-old’s work has ranged from two-dimensional paintings to large installations. He describes his practice as “the intersection between image, performance, situations and writing”. His solo exhibitions are numerous, and have ranged from here in Singapore to Berlin, New York and London.\nContemporary art is literally art that’s made right here, and right now. Most of it is really, really terrible and dumb and downright awful.\nHe has participated in numerous international biennales, including the 50th Venice Biennale (2003); the fourth Busan Biennale (2004); the second Singapore Biennale (2008); and 20th Sydney Biennale (2016).\nElsewhere, he is the co-director and founder (with his wife Renee Staal) of The Library of Unread Books, which has been installed in NTU’s Centre for Contemporary Art in Singapore; The Museum of Contemporary Art and Design (MCAD) in Manila; Casco in Utrecht, The Netherlands; and Kunstverein Milano in Milan, Italy.\nDespite all the many accolades and accomplishments, Heman remains grounded and very grounded. And self-deprecating. In an interview with ArtAsiaPacific, he described his own work from the 2003 Venice Biennale as “super crappy” and “pretentious”. I like this about him, that he can be critical and honest.\nBe hungry! Look at everything! Don’t think in terms of good and bad! Expand your mind!\nAnd the next step for this respected artist is to take on a new medium. He’s long said, in reference to the video installations he used to create in his younger days, that he was quite bad at making them. Instead, he opined, he should make a film.\nBut even that would take time, patience and collaborative skills he didn’t posses. “So I thought maybe I’ll just write a novel. It’s more Heman Chong anyway.” Which is what he is now doing. His first novel The Book Of Drafts will be published by Polyparenthesis in 2019.\nHere, in CNA Lifestyle\'s series where we speak with creatives making their mark in Singapore, Heman discusses creative challenges, the state of contemporary art, and his unique clothing-optional process.\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT CONTEMPORARY ART IS TO THE LAYPERSON?\nHEMAN CHONG: Contemporary art is literally art that’s made right here, and right now. Most of it is really, really terrible and dumb and downright awful, but you’ll be able to see some really great stuff if you’re persistent enough.\nIS ART EVEN STILL RELEVANT TODAY? AND WHO IS YOUR OWN AUDIENCE?\nYes! I have a small but dedicated following. I don’t want numbers! I want a truck load of intensity. I prefer to have one single person who’s totally into my work, rather than having 1,000,000,000\xa0who would take a three-second glance.\nWOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO PICK OUT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT\xa0ARTWORK CREATED IN THE LAST DECADE?\nIn my opinion, it’s irrelevant what the greatest artwork is, ever, because when it comes to the creative world, it’s not productive to think in absolute terms. We must allow for a whole bunch of artworks to inform how we see the world. Be hungry! Look at everything! Don’t think in terms of good and bad! Expand your mind!\nEvery single mistake that I’ve made, every failure I’ve encountered has defined me more than anything else.\nWHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON RIGHT NOW?\nSince May 2018, I have been collecting images of back entrances of embassies in every city that I visit. These are doors in plain sight, but completely ignored and overlooked and often unmarked.\nI spoke to a friend of mine who works in an embassy, and she told me that these back doors have multiple pragmatic uses: For the delivery of takeaways, for family members of the ambassador to enter and exit without hassle, but also for things that happen in the shadows which I have promised never to talk about.\nThese back doors fascinate me because they represent everything in politics that is unsaid, invisible and sinister. They are gateways to secrets and lies. It is interesting how these unassuming and unglamorous doors have such a useful purpose to them, and I love this air of mystery.\nI have decided to never reveal which door these embassies belong to in whichever city as I am not interested in uncovering the mystery, but rather, to allow something to remain veiled and inaccessible. I have also chosen to force a viewer to see the image many times around, as if he or she is a figure of surveillance, forever watching these passages.\nIS SINGAPORE A TOUGH PLACE TO BE A CREATIVE?\nYes. But unfortunately, everywhere else is tough too! If you’re serious about something, take some time out, sit and make a plan and be prepared to work 10 times harder that you’ve ever expected. The toughest place is that place inside your head named ""Lazy""\xa0and ""Procrastination"".\n\n\nIF YOU COULD GO BACK AND MEET YOURSELF AS A YOUNG ART STUDENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE HIM?\nHa ha! I would destroy the time machine with my bare hands to stop myself from going back in time. Just because every single mistake that I’ve made, every failure I’ve encountered has defined me more than anything else.\nDID YOU EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE “WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I DOING?” MOMENTS?\nYes! Every single waking moment. But you just deal with it, you know. For an artist, it’s immensely more fun not knowing what you’re doing than having everything figured out at the beginning.\nI make most of my work completely naked! Sorry, but you asked.\nYOU’VE LIVED IN NEW YORK, LONDON, BERLIN AND NOW YOU’RE BACK IN SINGAPORE. WHAT DO YOU MISS ABOUT THOSE OTHER CITIES?\nOf all the cities I’ve lived in, I miss New York the most, only because of three things: The Strand Book Store, Shake Shack and the fact that you walk up and down Manhattan in completely straight lines. And the Met. And the train ride to Dia Beacon. And driving across to Brooklyn at 4am. And groceries from Trader Joe’s. And sunsets in Brooklyn Heights.\nMy solo exhibition – Ifs, Ands, or Buts – at the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai where I had to fill seven floors of real estate with new works. And I only had a year. And I had to make another solo at the South London Gallery at the same time.\nWHO IS YOUR OWN DESIGN OR CREATIVE HERO?\nOn Kawara!\nWHAT’S BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR CAREER TO DATE?\nThere are many! But if I have to mention one, it would be that I met my wife, Renee, while making an exhibition at Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam.\nTELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS I WOULD NEVER EXPECT.\nI don’t have aircon in my studio! I make most of my work completely naked! Sorry, but you asked.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     art ']}"

      Naked art: Take a peek inside a nude drawing class in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'On this Thursday evening, all eyes are on Shirley. As she nonchalantly fixes her gaze on some imagined point at the far end of this air-conditioned room, nine complete strangers are silently but intensely scrutinising her from top to bottom.\nIt’s all quiet, except for some gentle piano music and the faint sound of scribbling on paper. Shirley doesn’t move a muscle – even though she’s been standing up for 20 minutes with her left leg at an awkward angle. It’s obviously cold and she’s completely naked.\n“Okay, time’s up!” someone exclaims. Shirley relaxes, picks up a white top and casually covers herself. Before shuffling to an adjacent room to stretch her back, she takes a peek at a couple of nude sketches propped up on easels.\nYou just have to be very comfortable in your own skin\xa0\n“The first time I did this, I wanted to see the end result – how I looked on the canvas. It didn’t feel awkward because I already knew I will be in front of artists,” she told CNA Lifestyle earlier.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nHONING SKILLS FOR TWO HOURS\nOnce a month, the Visual Arts Centre Singapore (VAC) holds a nude life drawing session at its Dhoby Ghaut premises. For two hours, professional and amateur artists hone their skills, translating a model-in-the-flesh into figures on paper or canvas.\nTonight, the subject is 30-year-old Shirley, who has been doing this for the past three years, after starting out as a photography model for lingerie, fashion and “implied nude” in 2009.\nIt’s not that I’m showing a\xa0naked body to another person – I’m showing a naked body to an artist who wants to paint for the sake of art\n“All girls want to be models but they don’t know where to start. I was lucky that I Googled it online and found (photographers) who wanted models, so I gave it a try. After that, I liked it a lot,” she said.\nThese days, she roughly gets\xa0three to four gigs a week, which include\xa0nude life drawing sessions such as tonight. ""Every week, depending on the timing and the art organisation you work with, there are assignments,” she said.\nVAC is one of her regular clients – and that rare non-art school venue\xa0that offers such classes.\nThe monthly sessions began two years ago. “We wanted to introduce professional art courses – and a part of the Academy\'s approach to learning fine arts were nude life and portrait drawings,” explained Iola Liu, director of VAC.\n\n\nThe legacy\xa0of nude art stretches way back, and is found in all cultures, from the Greeks to the Japanese, with many of the world’s masterpieces falling in this tradition. Suffice it to say, majority of these weren’t simply imagined by artists but had actual people in the buff posing for them.\n“It’s basically the same as learning to draw a still life of apples or vases and all that – but you study the human anatomy. You can’t go far just copying from a picture,” said Iola.\nFROM PROFESSIONALS TO BEGINNERS\nAccording to Iola, between eight to 12 people attend each session and their backgrounds are quite varied. “Some are former or current art students, and there are also complete beginners. And we also have a teacher present, who guides them.”\nEverything is done in a controlled environment – no photography is allowed and outsiders can’t just barge in. Each session is S$56 and the VAC provides the materials.\n“Some people can’t imagine but the mood is actually very serious. People who come here are really thankful for the opportunity to be able to draw nude models,” said Iola.\nFor the first few minutes, you don’t feel cold but then after 10 minutes…\nTonight, one of the students is Jing Xiang. The 28-year-old event coordinator working in the mental health industry is attending his first nude drawing session at the VAC.\n“I haven’t done it in a long time but it’s been a good way for me to focus, and take my attention off things like work. I think art is actually a nice way to relax. It’s good to be able to observe and draw,” he said.\n\n\nTHE IDEAL NUDE MODEL\nWhile nude life art – and such sessions devoted to this – is pretty normal elsewhere, that’s not the case in Singapore,\xa0said Iola, citing artists like Siew Hock Meng and Fan Shao Hua as among the more famous ones.\nClasses are mostly reserved for art schools and private sessions by different groups. As for nude models, there aren’t many around apparently – VAC finds its models from a recommended list by the Federation of Art Societies.\nThe mood is actually very serious. People who come here are really thankful for the opportunity to be able to draw nude models\n“We do have people who contact us because they think it’s very fun and want to tick it off their bucket list.\xa0But nude life modeling is a serious assignment,” said Iola, who reckons there are less than 50 models who do this. VAC has worked with about 10 of them.\nSo what does it take to become a nude model then?\nIt’s not just about being naked in front of strangers. According to Iola, there are requirements regarding the models’ physique – and it has to do with actually having something to draw or paint.\n“The ideal (female) nude life model would be curvaceous, with all the connotations of a female body – full hips and breasts. If a model is too ‘flat’ (it’s not ideal). For guys, we want someone with abs and muscles – although we’ve had feedback that some guys don’t like to draw other guys,” she said, with a laugh.\nON ACHING BODIES AND BEING COLD\nAside from that, models have to be disciplined. “Moving a lot is unacceptable behaviour. You’re required to hold a certain position so people can focus and draw you.”\nWhile models do take breaks in-between poses – which usually includes the basic ones like standing, sitting and lying down – it can get pretty tiring, said Shirley.\n“One of the challenges is the body ache – especially if you do a pose wrongly and have to stay there for, like 15 minutes. And then there’s the aircon. For the first few minutes, you don’t feel cold but then after 10 minutes…” she laughed.\nAnd what goes on in her head as she stands or sits immobile in front of artists? “If there’s music, I’ll just listen to it. If it’s just silence, I’ll treat it as if I’m meditating. Because I do yoga as well.”\nThe ideal (female) nude life model would be curvaceous. For guys, we want someone with abs and muscles\xa0\nBut what about the very notion of standing in your birthday suit in front of total strangers?\n“You just have to be very comfortable in your own skin. Not many people in Singapore can accept nude modelling (but) it’s not that I’m showing a\xa0naked body to another person – I’m showing a naked body to an artist who wants to paint, who wants to photograph, for the sake of art.”\nWhile nude life modelling doesn’t necessarily mean one has to actually like art, it’s certainly a big plus if one does.\nShirley, for instance, developed a love for art from her teenage years, and does some photography herself (sunsets and old buildings are favourite subjects). She also has a fine arts diploma and a degree in dance from LASALLE College of the Arts.\n\n\nThat sensitivity to aesthetics extends to how she views her modelling gigs. She would normally interact with artists during breaks, and\xa0offer or receive feedback.\n“Artists know what they want in their canvas and sketches. And if I can help them (to achieve that), why not? I’m also an artist – my body is my tool.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Trending ', '     art ']}"

      A life in colour: Legacy of Singapore’s ‘Bridge of Art’ creator Pacita Abad celebrated on remote island home
  </h1>, 'text': ""BASCO, PHILIPPINES: Pacita Abad was sipping coffee by the riverside in Singapore, deep in the throes of a cancer battle, when she was struck by artistic inspiration.\nIt was 2003, and her life had been one full of colour and creativity. But the transformation of a non-remarkable pedestrian bridge in a foreign land would became a final project of an esteemed life.\nIt was Alkaff Bridge at Robertson Quay - and its relative dullness - that had captured Abad’s imagination. Over the next year, the Philippine artist, with the assistance of a team of rope specialists, would defy her ailing health to create a lasting mark on the country’s contemporary landscape.\nAbad’s sister Victoria remembers the feelings of positivity radiating from Pacita as her vibrant designs were fulfilled.\n“She was so sick with cancer, in a wheelchair. She said to the doctor, ‘I’m going to die anyway, can’t I just finish the bridge? Why won’t you just let me work?’ She signed it at the end. That’s how amazing she was. Even in the last days of her life, she was still working.”\nAt the time, she described it as “a gift to Singapore”. “I passionately believe in public art and hope that this project inspires many more like it and brings art into the everyday lives of Singaporeans,” she said.\nThroughout her career, Abad’s abstract works - often using materials like ceramic, glass and natural materials - would see her featured in\xa0galleries throughout the world and celebrated as a pioneering female artist in the Philippines.\nAbad would succumb to cancer in December 2004, yet her legacy remains alive, not only in the centre of Singapore’s river precinct and on gallery walls, but perhaps most strongly back on the remote island of her birth.\nAbad, one of 12 siblings, was born in the post office in Basco, a town on Batanes, the Philippines’ northernmost province. It is a wild, weather-beaten land in the path of typhoons and encircled by unforgiving tides. The roots of her ancestors, the indigenous Ivatan, are deep on the island.\nAs children, the Abad clan would brave a three-day boat ride from their home in Manila to Batanes, somewhere their accompanying father would laud for its green rolling hills, sheer cliffs and rolling hills.\n“We would land at that port, and as you can imagine, we were all seasick. Our father would wake us up, all clustered in one room, and say ‘Batanes, Batanes, Batanes. This is the most beautiful place in the world’. And we would say ‘Oh my god, there is nothing here. Just waves and it’s so ugly’,” Victoria Abad Kerblat said.\nOver time, Pacita, as well as her siblings, would come to understand the magic and despite extensive travels around the world to spread and celebrate her art, it was in Batanes that a special connection was forged.\xa0\nOn an isolated hilltop, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Abad built a small house and her dream studio. It was akin to a glass cathedral, paying homage to sky and sea.\nBut far from just becoming an artist’s secluded refuge, it was symbolic of her investment in Ivatan culture and in a people often forgotten in a diverse nation. Batanes communities are rugged and a career in art, rather than the staples of fishing and farming, is a rare pursuit. Abad dreamt of changing that.\n“Every time she came home, she saw the possibility of this becoming an artist haven and she tried to inspire a lot of artists. They would paint with her. They loved her,” Victoria said.\n“She was a queen every time she came here. And she loved it here and she wanted to die here. When she passed away, she gave it (the house) to the family and the family decided we would make it into something.”\nAbad’s house is no longer just a residence. It has been lovingly renovated and expanded by one of her brothers Butch Abad into a luxurious high-end hotel and professional gallery space. The property - now called Fudacion Pacita - embodies Abad’s spirit and showcases her style and designs.\nAt its core, the hotel and gallery also acts to serve the small Batanes community. It is strictly non-profit and the proceeds go towards supporting local artists, as well as other eco-tourism, livelihood and education programs in the province.\nJaypee Cortez, an upcoming local artist says he has been inspired by Pacita Abad and is exploring a creative path thanks to the resulting shift in social perceptions around the craft.\nWith a dozen or so other artists, he is working to further develop Yaru Arts Gallery, an art space and cafe that showcases and helps sell the works of locals. “Nowadays a lot people are getting interested in art, especially the youth,” he said.\n“Pacita's arts were an eye opener for us all. It shows us that we can showcase our art. Her art is all about colors and patterns. My inspiration is our own culture, mother and child, the fish vendors. That's what I’m showcasing in my paintings, the very rich culture of Batanes.”\nAbad never saw her dreams for Batanes realised. Her statue though stands pride of place under the sun near the entrance to the hotel, overlooking the mountains and waves she learned to savour.\nChildren play around it, in the gardens and by a bubbling fountain. They have found joy in Batanes too. Victoria Abad Kerblat says her sister would be overjoyed.\n“As you see more artists, you realise your dream is coming true. Everywhere you go, you are awed by the scenery. Just look at the sky and you can paint something. Paradise,” she said.\n“I’m sure she’s looking from somewhere else now. She would be so happy.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Philippines ', '     art ']}"

      The artist intrigued by an old Singapore he's too young to have experienced
  </h1>, 'text': 'Walking around artist Hilmi Johandi’s latest art installation is like stepping into an eerie dream-like version of Singapore’s old amusement parks.\nThere are paintings of Happy World’s stadium stage, children on a merry-go-round ride from Great World, and the entrance to New World. There are fuzzy slow-motion videos of a ferris wheel. At the back, you climb up a stage that’s reminiscent of the platform where one queues up for such rides.\nThese pieces, which the 31-year-old Singaporean described as “discarded nostalgia”, comprise An Exposition, his contribution at this year’s President’s Young Talents (PYT) exhibition, which opens on Thu (Oct 4) at the Singapore Art Museum’s 8Q wing.\nWhile his fellow PYT artists – Weixin Quek Chong, Yanyun Chen, Zarina Muhammad and Debbie Ding – created works that touched on soil or scars, Hilmi looked to the different defunct Worlds for inspiration.\n“I came across them while looking into the National Archives in 2015 and I became intrigued. The names suggested this utopian vision during that time – they were spaces where patrons could escape (into),” he told CNA Lifestyle.\n“Their heydays were in the 50s and 60s – the pre-TV era, and there were\xa0so many things happening at Great World back then – they had these carnival rides, bars and cabarets for adults – I won’t be surprised if there was\xa0vice\xa0at these spaces. And in Happy World, fights would happen and the buildings were later destroyed because of fire.”\n\n\nIt’s not the first time Hilmi has proverbially travelled back in time for his artwork – his previous paintings and videos were collages that sprung from archival images of old P Ramlee movies, old street scenes or images (a woman performing a bangsawan, for instance) and even Great World, too.\nBut while there’s something “retro” about Hilmi’s works, he’d rather not bring up the ""N word"": Nostalgia.\n“I’m engaging nostalgia... but not in a nostalgic way. I’ve never experienced them before. I wasn’t even born at that time,” he said, adding that he finds the whole trend of romanticising nostalgia “quite disturbing”.\nInstead, he prefers to approach these blasts from the past from a more “intellectual” and “critical” standpoint – one reason why his work at PYT feels fragmented, where the different elements feel\xa0like bits and pieces of an incomplete experience.\nHilmi pointed out that his detached view is very similar to what many of the younger generation feel. “We know these places used to exist, we’ve heard of the name but we’re not very familiar with them. I used to pass this hotel called Gay World and I didn’t know exactly what it was until I later found out it was named after the amusement park – everything started to make sense.”\nThat said, he’s perfectly fine if someone sees his work differently.\nLast week, he recounted a pre-opening tour he did for museum docents. “One person in the group said her parents used to work in one of the Worlds and she was almost in tears. It was quite an interesting experience for me as the artist,” he said.\nThe President’s Young Talents exhibition runs from Oct 4 to Jan 27 at the Singapore Art Museum at 8Q.

      Flood of interested art buyers, and a job offer, for artist living in IMH
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: When Ms Cindy Sim heard of the job offer for her brother, she instinctively hugged Goshen Art Gallery co-founder Faith Lum-Yu, who had reached out with the proposal.\nMany others have responded generously, offering the family cash donations and to buy her brother’s paintings, following CNA Insider’s story about 50-year-old Sim Kah Lim, who has been institutionalised for nearly 35 years and paints old Singapore from memory.\nThe possible chance, however, for him to reintegrate into society, as both siblings see it, has thrilled them the most. “I’m happy and touched that somebody recognised his talents, and is willing to give him a chance,” said Ms Sim.\n“It would be good for Kah Lim to get back into society, back to work and interacting with people. Now he’s still living in his own world. When people talk to him, he’d just interrupt.”\nWATCH: His gift unfettered (6:16)\nBut there are many other considerations to take into first, and she admitted that it was early days.\nThe last time he was in any sort of job was as a 10-year-old helping an advertising company to paint movie posters and bus advertisements, before he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n“Nor has he gone out for a long time. I’m just a bit worried about whether he can cope,” added Ms Sim.\nHer brother, however, is already talking about using part of his future salary to employ a helper for their mother.\nWAITING ON DOCTORS’ ADVICE\nMs Lum-Yu decided to offer Mr Sim help in the hope that he can “have a sustainable way of life”. Her new social enterprise ArtSE provides employment for individuals with special needs, especially artists.\nAnd having met him and his sister at the Institute of Mental Health, she was struck by his talent and knowledge of the old Singaporean painters.\n“Kah Lim is such a lovable person. We talked about artists; even the ones that we represent, he knows them. We had a lovely time talking,” she said.\nHe was excited when they spoke about the possibility of employment, but she cautioned that “we want to take it slow”. She said: “We’ll wait for the doctors to advise us what days he can come out to work.\n“We’re going to impact on another person, and that’s what we’re looking forward to – it gives a greater meaning to what we’re doing.”\nThe idea is to have a senior artist mentor Mr Sim at the gallery once or twice a week. He, too, could share his knowledge with budding artists, but that would depend on how ready he is.\nMs Sim intends to take her brother out to crowded public places first, to observe how he interacts with others. She will also show him the art gallery to see if he likes the environment.\nAscertaining whether he is ready for the job will take some time, while full reintegration is a long way off, she admitted, as a sudden return to society would be “a shock to the system”.\nMANY FACTORS IN CONSIDERING REINTEGRATION\nThe first step, however, is for Ms Sim to work closely with the IMH doctors.\n“His consultant said it would be good if he can slowly integrate back into society, and he’d love to see if Kah Lim can progress to that stage,” she said.\n“I’d love for him to be out completely, but partially is good enough. Eventually, he can change for the better, to be completely okay.\nWe’ll take it step by step. I’m still in good health – I can take care of him.\nWhen contacted, the IMH said that in assessing a patient’s readiness for reintegration, the care team would consider his clinical condition, the ability to support himself in the community in areas like home support, and the ability to do practical things like use public transport and money.\nThe team must also consider the patient’s wish to return home or not, and whether there are carers around, such as family members.\nThe IMH said its occupational therapists and vocational specialists assist individuals in their job search and placement when they are ready to take up employment, based on their interests and skills.\nMost collaborations are in the administrative, retail, food and beverage and cleaning settings, where there are more opportunities.\n“In addition to providing on-site job coaching to support clients at work, individual follow-up with clients is also carried out to help them identify and overcome any challenges they face at work,” said an IMH spokesperson.\nTo date, 26 patients from its slow-stream rehabilitation ward have been discharged to their homes and community rehabilitation facilities.\nThese patients are doing well and engaging with the IMH at the outpatient level, added the spokesperson, who declined to comment on Mr Sim’s case, citing patient confidentiality.\nOFFERS FROM U.S., NEW ZEALAND\nApart from the job offer, as many as 80 people, including from the United States and New Zealand, have emailed Ms Sim to buy her brother’s paintings, donate art materials or even to commission him to paint something for them.\nSome have offered monetary assistance, but she referred them to the IMH. “So many people there also need help, not just Kah Lim. That’s not right. He could always sell his paintings if he needs more money,” she said.\nSome of his paintings have since been sold, but the details are being confirmed, she added.\nIt’s very great – the responses from the public. Some even messaged me. The first week, I was very emotional.\nMs Sim has created a website about her brother and diverted all the emails and queries there. She intends to photograph his paintings and catalogue them on the website for interested buyers.\nIt is a work in progress, and she hopes to upload the pictures in the next month or so. She has not even had the time, however, to price his paintings.\nBut she promised one thing: “I’ll also share updates about him and his progress.”\nRead Mr Sim's story here, and visit the website about him here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     mental health ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Cambodia's ancient dance gets modern all-male makeover
  </h1>, 'text': 'PHNOM PENH: Two figures glistened in Khmer costumes, an artistic mix of ancient tradition and daring modernity, with green silk shorts and almost transparent gold tunics with embroidered metal flowers.\nTheir bodies curved and curled, rose and fell with grace, each movement so elegant and subtle, to the rhythm of Sam Smith’s pop hit Lay Me Down.\nIn a narrow living room, the two dancers translated the music with their bodies. They entwined in each other’s arms like vines, their fingers folding and unfurling graciously like exotic flowers coming into bloom.\nHovering between them was their teacher, Prumsodun Ok, a Cambodian-American choreographer, who is sculpting what he hopes would be the future of Khmer classical dance - an ancient art form on the brink of extinction in modern Cambodia.\n“When I think about the future of the dance, it\'s nothing less than symbolic of the future of Cambodia,” he told Channel NewsAsia inside his apartment in downtown Phnom Penh, where his dance troupe was holding a routine rehearsal.\nTwo years ago, it was here that he formed Prumsodun Ok & Natyarasa, a local company that shot to fame as one of the most revolutionary dance troupes in Cambodia.\nBorn to Cambodian refugee parents in California’s Long Beach, United States, Prumsodun fell in love with Khmer classical dance when he was a young boy. But it was not until 2015 that he travelled to the country where the ancient Khmer kingdom had given birth to his passion.\nThe choreographer was working on a one-year project called Beloved. It was an experimental interdisciplinary work based on a tantric lovemaking ritual in 13th-century Cambodia, which was believed to ensure the fall of rain, life and prosperity of the Khmer people.\nSix weeks into the programme, he was contemplating young Cambodian men as they practised Khmer classical dance in his apartment.\n“I looked at them and I said ‘Oh’, you know, ‘They look like a real company now’ and \'Oh. Cambodia\'s first gay dance company\'s just formed in my living room’,” he recounted the moment with a smile.\n""It was something that was completely accidental.""\nA dance troupe like no other, Prumsodun Ok & Natyarasa trains young Cambodian men in the ancient art form that is traditionally dominated by women, while breathing new life and possibilities into what the society views as old-fashioned and primarily confines to tourist attractions.\nIt did not take long for the troupe of eight dancers to witness a surge in popularity, both locally and abroad, for their avant-garde interpretation of Khmer classical dance, also known as the Royal Ballet in Cambodia.\nFor Prumsodun, his company is not only a platform for cultural preservation but also a medium for endless artistic innovations, an experiment to find new paths and possibilities for survival.\n""I want to find a Khmer way of being contemporary,"" he said.\nI\'m not interested in imitating the past. I\'m interested in having the dance have meaning for us today and for the future.\nPUSHING BOUNDARIES\nUnder his tutelage, eight Cambodian men from different backgrounds have blossomed into professional artists.\nTheir transformation from amateur dancers into classically-trained performers was not an easy experience, given their male physique.\n“Our shoulder bones are large. We also have big muscles on our arms and in our calves and thighs. So we can’t really bend them like women do,” said Prumsodun’s protege Sokhon Tes.\nOur bodies may be different from women’s but our hearts are the same.\nThe 24-year-old has been training in Khmer classical dance for five years but only got to go deeper into different poses with his current mentor, who has taught him how to translate feelings into movements.\n“We can express a feeling hidden in our heart, visualising it with body movements that people can interpret and relate to.”\nCommunication through movements is key in Khmer classical dance. However, Prumsodun is experimenting with different components that could make the ancient art form better relate to the modern population.\nUsing a classical dance as a foundation, the choreographer builds on it layers of contemporary elements to achieve an interdisciplinary dance form. He modified traditional costumes, mixed English lyrics with classical tunes and bent dance patterns in a personal combat against what he calls “a legacy of colonialism in dance”.\n“Certain dance forms, because of where they\'re from, are allowed to be considered modern and contemporary, relevant and meaningful or cutting-edge. But I don\'t think that I have to jump up or roll up and down like some contemporary dance stars to be contemporary,” he said.\n“I want to find a way to be local in character but global in significance.”\nDANCE AGAINST VIOLENCE AND PAIN\nPrumsodun is a product of the Cambodian war and violence that was wreaked upon his homeland between 1975 and 1979. His parents fled the country during the oppressive rule of the Khmer Rouge, where almost a quarter of the population or close to two million people were wiped out in a four-year genocide.\nAmong them were artists. About 90 per cent of them are thought to have died, their knowledge of Khmer classical arts buried across the killing fields.\xa0\nFollowing the fall of the Khmer Rouge, some of the old masters who had survived planted new artistic seeds in post-war Cambodia and reopened Phnom Penh’s School of Fine Arts to revive the dying legacy.\nOne of their first students was Prumsodun’s mentor, Cambodia\'s leading choreographer Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, who founded the Khmer Arts Academy in Long Beach, California, in 2002.\n“When my teacher taught me, she was literally passing on the love of her teacher\'s, the knowledge of her teacher\'s, the history of our people and the magic of the art form,” said Prumsodun.\nAs a young boy in California’s inner city, he was surrounded by violence, poverty and struggle. If it had not been for Khmer classical dance and the coaching of his teacher, Prumsodun said, he would have been nothing but invisible, another victim of the genocide.\n“The teaching and the continuity of the art form itself is a gesture of healing, a testament to resilience of beauty. It\'s really the ultimate form of protest against the legacy of violence and the legacy of pain,” he said.\n“Dance gave me a voice and a platform to be seen and heard; it made me the person I am today.”\nAnd that enriching experience is what has driven him to pass on the knowledge of Khmer classical dance to the younger generations in modern-day Cambodia, especially those whose dreams are constrained by cultural traditions and social values.\n“It was this moment when I realised that my life got fuller and the meaning of my life got bigger,” he said.\n“We\'re giving this beautiful but vulnerable tradition a new life, new possibilities and new caretakers.” \xa0\nFollow Pichayada Promchertchoo on Twitter @PichayadaCNA\n', 'related_topics': ['     Cambodia ', '     art ']}"

      5 ways the Esplanade has made an impact on Singapore’s arts scene
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: This week, the Esplanade kicked off a year-long campaign to celebrate its 15th anniversary. Called #mydurian, it began with a light-up of its prickly domes, a social media campaign and contests.\nThe arts centre has also started a series of fundraising initiatives, including backstage tours by artists, old-school donation boxes all over the arts centre, a fundraising gala dinner next year, and an online art auction, all primarily to help in its next big project – the construction of an additional waterfront theatre.\nSet to be up and running by 2021, it costs S$30 million, of which the centre is hoping to raise two-thirds through corporate sponsorship and public fundraising.\nIf it all sounds familiar, it’s because it was done before – the iconic, and now-defunct, National Theatre was built in 1963 thanks to “a-dollar-a-brick” campaign, where Singaporeans gladly chipped in as a way of staking ownership.\nAnd after being around for 15 years, the Esplanade is trying to do the same for its new building, crossing its fingers that the public feels the same way about #mydurian.\nBut has it done enough to prove its worth? Channel NewsAsia looks back at some of the centre’s achievements.\n***\n1. BUILDING AN AUDIENCE\nThe debate over whether the Esplanade was going to become a white elephant was well and truly settled practically from the very start. During its first full year of operation, from 2003 to 2004, it notched up an attendance of 949,906. Last year, it was a whopping 2 million.\n\nIt has achieved this thanks to its many festivals that cater to every type of audience: Dance enthusiasts, music lovers, families, senior citizens, hardcore theatregoers, and tourists. Plus, there are the cultural festivals that attract people across the board, such as Huayi, Pesta Raya and Kalaa Utsavam.\nIt has also long debunked the notion that it was going to be only for the cultural elite – last year, more than three quarters of the audience came to see non-ticketed events found at its indoor and outdoor venues.\nIt has also adjusted to the times, setting up an Annexe space for more live music performances for millennials, creating a new nook for children called PIP’s PLAYbox, initiating more events for senior citizens, and of course, its planned mid-sized theatre for even more shows, workshops and events.\n\nThirty-seven thousand performances, 26 million audiences and 92 million visitors in 15 years? Not bad at all.\n2. MAKING SWEET MUSIC\nThe Esplanade continues to play host to many top-notch orchestras and more “atas” musical performances. But its biggest musical successes have been Baybeats and Mosaic Music Festival, which began in 2002 and 2005, respectively.\nThe former is still around while the latter officially wrapped up three years ago, after morphing from a kind of jazz and world music event to something more indie-friendly. (Today, it has also become more of an ad-hoc series.)\nThese two events introduced audiences to a wide range of music both locally and internationally, and signalled to commercial promoters that there was something there worth pursuing.\n“Mosaic was the template for subsequent festivals,” said Yeow Kai Chai, Singapore Writers Festival director and former music journalist. “They seeded the idea where you come to a venue to check out acts of different genres, and other festivals saw that it was possible as long as you create an environment where people are comfortable and willing to check out acts they’ve never heard before.”\nThe Esplanade’s disposition to consciously give local musicians a platform to perform was also a boon. Recently, acts like Gentle Bones and DJ KoFlow have performed their own big shows – and one could argue that it was the arts centre’s constant programmes showcasing local acts that made what was once unthinkable possible.\n“The Esplanade dismantled the idea that Singaporean musicians cannot hold their own,” said Yeow. “They’ve invited bands at different levels of development, hold workshops, and now these bands are performing at big concert halls. It wasn’t just about presenting them but developing them.”\xa0\n3. SETTING THE STAGE FOR THEATRE\nWhen the Esplanade first started, there were fears it would only play host to big, international touring musicals and would have no space for Singapore’s theatremakers.\nWhile it did do the former – a role that has since shifted to other venues such as Marina Bay Sands – it’s safe to say that it has also become a second home for the local theatre scene.\nFrom commissioning large and small shows (beginning with Forbidden City in 2002) to holding festivals of its own and being a venue for others such as the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival and the different iterations of the Singapore Arts Festival, it has become the place where audiences can catch quality theatre shows of all sorts.\nIts annual Studios season continues to feature many small-scale or experimental works by local and international acts – and can be rightfully considered a series where one can get an accurate snapshot of what local theatremakers were doing. The Theatre venue also offered groups a chance to try their hand at bigger things, with musicals such as 881 The Musical, Forbidden City, and December Rains.\n“I think the Esplanade is still the premier arts centre in Singapore after all these years,” said Melissa Lim, general manager of The Necessary Stage (TNS).\n“It has the best venues and technical support available to artists and arts groups there. It supports the creation of new works by commissions and features on its programming platforms.”\nBut she also added an overlooked contribution – to have all those shows in all sorts of styles and languages under one roof had created an environment that was diverse enough for\xa0audiences to step out of their preferred theatre silos. And it has given theatre groups a chance to do so, too. Lim cited how TNS, known mainly for its English language works, was commissioned to create Malay and Chinese pieces, for instance.\n“I feel these intercultural efforts are important, particularly in a society like Singapore, in that they encourage dialogue on diversity and national identity.”\n4. MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES IN DANCE\nThree years after it opened, The Esplanade introduced da:ns festival, a full-blown event dedicated to all things dance. It was a big deal, especially for a scene that was relatively small compared to other performing arts.\nToday, the 12-year-old festival has become a fixture on the calendar – so much so that October has become a de facto “dance month”, with the National Arts Council also starting its own dance event Got To Move around the same time.\nAnd in true Esplanade fashion, the fest continues to offer a whole range of offerings from big ballet acts to cutting-edge contemporary choreographers to traditional groups and even flamenco masters. In recent years, it has also come to champion Southeast Asian works, and many of Singapore’s most exciting choreographers.\n“It was a bigger platform for different genres and it has done well to meet the needs of different audiences,” said dancer and choreographer Kuik Swee Boon.\nAnd like its support-and-nurture role in music and theatre, the Esplanade has done the same for dance artists. Kuik recalled how the arts centre was the first to support his first full-length piece after he decided to strike it on its own after stints at Singapore Dance Theatre and Compania Nacional de Danza in Spain.\nAfter Kuik founded THE Dance Company, the arts centre also encouraged his group to try their hand at doing something bigger at its Theatre venue in 2009 – a move that was unheard of for a local contemporary dance company. The partnership would continue as it supported THE’s new M1 Contact festival.\n5. CATCHING YOUR EYE WITH VISUAL ART\nIt’s understandable that people don’t think of checking out an exhibition at a performing arts venue, but artworks are all around nonetheless. From Han Sai Por’s sculptures outside, to paintings, video works and sculptures visitors encounter walking past the underground Tunnel or the Concourse, the Esplanade made space for visual artists.\nIt wasn’t an easy start, though. The spaces for these were indeed awkward: The Concourse is simply a huge open space, the Tunnel is a busy pedestrian thoroughfare, and the Jendela gallery was initially supposed to be a bar. All tough spaces for visual artists to work with.\nPlus, as Puah recalled in a previous interview, the more established artists had been skeptical at the start. “I was belittled by many of our senior artists. How (it was) disrespectful to put art up like this when it’s not a specific space.”\nThese days, it’s not unusual to see art sprouting up at the oddest places. And while the Esplanade won’t give the Singapore Art Museum, Gillman Barracks or the National Gallery a run for their money, it’s yet another venue for artists of all sorts.\nSometimes, it can be ahead of the curve, too. Remember Zai Kuning’s enormous boat installation that represented Singpore at the recent Venice Biennale? It was first exhibited at the Concourse two years before that. Casual visitors had encountered a world-class artwork by a Singapore artist way before everyone else did.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Music ', '     art ']}"

      Dying indigenous cultures? These young Malaysians are fighting back with music and art
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUCHING: On a cool Sunday night, people have gathered expectantly for a concert at the city’s open-air amphitheatre.\nMany are here to see some of Sarawak’s famous musicians perform, such as rocker Noh Salleh and R&B singer Dayang Nurfaizah. But before their homegrown heroes in Malaysia’s pop music scene appear, two unassuming people in tribal wear step out carrying unusual stringed instruments.\nOne of them is Alena Murang, a Kuching native who has been making a name for herself playing the sape, a traditional lute used in the island of Borneo.\nTogether with her long-time mentor and sape master Mathew Ngau Jau, the 27-year-old launches into a series of songs from Kelabit, her father’s tribe, to a smattering of polite applause from an audience fed on a diet of pop and rock music.\nIt’s a tough crowd but that hasn’t stopped her from reaching out to people. Aside from Sunday night’s gig as part of the first Rainforest Fringe Festival (RFF), Alena has also been playing short sets at some of the city’s bars. On Friday, the annual Rainforest World Music Festival beckons.\nAlena isn’t the only young Sarawakian valiantly trying to bring her indigenous culture to a mainstream crowd this week.\nElsewhere, 30-year-old contemporary artist Kendy Mitot is presenting art installations based on his own Bidayuh heritage – and he admits feeling nervous about it.\nThe Kuala Lumpur-based artist is exhibiting in Sarawak for the first time, and he’s not sure how people will react to the works, which are swathed in mysticism and ancient traditions frowned upon by some.\n“It’s very tough to make people like artworks like these,” he told Channel NewsAsia. “But it comes from a dying culture, and I just want to share my knowledge in a contemporary way.”\nThe Bidayuh and Kelabit are among the many indigenous minority groups in Sarawak.\nWhile the former is the fourth largest ethnic group in the East Malaysian state, they actually make up only eight per cent of the population. Meanwhile, there are only 6,000 Kelabit people combined, in both Sarawak and Indonesia’s northern Kalimantan, south of the border.\nA RACE AGAINST TIME\nFor both artists, saving the rich heritage of their respective indigenous groups has been a race against time.\nAlena, whose father is a Kelabit and mother is an English-Italian anthropologist, began learning the sape, an instrument traditionally played only by men, at the age of 13. And only out of sheer necessity.\nWhen she was six, she and her cousins would perform traditional dances at small functions in Kuching. But there weren’t many sape players to accompany them.\n“Sometimes, we’d just perform to that one CD everybody had,” she quipped. “When I started playing the sape, almost no one was learning it. Even from my dad’s generation, hardly anyone was playing it.\nMeanwhile, Kendy grew up still surrounded by the traditional rituals of the Bidayuh tribe in Bau, a gold mining town just 45 minutes from Kuching. In fact, his late grandmother was a shaman.\nBut today, there’s a catch. “They’re all old already. I think less than 30 people still practice these kinds of rituals, and most of them are from 65 to 90 years old. This year, already two have died. I think it’s too late. It’s a dying culture.”\nCLASH OF CULTURES\nThe disappearance of such rituals has been the result of cultures clashing. Since the missionaries arrived in the 1860s, the Bidayuh have been staunch Christians who often frowned upon old rituals and ceremonies.\n“After you convert, you cannot touch these things,” said Kendy, who is a Christian himself.\n“In my area, they throw away all the ritual objects and traditional art into the river. Some are burnt. Religion in itself is not a problem, but when people who practice them say ‘you cannot do this or that’, then that becomes a problem. If you’re a first-time convert, you become scared of these (objects).”\nAlena recalled a similar situation when she was growing up among the Kelabit, who were also Christians.\n“When I was younger, some of the old aunties and uncles weren’t that happy when they saw us learning some of the songs, which could be about headhunting or a love song calling out to different lovers to lie with you,” she said.\nA TURNING POINT\nBut as both artists grew up, they also realised they belonged to a unique heritage.\nAfter finishing her business degree in the UK, Alena spent a couple of years in management consulting in Kuala Lumpur before shifting careers to become an artist.\nFollowing a one-year stint at Singapore’s LASALLE College of the Arts, she joined the Malaysian percussion group Diplomats Of Drum on a two-month tour of the US in 2014.\n“From there I realised so many people were interested in the sape. They’ve seen all these ‘exotic’ instruments like the sitar or the ukulele from Chile but it was like, ‘where’s Borneo?’” she recalled.\nDespite aiming to be a full-time visual artist, it was her sape playing that drew attention. After doing small gigs and open mic sessions at bars in KL, she was invited to bigger events and festivals, and even got a government grant to teach sape.\nMeanwhile, the turning point for Kendy was taking up an art degree a decade ago, when he eventually realised that tapping into the objects, artefacts and rituals of his youth could be a way of preserving his cultural identity.\nAmong the exhibitions at the RFF are his mixed media installations that reinterpret objects from Bidayuh rituals. One of these uses tribal totems called tipaduak, which are only usually put in front of longhouses to protect against evil spirits. For the show, Kendy recreated and assembled them together as a statement of protecting his indigenous culture.\n“I’m very lucky that I studied fine art because if not, I won’t be doing this kind of thing,” said the artist. He added wistfully: “When you’re young, you don’t think these things are important, and now, I keep thinking why I didn’t start documenting this earlier.”\nINVOLVING THE COMMUNITY\nThe two artists have since been seriously learning more about and promoting their indigenous cultures.\nTwice a year, Alena makes the long trek from KL to the remote settlement of Long Peluan, where her father’s family are from, to learn the songs and stories from the Kelabit elders.\xa0\n“They’re realising we’re slowly losing these and not many people are singing them, so they’re quite happy to share some of these pre-Christian songs.”\nHer painstaking efforts have resulted in her first album, Flight. Released last year, it comprises a handful of songs from the Kelabit and Kenyah tribes.\n“I don’t write my own songs on sape. For me, it’s important to keep the old songs alive and there’s still so many that I have to learn and share,” she said.\nKendy’s own Bidayuh people, too, have slowly come to accept his efforts – and it has extended beyond art-making.\nThanks to his father, who’s the kampong chief, there’s been a revival of their annual festival, called Gawai Bidayuh. While it’s not quite the real thing, it’s still a nice symbolic gesture that has been going on for the last couple of years.\nREACHING OUT TO MALAYSIANS\nWhile their communities are now coming on board, it’s been slow-going outside, said Kendy.\nUntil quite recently, there was also a stigma attached to any kind of art with “indigenous” trappings in Malaysia. He recalled how, in 2015, galleries would dismiss his works saying these wouldn’t sell.\nA recent exhibition of indigenous art at Galeri Petronas in Kuala Lumpur is a sign that things are slowly changing, but he reckons there’s still much to do in terms of raising awareness in Malaysia, especially from the peninsula.\n“Most of them still don’t like to see these kinds of indigenous art, much less know about Sarawak or Sabah tribes. In the college where I teach, my students first thought I was Malay. And when I told them I was a Bidayuh, they asked me what it was. They only know Malay, Chinese, and Indians.”\nThings seem to be much better when it comes to music. In fact, the last few years have seen a surge in interest in the sape.\n“People want to use in movies, documentaries, and ads. They want to learn how to play it and even include it in their rock songs,” said Alena, who has formed a sape collective with other musicians, and was even invited by Malaysian rock band Estranged to join them for their live shows.\nAnd it doesn’t end with the younger generation embracing sape. Alena also started an organisation called Art4, which aims to give back to the people from whom she has learnt so much.\n“One of the things we do is connect indigenous musicians and artists with more contemporary events and spaces. I want it to become the hub that people go to when they want indigenous artists,” she said.\n“Music or art was not meant for fame or money. It’s meant to pass down knowledge and certain values, tell stories, and bring communities together.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Music ']}"

      Cambodian nature and childhood inspire Instagram star artist
  </h1>, 'text': 'PHNOM PENH: For many people, doodling is a fun way to pass time or release some hidden creativity.\nBut for Visoth Kakvei, it is something to be taken seriously.\nThe 27-year-old’s incredibly intricate drawings and digitally popping creations depicting animals, nature and galaxies have taken the Internet by storm.\nHe now has nearly one million followers on Instagram, an enormous audience for his highly shareable works of precision, mostly done free hand.\nVisoth says his Cambodian home and upbringing in Kandal was the spark of inspiration that began his artistic journey.\n“Most of my artworks are inspired by nature, wildlife and everyday stuff,” he said in an email interview with Channel NewsAsia.\n“I loved drawing since I was very young like other kids do. But I managed to maintain the talent because I practiced most of the time after school and after helping my farming family.\n“I\'m so attached to nature because when I was younger I spent most of the time at the farm with my parents growing rice and vegetables. And we had to pass by the jungle to reach our farm.""\nNow based in Maine in the US, Visoth has been building a dedicated collection of fans from around the world. In particular though, he wants to encourage other Cambodians to turn their everyday into something magical.\n“We live in this world to inspire and to be inspired to be better. And I\'m glad to be one to inspire people – my fellow artist fans around the globe as well my Cambodian compatriots.”\nIn his Instagram videos, Visoth can often be seen using the world around him in Maine as new canvasses, including snowfields and ice-covered lakes. He is also now experimenting with 3D technology to make his doodles come to life.\n“Sometimes I go outside and I see stuff around me, it inspires and gives me lots of ideas as well to do the work.,” he said.\n“When you\'re excited about doing one thing, it means you love it and you\'ll get it done passionately and productively.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     Cambodia ', '     Instagram ']}"

      Typewriting the future: A dying art in a changing city
  </h1>, 'text': 'YANGON: The tapping of keys is a familiar sound ringing through the old downtown streets of Yangon.\nMostly older typists sit on small enclaves in crumbling colonial buildings and on street corners under colourful umbrellas, their fingers a fury of precision. Using typewriters often older than themselves, they write up the likes of bonds, marriage certificates, and visa letters.\nIn Myanmar’s biggest city, it has been like this for decades.\n\n\nWhile this type of technology was being phased out of operation in most parts of the world in the last millennium, the hardy typewriters and their dedicated operators remain a symbolic throwback to a bygone era.\nAfter a prolonged stretch of military rule, Myanmar became a pariah state, which meant modern technology was almost completely inaccessible or prohibitively expensive. In lieu of the introduction of computers, typewriters used since colonial times were maintained.\nWai Wai Thaung is one of the younger masters of the craft on Bar Street in downtown Yangon. She describes how she first learned to type from her family.\n“Since my childhood I am used to doing this work. My Dad and Aunty were doing it and I also had to help them. So I became skilful,” she said, while perched on a wooden stall in the business she now runs with her husband.\n“It’s sure that the typewriters are going to disappear in the future. The computers will replace them,” she said.\n“The computer is a modern machine. It’s easy to use and it’s appropriate for the modern age. To use the typewriter, you need to seriously learn its basic functions and it’s not so easy.\n“Why I keep using the typewriter is just to preserve the legacy of my parents.”\nIt is a rare moment of sentimentality on these streets.\n""I love it,” he says while demonstrating how to explore the inner workings of an old mimeograph machine, the precursor to photocopiers.\n“The number of people who can fix typewriters is decreasing. Most of them are old and many of them have died,” he said. “But the business is decreasing.”\n“This could be the last generation that has these techniques. The youth are just interested in computers.”\n“At the moment I don’t have any time to think about the future. I just need to keep on doing this for my daily survival.”\n“Lots of people don’t think about these things, or the value,” he said. He has lived in the same downtown home since 1968 and has watched generational change occur, transitions made more dramatic by the country’s turbulent politics over the decades.\nBusinesses have changed hands, neighbours have passed away or moved on and national leaders have risen and fallen. When the typewriter goes, while Yangon’s core may not carry the same mechanical whirring of the past, its purveyors will find new ways to move with the times.\n“In Myanmar we don’t have a lot of sentimental value,” he said. “If it’s gone, it’s gone. Let it be.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     business ', '     art ', '     Yangon ', '     Myanmar ', '     Mandalay ']}"

      ASIA'S FUTURE CITIES: Manila residents feel the squeeze as city modernises
  </h1>, 'text': 'MANILA: Roaring up in front of the National Housing Authority, thousands of protestors completely block off traffic as they shout their demands. Dozens of police officers stand by, controlling the mob while standing in formation, batons on standby but not required.\nMany of the demonstrators – most of whom are women – are angry; others seem bemused by the spectacle that they find themselves part of.\nThis is a mobilisation of the urban poor – there is no shortage of them in Metro Manila, as land prices continue soar and with it the number of informal settlers.\nThey have brought a fight of desperation to the street.\nMany of these communities have been established for years in so-called danger zones in the metro – along polluted canals, near garbage dumps, along shorelines or anywhere that can provide some refuge for society’s poorest.\nThey have also occupied highly valuable land – both public and private – in parts of Metro Manila ripe for development. As a result, demolition of these “squatter colonies” happens regularly, in the name of progress. What comes in their place are normally mega malls and condominiums.\n“The high rise construction is happening left and right. Whenever you see one, you will just imagine there have been people who have been displaced,” said Prof Hazel Dizon, an expert of urban landscapes from the University of the Philippines Diliman.\n“This has been happening at a faster rate. In a way it’s a paradox because you are building condominiums but then you are displacing people.”\nIn 2010, the Metro Development Authority estimated there were 2.8 million informal settlers, out of a population of 11.9 million. Both figures are expected to have accelerated sharply since then.\nIt is a situation she says is unacceptable.\n“In the relocation site, there’s no food. Children steal food from others; most of the relocated people do that, that’s how they survive,” she said at the protest.\n“You will steal from your own neighbour so that you have something to eat.”\nThe problems there are “classic” – a lack of services and opportunities, which in turn force people to return to wherever they came from to seek employment. It is an unhealthy cycle Manila has to contend with.\n“If you’re going to resettle people you have to do it complete with the public utilities, electricity and water, school and hospitals and of course employment because that’s the main reason they were here in the first place,” Prof Dizon said.\n“You’re always playing catch up to a problem that should have been solved by thinking ahead,” he said. “Modernity is relative – we need to address just the basics first because once you address the basics you build a city that can accommodate equally.”\nThe government, however, is studying a proposal to create a city planning commission that would look into the feasibility of mass in-city housing projects for the urban poor.\nIt is what many evictees want – and possibly precisely what Manila needs.\n‘WE’RE NOT GETTING MORE SPACE’\nThe idea has the support of the Heritage Conservation Society (HCS). The organisation’s president Mark Evidente believes such a concept would actually drive revenues for local government units and ensure that gentrification does not price out the very people who need housing the most.\nHCS is also leading efforts to restore “value” in older parts of the city, which are often being used by informal settlers and seen as derelict. This type of privately owned land becomes a prime target for developers.\n“All of these are at risk because land values are increasing and the home owner can derive much more from building a 50-storey condo on top of it,” said Mark Evidente, the organisation’s president.\n“The owner himself would find it very hard to say no to a deal. Heritage becomes a very difficult proposition to protect.”\n“If you lose your heritage structures, what makes your city or town different from the next one? If we manage to save our heritage structures then we can tell a story about our towns,” he said.\nThey are not the only ones trying to change the narrative. There is a growing movement to reclaim spaces to be used or enjoyed by the public. And art is central to the idea of a more sustainable future.\n“Creative projects are very important in urban life, not just as a source of inspiration but also they add to our quality of life.”\nShe is leading a project to regenerate Pasig River, a major artery through Metro Manila that was traditionally a transport route and water source, but has become heavily polluted and neglected.\nIn a similar way, the artist-run space 98B COLLABoratory has set up its operations in the old downtown district of Escolta, an area that is rundown but slowly being revived by such alternate ventures.\nThe group’s executive director Marika Constantino believes they have the power to reach local residents, rather than push them away as the area gentrifies. “Accessibility is very important – the common misconception is that art is for the educated or the elite. We try and create projects that can engage the wider population,” she said.\n\n\nWhen engaged, public restoration projects have already been proven to work in some residential areas. In Estero de Paco, a canal of “dark grime and filth” where “the stench of water sticks to your skin” has been transformed into a leafy waterside recreation area for local residents.\n“River warriors”, a group of locals who clean up the small river daily are proud of their local environment, while others enjoy community gardens.\nWhile the situation may not be perfect, it is something tangible for a poorer community to build upon. For them, it is far more valuable than any number of new malls.\n', 'related_topics': ['     art ', '     space ', '     Manila ']}"
