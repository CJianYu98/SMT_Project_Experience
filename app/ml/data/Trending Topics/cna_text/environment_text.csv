      ‘I will die too’: What’s at stake in India’s reliance on coal power
  </h1>, 'text': 'JHARKHAND, India: In Dhanbad city, otherwise known as India’s coal capital, 13-year-old Gauri Kumari’s family depends on the black fuel she collects each day to survive.\nIt is a hard life for the teenager, who lives in one of the squatter colonies surrounding the coal mines.\nAt 8 p.m. daily, she heads out to the mines and returns between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. Barely four hours later, she wakes up to gather coal again before attending school. After returning from school at about 1 p.m., she makes a third round before her tuition classes.\nThe coal is later sold to traders. And if she cannot collect any owing to police presence or guards at the mines or owing to rain, the family must depend on the few rupees her mother earns from making samosas.\n“My mother cooks rice but without any vegetables. Sometimes we just eat plain rice and sleep,” said Gauri, whose father is incapacitated by a fall.\nTrips to the mines are risky. “If we’re caught by police, they tell us not to repeat the act and scold us,” she said.\n“We tell them we won’t be able to eat if we don’t do that. They say they don’t care whether we eat or not.”\nIn the Jharia subdivision of Dhanbad, mother-of-five Ruby lost her husband last year.\nRanjeet, who died aged 40 from tuberculosis, had also depended on coal for a living — either by filling coal trucks or stealing coal to sell to traders for 50 to 100 rupees (S$0.90 to S$1.80) a day.\nIt is now up to 35-year-old Ruby, who goes by one name, to collect and sell coal.\n“I go at 4 am to collect coal. Security guards make us run. I carry coal baskets on my head and sell the coal in the lanes,” she told the CNA programme Insight.\n“All my relatives are dead … My father, brother and mother — everyone,” she added. “I suffer from chills and am weak. I will die too.”\nFor Ruby and Gauri, coal is both a short-term lifeline and a potential killer. They are caught between a rock and a hard place, and their situation highlights the tension and challenges that India faces in phasing down coal.\nCoal is the single biggest source of man-made climate change, contributing more than 40 per cent of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.\nAlthough India consumes less coal than China, it derives a bigger proportion of its energy from the dirtiest fossil fuel (about 70 per cent, compared to China’s 57 per cent).\nThe lesser ambition of phasing down — instead of phasing out — coal stirred controversy at the recent United Nations climate conference, or COP26, in Glasgow.\nIndia and China had pushed for a watered-down pledge, dealing a blow to the Glasgow Climate Pact and efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\nVarious experts have since argued, however, that India was not the climate villain. Although the country of 1.3 billion people is the world’s third-largest emitter after China and the United States, its per capita emissions are lower than many countries.\nRich nations, which account for the bulk of historical emissions, have also failed to deliver climate finance to poorer countries, experts noted. This includes the US$100 billion (S$134 billion) per year they committed, in 2009, to less developed nations by 2020.\nFor its part, India must sustain economic growth to pull more people out of poverty, said Narendra Taneja, an energy expert and spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. To do so, it needs energy.\nGiven the country’s rich coal reserves, relying on the fuel also offers energy security, he said.\n“Look at, for instance, oil — 86 per cent of the total requirement is imported,” he noted. “Fifty-six per cent of our natural gas is imported … Quite a bit of uranium is imported. Even solar power — 90 per cent of equipment is imported, mostly from China.\n“The only source of fuel that gives us absolute confidence and 100 per cent energy security is coal, because coal is in our own ground.”\nScientists have said global emissions must peak as soon as possible to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and he agreed that India must “fast-track” the transition to renewables “for the health of our people, our children, our grandchildren”.\nHe believes India can reach its net-zero target sooner than 2070 — the timeline pledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP26 — although Taneja argued that India “can’t suddenly say goodbye to coal”.\n“If we switch overnight, millions will go back to poverty,” he said.\nA study published last year estimated that 3.6 million people are directly or indirectly employed in the coal mining and power sectors in 159 districts in the country. State-owned Coal India is also the world’s largest coal-mining company.\nBut the condition of coal workers “hasn’t improved much” in recent years, observed Bir Bhadar Singh, the vice-president of the Dhanbad Colliery Workers’ Union. Work conditions and facilities were even better 10 years ago, he said.\nDespite this, he thinks workers would be worse off if coal mining is stopped.\n“If the government can’t give jobs to educated people, how will it give employment to uneducated people or temporary workers who earn their living through coal mining?” he questioned. “If coal mining is stopped, their condition will become more critical.”\nAlthough his home state of Jharkhand in eastern India is resource-rich, it is one of the poorest. Most of the coal-producing states are poor, noted Harjeet Singh, global director of engagement and partnerships at the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative.\nAnd while it may be a cheap way to produce electricity, the mining and burning of coal exacts a huge human and environmental cost.\n“Most of the energy or electricity that gets produced goes to the manufacturing sector as well as cities, and people who are into coal extraction are facing the brunt,” said the climate adviser.\n“They’re subsidising the production, and they’re the ones who are paying (with) their lives because they live in very high pollution situations.”\nThere are high levels of coal dust in mining areas, which accumulates in the lungs of people who live and work there, said Vikas Kumar Rana of the district hospital in Dhanbad.\n“The dust will cause bronchial asthma and allergic bronchitis. Later, it’ll lead to bronchial cancer,” said the doctor, who sees “many children” who suffer from allergic bronchitis.\nHe added, however, that the government provides help even to casual workers in the mining industry.\nA village health worker can provide medicine to those who need it; if their condition is serious, an ambulance will take them to the medical college or government hospital for free treatment, he said.\nAir pollution claims well over a million lives in India each year.\nIt killed 1.67 million people in 2019, with economic losses from the premature deaths and morbidity amounting to US$36.8 billion, or 1.36 per cent of India’s gross domestic product, according to a 2020 report in The Lancet Planetary Health journal.\nIn the capital, New Delhi, sportswoman Chanchal Yadav began wearing double masks long before COVID-19 surfaced. After moving there in 2016 to continue her training in shooting, she developed allergies and headaches from the choking pollution in winter.\nThis affected her sporting performance. To cope with the symptoms, the 23-year-old takes medication and anti-allergens and uses saline spray. Doctors have even advised her to leave Delhi to get her health back.\nAir pollution makes a move away from coal power needed even more, but the problem is “complex”, said Navroz Dubash, a professor at Indian think-tank Centre for Policy Research.\nIt is also a problem of transport emissions, construction dust as well as biomass burning for cooking and crop clearing, he cited.\nDistant net-zero targets aside, he said India and other countries must act sooner to cut emissions.\nWATCH: India’s coal addiction (46:58)\n“If we don’t take substantial action in the next 10 years, then you can say goodbye to net zero down the road,” said Dubash, who is also an adjunct senior research fellow at Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.\nThe Indian government should provide coal-dependent regions with resources and programmes to make the energy transition, and support workers in coal-related sectors to minimise socio-economic disruption, the experts said.\nIndia’s coal dependence, however, should not obscure its rapid renewable energy deployment. Modi pledged at COP26 that India will meet half its energy requirements with renewables by 2030 and increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by then.\nSolar power entrepreneur Amol Anand and electric scooter maker Kshitij Kumar are perhaps the faces of India’s energy future. Anand, 33, co-founded Loom Solar in 2018, and the company now employs 100 people and produces 80,000 solar panels a year.\nKumar, 44, is the co-founder of Goreen E-Mobility, which now makes 30,000 e-scooters a year.\nWhat is notable to him is that smaller towns are embracing electric vehicles, and besides Delhi, the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh is also driving vehicle sales.\n“We’re seeing a lot of traction in the rural markets… so the transition is happening,” he said.\nEven coal scavenger Gauri can see a life beyond the coal pits. “When COVID-19 hit the nation, doctors saved the lives of so many patients,” she said. “I want to study and become … like them.”\nWatch this episode of Insight here.

      Paris starts building 'Triangle' tower despite green opposition
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Construction of a 42-floor, pyramid-shaped skyscraper began in Paris on Thursday (Feb 10) despite objections from local politicians and associations\xa0and environmentalists who have branded the project ""catastrophic"".\nThe Triangle Tower (Tour Triangle) in the 15th district on the city\'s south-western edge will, at 180m, become the city\'s third-highest building after the Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, and the Montparnasse Tower, which opened in 1973.\nHigh-rise additions are rare in the inner city limits of the French capital, which prides itself on keeping its historic character intact in the face of rampant development elsewhere.\nDesigned by Swiss architects Herzog and Meuron, the Triangle Tower -\xa0which is to resemble a giant wedge of Toblerone chocolate -\xa0is to be completed in 2026 at a cost of €660 million (US$755 million), according to developers Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW).\nThe plan for the skyscraper was first launched in 2008 and then approved in 2015 by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo against resistance from her Green party allies in city hall.\nHidalgo, who is standing for the Socialists in April\'s French presidential election, has tried to burnish her credentials as an environmental campaigner, decreasing traffic congestion in the city and favouring clean transport, especially bicycles.\nThe conservative mayor of the 15th district, Philippe Goujon, is also against the project, telling AFP that ""the neighbourhood will be devastated for several years"".\nAlready, he said, there was a constant flow of trucks and ""four giant cranes"" had been deployed.\nThe city\'s Green legislators have denounced the tower as a ""climatic aberration"" that should be abandoned because of its ""catastrophic carbon footprint"".\nParis prosecutors opened an investigation last June into possible favouritism over the lease of the land on which the tower is being built, following legal complaints from several associations fighting the project.\n""How can you justify building a tower made of glass and steel, which needs huge amounts of energy, with 70,000 square metres of office space, in Paris -\xa0a city that is already overflowing with offices?"" the association ""Collectif Contre La Tour Triangle"" said.\nThe lease runs for 80 years and URW has agreed to pay city hall €2 million per year for its duration.\nSome two thirds of the tower\'s 91,000 square metres are to be used for office space, and there will also be a 130-room hotel, a childcare unit and shops.\nURW, which also runs flagship shopping complex Les Halles in the heart of the city, has said that the building could be repurposed in the future as needs changed and that its carbon footprint was low.\nFeeling the financial pain from two years of COVID-19\xa0restrictions, URW reduced its share in the operation to 30 per cent and brought in insurer Axa to share the cost.\nStock market investors welcomed Thurday\'s building start, with URW stock rising nearly six per cent on the Paris bourse.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Paris ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: South China Sea may run out of fish at this rate of overfishing
  </h1>, 'text': 'ATLANTA, Georgia: With US and Chinese warships increasingly playing chicken, and China transforming atolls and outcroppings into militarised artificial islands, the South China Sea presents a striking picture of Sino-American strategic competition.\nBut China’s expansive assertion of offshore sovereignty is not only challenging others’ territorial rights and free navigation of international sea lanes. It also is threatening a central feature of the Southeast Asian ecosystem, and thus the region’s economic future.\nChina has refused to submit its territorial claims to international review, even though six of the 10\xa0countries surrounding the South China Sea have claims to various rocks, shoals, reefs, and resources.\nChina also has ignored the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s (PCA) 2016 ruling affirming the Philippines’ historic rights to the Spratly Islands and dismissing China’s outsized claim to some 90 per cent of the South China Sea (based on the so-called nine-dash line).\nFor Southeast Asia’s 600 million people, the territorial crisis in the South China Sea is not some distant future concern. China’s actions already are harming the region’s maritime ecosystems and livelihoods.\nThat is the key lesson of the book Dispatches from the South China Sea: Navigating to Common Ground, by James Borton of the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute.\nPutting aside geopolitics considerations, Borton focuses on the ground truth: Chinese exploitation of the South China Sea is threatening the region’s future through the ecological, environmental, and economic damage that it is causing.\nFishing is at the heart of Borton’s tale. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 15 to 56 per cent (depending on the country) of all animal protein consumed in Southeast Asia comes from the neighbouring seas. And the global market reflects this bounty.\nThough it accounts for only 2.5 per cent of the planet’s ocean surface area, the South China Sea produces 12 per cent of the world’s fish catch. According to Borton, half of the world’s 3.2 million registered fishing boats operate there.\nWhile overfishing is a growing global problem, China clearly contributes to it disproportionately with its long-distance fishing fleet of 2,500 ships (a number that rises to 17,000 if one counts unregistered and illegal vessels).\nBorton marshals first-hand accounts from fishers, officials, and researchers to show how the South China Sea’s vital resources are being degraded.\nAround 2,500 species of fish inhabit its waters, but since 2000, catch rates have declined by 70 per cent, and large fish stocks have shrunk by 90 per cent.\nFor years, China has unilaterally declared fishing bans, supposedly to protect fish stocks. And in 2021, it adopted a new law empowering its coast guard to use force against alleged violators from neighbouring countries.\nAnd yet, while China’s maritime militia has driven other countries’ boats elsewhere, Chinese fishing operations in the world’s proscribed zones have continued, such that China alone hauls in 20 per cent of the world’s annual catch.\nThe ecological effects of China’s island-building are no less troubling. The South China Sea was once home to one-third of the world’s coral reefs, but according to Borton, around half have already been lost.\nCoral reefs around the world are being degraded by the effects of climate change. But as the PCA noted in its 2016 ruling, China has accelerated this destruction in the South China Sea, by dredging up more than 100 square miles of healthy coral reefs to create artificial islands.\nBorton sees the failure to resolve the South China Sea crisis as a harbinger of ecological disaster. Highlighting the work of scientists, researchers, and concerned officials, he helps us understand the nature of the challenge and its possible solutions.\n“Just as the current pandemic requires a collaborative approach, the South China Sea requires scientific cooperation … and open access to data,” he writes. “Science diplomacy can establish … a starting point for regional cooperation” and “a much-needed pause in rising tension.”\nUnfortunately, the Chinese government’s failure to do any of these things during the global COVID crisis is a harbinger as well. It has refused to provide basic information about the ecological impact of its island building, even as it expands its territorial claims elsewhere in Asia.\nAnd its strong-armed tactics and steady militarisation of its newly created offshore real estate hardly suggest that it intends to share data, much less play a constructive role in preserving the region’s ecosystems.\nBorton is certainly correct that citizens and scientists ought to collaborate to find ways to bridge the political divide in the South China Sea. But, given China’s intransigence, businesses may be better positioned than governments to take the steps he proposes.\nFrom start-ups to technology giants, the private sector is creating new tools that will shed more light on the situation. Satellite systems and artificial intelligence are already being used to collect and analyse massive amounts of climate data for clients and researchers.\nMicrosoft, Google, and Amazon are gathering and publishing more climate data, and business leaders like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink are pushing companies to align their operations with the global climate agenda.\nBut while Borton has offered a clear overview of the crisis in the South China Sea, comprehending the problem is no guarantee that those with the means to address it will take up the challenge.\nKent Harrington, a former senior CIA analyst, served as national intelligence officer for East Asia, chief of station in Asia, and the CIA’s director of public affairs.

For instance, about half of those surveyed thought that soft toys and Styrofoam items could be recycled.\nThe survey also found that 72 per cent were not aware that households did not need to sort their recyclables before depositing them into the blue recycling bins or recycling chutes.\n""To make recycling more convenient for households, Singapore has a single-stream recyclables collection system where households can place four types of recyclables – paper, plastic, glass and metal – into recycling bins and recycling chutes,"" said NEA.\n""This not only saves on the effort for households to segregate recyclables at home, but also reduces the carbon footprint of collecting recyclables, when compared to the multiple truck trips needed for the separate collection of different recyclable streams.""\nThe agency noted that if Singapore does not reduce waste generation, Semakau Landfill is expected to be full by 2035 given the country\'s current rate of waste disposal.\n""Through recycling, we can not only divert waste from Semakau Landfill, but can also turn trash into treasure and close the resource loop as part of a circular economy.""\nCurrently, all HDB blocks have one recycling bin per block or a recycling chute, while landed houses each have a dedicated recycling bin.\xa0\nAt condominiums and private apartments, one recycling bin is also provided for each residential block. These bins, as well as the dedicated recyclables collection trucks, are all coloured blue to differentiate them from the general waste bins and the refuse collection trucks.\nThis year\'s recycling campaign will introduce a new recycling mascot named Bloobin - a disgruntled blue recycling bin ""frustrated by the years of contamination, and on a mission to educate the public on how to recycle right"".\n""20 years ago, Bloobin started out as a dreamer full of hope. He believed that when everyone banded together to recycle, we could create a greener Singapore with less waste sent to Semakau Landfill,"" reads Bloobin\'s origin story.\n""Over the years, however, Bloobin felt that Singapore’s recycling rate showed insufficient improvement. And he became increasingly frustrated, due to constant bin contamination … and it was breaking his heart. People had been treating the blue recycling bins as trash bins and he has finally had enough of the years of abuse and misuse!\xa0\n""So Bloobin is now on a mission to get everyone to recycle right, which will help increase recycling rates and extend the lifespan of Semakau Landfill.""\nBloobin stickers at general waste and recycling chutes at public housing developments will serve as a ""last-mile reminder"" to nudge households to check their items before appropriately disposing of them as general waste or recyclables, said NEA.\nTo nurture proper recycling habits, interactive educational resources such as an e-activity book for pre-schoolers and e-games for older students will be made available.\xa0\nAn Inter-Institutes of Higher Learning challenge - Ready, Set, Recycle - will be launched to mobilise youth to take action for recycling and develop deeper and more meaningful engagement programmes.\nOn Friday, NEA said it is collaborating with the community, non-Governmental organisations, corporate and industry partners to encourage the public to recycle more and recycle right, and to explore and implement new methods of making recycling convenient in neighbourhoods and homes.\nIt will also work with local Public Waste Collectors to distribute a recycling receptacle to each household in 2022 in a bid to nudge households to step up their recycling efforts.\nMore details will be announced at a later stage, said the agency.\nNEA highlighted an ongoing trial of using transparent recycling bins at Hong Kah North Single Member Constituency and East Coast Group Representative Constituency to facilitate an intuitive and informed recycling process amongst the public.\xa0\n""The establishment of a Producer Responsibility Scheme for regulated e-waste on Jul 1, 2021, resulted as well in the setting up of dedicated e-waste bins around the island and the scheduling of e-waste collection drives at housing estates, making the recycling of such waste more convenient,"" it said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     NEA ', '     National Environment Agency ', '     Recycling ', '     environment ']}"

      Mass fish deaths in West Sumatra’s Lake Maninjau point to extreme weather and overfishing
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Thousands of fish have died in the past few weeks in\xa0Indonesia\'s\xa0Lake Maninjau, West Sumatra, highlighting both the environmental as well as human factors in contributing to the decade-old problem.\nIn December, more than 1,700 tonnes of fish were found dead in the lake located about 115 km\xa0from West Sumatra’s provincial capital of Padang, said authorities.\nMr Handria Asmi, head of Tanjung Raya sub-district where the picturesque lake lies said that unexpected extreme weather due to climate change could be one of the causes of the mass fish deaths.\n“From November to February we always experience extreme weather in Tanjung Raya,\xa0 namely strong winds and heavy rainfalls which cause occasional landslides and fish deaths.\n“The death of this fish occurs if the wind reaches the lake, reversing the mass of the water,” Mr Asmi told CNA.\xa0When the mass of the water is reversed, denser water rises to the top.\nHowever, Mr Asmi said that recent research conducted by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences shows that extreme weather may not be the main reason for the phenomenon.\nHe said that human activities including overfishing and overfeeding in the lake causing water pollution, could also contribute to the fish deaths.\n“Today, our lake is polluted, one of which is because it is contaminated with fish food. When the wind is strong, the fish food is turned upside down, so the oxygen in the water is reduced and the fish of course lacks oxygen,” said Mr Asmi.\nBesides, Lake Maninjau is also a volcanic lake and the presence of sulphur contributes to the fish deaths as well, he added.\nLocal authorities had taken steps to prevent the recurrence of the problem, including by coming up with stricter regulations on fishing activities in the lake.\nExperts who spoke to CNA believed that if no immediate concrete action is taken to resolve the problem, incidents of mass fish death would continue and cause damage to the environment.\nMass fish deaths became a recurring problem\xa0in Lake Maninjau more than a decade ago when there was an increase in fishing activities, especially fish farming involving floating net cages.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nMr Tommy Adam, head of advocacy of WALHI, an environmental non-governmental organisation for West Sumatra, said that locals living near Lake Maninjau who used to be rice farmers switched to fishing in the early 1990s.\nMany of them used floating net cages to grow and harvest their fish.\xa0\n“They were quite successful because they could catch massive numbers of Nile tilapia and other tilapia fish,” said Mr Adam.\nHe noted that there are about 27,000 fish cages on the lake while the standard regulation allows for about 7,000 cages only given the size of Lake Maninjau is 99.5 sq km.\nAttempts by the local authorities to regulate the use of this method of fish farming have not been successful as many locals depend on fishing for their livelihood.\nAmong the regulations often flouted by the fish farmers is the need for them to restrict the number of floating net cages they can use per fishing zone. This is to prevent them from flocking in one particular area and hence avoid overfishing there.\xa0\nMr Adam said that Lake Maninjau is also a caldera lake formed by volcanic eruption and contains sulphur which is toxic to fish which can worsen the problem of overfishing.\xa0\n“The marine climate in Lake Maninjau where the wind is quite strong at night, causes the water mass to rise to the top which in oceanography is called upwelling.\n""When that happens sulphur and fish waste will go up as a result of massive fishing and suffocate the fishes due to a lack of oxygen,” he added.\xa0\xa0\n“Upwelling and downwelling are common there but the situation is exacerbated by climate change. Now we cannot predict the weather, suddenly there is heavy rain, suddenly there are strong winds,” noted Mr Adam.\nAccording to Mr Adam, in the past the authorities could predict the weather, so they could alert the fish farmers when to harvest their fish before the strong winds occur.\n\xa0“There used to be boards with such signs alerting them but now I think climate change has affected the local weather, so we cannot predict it anymore,” he said.\nWith overfishing, it further aggravated the whole situation, he added.\nProfessor Hafrijal Syandri, a fisheries expert from Padang’s Bung Hatta University agrees.\nHe believes that apart from overfishing, mass fish deaths only happen if there is extremely bad weather.\nProf Syandri last visited the lake earlier January this year and found no mass fish death, presumably because the weather has been good.\n“I went there a few days ago, and there were people who were already spreading new seeds.\n“So, to them, the mass fish death is not a problem. They already know there will be mass fish death from November onwards, it is only us who make a fuss,” he said.\nProf Syandri noted that although the local people there do not think they suffered a major loss from the mass fish deaths, it is still a problem.\n“When more than 1,000 tonnes of fish die, where should the carcasses be disposed of,” he asked.\xa0\nBut leaving the dead fish in the lake would also affect the environment as it harmed the water quality and left a bad smell there.\xa0\n“The lake used to be a tourist destination, nowadays not anymore because it stinks,” added Prof Syandri who said that when he last visited the lake the carcasses of the dead fish were still left floating on the surface.\nFish farmer\xa0Fajri, who goes by one name, told CNA that he did not suffer major losses overall and that the mass fish death is not a problem from his perspective.\xa0\nThe 31-year-old explained that he has about 12 floating net cages and what he needed to spend on was to buy fish seeds and fish food some time back.\xa0\nIt usually takes about three and a half months to breed and harvest the fish.\nHowever, he\xa0admitted that there were minor losses on the days when the fish died as this affected his daily income.\n“This is a natural law. If there is fish left, that is our fortune,” said Mr Fajri who has been in fish farming for six years.\nHe pointed out that fish farms play an important role in the local economic chain as many are dependent on them.\nThe local community head acknowledges that while there is environmental impact arising from such incidents, the economic aspect of the problem should not be neglected too.\n“Without the economy, the environment also cannot be saved,” Mr Fajri claimed. \nHe added that this issue is all the more significant as 70 per cent of the people in Tanjung Raya who live near Lake Maninjau are economically dependent on the lake.\nMr Edi Netrial, head of fishery cultivation in the fishery and food security department of Agam district, the district overseeing Lake Maninjau told CNA that incidents of mass fish deaths have been happening almost every year since 2011.\n“But usually it’s not as much as this time. Sometimes it was 50 tonnes, while now it is\xa0 even over 1,000 tonnes,” said Mr Netrial, adding that the losses could amount to billions of rupiah.\nHe said local authorities have tried to put an end to the problem by introducing regulations to reduce overfishing and also by encouraging fish farmers to switch to other sources of livelihood.\nSo far the efforts have not been successful.\n“They are not responsive to our requests. They think what they are doing is not a problem since they are not complaining,” Mr Netrial said.\nMr Tommy Adam, the environmentalist with WALHI, said the local government needs to help the fish farmers change to other jobs.\xa0\n“There must be an alternative economy for the people because the regulations are there already. What is now important is for the government to help those who want to switch jobs, by providing them jobs in agriculture, plantation or non-timber forestry,” said Mr Adam.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     overfishing ', '     climate change ']}"

      What can these remote Scottish islands teach Southeast Asia about clean energy?
  </h1>, 'text': ""KIRKWALL, UK: Henny Gunawan and Agung Iswadi could hardly be further from home. The two Jakartans don winter jackets standing outside the International Centre For Island Technology in Orkney, an archipelago in the far north of Scotland.\xa0\nThe skies are turbulent over this part of the world and the winter comes early. Powerful gales sweep across the island for most of the year, whipping up daunting swells in the surrounding Atlantic Ocean, which pound the western shorelines.\nThis is a very different island life to what these PhD students know. Both are here to fast track their levels of expertise in the renewable energy sector with the specific ambition of taking that knowledge back home.\nThey are in the right place then.\xa0\nOrkney, notwithstanding its small population of around 22,000 and geographic isolation, has become a global centre for clean energy technology, a literal playing ground for experimenting with the next wave of solutions for the world.\nWith more than 650 wind turbines and about 400 solar panels installed, the islands can generate more than 130 per cent of their energy needs, with the capacity to sell any excess back to the UK mainland.\nFor decades, a spirit of endeavour and a need for resilience has emboldened Orcadians to try and harness the elements around them. The result is the archipelago becoming a magnet for companies, startups and initiatives looking at the skies and into the deep for solutions.“This is like a living laboratory for us. Maybe like a miniature Indonesia, as an island nation. We can learn many things from here,” Iswadi said.\n“I think if Orkney can do it, maybe Indonesia can do it even better. We have much potential in Indonesia, especially from the ocean.”\nIt was Iswadi who\xa0recently greeted a delegation from the Indonesian government visiting Orkney to see firsthand the ways renewable energy was transforming the local economy, around the time of the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow in November.That visit was another signal of the interest in Orkney from governments, academics and enterprises in Southeast Asia.\nTHE POWER OF THE OCEAN\nWave and tidal energy are being developed in the waters around Orkney, two fledgling technologies that could have vast potential in different environments.\nMocean Energy has recently completed a round of testing on its pioneering Blue X device, a 20-metre long, 38-tonne prototype that can generate energy using the power of the ocean swell.\n“Marine renewables is a growing field. There's a lot of uses globally for wave power and it’s estimated that wave power could produce up to 15 per cent of the global energy demand,” said Yan Gunawardena, Mocean’s operations manager.\nIn 2022, it is planned for the device to be redeployed and connected to a subsea battery, which will be used to power a remotely operated autonomous underwater vehicle. At this stage, it could help provide energy for offshore oil and gas operators. “Our technology is still in its infancy. We want to try to scale up from a device we currently have,” Gunawardena said.\n“The Blue X is our first device and this scale is really designed for off grid offshore and subsea applications. The same technology can then be scaled up to produce grid scale power.”\n“We want to make a device about 40 metres long which weighs 300 tonnes. So it's the next next step and we need to get investment to do that,” he said.Meantime, another company, Orbital Energy, has launched an even larger project, which attempts to harness the immense potential of the forceful tides that flow around these northern islands.Over the next 15 years, Orbital’s 72-metre long O2 tidal turbine is expected to produce capacity for clean and predictable power for 2,000 homes, and is also involved a project to generate green hydrogen using an onshore electrolyser.\nAs the tides can be easily predicted, unlike wind or solar energy applications, there is great hope in this technology becoming a potentially valuable addition to energy mixes. With its vast maritime resources, adopting similar technologies could come into play in Southeast Asia in coming years.\xa0\nLOCAL BENEFITSFor his PhD, Iswadi is looking at the technological challenges of marine energy in tropical waters, while Gunawan is focused on the financing of renewable energy, especially in eastern Indonesia where electricity access is uneven and under-resourced. Aside from them, Orkney-based operations already have a foothold in Southeast Asia. Aquatera is a local business providing environmental expertise and operational support for many new clean energy ventures and research.\nIts director, Ian Johnstone, said he thinks the knowledge that has been developed for years in this part of Scotland is ready to be applied across the globe, a situation made more urgent by climate change.\n“The expertise that we've built up and the lessons we've learned from deploying devices, installing devices, and then learning how to integrate devices into an energy system is incredibly valuable to be taken to other places,” he said.\n“We've been all across Indonesia, looking at projects and working with regencies. It’s the same in the Philippines where we've got very good connections.\n“With thousands upon thousands of islands, I think we see this potential and also the drivers of climate change.”As well as Aquatera, Johnstone has been involved with a local initiative to try and better manage the excess electricity being generated across Orkney. For now, many local residents are not getting direct benefits from clean electricity and household bills remain high.Additionally, grid capacity issues - the power cable back to the mainland gets overloaded - mean that sometimes wind turbines need to be switched off, which Johnstone described as a “terrible waste”.\n“We can still produce more than we can use, so we need to move the energy around. So when the wind is blowing flat out, then we want to be filling batteries or producing hydrogen. These are two ways that we saw to store energy,” he said.\nSeveral community-owned wind farms are helping to provide direct funds to local projects, such as public transport, affordable housing and loan repayments.\xa0\n“All that money can feed back into the community so that they can either look to invest in their own projects, or they can look at different projects to help reduce their energy requirements or invest in more renewable projects on their own scale,” said David Hannon, the strategic project manager for Orkney Islands Council.\nGetting buy-in from locals is an area that Orkney has been an area of success, but a hurdle elsewhere where the experience of renewable energy is less mature.The council is active in promoting electric vehicles and a program to convert excess electricity into hydrogen, which can be used to drive\xa0vehicles and provide auxiliary power to ships in dock.“We also are looking into other projects where we could have ferries that are running on hydrogen. So we are very much looking at all the different aspects of hydrogen that could be utilised; we have transport, we have storage, and we have heating,” Hannon said.\nHYPE FROM HYDROGENHydrogen is also a focus of the European Marine Research Centre (EMEC), which for years has been trialling new technologies and providing a testbed for other companies.It sees hydrogen as one of the key ways of integrating power that would otherwise be wasted and decarbonising fossil-fuel heavy industries, like shipping and aviation. “We think, if the wind is always blowing, the waves are always high, the tide is reliable, there's an immense resource there that we can't yet take advantage of. So we look at hydrogen as a means of storing power,” said James Walker, EMEC’s hydrogen development manager.“And then we can use that hydrogen at a later date to tackle some of the key sectors that are otherwise quite difficult to decarbonise.\xa0\n“Particularly international long distance shipping, it's difficult to see an electrified alternative that will address that energy need. Similarly, it's very difficult to look at a battery operated plane crossing the Atlantic or going from here to Singapore, for example. And in that instance, we need to think about alternatives,” Walker said.\nEverything in this closed loop “living lab” is designed to be replicated elsewhere on islands and in coastal environments, once the technology is proven.\nThe prevailing general attitudes from islanders about tackling unique challenges can help them solve this decarbonisation issue, according to Sandy Kerr, the director of the International Centre for Island Technology at the Orkney campus of Heriot-Watt University.\nSo while Orkney might seem completely distant and removed from small islands in Southeast Asia, there are plenty of commonalities to draw upon.\n“Because we're small, and it gives us flexibility to change, maybe we can be fleet of foot and move quicker than big metropolitan areas,” Kerr said.“But also I think islanders themselves, they're inherently systems thinkers. If you live on a small island, you know where your energy comes from, you understand the transport links, you know where your water comes from, you understand the life support system for the island in a way that if you live in a city, you probably don't.“Curiously, we all face similar problems. We're at the end of long supply chains and we're over-reliant on diesel. We need to deal with the intermittency of renewables and relatively small electricity systems,” he said. “And we all have to decarbonise. There's no one silver bullet. So we can learn from each other.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     clean energy ', '     renewable energy ', '     Indonesia ', '     United Kingdom ', '     environment ']}"

But there is another group who have thought of alternative workable solutions, such as using a pail and tub\xa0system due to space constraints faced by the premises,” she added.\xa0\n“So actually we are happy that these operators have actually taken the initiative to think about innovative solutions that work for their premises.”\xa0\nCoffee shop operators were initially concerned that patrons might find having to return their trays and crockery “troublesome”, causing them to lose business, said Dr Khor.\xa0\n“But I think now most of the coffee shop operators realise that in fact this is helpful to the stallholders, the patrons as well as themselves. You’re able to turn over clean tables faster because now the cleaners can just focus on wiping and sanitising the tables and clearing and sorting the crockery at the designated tray return point,” she added.\xa0\nWhen asked about whether the number of safe distancing ambassadors would decrease as the COVID-19 pandemic wanes and how this would affect enforcement, Dr Khor stressed that enforcement officers “cannot be around 24/7 at every corner”.\xa0\n“What we really hope is that members of the public will see this as a habit that we all can nurture, and something that we can be proud of, to raise the standards of cleanliness and hygiene in all our public dining places, which will also help to mitigate, prevent the spread of infectious disease and give us a better and cleaner and safer environment,” she added.\xa0\nThe response to the enforcement of tray and crockery return has been “positive” despite some initial concerns from various stakeholders, said Dr Khor.\xa0\n“But on the whole now ... various stakeholders, not just patrons but even stallholders and coffee shop operators, have actually shared that they have found that the environment is much cleaner, the bird nuisance, pest incidences is mitigated significantly, and they are happy that this has been rolled out,” she added.\xa0\n“We will monitor and we will see in future if further actions need to be taken to address this minority, this small group who remain recalcitrant patrons, but at the moment response has been positive.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Ministry for Sustainability and the Environment ', '     Singapore Food Agency ', '     hawker centres ']}"

      Thai artisans revive old crafts to weave new fashion and stories for modern market
  </h1>, 'text': 'PHU PHAN, Thailand: Drawing was a matter of secrecy for Tavee Meboot when she was a little girl. The more she drew, the more money her father had to fork out to buy new notebooks.\nHer family could not afford to keep doing that. So the young Tavee used each notebook sparingly and kept her art secret or until she ran out of pages for her childhood imagination.\n“I liked drawing but we were poor. Each time I needed a new notebook, my dad would ask ‘Why do you buy it so often?’. The notebook was actually for art assignments from school,” Tavee, now 43, reminisced with a smile.\n""I sneakily used it for my own drawings.""\nTavee’s love for art was tucked away in her heart. She grew into a farmer in her hometown of Sakon Nakhon, northeastern Thailand. Her life revolves around the seasons on the Phu Phan mountains, her paddy fields, cassava farm and rubber plantation.\nA few years ago, a motorbike accident kept her immobile for months. That was when she got to know Bhukram - a clothing brand from her small village of Nang Toeng.\nOver the past seven years, Bhukram has revived the disappearing art of cotton weaving in the community. Its artisans are local villagers who grow, weave and dye cotton by hand. With needles and threads, they then tell the story of local livelihoods through intricate embroidery that has given Bhukram its unique character.\nThis is a creation of Pilan ‘Meaw’ Thaisuang, a Thai historian who is passionate about nature and the traditional way of life on the hills of Phu Phan.\xa0\nMeaw grew up in Nang Toeng, where generations of residents have lived a simple life close to nature. Her childhood was shaped by the richness of the forest, where children played and looked for food with their parents.\n“I love this place very much,” said Meaw, who had left home to pursue a university degree and work in Bangkok, 600 km away, for ten years.\xa0\n“I always wanted to come home after finishing my education. I wanted to come back to do something and stay with my parents.”\nBehind her, different kinds of cotton garments fill a new studio. The two-storey wooden building is a place where artisans meet to discuss designs and submit their work for review. The space also functions as a shop and is open to the public every Saturday.\nInitially, Meaw worked as a historian in Bangkok with architects and communities. Her love for local fabrics and history, and longing for nature back home made her study the past of Nang Toeng village.\xa0\nShe discovered that cotton used to be grown along the farmland and harvested for weaving simple garments. It was then handspun into yarn and soaked in natural blue dye from the local indigo plant.\nThen Bhukram was born. Meaw left her regular job for an uncertain career path in the village. Little by little, she worked with local women to breathe new life into the old artform, infusing it with hand embroidery that depicts their livelihoods and the nature around them.\nColourful flowers and trees, streams, farms and paddy fields make up the designs of Bhukram’s products. They range from scarves to jackets, dresses and shirts - all made from cotton by hand.\nEach of them is unique with its own embroidery design that is only produced once to reflect the artisan’s perception of the surroundings. Prices start from about US$45 for a scarf but can go beyond US$500 for a dress.\n“I’m thankful to Meaw for giving me an opportunity to work like this,” said Tavee, who embroiders garments for Bhukram when she is not working on farm chores.\n“This is what I wanted to do when I was little.”\nTo her left, an indigo-dyed cotton jacket shows a beautiful scene of a season change, when flowers bloom on Phu Phan and turn its hills into a colourful palette of red, pink and white. Some of them have fallen into a stream, where white storks search for fish among groups of rocks.\nThe embroidery was inspired by a car ride up the Phu Phan mountains, when her eyes were amazed by the vivid display of colours, and her favourite place at the foot of a hill where her grandmother used to take her to look for mushrooms.\nIn the village of Nang Toeng, 45 embroiderers work with Bhukram. They are relatives, neighbours and friends who mainly farm for a living.\nEmbroidery is usually done when they are free and each piece can take weeks or months to complete.\xa0\nThe artisans are paid when they submit their work. The amount varies according to the intricacy and quality of the needlework.\nFor local women, this is a source of additional income for their families - one that does not require them to change their way of life.\n“The income may not be regular like US$600-900 every month and there is no overtime. But by working from home and doing embroidery, I can sweep the floor, look after my child and my dogs, water my plants, tidy up my house and cook. My work stays with me,” Tavee told CNA.\nMany people her age had to leave home to find jobs in Bangkok, she said, “but I don’t need to do that”.\nGradually, extra income from the commercial handicraft production has improved the life of many women in Nang Toeng.\xa0\nBesides being able to support their families, they also feel a sense of pride and appreciate their financial independence. Being able to earn also means more bargaining power in family discussions and for stay-at-home mothers, the ability to stand on their own feet.\n“When my child asks me for money, the money comes from me - his mother,” Tavee said.\xa0\n“We don’t have to wait for the men.”\nBefore the opening of the studio, Bhukram operated almost exclusively online through its Facebook page, which now has more than 33,000 followers.\nEach collection contains a limited number of items. They are all unique and come with name tags and photographs of the artisans who created them - weavers, dyers, seamstresses and embroiderers.\nA few days before the sale, photos of the garments will be posted online for customers to browse. Most of the products are usually taken within minutes once the sale begins.\nCustomers who cannot buy in time have to wait for weeks or months before a new collection is launched.\n“I’m proud, especially when I receive compliments from customers. I’m even more proud when they want my work,” said embroiderer Areena Tabonglek.\nFive years ago, she moved to Nang Toeng to take care of her mother. At that time, she had no job and only basic sewing skills. But working with Bhukram has changed that.\n“Whenever Meaw posts our work online, I’ll keep checking it. When customers comment ‘Oh wow! It’s so beautiful!’ or write ‘Reserve’,” she said with a broad smile, “I’m proud, so very proud.”\nBesides operating as a clothing brand, Bhukram also tries to communicate with society about preserving nature and the local way of life.\xa0\nAccording to Meaw, the brand does it through its intricate designs, environmentally-friendly materials from nature and traditional production process that engages people in the community.\n“I want people who see our clothes to think ‘the forest of Phu Phan is so beautiful and I want to tell others about it’. I want people in Sakon Nakhon to see how others appreciate it and how our brand is trying to talk about it,” she told CNA.\nThe message is also for its artisans - the local residents of Phu Phan. Their job requires them to closely observe the natural surroundings and use them as inspiration to create work.\nFor embroiderers like Tavee and Areena, they have to come up with their own design once they are assigned a concept for a piece of clothing. It could be a plain dress, jacket or scarf, which still needs to be decorated.\nThis is their canvas, where they tell a story of their home with needles and threads, feelings and imagination.\n“Whether it would be the forest on the hills, the trees or wild daisies, I now spend more time looking at them. In the past, if I saw a tree, I’d think it could be cut. Now, I’ve grown to realise it’s fertility and if possible, I don’t want it to be cut,” said Areena.\nThe wild daisy is her favourite flower because she used to make a crown out of them when she was a little girl.\xa0\nHer embroidery may not exactly mirror its shape, she added, but she always tries to replicate its delicate petals and leaves, curves and gentleness when she works.\n“I try to imitate nature as much as I can.”\nIn its early days, Bhukram had about 130 embroiderers. But as the brand grew, the number of its artisans has dropped to 45.\xa0\nAccording to Meaw, every step of the production is time-consuming and requires attention to detail. Not only that, she added, the artisans also need to enjoy translating ideas into designs and keep improving their work.\n“So, we only have perfectionists who stayed because they really love it,” she said.\nIn Thailand, Bhukram is popular among people who value nature-friendly handicrafts, as opposed to fast fashion.\nFast fashion refers to the mass production of inexpensive, trendy garments that are low-quality and disposable. The business model is common in Thailand and often employs low-paid workers.\nEach year, various practices in the fashion industry have devastating impacts on the environment.\nAccording to the UN, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned every second and if nothing changes, “by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget”.\n“Speed destroys many things,” Maew said. “Slowness, on the other hand, destroys the environment less.”\nFor seven years, Bhukram’s time-consuming production, limited merchandise and unique designs have continued to attract customers from across the country. Many of them flew or drove for hours to attend the opening of its studio in Nang Toeng village.\xa0\n“I’m amazed by their embroidery, which requires a lot of attention and care. Their work isn’t produced en masse like other brands,” said Nitaya Onhan.\nShe took a flight from Bangkok to Sakon Nakhon with her friends and drove for an hour to the village so that she could meet the artisans and buy their work.\n“There is plenty of apparel with embroidery but for many brands, it doesn’t tell a story,” said another customer, Chalunthorn Boonwattanaphon.\xa0\n“What I really like about Bhukram is their stories, which often have animals like buffaloes and paddy fields. It’s like I was transported there and got to share the experience with the embroiderer.”\nThe new studio in Nang Toeng is full of people.\nA hum of conversation can be heard on the ground floor, where customers gather around rows and shelves of garments.\nOutside, a man in an indigo jacket fills the air with his music from a bamboo mouth organ. Above him, a curtain of raw cotton on white strings flutters in the breeze.\nA group of local women sit in a circle on the grass. Their wrinkled hands move with precision as they work with cotton from the fields, turning it into fine threads.\xa0\nOne day, these thin fibres will turn into clothes and echo the story of nature and the small village where they grew.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     fashion ', '     environment ']}"

      One remote Scottish distillery is now carbon net zero, and it’s showing the whisky world the way
  </h1>, 'text': ""DRIMNIN, UK: This is wild country, raw and exposed to nature’s force. In these late autumn months, the landscape is a rich ochre.\xa0\nAfter a few dozen miles on a single track road that contorts through rugged highland valleys, a distillery looms, overlooking the Sound of Mull. The Drimnin Estate isn’t at the end of the Earth, but it feels something close to it.\nThis is one of Scotland’s most isolated places. Only a few hundred people live on this land in the Hebridean Islands. A small group of them are doing something quite remarkable with whisky.\nThis year, Nc’nean Distillery became the UK’s first and only net zero carbon emissions distillery. It runs on 100 per cent renewable energy and offsets its small footprint using forestry resources.\nThe distillery’s operations are designed around using biomass as a fuel. It also recycles 99.97 per cent of the water used in the whisky-making process, is a zero waste operation and is certified organic.\nIn ways, this is emblematic of a new Scottish whisky story.\xa0\nWhisky has for centuries had an intimate connection with nature. It is a product directly born from its landscape. Its ingredients are simple and time honoured - barley, water and yeast. But equally, its history has been tied to the burning of fossil fuels for energy - originally coal and for many decades now, natural gas.\nAs the world now attempts to wean off dirty energy in the face of worsening climate change, so too is Scotland’s whisky industry.\nReaching net zero certification has been a journey for Nc’nean, one that many other distilleries around Scotland are also starting to undertake as the scotch whisky industry aims to completely decarbonise by 2040.\n“We've managed to hit net zero 20 years ahead of industry targets and 25 years ahead of government targets. But that's because we were thinking about this 10 years ago,” said Amy Stammers, who runs the sustainability portfolio at Nc’nean.\xa0\n“Sustainability is a very broad topic. But we apply it in very specific ways: to energies, to packaging and to purchases. It's really like just having a lens where we say, ‘right, is this the best way that we can operate in order to have the least environmental impact?’,” she said.\nIn the hills behind Nc’nean, an estate owned forest boasts trees of various heights. Some of the timber from these trees is sold to the distillery, which then powers its spirit making as biomass. This sustainable forestry is a crucial component to minimising the distillery’s carbon footprint.\n“This is classed as carbon neutral because the CO2 that's being emitted when we combust, that timber has already been absorbed from the atmosphere while the tree grows,” Stammers explained.\n“We have enough trees to close a 40-year loop in terms of cyclical energy - trees growing and energy generation.”\nInstalling a boiler that could function using biomass was an engineering challenge and a serious investment.\xa0\nStammers estimates it initially cost five times that of a conventional boiler. Meantime, hand selecting organic barley producers and shifting towards recycled glass in their bottles were also extra expenses to consider for a fledgling business.\xa0\nThe next step for Nc’nean is to tackle its supply chain and influence changes that will positively affect its wider emissions output and the environmental impact of its products.\nThe only sources of emissions now left on site are the distillery’s forklift and tractor, which are separately offset elsewhere. “The cost implications were more at the time. But the savings that that's brought us now is worth every penny.”\xa0\nThere is also an inherent value in preserving this rugged frontier.\n“The highlands are particularly magical. And that is a definite reason why we wanted to take this business route, because, yes, sustainability is about emissions. But also it's how we operate on a day-to-day basis and how we can build in operational things that don't adversely affect our immediate environment,” Stammers said.\nScotland is home to more than 130 whisky distilleries, all of them with unique geographies, recipes and stories. What will tie them together is the need to be decarbonised within two decades under an industry-wide 2040 net zero strategy. The industry body, the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), is taking climate change seriously, describing it as “the most pressing emergency the world faces today”.\nSince 2008 when emissions data was first collected by SWA, the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions have reduced by 53 per cent. To achieve its climate ambitions, it will aim to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint in operations by a further 40 per cent over the next decade.\xa0\n“The distilleries have always been on a journey and are evolving along a pathway towards more sustainable energy use. It’s not a massive transition in mindset. But it will be in terms of engineering, process and the infrastructure needed,” said Graeme Littlejohn, SWA’s director of strategy and communications.\n“We think it’s important to show leadership on this issue and really drive forward as fast as we can. Some distillers will get there much sooner than that. We think it’s ambitious but achievable.”\nWhisky making is an energy intensive process. Heat is used to produce steam, which is currently generated in boilers by combusting fuel.Switching that to a renewable energy source will require innovation, investment and experimentation. Biomass and hydrogen are seen as promising long term solutions.The sustainability commitment, however, goes beyond simply counting carbon.Water use and efficiency is central. Despite being one of the wettest places on earth, Scotland has seen drier summers in recent years and there are projections of more to come with the onset of climate change. This means some distilleries have been left scrambling for water. Land use and stewardship are also key strategies, with the aim of being able to farm barley and cereals in a climate-resilient way with minimal impacts to local ecosystems. In regions of the country where peated whisky is a coveted product, restoring those carbon-rich peatlands, which have broadly degraded across the United Kingdom, will also be prioritised. And by 2025, SWA wants all packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable.Littlejohn said that despite the fierce competition on the shelves, whisky producers are eager to cooperate when it comes to climate change.\n“The industry has 500 years of history behind it. Over that time producers have collaborated together. It’s a longstanding tradition. That has set them in good stead for the effort it takes to get sustainability strategies up and running. It’s engrained in the muscle memory of distillers,” he said.\nNot all distilleries have the same advantages as Nc’nean. Retrofitting a century-old whisky operation and gearing it with new technology is a very different challenge to building a new distillery from scratch.Glengoyne Distillery is steeped in tradition, from its iconic pagoda chimney to its fabled waterfall, where water has flowed for centuries to form a natural component of its whisky.\nSince 1833, it has been distilling single malt on the northern outskirts of Glasgow. Now, it is contemplating an upheaval of its practices. It will not be easy.“You can’t just turn into a green distillery overnight. We have some of the older technologies. If we were building a distillery today, we’d be building with these targets in mind,” said Gordon Dallas, the experiential ambassador for Ian Macleod Distillers, the parent company for Glengoyne.“It will take time, we will have to innovate, we will have to adapt to greener technologies and we are. It will take a number of years but we will get there and we are confident that we will reach net zero by 2040, not just at Glengoyne but as an industry.”\xa0\nWhile renewable energy technologies come into play, already Glengoyne has proven innovative in the way it cares for its local environment, a picturesque valley with sweeping mist.\nIt has developed a wetland on its property, comprising about 14,500 plants that act as a natural filter for the waste generated by the distillery, as well as a home for wildlife. Previously, Dallas explained, 21 tankers a week would be deployed to remove the waste. Now, nature does the job in a far more sustainable way.\n“In many ways the wetlands are a wonder. It’s an amazing technology that has been right under our noses for generations. We’re utilising the power of plants, so that’s really important. They’ve been underappreciated,” he said.\nIn addition, solid waste is no longer being spread on the field as fertiliser. Instead, it is being taken away to a local village and put into an anaerobic digester and turned into electricity. Last year, Glengoyne powered approximately 354 homes from the power generated from that digester.\xa0\n“This product comes from the land of fresh air and wild wilderness. I do not see the story of scotch whisky being a polluting story,” Dallas said.\n“We are proud of where we come from and our landscapes. If scotch whisky can be part of the vanguard of making this a greener landscape and economy then that is something to be proud of. It’s our duty to lead the charge.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     whiskey ', '     Scotland ', '     environment ', '     carbon emissions ', '     carbon footprint ', '     business ']}"

      UN tonic for forest carbon market omits cure for corporate trading pains
  </h1>, 'text': 'OSLO: New UN\xa0guidelines for carbon trading, set at November\'s COP26 climate talks, are a step toward enlisting forests to help curb global warming, but robust rules are urgently needed for a fast-growing yet opaque voluntary corporate market, analysts say.\nThe Glasgow summit completed a ""rule book"" for governments under the 2015 Paris Agreement by adopting standards for international carbon trading and a new mechanism for rich nations to help poorer ones cut their greenhouse gas emissions by investing in everything from wind turbines to forests.\nBut the long-awaited deal on Article 6\xa0of the Paris pact has spotlighted the lack of rules for a murky, expanding voluntary carbon market.\nHere companies are investing to safeguard tropical forests from the Amazon to the Congo Basin and claiming carbon credits to help reach their own net-zero emissions goals.\n“There is a screaming need to have more regulation and rules around this,” said Anders Haug Larsen, head of policy at Rainforest Foundation Norway, which supports indigenous rights.\nThe Glasgow pact - which covers only government action - could inspire tougher rules in the voluntary market, he noted, but warned it “continues to leave the responsibility about what to do with the companies themselves”.\nMore than 2,000 firms worldwide, including Amazon, Royal Dutch Shell and Nestle, have set net-zero emissions goals.\nInvesting in forest protection to help meet those goals is attractive, both because customers like the idea and because trees naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the air as they grow.\nVoluntary carbon markets are on track to exceed US$1 billion in trades for the first time in 2021, according to an annual report from Forest Trends\' Ecosystem Marketplace.\nPrices on a futures market for nature-based climate solutions covering forestry, agriculture and other land uses, known as N-GEO, have risen to more than US$14 per tonne of carbon this month, up from about US$8 a tonne in October.\nThe coming year looks set to be crucial in the push to develop tighter standards, observers say.\nAmong groups working to that end are the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative with participants from non-profits to governments, and a task force on scaling up voluntary carbon markets set up by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney.\n“The new sets of guidance are going to really help separate the wheat from the chaff,” Kelley Kizzier, previously the European Union\'s lead climate negotiator for markets, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBy the next UN\xa0climate summit in Egypt in November 2022, “we should have a clear idea of what \'good\' looks like” in terms of carbon credits, said Kizzier, now vice president for global climate at the US-based Environmental Defense Fund.\nResponsible companies want strong rules to prove that they are safeguarding forests.\nBut less rigorous investors have often been accused of “green-washing” – making investments that look good in a glossy company brochure but with scant effect in reducing emissions.\nKizzier praised the progress made at COP26, noting that ""a win for carbon markets is a win for forest carbon markets"".\nBreakthroughs in Glasgow included setting accounting rules, championed by developed nations, which prevent double-counting of emissions cuts when two nations co-operate on reductions under their climate action plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).\nThe rules also allow emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil to carry over some credits for emissions reductions earned from 2013 to 2020, for things like building hydropower and solar plants, into the new Paris Agreement regime.\nBut, Kizzier noted, there was no COP26 bonanza for forest nations because the new carbon-market rules ban carrying over pre-2020 credits for planting trees and reforestation, which cannot be used to meet emissions targets set in the NDCs.\nHugh Sealy, an expert on voluntary carbon markets at the University of the West Indies in Barbados, said the Glasgow deal sent ""a strong, strong signal that the world wants to use markets, but ... with high integrity”.\n“There’s no stick we can wave – the market must want this (integrity) to happen,"" he told an online briefing this month.\nUnder the rules set in Glasgow to prevent double-counting by governments, the United States could pay to plant forests in Brazil to soak up 100 million tonnes of carbon emissions, and it would be recorded as a cut in US\xa0emissions - not Brazil\'s.\nBut the COP26 deal leaves the door open to a different system for “other international mitigation purposes”, such as those of private firms or investors rather than countries.\nThat means a US\xa0company investing to protect Brazilian forests could claim the carbon credits towards reducing its corporate emissions while Brazil also counts the reductions towards its national target under the Paris pact, Kizzier said.\nCritics, such as environmental group Greenpeace, say this system will allow companies to avoid making deep cuts in their own emissions and instead merely pay others to act.\nBackers, however, say it can boost investments in a more nimble, co-operative system to help lower emissions overall.\nThey argue it would not qualify as double-counting under the Paris Agreement as long as the emissions cuts are registered in only one country\'s NDC.\nVerra, a body that helps set standards for certifying carbon credits, welcomed Glasgow\'s clarification that Article 6 “does not regulate the voluntary market”.\nVerra said it would clearly label projects whose credits are traded on the voluntary market to show the carbon accounting methods used.\n“Some countries may want to leverage the private finance provided by voluntary carbon markets to further their own climate action, which is something many buyers will want to contribute to,” it noted.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     COP26 ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Our festive shopping will cost us far more than our holiday bills
  </h1>, 'text': 'ST\xa0CATHERINES, Canada: As extreme weather events in Canada and around the world are linked to human-made climate change, there is one story that continues to be left out: The connection between climate change and the products we purchase.\nRecent research shows that across a product’s life cycle — from raw material extraction through manufacturing, distribution, use and disposal — the total embedded carbon emissions are 6.3 times the product’s weight.\nInterestingly, it is the product’s supply chain, or what we do not see related to making and distributing products, that is especially carbon intensive.\nIn the context of human history, the changes to our relationship with the material world have happened in the blink of an eye. Our ancestors lived in direct connection with the land that physically and spiritually sustained them.\nOnly in very recent human history have so many of us lived our lives at such a great distance from that which sustains us. Today, unchecked consumerism is helping drive a changing climate that is very much affecting all people.\nSince the Industrial Revolution introduced mass production, companies have devoted tremendous quantities of time and money to educating people about the value of the ever-increasing quantities of stuff for sale.\nThey have told us what to covet, what our stuff says about who we are or our status in the world and why we need to buy even more.\nAs marketing consultant Victor Lebow wrote in the Journal of Retailing in 1955, “We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing pace.”\nAppeals to consume more stuff — clothes, electronics, appliances, toys, cars and so on — used to be found only in advertisements. In the 1990s, the average American was targeted by 3,000 advertising messages a day.\nToday, appeals to consume are barely countable, as they are seamlessly and endlessly woven into our screen-filled lives, arriving via text message, personalised pop-up appeals and social media posts that celebrate consumption such as influencer haul videos.\nIn the past few decades, those in more materially affluent parts of the world have enthusiastically added more stuff to their lives and discarded hastily.\nFor example, in the US, the average person’s consumption of stuff has doubled in the past 50 years and, in 2019, North Americans disposed of almost 21 kilograms of electronic waste per person.\nThe consequences of our rabid consumption are borne out in the planet’s ecosystems. Consumption in “developed” countries has led to massive-scale logging of the Earth’s forests, leaving just three per cent of the world’s ecosystems intact.\nThe widespread production, use and disposal of plastics has deposited about eight million tonnes of plastic waste into the world’s oceans each year.\nThese outcomes have historically been experienced as “tragedies of the commons.”\nThis implies that the consequences are “out there,” that the degradation and devastation were not been experienced firsthand — but climate change has changed that, taking lives and livelihoods, destroying homes and entire towns with extremes of heat, drought, wind, fire and floods.\nIt begins with the collection of “resources” — minerals, metals, oil, water and wood — and follows with their assembly into products, their distribution, use and often quick disposal.\nEach step in a product’s life cycle has environmental consequences and a carbon footprint.\nFor example, trees are the Earth’s carbon storehouse but the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) estimates that 10 million hectares of forests are lost each year.\nFurniture and furnishings in municipal waste (mostly wood products) amounted to almost nine million tonnes in 2018, according to the US\xa0Environmental Protection Agency, nearly five times more than what was landfilled in 1960.\nYet, old-growth forests continue to be cut down and consumers don’t know which forest products contain 100-year-old trees.\nWhile producing or buying differently may decrease our carbon footprint, ultimately, the planet’s wealthiest will need to produce and consume less.\nMaking an effort to buy less during the holidays could have a meaningful impact.\nAmericans, for example, produce 25 per cent more waste between US Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, discarding half of their yearly paper waste — holiday wrapping and decorations — totalling about eight billion tonnes.\nLikewise, Canadians will send more than 2.6 billion cards and wrap gifts using 540,000 tonnes of wrapping paper over the holidays. For every kilogram of paper, 3.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide are produced.\nIndeed, a big part of coming to terms with consumption and climate change involves acknowledging the inordinate consumption and climate impact of the wealthy.\nUNEP points out that the planet’s richest 10 per cent contribute almost 50 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the planet’s poorest 50 per cent contribute only 12 per cent of global emissions.\nGiving is a wonderful way for us to connect with those in our lives. Giving builds families, friendships and communities. Arguably such connections are needed more now than ever. But what we have been taught by the endless onslaught of consumption stories we must unlearn.\nWe must challenge stories that encourage fast and “cheap” consumption and demand the telling of — and share — stories that accurately link our copious consumption to the devastating effects of climate change.\nWe must elect leaders who will do the hard work of transitioning away from an endless growth economy based on the excessive consumption of monetarily cheap but planet-expensive products.\nWe must demand vital product information such as life cycle carbon footprints. And we must all commit to resisting the constant appeals to consume fast and cheap, by giving less stuff, more slowly and thoughtfully.\nJennifer Ellen Good is an Associate Professor in Communication, Popular Culture and Film at Brock University.

      Signs of life after Indonesia's polluted Citarum river gets a clean up - but for how long?
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANDUNG, Indonesia: As Rahmat Sutrisno descended the slope of the Citarum riverbank, he could not help but grin.\xa0\nFor decades, the 71-year-old had been patrolling the river which was once dubbed as one of the most polluted watercourses in the world.\nAlong with other activists from the River Quality Preservation People's Network, Sutrisno used to collect evidence against the many textile factories dotting his village, located in the outskirts of Indonesia’s third largest city, Bandung.\nThese factories, some of which supply clothes to world renowned fashion brands, would often discharge untreated wastewater into the Citarum and its tributaries, contaminating the vital water source for the 18 million people living along its course with toxic chemicals and heavy metals.\n“During the dry season, the river would turn black from the industrial waste,” Sutrisno told CNA, adding that the water would emit a caustic stench so pungent it could be detected from 2km away.\n“During the wet season, the river would be completely covered in trash,” he continued.\nA 2013 study by Green Cross Switzerland and Blacksmith Institute named Citarum as one of the top 10 worst polluted sites in the world.\nBut things started to change gradually since the Indonesian government began to clean up the Citarum in 2018 by clamping down on factories which violated environmental laws and relocating illegal settlements which disposed of solid waste, detergents and faeces into the river and its tributaries.\nToday, there are spots where the water is safe enough to swim. Scavengers who once hunted for plastic cups and bottles became fishermen instead.\nSutrisno had also given up patrolling the river looking for incriminating evidence of the pollution and gone back to farming.\n“Rice plants would die before they had a chance to grow. Even if they did, the plants would produce no grain,” Sutrisno said of what it was like in his village before efforts to tackle pollution in the Citarum began.\xa0\nThings have now improved. “For the past two years, we have had six harvest seasons,” he said.\nBut there is still much work to be done.\nAlthough not as massive and blatant as before, there are still textile factories which dump their untreated wastewater in the Citarum and its tributaries in secret at night or whenever authorities are not looking, according to officials and activists interviewed by CNA.\nMeanwhile, the amount of domestic waste produced by those living along its watershed areas is not slowing down.\nHeavy machinery has to constantly pick up mountains of trash on the surface of the river and dredge the contaminated sediment\xa0accumulating on the riverbed. The military has also deployed thousands of soldiers to monitor and clean the 297km river which meanders through Indonesia’s West Java province.\nActivists and experts worry about Citarum’s future. They have seen various administrations trying to clean the river only to see their respective programmes lose steam or struggle with funding.\nThe government estimated that the Citarum Harum (Fragrant Citarum) programme, which will end in 2025, would require 34.8 trillion rupiah (US$2.34 billion). This includes numerous infrastructure projects and the day-to-day dredging, cleaning and patrolling.\nActivists and experts also noted that so far, much of Fragrant Citarum’s success rests on efforts to continuously monitor and search for evidence on environmental law violations as well as the constant work to pick up the rubbish polluting the Citarum.\nThis leaves them questioning what will\xa0happen once the programme ends in 2025.\nSofyan Tsauri, who lives close to one of Citarum’s tributaries, said the level of pollution caused by the many textile factories near his home has\xa0dramatically decreased since the programme began.\n“Before, the smell was so pungent you could smell it indoors. The river used to be black and thick. But it hasn’t been like that for the last two years,” Tsauri told CNA.\nBut the 51-year-old said the illegal discharge of untreated industrial waste is still happening, albeit not as frequent and serious as it used to be.\n“I still feel that there is discharge (of untreated waste) going on. Whenever I get close to a river or discharge outlet, the smell is still there,” he said.\nAsep, a food vendor who lives on another part of Citarum, said he sometimes sees factories dumping its untreated wastewater into the river.\n“I can still see black and foamy water coming from their discharge outlets but the factories have been careful not to do this in broad daylight. Sometimes, they would send workers to clean the blackened outlet because officials regularly patrol the river,” said Asep, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.\n“But nowadays, the amount of waste they discharge is small. Before there were any patrols, they would dump all of their waste non stop without fear of repercussion.”\nIn an interview with CNA, West Java vice governor Uu Ruzhanul Ulum admitted that some factories are still defiant.\n“But there are not as many as before. I would say around 20 per cent (are still defiant). We will keep monitoring them. There are companies which are on our watchlist and we are giving them time to fix themselves. If they continue, we will revoke their licence,” he said.\nThere are more than 4,000 factories operating along the Citarum and its tributaries and the West Java Environmental Agency has so far been able to build a case against 451 of them.\n“There are still many industry players which are ‘naughty’. But it is hard to build a strong case against them. We need to take samples of the water and have them tested in a lab … to prove that they really did it (pollute the river),” West Java Environmental Agency chief Prima Mayaningtyas told CNA.\n“These factories sometimes dump their waste at night and we only find out about it later when the waste is already mixed with the main body of water and impossible to trace back to its original source,” she continued.\n“That’s why we need locals to take pictures and collect evidence on our behalf. They need to file a formal complaint. Then we can conduct a surprise inspection.”\nBut Deni Riswandani, chairman of the not-for-profit organisation Elingan, said it is easier said than done.\n“People are afraid to file a complaint or collect evidence. Some of these companies employ thugs to stop people from taking pictures of their discharge outlets. Meanwhile, some locals might have family members who work in the factories and they stand to lose their jobs and livelihoods if they turn in their companies,” he said.\nDwina Roosmini, an environmental engineering lecturer from the Bandung Institute of Technology, said wastewater produced by textile factories can be harmful to the environment.\n“Companies use different chemicals to produce different colours to dye their fabric. They also use heavy metals to make the colours more vibrant, not to mention the metals used to make zippers and buttons,” she said.\nBy law, companies must treat their wastes chemically using binding agents or biologically using bacteria, Roosmini explained.\xa0\nThese processes will make the hazardous pollutants settle into a sludge, which must then be disposed of safely at a licenced disposal company. The resulting water must meet certain standards before they can be dumped into bodies of water like the Citarum.\n“In theory, we should be able to audit how much chemical agents these factories purchase and how much sludge they transport to these disposal companies and compare them with their production capacity. But companies rarely grant access to such audits,” she said.\n“Because the government has limited manpower, it is left to the industry players to report how much waste water they are discharging and what the water’s characteristics are. We don’t know if these industry players are being truthful or not. That is the problem.”\nThe government has installed nets along the watercourse manned by hundreds of officials who pick up tonnes of trash each day.\xa0\nTrash\xa0also gets tangled on the water hyacinths floating on the river surface or washed ashore to the riverbanks.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nBut at the start of the rainy season, heavy rains wash away piles of domestic waste accumulated in Citarum’s tributaries into the main river. The amount of trash can be so overwhelming that the entire surface of the watercourse is covered, forcing officials and labourers to work for hours just to clear the waste.\nThe reason, activists and experts say, is that the 13 regencies and cities straddling along the Citarum have inadequate waste management systems.\nBandung and its four surrounding regencies, for example, only has one landfill with a capacity of 2,000 tonnes per day. The Bandung metropolitan area has a population of 8.5 million people. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry estimated that on average each person produces 0.7kg of trash per day.\nAs a result, all across the Greater Bandung area there are piles of rubbish left by the roadside next to packed trash bins waiting to be picked up by sanitation workers who come once every few days.\nAnother common sight are empty plots of land being used as impromptu landfills or sites for open burning, which creates suffocating smoke. The rest of the trash can be found littering open sewers, creeks and streams which flow into major rivers like the Citarum.\nLast month, during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil presented how the province is home to a trash-for-cash scheme to collect and recycle plastic bottles and cups as part of the efforts to keep the Citarum clean.\nWest Java, the governor continued, also hosts several small businesses which turn multi-layer food and detergent packaging into floor mats and bags as well as maggot farms which eat away organic wastes.\nBut environmental agency chief Mayaningtyas admitted that these ventures are only creating a small dent on the province’s domestic waste problem.\n“We have a regional strategic policy that every regency and city must implement, which is a 30 per cent reduction in waste through recycling and upcycling,” she said.\n“That has not been achieved. We will push all regencies to start sorting wastes and create a circular economy. Because today, the amount of waste which ends up in our landfills and incinerators is not decreasing.”\nRiswandani, the activist, agreed that getting people to recycle their wastes is the way to go, but he also called for more government intervention.\n“There have been efforts to create a circular economy by upcycling plastics into bags and floor mats but the government didn’t create a market for them. The same goes for waste banks. Without a market, they will become nothing more than waste collectors,” he said.\nErri Megantara, an environmental science professor from Bandung’s Padjadjaran University concurred.\n“The government tried to establish waste banks or trash-for-cash schemes. But they are not supported by banks and financing firms. They could not find a market for the plastic collected because there are not that many recycling plants around,” Megantara told CNA.\nFor now, the government appeared to be serious about cleaning the Citarum, a vital source of water for millions of people and thousands of hectares of farmland.\nIn 2018, President Joko Widodo signed a decree on the Acceleration of Citarum River Pollution and Damage Mitigation, earmarking billions of dollars for the programme and assigning Cabinet members to oversee the programme.\nAccording to data from the Fragrant Citarum task force, the government has so far poured in US$700 million into the programme. Most of the money has been spent on building retention ponds, reforesting the hilly upstream areas and other construction projects to regulate Citarum’s flow.\xa0\nMeanwhile, to keep pollution from industrial and domestic wastes at bay, the government mostly relies on the military’s day-to-day patrolling and cleaning work.\n“Citarum has 20 tributaries which host thousands of factories and millions of inhabitants. They can’t monitor everything all the time. The environmental agency has limited manpower at both the provincial and regency levels. Today, the agency is assisted by the military but we can’t involve them forever. There needs to be systemic changes,” Megantara from Padjadjaran University said.\nRoosmini, the environmental engineering lecturer, echoed the same sentiment.\n“For now, the government is relying too much on monitoring. There needs to be prevention strategies. We need to control the source of the pollution,” she said.\xa0\nUlum, West Java’s vice governor, said there are plans to move some factories away from the Citarum to industrial complexes which are currently under construction in other parts of the province where they can easily be monitored.\n“These industrial areas will have facilities which will minimise some of the problems we are seeing now,” he said.\nAs for domestic waste, Ulum said the government is engaging religious and community leaders to educate the public.\n“People are still not aware about the importance of preserving Citarum as a whole.\xa0\n“They don’t litter not out of good will but because they are afraid of punishment and because the military is involved. There are people who litter in secret but not as massive as before. To change paradigm and behavior takes time. That’s why educating the public is so important,” he said.\xa0\xa0\nMayaningtyas, the environmental agency chief, said the government is also opening up new landfills as well as establishing new recycling plants to expand its trash-for-cash scheme.\nMegantara is sceptical, saying that the government needs to make sure that these changes stay in place long after the programme ends in 2025.\n“The reason why previous attempts (to clean Citarum) had failed was (the lack of) consistency. They also did what they do now. They shut down a number of factories, they patrolled the river, they launched infrastructure projects and campaigns,” he said.\xa0\n“But after a while the (previous) programmes started to lose steam. The patrols were conducted less frequently, inspections were relaxed, companies went back to business as usual and infrastructure projects didn’t get maintained and were left in decay. We need the government to stay committed to keeping the Citarum clean.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     pollution ', '     river ']}"

      Under the shadow of China’s mega dams, millions in Southeast Asia face a fight for survival
  </h1>, 'text': 'CHIANG RAI, Thailand: Anusorn Nantharak has known no other occupation.\nBorn and raised in a fishing village along the Mekong River, the 37-year-old joined his family-owned fishing business at the age of 17. Back then, they had more than 10 fishing boats and could fish all day.\nBut 15 years ago, everything started changing.\n“We used to find so many big fish … The population of fish has decreased, and their size has gotten smaller,” he said. His family now owns just two or three fishing boats.\nFar upstream from where he lives, the hydroelectric dams China built along the Mekong have turned his life upside down by ruining the water system, he said, and thus resulting in fewer fish.\n“The flood seasons aren’t following the same pattern any more,” he said. “When it’s supposed to be high tide, the river becomes dry. And when the river should become dry, the water level rises.\n“With the damage to the ecosystem, soon some fish will go extinct.”\nThe Mekong, which passes through, Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, is one of the world’s most complex river systems, second only to the Amazon River in terms of fish biodiversity.\nBut all this is threatened anew by China’s efforts to be carbon-neutral by 2060. As the programme Insight finds out, the mega dams China has been constructing come at a cost to the environment and the livelihoods of those, like Anusorn, who live downstream and a world apart.\nChina completed its first hydroelectric dam on the Mekong, the Manwan dam in Yunnan province, in 1995. Since then, it has built 10 more on the main river, along with hundreds of dams on the Mekong’s tributaries.\nHarvesting water in dams and creating hydroelectricity are “high on the agenda in the Chinese government”, noted Elizabeth Lai from the University of Hong Kong.\n“It’s very important politically for China to provide security in water supply,” said Lai, an honorary lecturer at the university’s Centre for Civil Society and Governance. “Another importance is in terms of providing clean energy.”\nWith reference to China’s pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, she said building dams is “one of the most efficient ways” of providing that clean energy for the country.\nHydroelectricity is China’s second-biggest source of energy, after coal; it makes up close to a fifth of the total energy production.\nAnd the development of hydropower resources in “international and cross-border rivers” in particular is “very important” for China’s realisation of its carbon goals, according to Tian Fuqiang of Tsinghua University’s Department of Hydraulic Engineering.\nThis gives transboundary rivers an “overall strategic significance” for China, he said, noting that most of the border areas these rivers flow through tend to be mountainous, where “the local economy and society are relatively backward”.\n“So the development of cross-border rivers to benefit communities along the banks is very important for China.”\nBut the dams have altered the Mekong River’s traditional flow, fragmented natural habitats and caused water levels to plunge to dangerous lows downstream.\n“In the past 20 years, we can see that the Mekong River’s been affected in many ways,” said Thai environmental activist Niwat Roykaew. “A lot of living things have gone extinct, the environment’s been destroyed — all these issues are a result of those big projects, like the dams being built.\n“Building dams isn’t environmentally friendly.”\nAccording to a 2017 report from Unesco and the Stockholm Environment Institute, the hydroelectric dams, along with other large-scale infrastructure developments on the river, are responsible for trapping nutrient-rich sediment and preventing the river’s natural flow downstream.\nThe report said the average sediment load in parts of the Mekong in Thailand declined by as much as 83 per cent between 2003 and 2009.\nThe adverse effects have been exacerbated by climate change and a lack of transboundary communication.\nPianporn Deetes remembers that\xa0when the first two dams were built, downstream communities “didn’t get any notification”. “We had no idea what was going on in the upper reaches,” said the International Rivers regional campaigns and communications director for Southeast Asia.\n“(But) people downstream here … experienced the change of water level. We witnessed the unusual water fluctuation that drastically changed the ecosystem of the Mekong River.\n“We’re not against China … but we’re talking about the existing problems on the Mekong River. The dams over there are generating electricity, but with the cost borne by the downstream communities.”\nWATCH: People of the Mekong fight for survival, in the shadow of China’s mega dams (4:56)\nBesides fishermen like Anusorn, there are others whose livelihoods are affected, like farmer Nipon Wutthikorn, who grows bean sprouts on the banks of the Mekong.\n“The amount of (fertile) land has decreased … and the sand bar is higher than before,” he said. “The water levels aren’t predictable (any more).”\nActivists like Niwat worry that the Mekong is a testing ground for Chinese hegemony in East Asia and beyond, given that China’s dams have been holding back massive quantities of water over the last two years.\n“Keeping in all the water during the rainy season and letting it out during the dry season is wrong,” he said. “It’s going against nature.”\nIt has also threatened the livelihoods of the 60 million people living downstream by causing crop failure and depleting fish catches.\nThis, noted Niwat, is a topic for negotiation with China. “They keep saying, ‘Hey, we’re not keeping that much water. There’s only 13.5 per cent of the Mekong River held in our dams,’” he said.\nThis is something Tian the university professor described as an “exaggeration of the situation”.\n“Many people think that China is upstream, and the water comes from upstream, so building this dam is equal to shutting off the tap water, and then you can do whatever you want,” he said.\n“This statement doesn’t consider the area that such a water resource is distributed across.”\nHe added that storing water in a reservoir “just regulates the seasonality”.\n“It increases the water flow across the seasons by reducing floods and storing water for the dry seasons,” he said. “To a certain extent, this is conducive to downstream flood control and drought relief as well.”\nHe sees it as a “very complicated” problem requiring lots of data, modelling and “detailed research to reach scientific conclusions”.\n“Usually, there are various factors that affect irrigation. The reservoirs on the tributaries and sand mining may all play a role in changing the topography of a river,” he said.\n“We need to build this understanding based on science to improve the mutual trust between upstream and downstream areas.”\nUltimately, said Lai, who is also an environmental engineer, the engineering behind dam projects is “there for the good of mankind but needs to be properly managed instead of manipulated to become a political tool”.\n“It’s all up to the mentality of … the transboundary countries to have that sort of a broader perspective,” she added.\nPianporn agrees on the importance of the relevant governments having a “strong political will” to recognise these issues as “important transboundary issues in mainland Southeast Asia”.\nShe also advocates that rural communities should have equal participation in decision-making in the resource planning for the Mekong.\n“We’re not asking for cash compensation or anything like that,” she said. “We’d just like to see the mighty Mekong once again free-flowing, in a healthy manner, and that she can feed our livelihoods, migratory fish and our agricultural land.”\nWATCH:\xa0The full episode\xa0—\xa0China’s\xa0mega dams: The threat to Asia’s\xa0river communities (45:48)\nMeanwhile, China has turned its focus on another river for its biggest project yet: A mega dam in Tibet’s Medog county, on the Yarlung Tsangpo river. This transboundary river, known as the Brahmaputra in India, flows about 3,000 kilometres from its source in the Himalayas through Tibet, India and Bangladesh.\nThis hydropower project is set to be the world’s largest dam, generating 300 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year. It is estimated the dam could produce about thrice the power of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River.\nThe location of the mega dam offers “very good conditions for hydropower development”, said Tian. And the river is “relatively undeveloped” in China.\nBut the impact on India and Bangladesh could be huge.\nIn 1975, India constructed the Farakka Barrage across the transboundary river Ganges. This created water stress in Bangladesh and a multitude of environmental and social consequences.\n“Earlier, you’d hear its roars from two, three kilometres away,” said Bangladeshi water activist Mizanur Rahman. “How did that river become a graveyard in the last 30, 40 years? The reason is the Farakka Barrage.”\nIt is likely to get worse with the new dam. “As China will store water for the mega dam, the downstream countries, India and Bangladesh, will get less water,” said Partha Pratim Biswas, a professor at India’s Jadavpur University.\n“If India is compelled to produce power with a lesser amount of water, India will also have to build storage dams … The more storage dams you build in the course of the river, the more you’re interrupting its flow — so the country at the very bottom will (suffer) the worst.”\nAlready, fisherman Zahangir Alom has seen how the river has dried up and become narrower. The 26-year-old now worries that his community will have even more trouble catching fish.\nThe same goes for boatman Masud Rana Shomrat. “If the dam is constructed, the entire area would become a desert,” he said. “The northern part of Bangladesh runs along the river; if it turns into a desert, the supply of a lot of goods would stop.”\nIn March, the Chinese parliament adopted the country’s 14th five-year plan, which contained the plan to construct the dam as part of China’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.\nIt is those who live downstream, like Zahangir and Masud, who will have to pay a high price.\n“My life will be finished, since I’m a boatman,” said Masud. “Our whole family is dependent on the river for survival.\n“There’s no other way of survival — we’d die.”\nWatch this episode of\xa0Insight here.\xa0The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     environment ', '     Mekong River ']}"

      Barter plastik dengan beras tangani polusi sekaligus dampak COVID-19 terhadap ekonomi Bali
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Tahun lalu, Made Janur Yasa mengimbau warga di kampung halamannya di Tabanan, Bali, untuk menghimpun limbah plastik. Dalam lima hari, mereka berhasil mengumpulkan 500 kilogram plastik dalam bentuk sedotan, kantong, botol, dan sebagainya.\nSebagai imbalan, Made memberi mereka 500 kilogram beras.\nMade,\xa055 tahun, memprakarsai gerakan Plastic Exchange yang memberdayakan masyarakat Bali untuk mengumpulkan plastik dan menukarkannya dengan beras.\nSang ayah tiga anak memulai inisiatif ini ketika COVID-19 mendera bisnisnya. Hingga hari ini, 50 ton limbah plastik yang berhasil dikumpulkan turut membantu masyarakat memenuhi kebutuhan pangan mereka.\nKetika COVID-19 melanda, restoran vegan milik Made yang berlokasi di Ubud, pusat kebudayaan Bali yang mendunia, menerima pukulan hebat — sama halnya dengan banyak bisnis lain di pulau tersebut.\n“Restoran saya enggak kebal pandemi. Orang-orang stop datang kemari dan saya jadi mikir: ‘Wah, gimana ini?’\n“Tapi saya selalu terkesan dengan ungkapan: di mana ada kesulitan, pasti ada jalan.”\nSebagai penganut Hindu Bali, Made mengimani konsep Tri Hita Karana yang mengajarkan bahwa kesejahteraan dapat dicapai melalui keselarasan tiga hubungan — antara manusia dan Tuhan, antar-sesama manusia, dan antara manusia dengan lingkungan.\nIa lantas berpikir, bagaimana kiranya kearifan tersebut dapat terejawantah dalam tindakan.\n“Kadang-kadang ketiga unsur ini tidak seimbang. Kadang orang terlalu memikirkan lingkungan sampai-sampai mengorbankan manusia.\n“Terkadang kita memikirkan masyarakat dan profit, tapi malah tidak memperhatikan lingkungan,” ujarnya.\nMeski pendapatannya menurun akibat pandemi, ia tahu banyak warga Bali yang bernasib lebih nahas.\nDi pulau primadona pariwisata Indonesia ini, mereka yang telah kehilangan pekerjaan terpaksa pulang berbondong-bondong ke kampung halaman dengan tabungan seadanya.\nMasalah-masalah lain yang merongrong Bali, seperti sampah plastik, juga menjadi perhatian Made.\nSementara itu, menurutnya, banyak orang bergantung pada bantuan, terutama selama pandemi, tanpa merasa perlu turut menjaga kelestarian bumi atau berbagi dengan masyarakat sekitar.\nMaka dari itu, Mei tahun lalu, Made meluncurkan Plastic Exchange di kampung halamannya di Kabupaten Tabanan dengan menawarkan satu kilogram beras sebagai imbalan untuk satu kilogram limbah plastik.\n“Inisiatif ini berawal dari mulut ke mulut. Sekarang, kami punya grup-grup WhatsApp, jadi orang-orang bisa berbagi info di grup mereka.\n“Program ini tidak mengikat. Siapa mau beras, silakan kumpulkan plastik.\n“Mereka yang mau bersih-bersih rumah (dari sampah plastik), kami kasih imbalan baik,” katanya kepada CNA.\nSebagian warga bahkan membantu menggalakkan gerakan ini dengan menempelkan pengumuman di warung-warung.\nBermula dari satu desa, prakarsa ini telah menyebar ke 200 desa di Bali.\nPencemaran laut akibat limbah plastik di Indonesia merupakan yang tertinggi kedua di dunia setelah Cina, dan alam Bali yang asri termasuk pantai-pantai indahnya tak luput dari sampah jenis ini.\nKetika Made dilahirkan pada tahun 1966, masalah plastik Bali belum segenting sekarang.\nDulu hidup terasa sederhana, kenangnya.\n\xa0“Di desa saya, kami tumbuh tanpa uang. Kami hidup di desa kami dengan sistem barter.\n\xa0“Jadi, kalau butuh sesuatu, bumbu atau beras misalnya, kami tinggal pergi ke tetangga lalu saling tukar. Sistem barter membangun hubungan antarmanusia dan itu tidak ternilai harganya,” ujar Made.\xa0\nSistem barter yang dipelajarinya semasa kecil akhirnya menjadi landasan Plastic Exchange.\nDi bangku kuliah, Made menyadari bahwa pencemaran lingkungan akibat plastik telah menjadi isu serius di Bali.\nDari tahun ke tahun, masalah ini kian meningkat. Pada tahun 2019, pemerintah Bali akhirnya melarang penggunaan plastik sekali pakai.\nMasyarakat pun merasakan dampak nyata dari Plastic Exchange dalam bentuk beras gratis dan rumah yang lebih bersih.\nKarena sifatnya tidak mengikat, gerakan ini tidak membebani siapa pun, tegas Made.\nPlastic Exchange menerima segala jenis plastik, termasuk plastik sekali pakai berupa kemasan atau yang dapat digunakan kembali seperti ember.\nBahan-bahan daur ulang lain — kardus, kertas, kaleng, dan botol bir — juga diterima, meski penyetor harus memilahnya terlebih dahulu sebelum diserahkan ke bank plastik di masing-masing desa.\nMasyarakat diimbau untuk menyetorkan limbah ke bank sampah setidaknya sekali dalam sebulan, dan mereka akan memperoleh imbalan beras sesuai jumlah dan jenis plastik yang diserahkan.\nAwalnya, satu kilogram limbah plastik dihargai satu kilogram beras, cukup untuk kebutuhan makan empat orang dalam sehari.\nDengan makin banyaknya orang yang mengikuti program ini, Made mengubah aturan menjadi empat kilogram limbah untuk satu kilogram beras.\nKarena Bali belum memiliki pabrik daur ulang, ia pun bekerja sama dengan perusahaan pengepul limbah plastik yang kemudian mengirimkannya ke Jawa untuk diproses lebih lanjut.\nAwalnya, Made membeli beras untuk barter dengan uangnya sendiri.\nMeski bisnisnya terimbas COVID-19, ia bertekad membeli beras dari para petani lokal serta memilih yang berkualitas baik sebagai alat tukar.\n\xa0“Berasnya harus berasal dari desa tertentu. Harus dibeli dari petani lokal supaya ada perputaran ekonomi.”\nBanyak pihak telah mendengar gerakan ini dan tergerak untuk membantu secara finansial, dan Made pun dapat menggunakan donasi yang terkumpul untuk membeli beras.\n\xa0“Masih saja ada yang tanya ke saya: ‘Dari mana saya memulai? Bagaimana caranya dapat plastik?’ Ya saya bilang: ‘Kalau mau membersihkan dunia, bersihkan rumahmu dulu. Kalau mau mengubah dunia, mulailah dari diri sendiri dulu.”\nBerkat kerja kerasnya, Made diganjar nominasi CNN Hero of the Year. Pemenangnya akan diumumkan pada pertengahan bulan ini.\nNominasinya telah menarik perhatian donatur-donatur baru dari luar negeri. Kini dua per tiga donaturnya berasal dari Kanada, Australia, dan negara-negara Eropa.\xa0\nMeski berharap menang, Made mengaku tidak pernah mengharapkan pengakuan apa pun.\nTarget Made berikutnya adalah memanfaatkan limbah plastik Bali untuk pembuatan bata guna membangun rumah bagi keluarga miskin.\nIa juga ingin mereplikasi inisiatif ini di berbagai kawasan di Indonesia.\n\xa0“Program ini bisa terus berjalan selama masih ada plastik, karena sekarang orang-orang mulai memperlakukan kredit plastik seperti kredit karbon.\n\xa0“Selama masih ada plastik, selama masyarakat ingin melihat lingkungan yang bersih, saya kira program ini bisa berlanjut seumur hidup saya… karena plastik toh akan terus ada.”\nBaca artikel ini dalam Bahasa Inggris.\xa0\nBaca juga artikel Bahasa Indonesia ini mengenai kerja keras para pemengaruh pemula Indonesia demi capai citra mereka.\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\xa0Ikuti CNA di\xa0Facebook\xa0dan\xa0Twitter\xa0untuk lebih banyak artikel.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Bali ', '     environment ', '     Indonesia ', '     Plastic ']}"

      Bali man's rice for plastic initiative tackles pollution while supporting COVID-hit villagers 
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: When Indonesian Made Janur Yasa encouraged villagers in his hometown of Tabanan, Bali, to collect plastic waste last year, they came back with 500kg of straws, plastic bags, plastic bottles and the like in five days.\xa0\nIn return, he rewarded them with 500kg of rice.\xa0\nYasa is the founder of Plastic Exchange, a movement that empowers communities in Bali to collect plastic in exchange for free rice.\xa0\nThe 55-year-old father of three started his initiative when COVID-19 disrupted his business, and as of today has successfully collected about 50 tonnes of plastic waste while helping people put food on their tables.\xa0\nAs an owner of a vegan restaurant in Bali’s cultural hub Ubud, Yasa’s business, like many others on the island, suffered when COVID-19 hit the globe.\n“My restaurant was not immune to the pandemic. So people stopped coming and I was like: ‘Wow. What to do?’\n“But I always liked this phrase: inside of a challenge, there is a solution.”\nAs a Hindu Balinese, Yasa believes in the concept of Tri Hita Karana. According to this principle, prosperity is obtained by having three harmonious relationships - between humans and God, among humans and humans with the environment.\nHe thought about how to turn this wisdom into action.\xa0\n“Sometimes these three elements are not balanced. Sometimes people think too much about the environment and they sacrifice humans.\xa0\n“Sometimes we think about people and profit and we don’t take care of the environment,” he said.\nAlthough his income has decreased, he was aware that many Balinese fared worse than him as a result of the pandemic.\xa0\nMany on the popular tourist destination island had lost their jobs and were forced to return to their villages with little savings.\xa0\nYasa also noted that Bali has other problems, such as plastic pollution.\xa0\nIn the meantime, he felt many people relied on handouts, especially during the pandemic, without thinking they need to give back to mother Earth or society.\nHence, in May last year, he launched Plastic Exchange in his hometown in Tabanan to give people 1kg of rice in exchange for 1kg of plastic waste.\xa0\n“It was a word of mouth initiative. Nowadays, we have WhatsApp groups, so people spread the news in their groups.\xa0\n“This programme is not an obligation. If people want rice, they can collect plastic.\xa0\n“If they want to clean up their house (and clear\xa0plastic waste), we will give them a positive reward,” he told CNA.\nThere were also some villagers who helped spread the news by putting up flyers in local food stalls.\xa0\xa0\nWhat started from\xa0just one village has now grown into an initiative in 200 villages across Bali.\xa0\nIndonesia is the world’s second-biggest ocean plastic polluter after China, and Bali’s pristine nature spots such as its sandy beaches have often become a dumping ground for plastic.\xa0\nWhen Yasa was born in 1966, plastic was not a huge problem on the Island of the Gods.\xa0\nLife was simple back then, he recalled.\xa0\n“In my village, we didn’t grow up with money. We lived in our village with a barter system.\xa0\n“So if we needed something like spices or rice, we would go to the neighbours and exchange with something else. The barter system established a human connection and you cannot put a value on that,” Yasa said.\xa0\nThe barter system he learned as a child eventually became the foundation of Plastic Exchange.\nBy the time Yasa was in university, he realised there was a lot of plastics on the island polluting the environment.\nThe problem intensified over the years and in 2019 the Balinese government banned single-use plastic.\nBy participating in Plastic Exchange, people feel the immediate impact - free rice and a cleaner house.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nSince it is not mandatory to join, there is no pressure, Yasa noted.\xa0\nPlastic Exchange accepts all kinds of plastics, including single-use plastic like plastic packaging as well as reusable ones like buckets.\nOther recyclables - cardboards, papers, cans and beer bottles - are also welcome but villagers must sort the waste before dropping them at the village’s plastic bank.\xa0\nPeople are encouraged to bring their waste to the trash bank once a month and in exchange, they will receive rice according to the amount and type of plastics they have.\xa0\nInitially, people would hand in 1kg of plastic waste and Yasa would give them 1kg of rice, which is enough to feed four people a day.\xa0\nAs more people became interested in the programme, he decided that people must collect about 4kg of waste for 1kg of rice.\xa0\nSince Bali does not yet have a recycling plant, he works with a company that collects the plastics and sends them to Java for recycling.\nAt the start of the initiative, Yasa had to buy the rice with his own money.\nAlthough his business was suffering from COVID-19, he was determined to buy the rice from local farmers and only give people good quality rice.\n“The rice must come from that particular village.

      Cash-for-recycling programme among initiatives under PAP’s new green plan for towns 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Residents in towns managed by the People’s Action Party (PAP) will be encouraged to adopt a zero waste lifestyle, through a cash-for-recycling programme\xa0and more paper recycling machines set up in their estate, the party announced on Saturday (Dec 4).\nUnder its Action for Green Towns (AGT) initiative, the party has set a target of deploying at least 78 paper recycling machines across its 15 towns by the end of the month, in partnership with SGRecycle.\nResidents will first have to scan a QR code on the machine to register, before depositing their items. They will get 6 cents per 1kg of paper or cardboard recycled. This will be stored in their digital wallets before being credited to their bank accounts.\nWhen the COVID-19 situation improves, outreach programmes will be conducted to raise awareness of these machines among residents, PAP added in its press release. \nAll PAP town councils have also pledged to reduce paper use. For instance, by implementing electronic payments to contractors instead of issuing cheques when possible.\nThese were among a slew of initiatives announced by the party on Saturday, months after it first unveiled its Action for Green Towns initiative.\xa0\nLaunched in May, the initiative aims to galvanise various stakeholders to work towards making every PAP-managed town ""zero waste, energy efficient and greener"" by 2025. \nAs part of the initiative, all of the PAP’s 15 town councils has a Member of Parliament (MP) as a ""sustainability champion"". \nThese 15 individuals, together with Young PAP representatives, form the Action for Green Towns task force led by chairperson of Jalan Besar Town Council Dr Wan Rizal.\nSpeaking at a press conference on Saturday, Dr Wan Rizal said in coming up with the plans, the taskforce took stock of what each town was doing in terms of sustainability.\n“We came out with a report card, and this report clearly shows what they’ve done over the years and how much impact it made,” said Dr Wan Rizal.\nHe added that the report card covered three categories including zero waste, energy efficiency, as well as green town.\n“(At) a very fundamental level, we are all doing our part, but can we go further to reduce carbon footprint? I think that is the direction that we want to go. But as I mentioned, we want to take small steps as possible to get more people on board,” he added.\nMore than 3,000 lifts across PAP towns will be replaced by 2025 with more reliable and “electricity-saving” models when they reach their recommended lifespan, said the party. \nTo further improve energy efficiency, all PAP town councils will introduce electricity saving specifications in the lift replacement programmes. \n“New lift models save electricity with features such as energy regeneration systems, LED displays, LED lights with sensors, better ventilation,” said the party in a press release.\nCurrently, almost all the common area lights in PAP-managed estates have been changed to energy-saving LED lights. \n“This has helped us save 1,413 million kWh of energy, equivalent to powering 313,665 four-room HDB homes for a year, and reduce over 586,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions,” said\xa0Coordinating Chair of PAP Town Councils Lim Biow Chuan,\xa0adding that it has also provided more reliable lighting for residents.\nTo further reduce energy usage, the party said it intends to progressively incorporate smart sensors across its towns when the LED lights are due to be replaced. \n“The lights with smart sensors will provide more reliable light as they can be remotely monitored,” said PAP. It added that this measure is expected to reduce up to 62 million kWh of energy usage by 2025, equivalent to the energy used by 14,452 four-room HDB homes in a year.\nBy 2023, all of the party’s town councils will implement equipment to convert fallen leaves and branches into mulch, in order to reduce waste and carbon footprint from transporting excess plant material.\nMore greenery will also be incorporated when PAP town councils redesign and refresh public spaces in order to\xa0allow residents to enjoy more nature and cooler temperatures.\n', 'related_topics': [""     People's Action Party "", '     environment ', '     Recycling ']}"

      Lightweight, faster charge time: Indonesian researchers use coffee grounds to power EV batteries
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Indonesia is one of the world’s top coffee growers and its coffee grounds may have been given a new lease of life, after researchers found a use for them as a lithium battery component.\xa0\nThe team from the University of Indonesia in Depok have found a way to process coffee grounds into graphite, a form of carbon, which can be added into the anode active material within electric vehicle (EV) batteries, amid the country’s ambition to become a key player in the EV industry.\nThey have also found a way to transform coconut shell waste into activated carbon, which can be added to the anode active material as well.\nAnode active material in lithium batteries enables electric current to flow through the external circuit, while allowing the absorption of lithium ions released from the cathode.\xa0\nTheir research was announced by the university earlier this month.\xa0\nHead of the research team Professor Anne Zulfia Syahrial told CNA that their lithium-ion battery is made out of lithium titanate oxide (LTO), which produces a more stable electric current compared to graphite lithium batteries used in most EVs.\nLTO is not prone to short circuits during the charging process, she said. However, the capacity of LTO is 175 mAh/g, less than that of graphite at 372 mAh/g.\n“And this is why we tried to mix tin or silicon and activated carbon from coconut shell waste into a composite. We also process coffee grounds and even plastic waste into graphene to be mixed with LTO,” said Prof Syahrial.\nHer colleague Bambang Priyono said this results in lighter battery weight and faster charging time as compared to a graphite lithium battery.\nThe LTO’s weight could be 200kg lighter than batteries that are typically used in EVs these days. The latter weighs\xa0around 500kg.\nWhen the battery is lighter, the car’s mileage can be enhanced.\xa0\n“We found that in coffee grounds waste, the particles can produce nanoparticles with good surface area conditions.\xa0\n“The better the condition of the surface area, the more ions exist which can produce better energy,” Mr Priyono explained.\nThe team’s battery needs about 30 minutes to be fully charged. Most EV batteries need up to two hours to be fully charged.\xa0\nThe researchers are now trying to reduce the charging time to a mere 15 minutes. \nINDONESIA’S EV BATTERIES AMBITION\nIndonesia is the world’s largest producer of nickel ore which is the main material to produce lithium batteries.\xa0\nIn 2019, it produced 800,000 metric tons of nickel ore, or about 29.6 per cent of the world’s total, according to the investment ministry.\nBatteries are key components in EVs, and are believed to contribute about 25 per cent to 40 per cent of the vehicle’s cost.\nIn September, President Joko Widodo inaugurated the construction of the country’s first EV battery factory in Karawang, West Java.\nWith an investment of US$1.1 billion, it is also the first EV battery facility in Southeast Asia. It is scheduled to start production in 2024.\xa0\nOn Nov 17, Mr Widodo said that the government is encouraging various efforts to increase the production of electric and hybrid vehicles in a bid to establish\xa0an environmentally friendly and low emissions EV\xa0ecosystem.\n“We are also pushing for the production of electric vehicles, the production of hybrid vehicles, but again, all of them must be environmentally friendly,” he said while visiting an international auto show in Banten.\nEnvironmentalists have pointed out that Indonesia’s ambition to convert nickel into batteries would require it to use a lot of energy. The archipelago is heavily reliant on coal for its energy mix and is one of the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters.\nThus, the move may not be as environmentally friendly as initially thought.\nHOW THE IDEA CAME ABOUT\nThe team, which comprises Prof Syahrial, Mr Priyono and several students, took three years to develop the LTO battery. They had to juggle their various responsibilities, while navigating the challenges brought by COVID-19 which limited their movements.\nThe idea to use coffee grounds occurred because they noticed that Indonesia has a lot of unused coffee grounds as it is a major coffee producer, said Mr Priyono.\nIt is also one of the world’s biggest plastic ocean polluters and the researchers wanted to tackle both problems at the same time.\nThey started out by taking coffee grounds from the university’s cafeteria for their research.\xa0\n“It turns out that coffee grounds can be processed into graphene to increase LTO conductivity in lithium-ion batteries,” said Mr Priyono. He added that the team may look into different types of coffee in the future to determine what kind of grounds works best as graphite.\n“This lithium battery can be used for a lot of things, not just electric vehicles,” Mr Priyono stated.\n“But electric vehicles would have the biggest outreach and the impact can be felt by many. Especially for Indonesia so it does not need to import oil and gas, and now that Indonesia aims to be a big player in the EV industry.”\xa0\nProcessing the coffee grounds is fairly easy, he said, as it just takes a few hours.\n1. Wash coffee grounds with ethanol\n2. Dry the coffee grounds at 120 degrees Celsius for 2 hours\n3. Heat coffee grounds at 150 degrees Celsius for 6 hours\xa0\n4. Filter and dry the residue\n5. Decompose the residue at 900 degrees Celsius for 3 hours\n6. Disperse the particles in 10% sulfuric acid\n7. Examine the carbon\n8. Graphene is formed\nThe team also said that the LTO\xa0battery they invented could\xa0be used to store energy in solar panels if the authorities are committed to moving away from fossil fuels and turning to renewables.\nProf Syahrial also said that any type of plastic can be converted into graphene layers.\xa0\n“We will still need to examine which has the best characteristics between coffee grounds, plastic waste or coconut shell waste. All three of them are good but we need to find out which has the best characteristics and then we will use that moving forward,” she said.\xa0\xa0\nThere have been queries on how many batteries the team can produce. However, as university researchers, they cannot produce the product in high volume without the help of major manufacturers.\n“Our team consists of students, they have different tasks each semester. We are not like industries which can work on something immediately,” said Mr Priyono.\xa0\n“As long as the manufacturing industry is willing to produce it, we are ready to help.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     electric vehicles ', '     electricity ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Firms like Amazon want to be ESG-friendly but have unaccounted long supply chains
  </h1>, 'text': 'BALTIMORE, Maryland: If you own stocks, chances are good you have heard the term ESG. It stands for environmental, social and governance, and it\'s a way to laud corporate leaders who take sustainability - including climate change - and social responsibility seriously, and punish those who do not.\nIn less than two decades since a United Nations report drew attention to the concept, ESG investing has evolved into a US$35 trillion industry.\nMoney managers overseeing one-third of total US assets under management said they used ESG criteria in 2020, and by 2025 global assets managed in portfolios labelled ""ESG"" are expected to reach US$53 trillion.\nThese investments have gained momentum in part because they cater to investors\' growing desire to have a positive impact on society. By quantifying a company\'s actions and outcomes on environmental, social and governance issues, ESG measures offer investors a way to make informed trading decisions.\nHowever, investors\' trust in ESG funds may be misplaced. As scholars in the field of supply chain management and sustainable operations, we see a major flaw in how rating agencies, such as Bloomberg, MSCI and Sustainalytics, are measuring companies\' ESG risk: The performance of their supply chains.\nNearly every company\'s operations are backed by a global supply chain that consists of workers, information and resources. To accurately measure a company\'s ESG risks, its end-to-end supply chain operations must be considered.\nOur recent examination of ESG measures shows that most ESG rating agencies do not measure companies\' ESG performance from the lens of the global supply chains supporting their operations.\nFor example, Bloomberg\'s ESG measure lists ""supply chain"" as an item under the ""S"" (social) pillar. By this measure, supply chains are treated separately from other items, such as carbon emissions, climate change effects, pollutants and human rights.\nThis means all those items, if not captured in the ambiguous ""supply chain"" metric, reflect each company\'s own actions but not their supply chain partners\'.\nEven when companies collect their suppliers\' performance, ""selective reporting"" can arise because there is no unified reporting standard.\nOne recent study found that companies tend to report environmentally responsible suppliers and conceal ""bad"" suppliers, effectively ""greenwashing"" their supply chain.\nCarbon emissions are another example. Many companies, such as Timberland, have claimed great successes in reducing emissions from their own operations. Yet the emissions from their supply chain partners and customers, known as ""Scope 3 emissions"", may remain high. \nESG rating agencies have not been able to adequately include Scope 3 emissions because of a lack of data: Only 19 per cent of companies in the manufacturing industry and 22 per cent in the service industry disclose this data.\nMore broadly, without accounting for a company\'s entire supply chain, ESG measures fail to reflect global supply chain networks that today\'s big and small companies alike depend on for their day-to-day operations.\nAmazon, for example, is among ESG funds\' largest and favourite holdings. As a company bigger than Walmart in terms of annual sales, Amazon has reported emissions from shipping that are only one-seventh of Walmart\'s.\nBut when researchers for two advocacy groups reviewed public data on imports, they found only about 15 per cent of Amazon\'s ocean shipments could be tracked.\nIn addition, Amazon\'s figure does not reflect emissions generated by its many third-party sellers and their suppliers who operate outside the US\nThis difference matters: Whereas Walmart\'s supply chain relies on a centralised procurement strategy, Amazon\'s supply chain is highly decentralised - a large percentage of its revenue comes from third-party suppliers, about 40 per cent of which sell directly from China, which further complicates emissions tracking and reporting.\nAnother important ESG metric concerns consumer protection. Amazon prides itself as ""Earth\'s most customer-centric company.""\nHowever, when its customers have been injured by products sold by third-party sellers on its platform, Amazon has argued that it should not be held liable for the damage, because it functions as an ""online marketplace"" matching buyers and sellers.\nAmazon\'s foreign third-party sellers are often not subject to US\xa0jurisdiction so can\'t be held accountable. Yet major ESG rating agencies do not appear to reflect the supply chain implication on customer protection when measuring Amazon supply chain performance.\nFor example, in 2020, MSCI, the largest ESG ratings agency, upgraded Amazon\'s ESG rating from BB to BBB, reflecting its strength in areas such as corporate governance and data security, despite its consumer liability risk.\nThese gaps are also concerns for ratings of companies such as 3M, ExxonMobil and Tesla.\nCurrently there is no unified reporting standard, so different companies may cherry-pick certain ESG performance measures to report to boost their sustainability and social ratings.\nTo improve consistency, the next step would be for ESG rating agencies to redesign their methodology to take into account what may be environmentally harmful and unethical operations across the entire global supply chain.\nESG rating agencies could, for example, create incentives for companies to collect and disclose their supply chain partners\' activities, such as Scope 3 emissions.\nIn June 2021, the German Parliament passed the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which will become effective in 2023. Under this new law, large companies based in Germany will be responsible for social and environmental issues arising from their global supply chain networks.\nThis includes prohibitions on child labour and forced labour, and attention to occupational health and safety throughout the entire supply chain. Those who violate the law face a fine of up to 2 per cent of their annual revenues.\nThe European Union\'s new Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which went into effect in March 2021, adds pressure in a different way.\nIt requires funds to report details on how they integrate ESG characteristics into their investment decisions. That has led some money managers to drop the phrase ""ESG integrated"" from some of their assets, Bloomberg reported.\nWithout similar laws in the US, we believe ESG rating agencies could fill an important gap. To be sure, surveying a company\'s entire supply chain\'s ESG performance is far more complex.\nYet by tying all the ESG dimensions to a company\'s supply chain end-to-end operations, rating agencies can nudge corporate leaders to be responsible for actions across their supply chains that would otherwise be kept in the dark.\nTinglong Dai is a professor of operations management and business analytics at John Hopkins University, and Christopher S Tang is a professor of supply chain management at University of California, Los Angeles.

       Indonesia has announced an ambitious mangrove rehabilitation plan, but it could be an uphill climb
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Treading carefully on bamboo walkways perched above the swamp, several top Indonesian officials arrived at Jakarta’s nature park Angke Kapuk on Oct 13, ready to plant mangrove shrubs to launch the 2021 National Mangrove Map.\xa0\nThey clapped, and then lowered the shrubs into the water.\xa0\nAlong Indonesia’s coastline lies more than 3.3 million ha of mangrove forests. This accounts for about 23 per cent of all mangrove ecosystems in the world.\nOut of this, around 600,000 ha of them have been damaged. Earlier this year, the government set an ambitious target to rehabilitate all of the damaged mangroves by 2024.\xa0\xa0\nThe national mangrove map, which was launched by Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan, Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar, and Head of the Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM) Hartono during the October event, will be the database and reference for mangrove restoration in the country.\n“This one mangrove map is the right step to continue working to rehabilitate mangroves according to the president\'s agenda,” said Mr Pandjaitan.\nSignalling a sound of optimism,\xa0Mdm Bakar added: “We have many experiences from the late 1990s and 2003 on how to transform fish ponds and rehabilitate them into mangrove ecosystems.”\nWhile those interviewed by CNA noted the importance of restoring damaged mangroves in Indonesia, they are also well aware of the multiple challenges that lie ahead.\xa0\nThe country’s success depends on the mangroves’ regeneration period after replanting, availability of funding and public education, among other factors.\nMangroves can absorb up to five times more carbon emission than a tree in an upland area. Hence, they are important especially in fighting climate change.\nVarious studies have shown that mangroves and the soil beneath them can store up to 89 tonnes of carbon per ha. Under carbon emission trading schemes, which is an approach to tackle climate change by creating a market with limited allowances for emissions, the stored carbon can be traded.\xa0\nMangrove trees in Indonesia can grow as high as 50m. During high tide, they are usually flooded. Nevertheless, mangroves can withstand large waves and act as a barrier against tsunamis, protecting residents in coastal areas.\nThey can also be processed for consumption or sale, not to mention the potential for ecotourism.\nHowever, many mangroves have been damaged due to natural reasons or human behaviour, said Ms Khesyia Abigail Makhas, a climate analyst with non-governmental organisation World Resources Institute (WRI) Indonesia and her colleague Mr Arief Wijaya, senior manager for climate and ocean issues when interviewed by CNA.\n“Naturally, they could be damaged due to high waves, for example when sea level rises, or there are storms that can damage them,” said Ms Makhas.\nAdditionally, Ms Makhas said that WRI Indonesia has found that the biggest contributor to mangrove destruction in Indonesia is the establishment of ponds as mangroves trees must be cleared to make way for their construction.\xa0\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in 2007 that Indonesia had lost 40 per cent of its mangroves in the last 30 years mainly due to conversion of land for shrimp farms, excessive logging, conversion of land to agriculture or salt pans, oil spills and pollution.\xa0\nAnother problem is plastic waste. “Mangroves’ roots are for breathing and if they are covered with plastic, they can’t breathe,” Ms Makhas explained.\nIndustrial waste is also another factor. “Even though one of the tasks of mangroves is to neutralise substances … they have their limits,” said Ms Makhas.\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Iqbal Damanik said some other causes of mangrove destruction are the establishment of settlements, plantations, as well as infrastructure in coastal areas such as reclamation, roads and ports.\nThe Indonesian government has pledged to slash 29 per cent of carbon emissions by 2030, or 41 per cent with international help.\nThe rehabilitation of mangroves is part of the effort to meet the target, said government officials.\nEarlier this month, President Joko Widodo mentioned the 600,000 ha rehabilitation target in his speech at the World Leaders Summit held at the global climate change conference COP26 in Glasgow.\nAlso in Glasgow, Mr Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister, said that Indonesia’s mangrove restoration programme is the largest in the world, while vice environment and forestry minister Alue Dohong stated that Indonesia is very serious about conserving its mangrove forests.\nIn a panel discussion held at the sidelines of COP26 on Nov 5, Mr Dohong said that Indonesia is initiating the development of a World Mangrove Centre (WMC) with the support of the German government.\n“The WMC will bridge, coordinate and strengthen the collaboration among all stakeholders at all levels in various countries to support mangrove forest management,” he said, while calling for the international community to cooperate and share knowledge and experiences in sustainable mangrove management.\nMr Yaya Ihya Ulumuddin, a researcher with the Oceanographic Research Centre of the National Innovation Research Agency (BRIN) who is involved in the establishment of the 2021 national mangrove map, said that Indonesia’s target to restore mangroves is extraordinary.\n“Because it is big and in previous years it only managed to restore dozens of thousand ha, not hundreds of thousand ha, this is very huge,” said Mr Ulumuddin.\nDespite the level of ambition, Mr Ulumuddin said whether Indonesia will ultimately meet the target depends on how it defines restoration or rehabilitation of mangroves.\n“Rehabilitation means that after an activity, the forest must exist. But if the definition is the number of mangroves being planted or the planted area, I think that is achievable by 2024.”\n“For mangroves to be forests again, that would need at least five years after replanting. That’s the fastest rate,” he said.\nFunding is a real challenge. Mdm Ayu Dewi Utari, secretary of the BRGM, said that initially, the agency was given the target to restore 83,000 ha of mangroves this year. But due to rising COVID-19 cases which lead to budget constraints, the target for this year was lowered to 33,000 ha in 32 provinces.\n“So far we have replanted about 30,000 ha. The budget is not only from the state revenue budget, but also from corporate social responsibilities programmes, philanthropies, and loans or grants,” she said.\n“In 2021, we hope we can at least restore 53,000 from various sources of funds,” Mdm Utari told CNA.\nThere are other impediments, she said. For instance, when mangrove areas have been converted to ponds, the authorities cannot simply replant them. They will need to engage the fishermen, who do not necessarily understand the function of mangroves, in the replanting process.\nThus, the BRGM needs to educate fishermen on the importance of mangroves. It has introduced silvofishery, a form of low input aquaculture integrating mangrove trees with brackish water aquaculture, she highlighted.\nShe added that when the mangroves that are to be rehabilitated are situated on the coast, this makes the trees vulnerable to waves and pollution. There are also times when seawater conditions do not support growth and end up encouraging the growth of pests.\nGiven the various challenges, Mr Damanik from Greenpeace Indonesia said there must be clear indicators of success while protecting the remaining mangroves.\n“The rehabilitation figures are not a guarantee for trees to grow. To become a mature tree, according to forest ecology, there are four stages.\n“The process takes 15 to 20 years. From what we know, forest rehabilitation is only the first stage, the rest is left to natural processes. So one way to ensure this is to continue to protect the environment,"" said Mr Damanik.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ', '     climate change ']}"

      COP26: Singapore calls for ‘clear roadmap’ to keep 1.5 degrees within reach
  </h1>, 'text': ""GLASGOW: Singapore has called for “urgent collective action to address the global climate crisis”\xa0during the delivery of its\xa0national statement at COP26 on Tuesday (Nov 9).\nMinister for Sustainability and Environment\xa0Grace Fu\xa0said that multilateral cooperation was essential to delivering successful outcomes at the negotiations in Glasgow. She also committed Singapore to further reviewing and enhancing its future climate goals.“COP26 must provide a clear roadmap on how to keep 1.5 degrees within reach,” she said. “International climate change cooperation is key to achieving an outcome that is far greater than the sum of our parts.”“We are a densely populated small city-state with no hinterland and limited access to renewable energy, we do not shy away from taking bold actions,” she said.Ms Fu highlighted several priority areas for Singapore at COP26, including completing negotiations under the Paris Agreement Work Programme.The minister has been involved in high-level talks to operationalise Article 6, which covers cooperation among countries to meet their emissions reduction targets, including through international carbon markets.She also called for “a strong climate finance package for developing countries”, a key aspect of negotiations. During COP26, poorer nations bearing the brunt of climate change impacts have renewed demands for U$100 billion in annual financing to mitigate and adapt, funds that have largely not been mobilised.In calling for other countries to come forward with ambitious climate targets and low emissions strategies, Ms Fu told the conference that the Singapore Green Plan 2030 had set out “concrete near-term plans” to achieve the country's net zero aspiration. Climate action this decade is considered essential if the planet is to avoid excessive temperature rise, which would see devastating impacts across the globe.\u200b\u200bSoutheast Asia will experience a range of worsening conditions and disasters, including dangerous heatwaves, intense rain events, powerful tropical cyclones and coastal cities inundated by rising sea levels.\nMs Fu also encouraged “effective partnerships and alliances to harness low-carbon technologies”, while highlighting Singapore’s efforts to ramp up the deployment of solar energy infrastructure, capping private vehicle growth and phasing out internal combustion engines, planting one million more trees by 2030 and further greening the country’s urban environment. Singapore is looking at international collaboration in areas such as carbon markets and regional power grids, and working to tap low carbon energy imports from Indonesia, Malaysia and Laos. The government has set a target to import 30 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2035.\n“How fast we can move also depends on the development and maturity of emerging low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and low-carbon hydrogen. As and when international collaborations and new enabling technologies materialise, we will review and enhance our climate goals,” she said in Singapore's full COP26 statement submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThroughout COP26, Singapore has signed up to several partnership coalitions: The Powering Past Coal Alliance, the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement, the Global Methane Pledge, the Greening Government Initiative (GGI) and the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C).\n“The climate crisis is a wicked problem too big for any country to solve alone. Each country must pursue clear and effective climate actions that represent its highest possible ambition, in the light of its size, resource endowment, capabilities and constraints. Our national circumstances may be different, but the problem is a shared one,” Minister Fu said in the full submissions.“Nations cannot do this alone. To achieve an effective transition to a net zero future, we need ‘all hands on deck’.”\nOther nations which\xa0were represented by a head of state at COP26 delivered their statements during the leaders summit in the first two days of the climate change conference. Ministerial level statements were reserved for an additional segment during the second week of proceedings.Negotiations are slated to end on Friday.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     COP26 ', '     Grace Fu ', '     environment ', '     Singapore Green Plan ']}"

      From Philippines to COP26: Mother and daughter unite to fight for Indigenous people’s climate change rights
  </h1>, 'text': 'GLASGOW: Vicky and Jing Tauli-Corpuz got their visas to travel to the United Kingdom for global climate change talks at COP26 only six hours before their scheduled flight.\xa0\nAmid the pandemic, arranging travel to Glasgow from the Philippines was a task that required more patience and resilience\xa0than usual. They are attributes well suited to this mother and daughter, both now relative veterans of the international negotiating circles.Both are proud Kankana-ey Igorot women, Indigenous peoples from the Cordillera region of the Philippines. For years, they have been leading voices in the fight for climate change justice and rights for Indigenous peoples and local communities, not just in their home region but all around the world.The plight of Indigenous groups has been included as a discussion point during COP26 but it still largely remains a peripheral topic. That is despite Indigenous people protecting about 80 per cent of the biodiversity remaining across the globe.New research shows that land amounts to 958 million ha\xa0in countries spanning most of the world’s endangered tropical forests, sequestering 250 billion metric tonnes of carbon.\n“That itself is evidence that we are doing the right thing, despite the fact that our rights are always violated,” said\xa0Vicky, the former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n“Those kinds of evidence are important to come into the picture because that is what will strengthen the bid of Indigenous peoples to convince the dominant society that different forms of knowledge - traditional knowledge - should really have a place in coming up with solutions that we are looking for.""\nThe bureaucratic and structural barriers to inclusion and recognition at these types of conferences are real. Vicky and Jing understand how to navigate the hallways and the language associated. But they know it can be exclusionary for many others, who can be left behind as a result.It is estimated that some two-thirds of civil society organisations that would be expected to attend COP stayed at home, due to logistics, expenses and the global pandemic. Many of them are from the global south, typically poorer nations with fewer resources to mitigate or adapt to climate change, which they largely have not contributed significantly towards.“Knowledge holders from other regions weren’t able to come. Some of them have no passports. For some of them, their visa applications are still pending. So there you can see the inequity between the developed and the developing,"" said Jing, a biologist, lawyer and member of Nia Tero, a US-based foundation that supports Indigenous guardianship.Meantime, environmental destruction continues unabated in many regions, ravaging the custodial lands of increasingly exposed and marginalised communities.“Many Indigenous commitments live in the most vulnerable ecosystems, whether that be the Arctic, low lying islands or very high mountains. When there are hurricanes, or cyclones or floods, these are the places that are really impacted very much,” the elderly Vicky said.“It’s not just the direct impacts of climate change but also some of the solutions that are provided, that are pushed, but are not really respecting the rights of Indigenous peoples.”\n""WE COME FROM THE MOUNTAINS""\nThe Tauli-Corpuz story is rooted in a dedication to protect their home - the village of Payeo in the Besao Mountain province. In areas all around it, they have observed large mining and dam projects devastate natural ecosystems and leave damage to the landscape.While they say that the pristine nature in their land has been mostly preserved, now climate change is bringing impacts that are seemingly unstoppable.\n“We come from the mountains. Our people are very much tied to the land, most are farmers and a lot of the farming cycles take cues from nature,” Jing said.“Usually when a certain bird comes in that signals that it’s time to start planting. Those patterns have been changed now, so they’ve had to adapt to the changes and then you have more extreme events now. “Before we came here, there were two storms that came at the same time. It was really lashing the mountains. The winds were very strong and in mountains, landslides are a problem. And for the first time there was flooding, which is weird for a mountain town,” she said.\nThe key to being resilient to these shifting challenges will be money. And more of it, as a result of COP26, will be directed to helping Indigenous communities deal with climate change.\xa0\nThe UK, Norway, Germany, the US, and the Netherlands, in partnership with 17 funders, pledged last week to invest US$1.7 billion, a significant increase in funds directly available to forest groups and communities, which is currently predicted to be only US$46 million annually.\nIn addition, more than 100 countries signed a pledge to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 as a tool to combat climate change and limit global temperature rise.\nYet, despite the signatories including some of the world’s largest forest custodians, including Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, most countries in Southeast Asia did not make the commitment, despite the clear role forests play in absorbing nearly one-third of all carbon emissions\nHelping the right people get access to this money is high on the duo\'s agenda. They know that finance on paper does not necessarily mean funds available on the ground.\n“Sometimes the requirements are so difficult and Indigenous people cannot comply with all the reporting requirements, the financial requirements, so that’s a big challenge,” Jing said.“All of this money that has been pledged, mechanisms should be developed so that they can distribute the money equitably and directly to Indigneous peoples.\n“In a sense, it’s physically exhausting\xa0and it’s also mentally exhausting. You know there’s an urgency and when you see the negotiating rooms, it’s as\xa0though they don’t feel it. They don’t know that this issue is very urgent. It’s a matter of life and death literally,” she said.\nAs for teaming as a family unit, both have found ways to harmonise their endeavours and advocacy. It was an accident, they say, that both are often in the same rooms fighting the same causes.\n“I think it helps that we speak the same language, we know the processes and we’re able to enrich each other’s knowledge and sensitivity of the politics, because we know these different spaces. So we reinforce each other. We complement each other at this stage,” Jing said.\nVicky jokes that the power and enthusiasm and knowledge of young people might mean she can retire soon. But Jing is not so sure.Regardless, their mission going forward is as clear as the streams that still flow through their land.\n“Our places are very beautiful, we have high mountains, we have thick forests and of course rivers that are clean up to now,” Vicky said.\xa0\n“What else can we ask for? We’d like to just maintain it that way.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     COP26 ', '     Philippines ', '     environment ']}"

They\xa0are among the last few remaining patches of such habitats on mainland Singapore.\nThese are a\xa010ha coastal hill forest and a rocky shore. The 2.5ha coastal beach forest that will be restored lies between the hill forest and the sea.\nThese habitats contain a rich variety of flora and fauna, including more than 100 bird species, 41 butterfly species, 15 mangrove species and four seagrass species.\nThe coastal beach forest will be planted with native coastal species, including the locally critically endangered penaga laut and sea teak.\nAside from being an ecological buffer for the coastal hill forest, the plants in this\xa0area are\xa0also a source of food and shelter for animals, especially\xa0pollinators and dispersers such as birds, bats and butterflies.\nThe rocky shore of Labrador Nature Reserve is notable for being the last remaining natural rocky shore on mainland Singapore.\nThe habitat comprises\xa0coral rubble, sandy substrates and seagrass beds, with rich intertidal faunal diversity, says NParks.\nIntertidal surveys have recorded a wide variety of\xa0marine species, including blue-spotted fantail rays, eagle rays\xa0and blacktip reef sharks.\nThe coastal hill forest\xa0houses plants that grow\xa0on land next to the sea and are tolerant to salt exposure and poorer soil conditions, including some very rare species, said\xa0NParks.\nNative species, including\xa0the critically endangered broad-leaf fern, are being planted on its slopes.\xa0The edges of the forest are also being extended through the planting of native coastal plants.\nThe Keppel Coastal Trail, for which Keppel Corporation has made a S$1 million contribution, will weave through the coastal beach forest,\xa0providing\xa0views of the and\xa0information boards about\xa0coastal habitats, said\xa0NParks.\nBeyond the restoration efforts, the Government will also study how to enhance connectivity between the nature reserve and its surrounding green areas, said Mr Lee.\nMr Lee announced\xa0the restoration plan for Labrador Nature Reserve on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Tree Planting Day, which was established by former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.\n""As a very small city-state, we face intense land-use challenges, as we seek to balance the many needs of a country, within the limits of our city,"" he said.\n""And as our people\'s aspirations grow and as our society evolves, we will need land to provide even more housing, healthcare and other amenities.""\nSingapore\'s ambition to be a ""City in Nature"" involves ""finding more innovative ways to weave nature into the fabric of our\xa0city"", said Mr Lee.\n""(This is) so that nature can thrive right in the heart of our city-state, and for Singaporeans to enjoy the benefits of nature for generations to come.""\nThe Forest Restoration Action Plan for Labrador Nature Reserve sets out future restoration efforts up to 2030.\n', 'related_topics': ['     NParks ', '     environment ', '     conservation ']}"

      Southern California enacts new smog rules on refineries
  </h1>, 'text': 'DIAMOND BAR, California:\xa0Southern California air regulators on Friday (Nov 5) approved new restrictions on area oil refineries and other factories that could remove tons of smog-forming pollutants from the air.\nThe board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted rule changes requiring emissions limits on oxides of nitrogen that will affect nine refineries and seven plants that produce asphalt, biofuel plants, hydrogen and sulfuric acid.\nOxides of nitrogen, collectively known as NOx, form when fuel is burned at high temperatures. The gases can be produced by cars and industrial sources such as refineries and power plants. They are a key ingredient in producing ozone pollution.\nThe new rules will reduce NOx emissions by around eight tons per day over the next 14 years, with nearly half of the reductions expected by 2023 and will go a long way to helping the region meet some federal air quality standards by 2031, the AQMD said.\n“Once implemented, this rule will have immediate benefits to our air quality, especially for those living near these facilities who are directly impacted,” AQMD board Chair Ben J\xa0Benoit said in the statement. “We estimate the public health benefits achieved through this rule will help avoid 370 premature deaths and more than 6,200 asthma attacks.”\nThe rules apply to some 300 pieces of combustion equipment at the facilities such as boilers and gas turbines. The rules, which will be implemented over a decade, provide two ways of meeting the new requirements and also ban refineries from purchasing credits to offset pollution they produce.\nThe total cost of implementing the new rules is projected at about US$2.3 billion but the reduction in health costs from pollution is expected to be about US$2.6 billion, according to a September AQMD study session.\nThe Western States Petroleum Association, representing oil companies, called it “a strong rule"".\n“The industry is committed to ensuring the rule is successful by making substantial investments to reduce emissions,” Patty Senecal, director for the association’s Southern California region, told the Daily Breeze.\nThe vote also was applauded by environmental groups.\n“These reductions are crucially important; Southern California suffers from some of the dirtiest air in the nation and fails to meet state and national air quality standards,"" said a statement from the Coalition for Clean Air.\nThe coalition said most of the state\'s oil refinery capacity is located in and around the Los Angeles harbor neighborhood of Wilmington, nearby Carson and western Long Beach in areas with large low-income and minority populations.\n“Today’s vote is a win for clean air, the clean economy and environmental justice,” said Chris Chavez, the coalition\'s deputy policy director.\n', 'related_topics': ['     California ', '     pollution ', '     environment ']}"

      COP26: Young Filipino climate activist defies obstacles to raise his voice in Glasgow
  </h1>, 'text': 'GLASGOW, UK: As thousands of people stream through the centre of Glasgow on Friday (Nov 5), a young girl pauses, squeals in excitement and grabs the arm of her mother walking next to her.\n“I can see Greta!” The girl’s mother cranes her neck to try and spot the diminutive Swedish climate activist, another face in the moving wave of demonstrators but undoubtedly the most influential.The woman looks and then knowingly turns to me:\xa0“Greta is a rock star for these kids.""Thunberg has been a catalytic force in mobilising young people to demand more climate change action from the world’s most powerful people. In Glasgow, she has continued the movement and the momentum.\nIt is her organisation, Fridays for Future, that brought the crowds for action on this day - something that started as a one-person strike three years ago. It is also the organisation that found a way to bring activists from the most vulnerable climate affected countries in the world, those distant and forgotten, to Glasgow.One of those is Jon Bonifacio, a 24-year-old from the Philippines. He walks just metres away from Thunberg, part of a delegation of sorts, not made for the conference, but for the streets.His place is a precious one. COP26 has been labelled by many as the most inequitable and unfair iteration yet. The costs and logistics of reaching Glasgow, and the lack of access for those who have made it, have frozen out many, especially from the global south. Bonifacio is one of a handful of young people who have been able to make the journey from Southeast Asia. “Of course, a lot of the people who are getting the opportunities are based in Europe, they’re getting the badges, they’re getting the funding and there’s really a concerted effort on the part of the activists in the global north to shift those opportunities to the global south,” he said.“But this is just a subset of so many more who really need to have their voices heard at the conference.”\nBonifacio’s journey here has been one of awakening, and one that has taken years. He was studying medicine in Manila when he said he saw a map showing the future flooding that was forecast to affect the Philippine capital in decades to come.“The medical school that I was studying at was one of those places that would be underwater. It made me think, what am I doing?“There’s something that needs to be done when it comes to these issues. It made me realise that as a person it made more sense for me to take up climate activism full time instead of becoming a medical doctor,” he said.“Sometimes I wake up and I’m just frozen thinking about what it would be like living in those kinds of situations or scenarios because that\'s something I might experience within my lifetime right?”\nBonifacio has forsaken his budding medical career and is committed to the Youth Advocates for Climate Change Action Philippines (YACAP). He said he feels like stars have aligned to give him the change to amplify his voice in Glasgow.\nStill, he is reflective about the reality of the power discrepancy between young people like him, and those actually on the inside of the negotiating rooms. “It\'s definitely difficult because we\'re in the same conference area, yet it still feels like they\'re miles away,” he said. \n“Right now we’re just trying to maximise our opportunity by going to the places we can go to, specifically covering issues like adaptation because that’s a very big thing in Southeast Asia and in the Philippines in particular.\xa0 “If they\'re not going to let us in, we’re going to make sure that they can\'t ignore us as much as we can.”Loss and damage is a crucial goal for poorer nations that are already bearing the brunt of climate change without causing it, nor having benefited from extensive industrial development. The Philippines is among those.In the Paris Agreement, wealthy nations pledged to contribute US$100 billion annually to developing nations, with at least half going to adaptation. Overwhelmingly, this finance is not being mobilised and estimates are that much more finance needs to be made available. “I feel that they are not taking it seriously,” Bonifacio said. “These sorts of things are non negotiable. How can countries like the Philippines build themselves up in the context of so many problems and now they’re getting hit by all these climate impacts? “How can we really adapt without that support that essentially the global north owes to the global south?”\nIn a way, Bonifacio’s story is one of sacrifice. He, like many young activists, does not believe that they should have to be here, or be fighting every day normally to get climate change onto the agenda of decision makers.\n“I feel like it shouldn\'t have to be here to really beg, almost for our basic rights to a future. But you can start seeing that there is a world beyond those old white men who are making all the decisions,” he said.\n“There are people who are so active and so motivated to push for a better planet and better society. That’s what gives me inspiration to keep going.\n“When I think about the future, I think of the future as something that I alongside so many others activists are actively shaping. It’s not something we’re going to actively accept as it comes or going to be handed down to us from these leaders.\n“It’s something we’re going to grab from them and shape it into something for everyone: Something that is for people and the planet.”The march through Glasgow coincided with a day to focus on youth inside the COP26 venue. Climate change education and public empowerment were on the agenda, among ministerial diplomats and top voices of development agencies.But it was outside the conference that the boldest statements were being made. Bonifacio took the stage following the march, alongside multiple others from Colombia and Brazil and Uganda and others. His speech to the crowd was laced with anger and passion.“We are here and we will not be ignored.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     COP26 ', '     greta thunberg ', '     environment ', '     Philippines ', '     protests ']}"

      COP26: Indonesia needs more climate help from developed countries, Jokowi tells world leaders in Glasgow
  </h1>, 'text': ""GLASGOW: Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Monday (Nov 1) that developed economies need to contribute more funds and share technology in order for his country to ramp up its climate change efforts. \nIn his speech as part of the World Leaders Summit at the United Nations global climate change summit (COP 26), Widodo highlighted Indonesia’s efforts to use its abundant natural resources as a key strategy in lowering its carbon emissions, while describing climate change as a “major threat to global prosperity and development”.\n“With its abundant natural resources, Indonesia continues to contribute to tackling climate change,” he said.“We, countries with large green areas and re-greening potential, as well as countries with vast seas that have the potential to contribute to carbon sequestration, need support and contribution from developed countries.”\nDeveloping countries are pushing the world’s richest nations to deliver on a pledge to deliver US$100 billion in annual financing, which was initially agreed to as part of the Paris Agreement.\nSince then, those funds have largely not been mobilised. According to a new report released ahead of COP26, the funds are not expected to be provided until 2023.\nUnder its updated climate targets - known as Nationally Determined Contributions,\xa0submitted before COP26 - Indonesia outlined three pathways to a low carbon economy, the most ambitious being contingent on foreign assistance. \nThat path would see the country meet its Paris Agreement commitments and progress towards net zero emissions by 2060 or sooner. It also pledged that its most polluting sector - forestry and land use - would reach emissions peak by 2030.\n“Fulfilment of climate finance by developed partner countries is a game changer in climate change mitigation and adaptation for developing countries,” Widodo said.\n“Indonesia will be able to contribute faster to the world’s net zero emissions goal,” he added.“The question is, how big are developed countries' contributions for us? What kinds of transfers of technology will be provided? This creates action and implementation as quickly as possible.”\xa0\nThe challenges ahead of the world’s fourth most populous nation are steep, as it looks to protect and restore its vast forests and peatlands and reform an energy sector heavily reliant on fossil fuels.The president told the summit that deforestation in Indonesia had dropped to the lowest levels in 20 years, forest fires were down 82 per cent in 2020 and that the rehabilitation of huge areas of mangrove forests was underway.\xa0\nThe Indonesian government wants its forestry sector to be a net carbon sink that absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces by the end of this decade. Its national strategy still does not outlaw all deforestation, which has typically been driven by land clearance for palm oil and timber plantations in the past.\nWidodo also highlighted Indonesia’s efforts to develop an electric vehicle ecosystem, build Southeast Asia’s largest solar power plant as well as the world’s largest green industrial park in North Kalimantan.\nThat region is one that still relies heavily on coal production, an issue that is being hotly debated at COP26.\xa0\nThe UK, the host nation of COP26, has been pushing for a timeline to stop the burning of coal and end the building of new coal infrastructure, which Indonesia has not committed to.Leaders at the G20 Summit in Rome this week did reach an agreement to phase out overseas coal financing by this year.\nIndonesia is still staunchly reliant on coal - it is the second-largest producer of the resource and the biggest seaborne coal exporter.\xa0\nBut it has a roadmap for a massive rollout of various renewable energy infrastructure using new technologies, given the energy sector could become the country’s heaviest polluting industry within five years\nAlue Dohong, the country’s vice minister of Environment and Forestry, echoed his president’s message at COP26, telling CNA that Indonesia might be able to reach its net zero goal earlier than 2060 if developed nations provide the necessary help for a clean transition.\n“If financial assistance or technological assistance is available from developed countries, then we can make it even earlier than 2060. That’s the condition. I think that’s possible,” he said.\n“This challenge, particularly related to finance, needs to be a shared burden with other countries. We hope they will commit to fulfill their pledge or promises.\n“Without that kind of US$100 billion per year, it’s probably very difficult for developing countries to address climate change. We hope, because we have to be positive thinkers.”\nSpeaking at an event for Indonesian ministers at COP26, the minister for finance, \u200b\u200bSri Mulyani said carbon markets and pricing instruments would provide the platform for a low emissions “transformation”, domestically and globally. But she warned that Indonesia would not be taken advantage of.“This is a global game, but within this game, Indonesia has to protect our own interests,” she said.\nIndonesia will start collecting a carbon tax from the operators of high emitting coal power plants from April next year.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     COP26 ', '     United Nations ', '     Indonesia ', '     Joko Widodo ', '     Jokowi ', '     environment ']}"

      COP26: 10 reasons why it’s an important moment in the climate change fight
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: At the start of November, more than 100 world leaders are expected to descend on Glasgow in Scotland for the latest round of high-level talks to help address the challenges of climate change.\xa0\nFollowing the Paris Agreement in 2015, signatories pledged to increase their climate ambition every five years. Despite being delayed due to the pandemic, COP26 - which stands for “Conference of the Parties - is the moment for countries to plot their path towards reduced emissions and the ultimate target of a decarbonised planet. \nIf the meetings go to plan, they could trigger much greater momentum towards carbon net-zero in many parts of the world.\xa0\nHere are 10 important things that you need to know about COP26.\nWhile the Paris Agreement was a transformational treaty, setting a climate pathway for the vast majority of countries in the world, the details of what each nation would actually contribute to the cause can be updated as they go along.Their pledges - known as “Nationally Determined Contributions” - back six years ago have been criticised as being incompatible with the plan to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In fact, those commitments would have resulted in 3 degrees Celsius of warming.For COP26, the targets need to be updated and strengthened in order to keep the hopes of the Paris Agreement alive. Deep cuts are needed and soon. Legal mechanisms within the negotiations will help countries hold each other accountable. \nThe latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that grim scenarios are down the line, depending on the pathways taken by governments and major polluters.Negotiations will centre on more ambitious targets to reach by 2030, to avoid the globe reaching a tipping point, whereby future heat - and all the consequences of that - will be locked in.\xa0\nAs the co-host (alongside Italy), the UK will be pushing for the conference to focus on “coal, cash, cars and trees”, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson said it was “time for humanity to grow up” and act decisively to save the planet, during a major speech to the UN General Assembly in September.\xa0\nThat means a push for a timeline to stop the burning of coal and to reach an agreement to stop building new coal infrastructure, in order to consign the dirty fossil fuel to history. \nCOP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said he also wants every country to arrive in Scotland with a clear climate adaptation plan, a much-overlooked aspect of targets, which have tended to focus on mitigation measures.The UK wants a faster global shift to electric vehicles, an end to deforestation with supporting finance measures, rules for global carbon markets and the mobilisation of funds for developing nations, an area that has been neglected by the world’s wealthiest countries.\nThere has been a flurry of activity in recent months as countries announced improved targets bringing forward the year they would decarbonise by. Many are aiming for carbon neutrality, or net zero, by 2050. Malaysia, Laos and Australia are three countries in this region to make that pledge.\xa0\nBut significant polluters like China, India, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia missed the July deadline to submit their updated goals. Others like Brazil, Mexico and Russia put forward targets that were the same or weaker than previous versions, according to Climate Action Tracker.\nNone of these targets are compulsory and there are no sanctions should countries fail to submit or fulfill them.\xa0\nIt is expected that more countries will improve their pledges at COP26 during the leaders summit in the first few days of the conference.\xa0\nLoss and damage is a crucial goal for poorer nations that are already bearing the brunt of climate change without causing it, nor having benefited from extensive industrial development.\xa0\n“Responsibilities have to be acknowledged and promised measures delivered”, a coalition of least developed nations demanded in a report ahead of COP26, calling for a solidarity package.In the Paris Agreement, wealthy nations pledged to contribute US$100 billion annually by 2020, up to 2024, with at least half going to adaptation and that amount to increase beyond 2025. Overwhelmingly, this finance is not being mobilised and estimates are that much more finance needs to be made available.Countries like Indonesia will continue to push for more international assistance, making their climate progress contingent on outside help.\xa0\nSome poorer nations also want their richer counterparts to bring forward their own net zero targets even sooner, to avoid using up what is referred to as the global carbon budget. This is the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted by the whole of humanity before the 1.5 degree target of the Paris Agreement is completely out of reach.\nCoal is still overwhelmingly China’s biggest energy source. But President Xi Jinping is driving an energy transformation on the back of a massive planned rollout of different types of renewable energy infrastructure.\xa0\nThe country is responsible for more than a quarter of global emissions and there is external pressure for its 2060 target for carbon neutrality to be brought forward. It also only plans to reach peak emissions at the end of this decade.\nDomestic energy supply is an issue, however, and power shortages in recent months in strategic regions have caused contagion across the global economy. It could place pressure on the speed and scale of the clean energy transition. Mr Xi is not expected to attend COP26 having not left his home country since the onset of the pandemic, but last month he announced that China would stop building new coal-fired projects overseas.\xa0\nChina’s decision could result in other countries and companies doing the same. Experts say that coal is already on its last legs. International finance is drying up fast around the world for new projects, while those in the pipeline already risk being stranded in the future.Japan and South Korea - who with China have accounted for 95 per cent of overseas coal financing since 2013 - have also pulled their support for international dirty energy generation, which include projects in Southeast Asia.Globally, funding for new projects dropped in 2019 to the lowest levels seen in a decade. Yet still, Southeast Asia remains a holdout on the trend, contributing to the growth of a commodity fast reaching its expiry date.Coal barons like Australia, Russia and Indonesia - and big consumers like India and China - are likely to still depend on the resource and many developing countries will continue to operate their plants for decades to come.\nThe latest IPCC report gave more urgency to a push to limit methane emissions, which is the second biggest contributor to global warming behind carbon dioxide. Methane is much more intense when it comes to warming, however, causing 80 times more short-term impact compared to CO2.The biggest sources are the agriculture industry, especially cattle, and the fossil fuel sector, where natural gas leaks can be common in countries like Russia and throughout Central Asia.There’s no global commitment to cut back methane but advocates want action on it this decade, something likely to be raised at COP26. It is expected that dozens of countries will sign onto a US-EU led pact to cut methane emissions at the conference.\nSingapore is likely to push for strengthened climate change consensus and cooperation at COP26.Singapore only contributes about 0.1 per cent to global emissions. Currently, the government is aiming to halve its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century.\xa0\nThe city state\xa0has limited alternative energy options and faces serious constraints compared to better-endowed countries on this front.\xa0\nThe country might advocate for a decarbonisation agenda and look to promote solutions around renewable energy, carbon markets and new technology.\nMinister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, is expected to be involved in high-level talks to operationalise Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which covers cooperation among countries to meet their emissions reduction targets, including through international carbon markets.\nMr Xi will be a notable absentee after he decided to remain in China, where he has remained throughout the COVID-19 crisis.\xa0\nBut some 120 national leaders are slated to appear, including Mr Johnson, Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo, Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, American president Joe Biden, French president Emmanuel Macron, South Korean president Moon Jae-in and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison.But many leaders of heavily polluting nations are not attending in person, a potential blow to the negotiating aspirations of COP26. Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro are not going and Japan’s Fumio Kishida has not been confirmed.\nOther notable attendees include broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough, who has been named the COP26 People’s Advocate and will address world leaders. Queen Elizabeth, Prince William and Leonardo DiCaprio should also be there.\nThis conference is being labelled one of the most inequitable in memory. Some attendees from the developing world, where climate change impacts are forecast to hit hardest, have criticised the decision to go ahead with it, given logistical difficulties, visa problems and economic pressures.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated problems of access to travel due to the uneven rollout of vaccines. Inflated prices for accommodation in Glasgow have made it even more financially challenging for some of the participants, despite some generous locals opening their homes to attendees.Protests are expected throughout the conference too. But it will go ahead, with various social distancing and security measures in place, having been already delayed since last year.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     COP26 ', '     environment ', '     Ministry for Sustainability and the Environment ', '     Grace Fu ', '     Boris Johnson ']}"

      Thailand starts operating massive floating solar panel project as pressure mounts on climate action
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: From the shoreline, the newest piece of Thailand’s renewable energy future is just a shimmer in the distance. The pure scale of this ambitious project is difficult to appreciate from afar.Forty years ago, the face of this land was shaped by the construction of the Sirindhorn Dam, a then-controversial project designed to provide hydropower and irrigation water to the area. Once again, enterprise is harnessing nature here.\nThe reservoir is now home to the world’s largest hybrid solar-hydropower project. Installed on the surface of the water are 144,000 separate solar panels, the equivalent of 100 football fields.\xa0\nThe 45 megawatts of peak power the project can produce complements the existing dam operations, which can generate an additional 36MW, and provide electricity across three provinces in eastern Thailand.\xa0\nThe solar panels can make electricity throughout the day while the sun shines, and the hydropower dam can operate at night. Both share the same existing grid transmission lines and transformers. It is the first of what could be many similar floating solar panel projects rolled out across Thailand, as the country takes early steps to decarbonise its energy sector. The emerging technology is showing promise and generating interest throughout Southeast Asia. In Singapore, a similar solar panel scheme is operational on Tengeh Reservoir, while plans are underway to rollout similar projects in Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nThis project in Ubon Ratchathani province helps with one of the biggest issues associated with solar power infrastructure development, the scarcity and cost of land. \nThe surface of the dam is normally unused, except for small-scale local fishing, which can continue even after the installation of the panels.\n“Overall, floating PV (photovoltaics) is cheaper compared to a solar farm. We save the land costs and we save the land for Thailand,” said Prasertsak Cherngchawano, a deputy governor of Power Plant Development and Renewable Energy at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the state body in charge of the project.\nPrasertsak confirmed plans for another smaller floating solar project in northern Thailand. Following that, he said he expected that the next national power plan would include an expedited strategy to roll out more renewable projects and reduce the environmental burden and economic uncertainty of fossil fuels.\nDespite modest increases in renewables capacity, fossil fuels still dominate Thailand’s energy production and overall carbon emissions.\nThe energy sector is the greatest cause of domestic CO2 emissions, contributing about three quarters of the country’s total.\nThailand has for decades relied on natural gas for energy. Coal plants make up about 20 per cent of energy generation, yet their carbon footprint is huge.\nPrasertsak said that EGAT plans to shut down its lignite coal plants in northern Thailand in the near future, once capacity from renewables can replace it. But energy expert Suphakij Nuntavorakarn said Thailand’s enormous oversupply of electricity, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, means that heavily polluting power plants need to be phased out as soon as possible, and new fossil fuel infrastructure prevented from being built.\n“In the next three to five years we should only allow renewables, because we have this power overcapacity,” said the analyst from the Healthy Public Policy Foundation.“And because of the climate crisis, we need to develop renewable energy to its full potential.\xa0\n“A coal phase out is highly feasible and will make a lot of benefits that will compensate for the cost that will be needed to terminate contracts. We should also stop the expansion of new gas power plant projects and LNG infrastructure terminals,” he said.In order for Thailand to tackle climate change and lower its carbon emissions, he said that emissions should never return to their pre-COVID-19 levels.\xa0\nRight now though, Thailand’s level of ambition leading into global climate change talks at COP26 in Glasgow appears to be lagging behind other countries.\xa0\nNO TARGETS FOR 2050\nPrime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha recently confirmed his attendance at\xa0COP26 and is expected to confirm the country’s pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2065, a minor change as compared to the previous goal of between 2065 and 2070.\nIt falls short of what the UK government, the host of the conference, in particular has been pushing for in terms of non-binding pledges.\xa0\nScientists have warned that the world needs to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or face devastating consequences. To do so, carbon neutrality across the globe needs to be reached by around 2050.Thailand’s goal puts it 15 years behind many countries. Regional neighbours like Malaysia and Laos, for example, have recently adopted 2050 targets. \n“This is a really critical time in history. This is an important COP. We’re specifically calling on all countries to offer net zero commitments by the middle of the century, ideally by 2050,” said Mark Gooding, the British ambassador to Thailand, during a media event in Bangkok this month.“We also need to accelerate the transition to renewables, so we’d like countries to announce an end to new coal power stations in particular.”\xa0\nThailand is also among the countries that have failed to upgrade its climate targets for this decade as part of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), a mechanism that forms part of the Paris Agreement to ensure countries ramp up action over time.The existing Thailand NDC, submitted last year, only aims to reduce domestic emissions by 20 per cent compared to business-as-usual by 2030. In 2016, Thailand had already pledged to cut the same amount of emissions.\nThe current pledge is grossly inadequate, according to Suphakij. “It’s not a real reduction. Our climate change target and energy plan do not actually reduce emissions. It only reduces the increase,” he said. “We have made some progress, but it’s too slow and not ambitious enough. Thailand is playing safe. If for some reason they implement a better climate policy, they’ll tell the world and update it later.”\nTAKING CLIMATE CHANGE SERIOUSLY\nDuring a keynote speech in October, Prayut said that Thailand understands the seriousness of climate change and would intensify its efforts to address the problem, especially through reducing greenhouse gases.The impact forecast that will affect Thailand is concerning. Bangkok faces the likelihood of more regular, serious coastal inundation and flooding, at the same time as the city slowly sinks.The agricultural sector also faces major losses, with the annual monsoon expected to be less predictable and rainfall more intense.\nPrayut said Thailand must swiftly enhance its knowledge and capacity to create new innovations and technologies to tackle the challenge ahead. It will seek further support from richer countries to provide financing and expertise in this area, a negotiating topic that will be crucial for many nations at COP26.He confirmed that the government was in the process of finalising its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy, wherein national emissions would peak by 2030. It is also drafting the Climate Change Act, the country’s first comprehensive piece of legislation covering all aspects of climate issues, said the prime minister.Developing a circular economy and low carbon society will be priority national policy areas, as will reducing risks from disasters and climate change, he said.\nActions to address adaptation to climate change will be a major discussion topic in Glasgow, and while Thailand is not required to submit a formal strategy to COP26, it should communicate a plan about local impacts, challenges and areas where it needs help.\xa0\n“At COP26, it is time for Thailand to ratchet up its commitment to adaptation by ensuring that its adaptation plans are locally led and reflect the needs and priorities of vulnerable groups, communities and places,” said Albert Salamanca, a senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute.\n“Failing to do so will risk a repeat of the impacts and suffering encountered during the 2011 megaflooding.” \nHe added: ""In essence, Thailand’s target and commitment should not only be restricted with reducing greenhouse emissions but, more importantly, ensuring that the global goal of adaptation is achieved for its vulnerable groups.""\nBecoming a hub for the production of electric vehicles is also on the national agenda, with an additional aim of having 15 million of them on the road in Thailand by 2035.This is an area where Thailand could seize its leadership role in the region and help make a positive shift in infrastructure, pollution levels, health and competitiveness, according to Andrew Beirne, the UK’s permanent representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).\nAs about the 20th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and the second largest economy in the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN), he said Thailand has an important role to play in the coming days at COP26 and in the crucial years ahead.\n“We see Thailand very much as a leader in Southeast Asia. Having Thailand involved and engaged and doing more ambitious things at COP26 and climate negotiations is really important,” Beirne said.\n“It could be that Thailand brings it forward and of course we’d be encouraging that for 2050.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     Thailand ', '     environment ', '     COP26 ', '     clean energy ']}"

      Guilt, grief and anxiety as young people fear for climate's future
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Overwhelmed, sad, guilty are some of the emotions young people say they feel when they think of climate change and their concerns world leaders will fail to tackle it.\nBroadly referred to as climate anxiety, research has stacked up to measure its prevalence ahead of the UN\xa0talks in Glasgow, which begin at the end of the month to thrash out how to put the 2015 Paris Agreement on curbing climate change into effect.\nOne of the biggest studies to date, funded by Avaaz, an online campaign network, and led by Britain\'s University of Bath, surveyed 10,000 young people aged 16 to 25 years in 10 countries. It published its results in September.\nIt found about three quarters of those surveyed considered the future frightening, while a lack of action by governments and industry left 45 per cent experiencing climate anxiety and distress that affected their daily lives and functioning.\nElouise Mayall, an ecology student at Britain\'s University of East Anglia and member of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, told Reuters she had felt guilty and overwhelmed.\n""What I\'d be left with is maybe the sense of shame, like, \'how dare you still want lovely things when the world is ending and you don\'t even know if you\'re going to have a safe world to grow old in\'.""\nShe spoke of conflicting emotions.\n""You might have sadness, there might be fear, there might be a kind of overwhelm,"" she said. ""And maybe even sometimes a quite like wild optimism.""\nCaroline Hickman, a psychotherapist and lecturer at the University of Bath and one of the co-authors of the research published in September, is working to help young people manage climate-related emotions.\n""They\'re growing up with the grief and the fear and the anxiety about the future,"" she told Reuters.\nLondon-based psychiatrist Alastair Santhouse sees climate change, as well as COVID-19, as potentially adding to the burden, especially for those pre-disposed to anxiety.\nFor now, climate anxiety alone does not normally require psychiatric help. Painful as it is, it can be positive, provided it does not get out of control.\n""Some anxiety about climate change is motivating. It\'s just a question of how much anxiety is motivating and how much is unacceptable,"" said Santhouse, author of a book that tackles how health services struggle to cope with complex mental issues.\n""The worry is that as climate change sets in, there will be a more clear cut mental health impact,"" he added.\nAmong some of the world\'s communities that are already the most vulnerable, extreme weather events can also cause problems such as post traumatic stress disorder.\nLeading climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, 18, has experienced severe climate anxiety.\n""It\'s a quite natural response, because, as you see, as the world is today, that no one seems to care about what\'s happening, I think it\'s only human to feel that way,"" she said.\nFor now, however, she is hopeful because she is doing everything she possibly can.\n""When you take action, you also get a sense of meaning that something is happening.

      'Cement mountain': China's rocky road on biodiversity beyond rosy UN summit 
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUNMING, China: China used a five-day United Nations biodiversity conference in Kunming to celebrate its achievements in protecting habitats and improving its environmental record. Despite progress, a rift remains between rhetoric and reality.\nDuring talks to secure a global post-2020 pact to reverse species loss in the capital city of south-west China\'s Yunnan province last week, President Xi Jinping announced the launch of a new 1.5 billion yuan (US$233 million) biodiversity fund as well as a beefed-up national park scheme.\n""China is sticking to an ecology-first path for green development and has already made remarkable achievements,"" Vice-Premier Han Zheng said. The government would now put biodiversity at the heart of political and economic decision-making, he said.\nYunnan province itself is promising to reverse damage done to its fragile local ecosystems over the last four decades, starting at Dianchi, a 300 sq km freshwater lake - one of China\'s biggest - located within a mile of the Kunming conference centre.\nA decade of efforts and billions of dollars of spending at Dianchi have already seen the construction of 28 wastewater treatment plants handling more than 2 million tonnes of sewage a day. Wetland parks have been established, and polluted feeder rivers along the lake have been rehabilitated.\nBut though water quality has been raised from ""below grade V"", meaning not even suitable for industrial use, it remains at grade IV - still severely polluted and hazardous to humans. Yunnan province officials could not provide a date for when it would be upgraded further. Scientists said decades of untreated industrial and household waste had ruined the ecosystem.\n""Of course our target is to make the water better and better but scientifically speaking, in the short term it is going to be hard to get to grade III,"" said Huang Yuhong, vice-principal of a local research institute dedicated to protecting the lake.\nChina divides water quality into five grades, with grade III suitable for human contact and drinking.\nThe central government has accused local authorities of failing to develop a ""clear understanding of the fragile and sensitive reality"" of the local environment.\nA central government inspection team said in July that the ""ecological space"" around Dianchi was being ""severely squeezed"". It also accused local real estate developers of turning the protected zone of Changyao Mountain, located on the south-east edge of the lake, into a ""cement mountain"".\nDuring a visit to Changyao, Reuters was blocked from taking photographs and forced to leave the area by a group of men who refused to identify themselves.\nReal estate construction across the mountain is still ongoing, with cranes still working on rows of half-finished apartment blocks stacked on the higher slopes.\nAt Dianchi authorities are also trying to reintroduce more golden line barbel, a fish native to the lake almost wiped out by pollution and invasive species.\nNationwide, China has added 500 species to its list of protected animals, bringing the total to 980, but many are still under threat.\nChina has made progress protecting charismatic mammals like elephants and giant pandas, but according to the latest available national data, more than a fifth of China\'s 4,357 vertebrate species are endangered, including 43.1 per cent of native amphibians. Nearly 11 per cent of 34,450 observed plant species are also at risk.\nChina\'s nature reserves currently amount to 18 per cent of total territory, and the country has also put 25 per cent of the country behind what it calls an ""ecological protection red line"".\nThe United States and others have agreed to a United Nations call to protect 30 per cent of national territory by 2030, but China has yet to commit as it struggles to feed a quarter of the world\'s population with under a tenth of the world\'s arable land.\nGao Jixi, an environment ministry official and one of the architects of China\'s ""red line"" scheme, said he believed Beijing was still capable of raising protected areas to more than 30 per cent of national territory.\n""By 2030, I personally believe that it will finally reach 30 per cent - whether it is land or sea it will definitely reach that goal,"" he told Reuters in an interview.\n""My own judgement is that each country should aim for at least 50 per cent ...

      High paracetamol concentration in Jakarta Bay sparks concern over impact on people and environment
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: A recent study showing that the waters of Jakarta Bay contain high levels of paracetamol has sparked concern over the impacts on people and marine life.\xa0\nThe authorities in the meantime, are investigating the matter and have vowed to take firm action against the possible polluters.\nResearchers from Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) and the United Kingdom’s University of Brighton took seawater samples between 2017 and 2018 in four locations at Jakarta Bay. Their study found that there were 610 nanograms per litre (ng/l) of paracetamol in Angke and 420 ng/l in Ancol.\nAngke is a highly populated area in Jakarta with inadequate sanitation, while Ancol is north of the city where the mouth of the main Ciliwung river is situated.\nAccording to the study’s authors, research elsewhere in Brazil and Portugal has\xa0found paracetamol readings of 34.6 ng/l and at least 51.2 ng/l respectively.\nProfessor Zainal Arifin,\xa0who is a member of the research team from BRIN, said during a webinar on Oct 5 that “long-term exposure with low or high concentrations of paracetamol causes impaired reproductive function in shellfish,” in a laboratory setting.\nThe study was the first to report the presence of paracetamol in Indonesia's coastal waters. It was published in the scientific journal Marine Pollution Bulletin in August.\xa0\nWhile the study did not zoom in on the source of the paracetamol, the researchers believe that it may have originated from pharmaceutical companies, households\xa0and even hospital waste.\nFollowing the release of the study, environmentalists also highlighted that the results show the country’s waste management is insufficient and needs improvement.\xa0\nHowever, further studies are needed to come to a firm conclusion and permanent solution, said those interviewed by CNA. \nIMPACT ON HEALTH AND MARINE LIFE\nProfessor Etty Riani, a lecturer on aquatic resources management with agricultural university IPB in Bogor posited that the waters in Jakarta Bay may have been contaminated by human waste, pharmaceutical companies, or improper treatment of wastewater.\nShe noted that paracetamol is commonly consumed when people feel headaches, fever or pain. This is because it brings quick relief and is easily available in small shops without prescriptions.\n“Even in villages, it is easy to get hold of paracetamol, just like buying candy,” she said.\xa0\n“Actually, when prescribed by doctors, paracetamol is safe because it can be very quickly absorbed just like food and 90 per cent to 100 per cent is passed out through urine.”\nHowever, she said that when consumed in high doses, it can be deadly.\nWith a paracetamol concentration level of 600 ng/l, she believed that it would not be deadly for the aquatic ecosystem.\nHowever, if the concentration is sustained at this level, there could be secondary impacts on microorganisms, she said.\xa0\nMicroorganisms typically act as decomposers and are responsible for the recycling of nutrients.\nShe urged people against consuming paracetamol freely in a bid to seek instant relief when they are unwell.\nMr Tubagus Soleh Ahmadi, the executive director of environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO) Walhi Jakarta said that in addition to possible ecological impacts, livelihoods could also be at risk.\n“This will also burden the coastal communities and fishermen whose living space is very dependent on the sustainability of the Jakarta Bay,” he said.\xa0\nMr Ahmadi noted that it could become harder for fishermen to catch fish.\n“This adds to the burden of production costs, not to mention when they have to deal with bad weather.”\nMeanwhile, Greenpeace Indonesia ocean campaigner Arifsyah Nasution suggested that the source of the paracetamol could be from industrial waste disposal, especially by the pharmaceutical companies. Hospital waste as well as domestic consumption are other possible sources of the pollution, he said.\xa0\nHe noted that the study indicates that waste management in the megacity is still poor because law enforcement and monitoring are weak, due to a lack of political will.\n“The concentration of paracetamol detected can also indicate that the water circulation in several locations in the Jakarta Bay is impeded due to various reclamation projects that have been running for years in the coastal areas of Jakarta,” said Mr Nasution.\xa0\nHe said that the city’s waste management facilities should also be improved, while bearing in mind the budgetary constraints.\nHence, he called on the government to conduct further studies to identify the source of the problem and determine the necessary steps needed. \nPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO BE SUMMONED\nThe authorities have pledged to take firm action.\xa0\nJakarta governor's special envoy on climate change Irvan Pulungan told CNA that following the publication of the study, the city government took water samples in early October. The laboratory results will be known in a couple of weeks.\nWhile investigations are taking place, the municipal authorities are aiming to improve wastewater management. But this would take time, he added.\xa0\nAmong other things, it aims to tighten the control of medical waste, especially expired drugs in health clinics, said Mr Pulungan.\n“Expired drugs are hazardous and toxic materials. The management already exists but we will evaluate further,” he said.\xa0\nHe also said that the government will work with the researchers to conduct training for the city’s environmental inspectors on research techniques.\nMdm Rosa Vivien Ratnawati, the director-general of waste and hazardous and toxic materials management under the environment and forestry ministry said that they would check how expired drugs are managed by pharmaceutical companies in Jakarta. There are about 27 pharmaceutical companies in the city.\n“Those companies will be summoned and checked on how they manage their waste and used drugs that have expired. Those drugs are hazardous and toxic waste so their management is special,” she said during the webinar on Oct 5.\nShe also said the ministry would work together with the Jakarta government as well as the researchers to study environmental contamination brought about by paracetamol, plastic and antibiotics.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     pollution ', '     water ', '     Jakarta ']}"

      No end in sight for deforestation, as national goals and funding fall short
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Countries are spending only a fraction of the nearly US$500 billion needed each year to stop tree loss and restore forests worldwide to help meet climate and nature goals, researchers warned on Tuesday (Oct 12).\nAn annual report on the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests - backed by more than 200 countries, firms and green groups - found the sustained reductions in forest loss needed to meet its 2030 target to end deforestation are highly unlikely near-term.\nThis year\'s report focused on finance and forestry in national climate action plans submitted for the 2015 Paris climate accord, finding that many governments have yet to set specific forest protection goals under that pact.\nThe progress report by 28 civil society and research groups also found that, since 2010, countries have invested only between 0.5 per cent and 5 per cent\xa0of the estimated US$460 billion per year needed to conserve, manage and revive the planet\'s forests.\nMichael Allen Brady of the Center for International Forestry Research, which contributed to the report, said current funding was ""only a drop in the bucket of what we need"".\n""By ramping up investments in forest protection and sustainable management, the world could reduce emissions while securing clean air, water, fibre, food, livelihoods and biodiversity,"" the scientist added in a statement.\nCutting down forests has major implications for global goals to curb climate change, as trees absorb about a third of carbon emissions, which they release if they rot or are burned.\nIn 2020, tropical forest losses around the world equalled the size of the Netherlands, according to monitoring service Global Forest Watch.\nUnder the Paris climate accord, about 195 countries agreed to limit the rise in global average temperatures this century to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and ideally to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\nResearchers analysed the national goals set for that agreement by 32 countries with the most potential to reduce carbon emissions through halting deforestation, improving forest management and planting new trees - including Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, China and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThe report found ambition was low, with only 10 nations having set quantitative targets, while about a quarter of the total said their targets could only be met if they received international financial support.\n""What we can see from these national climate plans is that the ambition falls short of the potential,"" said the report\'s lead author Franziska Haupt, a managing partner at advisory firm Climate Focus.\nBesides boosting funding, wealthy commodity-consuming countries should partner with developing nations to tackle deforestation and introduce legislation to clean up their supply chains, Haupt told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nShe also called for public subsidies to be diverted away from activities that contribute to deforestation, such as commercial agriculture and fossil fuels, and into greener projects that empower indigenous and local communities.\nThe report did praise efforts to tackle deforestation in some countries, such as Vietnam\'s streamlined land-use planning and regulation, and bans on illegal timber trading and clearing of old-growth forests in Laos and Indonesia.\nIn a separate report published in the journal Global Change Biology on Tuesday, researchers identified the lowest-cost solutions involving land that countries could adopt to cut planet-heating emissions and meet their climate pledges.\nRoughly half of those cost-effective emissions reductions would come from protecting, restoring and improving management of forests and other ecosystems, such as mangroves and peatlands, they found.\nChanges to farming practices, switching consumer diets to more sustainable and healthy foods, and reducing food waste could also play a major part, the study added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     deforestation ', '     environment ', '     climate change ']}"

      Malaysia’s climate plan is high on ambition, but concerns linger over execution: Experts
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: When Malaysia enters negotiations at global climate change talks beginning at the end of this month in Glasgow, it will be with momentum from a sweeping and ambitious national plan for a greener and cleaner future.On paper, the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP), tabled by Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob and passed in parliament on Thursday (Oct 7), is a bold statement with climate change mitigation featuring prominently. The country aims to be carbon neutral by 2050 at the earliest and overhaul its energy, transportation as well as land use sectors.\xa0\nElectric vehicles will dominate the roads, renewable energy will power the nation’s cities, which will be moulded around green principles. Carbon pricing and carbon tax schemes will come into effect and no new coal power plants will be built, under the plan.\nWhile there is optimism around the level of aspiration, there is also concern among experts that a lack of detail and the limited capacity to implement complex policies could be hurdles to transformative climate action.\n“Malaysia has never been short of long term strategic vision. Ambitious planning has not been an issue at all in Malaysia,” said Niloy Banerjee, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative for Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam.\n“The challenge here has always been going from plan to work plan, implementation and addressing serious structural constraints on that implementation,” he said. \nOthers said they had not expected Malaysia to pursue net zero so soon, a policy that puts it among the most ambitious countries on long-term climate strategy in Southeast Asia.\nIndonesia aims to be carbon neutral by 2060 for example, Thailand even later, while Singapore wants to reach the target “as soon as viable” in the second half of the century.\n“Actually, we were very, very surprised. Because we had not heard about Malaysia thinking about carbon neutrality by 2050,” said Meena Raman, president of Friends of the Earth, Malaysia.“It’s giving signals for the next five years, but we don't have the details. We have not seen any roadmap. The devil will always be in the details,” she said.\nCrucial aspects of the rollout of the 12MP are being established by the federal government. National policies centred on the environment, climate change and biodiversity are still to be updated, and details on a carbon pricing framework, fuel economy standards and incentives for renewable energy have yet to be determined.\nBanerjee said having a “north star'' to guide economy-wide reforms is useful, but the shallow details leave holes throughout important policy areas.\n“The lack of details does make me cautious,” said Darshan Joshi, an analyst for the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia.\n“It is a holistic document that displays the government’s understanding of all the steps that have to be taken in order for Malaysia to effectively address climate change at the domestic level.\n“But until we know the details of our policies, it is tough to assess our true ambition,” he said.\nWhile the 12MP has lofty goals, the policy document Malaysia has submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat does not currently reflect the ambitious stance the prime minister has espoused.While the country has upgraded its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledge - submitted every five years as part of the Paris Agreement -\xa0 the way it calculates its planned emissions reductions still relies on a “mathematical quirk”, Joshi said.\nThe NDC target is not absolute when it comes to cutting greenhouse gases, rather it calls for a 45 per cent reduction in emissions intensity against the country’s GDP by 2030. \nGreenhouse gas intensity is the ratio of a country’s emission to the economic value it generates. It means that Malaysia’s emissions could actually rise, depending on the growth of its economy.\n“Ultimately, our goal collectively should be to halt the growth in total emissions, which is something our pledge does not necessitate,” said Joshi.\nThere is “wriggle room” in the NDC, Banerjee said, while noting that UNDP would continue to lobby for improvements.\n“That’s an ongoing conversation. It’s really a question of convincing the leadership, particularly the environment ministry. That one is achievable - a more ambitious NDC that is in absolute terms not relative to something,” he said.\n“In Malaysia, conversations take time to gather momentum.” \nThe 45 per cent target was a 10 per cent increase on Malaysia’s previous NDC and is pledged unconditionally, meaning it is not contingent on international support or market based mechanisms.It was also widened to include a greater range of damaging pollutants including methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons.\nYet there are major challenges ahead this decade to even reach that goal, many of them centred on the rollout of clean energy infrastructure.\nTHE RENEWABLE ENERGY ROLLOUT\nMalaysia’s early rollout of renewable energy has yet to gain the speed or depth of regional neighbours like Vietnam and to a lesser extent Thailand.\nThroughout 2020, of all the new capacity of renewable energy in the ASEAN region, only 3 per cent of it was installed in Malaysia, according to the ASEAN Centre for Energy (ACE).\nThe federal government plans to dramatically increase its clean assets. The electricity sector contributes about one third of the country’s entire carbon footprint, so it wants 31 per cent of its installed power capacity to be renewable by 2025.“Which on the surface seems like a rapid expansion of our ambitions. But there’s a caveat – our previous targets didn’t consider large-scale hydropower to be a form of renewable energy, owing to its various biological and ecological costs, but this target does,” said Joshi of ISIS.He added that by counting hydropower, the government has been able to instantly add 14 per cent to its renewable energy quota, taking it to a current total of 24.6 per cent.\nThe vast majority of the country, however - especially Peninsular Malaysia - continues to rely on fossil fuels, especially coal and natural gas. With a pledge to not build new coal-fired power plants, gas will be prioritised as a transition fuel, as coal plants are retired and until solar and wind can meet Malaysia’s ever increasing energy demands.\n“We cannot change everything overnight. Now, Malaysia is heavily dependent on coal. We are looking for renewable energy to be dominant,” said energy expert Hoyyen Chan, a researcher at Invite Green Consultancy.\n“For the transition period I think natural gas will play a very important role. But we have to be careful.\xa0\n“We have to make sure that its role in replacing coal is still contributing to emissions reduction, otherwise there’s no point,” she said.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has slowed down the rollout of several renewable energy projects, as global supply chains were disrupted and energy needs dropped.\xa0\n“Looking at the bright side, it actually gives us a moment of clarity and an opportunity to ramp up renewable energy deployment to shift towards a greener economy,” said Beni Suryadi, project manager of the ASEAN Climate Change and Energy Project at the ACE.“The challenge is real. Particularly in the next four to five years when we are still facing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\xa0\n“The government needs to continue its approach to balance the three elements in the energy trilemma - guarantee of energy supply, affordability and sustainability,” he said.\nJapan has offered assistance with new technologies, including Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage, while a major solar initiative is underway including a 1GW tender worth close to US$1 billion.\n“But the constraint here is that it caps at 50 megawatts (per project). Some of the industry is looking for more than that,” Chan said.\n“All these things become a push, a force. The industry is ready to go green but if you put in limitations, you limit opportunity. The industry is ready to invest but there’s nowhere for them to invest,” she said.\nPOLITICAL PRESSURES\nMalaysia has experienced a period of unstable politics, with shifting political coalitions and Ismail Sabri the third person to hold the top job since the last election.\nIt adds an extra layer to the already daunting task of overhauling multiple economic sectors, drafting new legislation and unpicking the opaque divisions of responsibilities held by both the federal and state governments, several of which overlap in important areas linked to climate change, like land use, biodiversity, forestries and carbon offsets.\n“They all come in this grey zone of, is it federal or is it state? Who gets to lead? And it mirrors itself in the financial transactions between federal and state and what kind of incentives the federal government can put out,” UNDP’s Banerjee said.\nExperts agree that real climate change action is - at face value - agreed upon in principle by both sides. But the turbulence in parliament and disruption within ministries is affecting the ability to generate coherent long-term policies.\n“I think political instability is a huge challenge and it impedes all sorts of policy planning and implementation,” said Ili Nadiah Dzulfakar, the co-founder of Klima Action Malaysia.\n“In Malaysia, we love bombastic ideas about development and all these nice policy statements. But the implementation side is really weak. Then comes the monitoring and evaluation, and that’s also problematic,” she said.\n“We need more than just targets. We need to talk about systematic change and this target is not a people-driven solution. These pledges hide inequalities. That’s what I’m scared of.”\nGlobal political pressure has not yet been fully felt in Malaysia, according to Banerjee, but soon it will. This could be led by the European Union, which is targeting palm oil, a major domestic industry, and planning a taxation regime that will place duties on products that are audited for their carbon footprint.\nMalaysia, as part of a bloc of developing nations, is expected to continue pushing for more finance and assistance from the developed world in order for it to maintain its climate pledges.\nThis falls under the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities” (CBDR), which dozens of countries subscribe to. It acknowledges that some countries historically have played a bigger role in causing climate change, while others have limited resources to solve it.\nDeveloped nations had pledged to jointly mobilise US$100 billion every year to assist other nations with climate finance. It will be a key focus at the COP26 talks in Glasgow.\nOverwhelmingly that target is not being met, although the United States has pledged US$11.4 billion a year by 2024 in public finance to developing countries to support climate action.\n“It’s totally realistic and fair,” said Danny Alexander, vice president and corporate secretary of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, about the developing world’s need to urgently tap climate finance.\n“The financial resources are available and I think it’s quite reasonable for developing countries to say, ‘we recognise this challenge, we want to play our part, we know we need to but we need the financial resources to be deployed to help us’, and I think those resources are definitely coming,” he told CNA.\nIndonesia is one country that is vocal about it only striving for net zero if given outside support, but Malaysia's target, according to its updated NDC, “will be achieved through domestic measures”.\nGiven the country’s fiscal challenges, it is a misguided strategy, according to Friends of the Earth’s Raman.\n“It sounds like Malaysia is on the same footing as the US or the UK. But actually that’s not fair because I don’t believe that the developed world should be allowed to get away with insufficient 2050 targets, and to continue to take up the remaining carbon budget,” she said.\nAs the clock ticks, climate change impacts are already being felt across Malaysia. Temperature rises in cities have been dramatic, flooding is increasingly damaging at the same time as some regions suffer water shortages as rain becomes more sporadic and inconsistent.The 12MP will include more flood mitigation measures, fiscal policies to support forest conservation and a blue economic blueprint for coastal and marine areas, amid the threat of rising sea levels, according to the prime minister.\xa0\n“Overall, it’s an ambitious aspiration. We cannot deny that.” Chan said.“To me, with this very clear policy direction, it’s a bright move. Whether we’ll be able to achieve it though, no one knows about that.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     energy ', '     COP26 ', '     Malaysia ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Why we feel a rush when we ‘Add to Cart’ and what we can do about it
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In the last three months, have you bought something that you do not need but you bought on impulse anyway? Perhaps it was a beautiful bag or the cute looking household item?\nCOVID-19 has increased our spending online. A Visa poll published in March this year showed that nearly three in four consumers in Singapore are shopping more frequently online. Forty-five per cent went to large marketplaces such as Lazada or Amazon.\nThis isn’t surprising - we are stuck at home and feeling really bored. People I have met said they bought something online on impulse recently simply to make themselves feel better. Retail therapy is even more compelling now. \nThe world economy is structured in such a way that companies and countries thrive the more consumers purchase. \nWith the rise of intelligent algorithms, special attention is placed on how products “speak” to the consumers. This is why designers put in a lot of thought to things like how a new phone feels in your hand or why a beautifully designed home appliance is so compelling.\nThe look and feel of products are carefully researched and refined. The more they can trigger your emotional reaction, the more likely you would be willing to part with your money for it. Why do these tactics work? \nThis is because most of our consumption decisions are guided by our emotions. Research has shown that we like to think we are rational beings but our “heart” frequently overrides our “head”. \nResearch in academic literature has shown that people consume to fulfill three major needs – functional needs, social needs\xa0and psychological needs. \nFunctional need is self-explanatory. You need a hairdryer to dry your hair after shower. \nYet, functional needs do not drive our buying decisions. There are so many different types of hair dryers out there. Some hair dryers cost as little as S$25 whereas others cost as much as S$500. What differentiates these products? \nIn a 2021 paper in the Journal of Marketing, Jennifer J Sun, Silvia Bellezza, and Neeru Paharia showed that high-end products tend to be more durable and have longer product life cycles than mid-range products. \nBut this isn’t always the case and the relationship between price and quality can vary, depending on the product. Quite often, the expensive product tends to look nicer and can be used to define who we are. \nFor example, if someone forked out five to 10 times more for a high-end hair dryer, they want to share it on social media which invites comments. Such behaviours speak to our social and psychological needs. \nSocially, humans have an innate need to communicate our personality, identity or our success to others. Since these are inherently “invisible” attributes, consumption is one way for us to convey such messages clearly. \nA common observation of buying behaviour shows when our status in life changes, the type of products we consume change as well. There is always the more luxurious car, the newest phone, the latest laptop we acquire. Owning these products signal our status to others. \nSo even though your “head” tells you that you do not need the latest phone (which often is only slightly different from the older version you own), you may still gravitate towards it because it’s cool to own the latest gadget. \nA 2005 study conducted in Canada by Katherine White and Darrin Lehman, and published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, showed that Asians tend to compare upwards with those who did better than them. So the mindset we need to “keep up with the Joneses” is common among Asians. \nPsychologically, studies show we also consume to make ourselves feel better. Have you had a really bad day and retail therapy made\xa0you feel instantly better? This is because when we buy something, we feel a sense of control over our circumstances. Losing control make people feel bad and buying helps us regain this. \nSeeing something aesthetically appealing may also lead to heightened arousal (like when you see a 90 per cent discount off a brand you really love), and a greater impulse purchase to satisfy it.\nDuring this pandemic, anecdotal evidence indicates more impulse purchases. The ease and prevalence of online platforms also make it easier for us to give in to these urges. \nMaking many small low value purchases which you can easily find on e-commerce platforms also allow us to mentally justify the consumption. \nYet, there is a deep impact of letting emotions drive our purchase decisions. We may end up buying more than we need thereby spending more than we should. But increased consumerism has broader and more insidious implications. \nThe more we buy, the more we tax the environment. This holds true even if you are buying products that are presumably produced in a more sustainable manner. \nA Stanford Social Innovation Review article in 2016 argued that there is no such thing as a green product. Even though the environmental impact of green products is lower than that of regular products, they still exert a toll on the environment throughout their product life cycles. \nThis is because production of all products and services will require extraction of natural resources and the production process will also create waste. One example is electric cars. Car manufacturers are promoting electric cars as the car for the future. Yes, they are environmentally friendly, but these cars still need a massive supply of electricity to charge. \nThe battery packs still require a lot of raw materials to produce and needs to be disposed of subsequently. So just because we purchase electric cars does not mean there is no impact on the environment. \nIf car population increases simply because we thought electric cars are more environmentally friendly, Mother Earth will still be in trouble.\xa0\nClearly, reducing consumption is the best solution to environmental protection. But because these are driven by emotions, it’s a complex mechanism to undo and certainly hard to curb our desires. \nBut if we are aware of our behaviours we can take some steps to recalibrate. There are simple things we can do.\nFirst, before paying, look into your basket and ask yourself if you really need everything in it or anything in there is an emotional purchase you are likely to discard or not use often.\nSecond, if you are online, after adding items to cart, don’t confirm the purchase immediately. Shut the app, leave the page, and come back a few hours later. More often than not, the items sitting the cart will appear less desirable once the arousal level has decreased. \nFinally, there’s no shame in buying second-hand goods. The Marie Kondo craze sent thrift shops in the US bursting with donations from her followers who suddenly realised how many things they had which they didn’t need or use. Used-goods platforms are just as good, and no one needs to know.\nThe truth is consumerism is deeply embedded in our society and is not going to go away, particularly in a pandemic. But if we are aware of emotional consumption, there is a way to slowly wean ourselves off. And the winners aren’t only us but our environment too. \nProfessor Sharon Ng is Head, Division of Marketing and Dr Boon Chong Lim is Deputy Head, Division of Marketing, Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     e-commerce ', '     retail ', '     sustainability ', '     environment ', '     Money ']}"

      Scrapping oil palm moratorium raises doubt over Indonesia's green commitments: Environmentalists
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: Indonesia’s moratorium on new permits for palm plantations ended on Sep 19 and the government has yet to make an announcement on whether it would be extended.\xa0\nThe three-year moratorium came into effect in September 2018, two years after President Joko Widodo pledged to halt the issuance of new permits following forest fires in 2015 that burned 2.6 million ha of land.\xa0\xa0\nFor decades, Indonesia has suffered from forest and land fires which have claimed lives, damaged people’s health and led to economic loss as well as transboundary haze affecting neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia.\xa0\nExacerbated by dry weather, the seasonal fires on the country’s tropical rainforests and peatlands are mostly caused by the practice to clear forests cheaply in order to make way for plantations in particular oil palm and timber.\nPalm oil, widely used as a cooking oil, is a common ingredient in food and personal care products. It is also used to produce biofuel.\xa0\nEnvironmentalists were hoping for an extension of the moratorium as they believed it has helped to stop deforestation in Indonesia.\xa0\nThey also believed that the absence of a moratorium could raise questions about Indonesia’s commitment to combat\xa0climate change and tarnish its reputation internationally. \nIndonesia is the world’s biggest palm oil producer and when Mr Widodo declared in 2016 to halt the issuance of new permits for oil palm plantations during an event to commemorate World Forest Day, he believed the existing plantations were sufficient.\nJokowi, as the president is popularly known, said at that time that the production capacity could be increased by maximising the existing plantations.\xa0\nHe added that Indonesia is known as a country rich in biodiversity and as the lungs of the world, it is important to preserve its nature since the world depends on it.\xa0\nWhile the moratorium’s bigger aim is to stop deforestation, it is specifically targeted to improve governance of sustainable palm plantation, provide legal certainty and protect environmental preservation.\xa0\xa0\nMr Adrianus Eryan, head of forest and land division of the Indonesian Centre for Environmental Law (ICEL), said the moratorium covered three main points namely data consolidation, reviewing permits and increasing oil palm productivity.\xa0\nHe said that for the last three years, the government has managed to consolidate data and concluded that the total area of oil palm plantations is about 16.8 million ha, around\xa03.47 million ha of which have been cultivated inside forest areas.\xa0\xa0\n“That 3.4 million ha is problematic because by law it cannot be in the forest, it must have a permit to ‘release’ forest areas,” he said, referring to a permit that allows a forest area to be converted for non-forestry uses.\xa0\n“The moratorium has postponed the permit issuance so that the government has enough time to evaluate it,” said Mr Eryan.\xa0\nHowever, he claimed that there has been no official information on permit reviews and what officials have achieved to increase oil palm productivity.\xa0\nHe noted though that some local governments such as in West Papua have taken the initiative to do their own evaluation and revoke permits.\nSince the moratorium has not fully accomplished what it set out to do, Mr Eryan said it should be extended as it prevents deforestation.\xa0\n“Even though it only withholds or delays granting permits, it means that the forests cannot be encroached and they will remain intact.\xa0\n“It (the moratorium) has an impact because the regulations are targeted.”\nMr Eryan pointed out that the government said that deforestation has decreased from about 460,000 ha in 2019 to 115,000 ha in 2020, a drop of 75 per cent, and it admitted that the moratorium is an effective instrument to reduce emission.\xa0\n“This is one of the reasons why the presidential instruction should be maintained,” he added.\xa0\nNot extending the moratorium would also lead to a loss of state revenue, said Mr Trias Fetra, programme officer of palm oil governance at non-governmental organisation (NGO) Madani Berkelanjutan, which focuses on forest and land sustainability.\nHe claimed that some palm oil companies have already started planting illegally. Based on his calculation in two provinces that are central to palm oil, namely Riau and West Kalimantan, the state\xa0could lose an income of 191 billion rupiah (US$13.3 billion) and 660 billion rupiah respectively.\nGreenpeace Southeast Asia’s global head of forest campaign Kiki Taufik has similar views and added that in the absence of the moratorium, the controversial Job Creation Law which was passed last year would be used to resolve problems with oil palm plantations inside forest areas.\xa0\nThe Job Creation Law, also known as the Omnibus Law, would pave the way for parties that have been in forest areas prior to the enforcement of the oil palm moratorium in 2018 to be given an amnesty.\xa0\n“And this is what we (environmentalists) are concerned about because the moratorium was positive. For example, it was found that about 500,000 ha of plantations had problems with their licences,” Mr Taufik told CNA.\nThis raises the question of how serious the authorities are in tackling climate change, said Mr Taufik.\xa0\n“If the government has big ambitions to tackle climate change, its commitment to the Paris Agreement, they should have continued the moratorium because the implementation of it is not fully done yet,” he said.\nIndonesia has ratified the Paris Agreement\xa0and targets to reduce 29 per cent of its carbon emission by 2030 or 41 per cent with international support.\xa0\nIt also aims to limit annual deforestation to 325,000 ha and 450,000 ha between 2020 and 2030. The government has also pledged\xa0to achieve net zero emissions by 2060.\n“The moratorium is the main way for the improvement of the palm oil industry,” said Mr Taufik.\n“It ensures that forests in Indonesia are not arbitrarily converted without heeding climate commitments.”\xa0\nProfessor Bambang Hero Saharjo, a forest protection lecturer at IPB University, an agricultural university in Bogor, said he was\xa0a bit shocked that the moratorium has ended since it helped in reducing deforestation.\xa0\n“The oil palm moratorium is actually not only preventing excessive and inappropriate oil palm expansion, but it also shows our commitment to the outside world how we protect the remaining forests from the possible threat of illegal oil palm expansion.\xa0\n“The public also knows that currently millions of hectares of oil palm are in forest areas and various parties are trying to legalise it with various options and statements such as stating that the forest has no economic value so it does not need to be maintained,” said the professor who has for numerous times been an expert witness in environmental crime cases.\xa0\nHe also opined it is unfortunate that the REDD+ deal has ended but he applauded the government’s move to end the cooperation with Norway if promises have not been kept. REDD+ refers to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation scheme, a deal between Indonesia and Norway to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation.\xa0\nWhen announcing the end of the 11-year partnership, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had cited lack of payment as the reason but asserted that it would remain committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\xa0\xa0\n“I'm sure the government must have a plan so that it dares to take these two actions because it is closely related to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29 per cent by 2030,” he said.\nMr Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, the director general of forestry planning and environmental management with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said on Sep 24\xa0that Indonesia would not approve new\xa0permits even after the oil\xa0palm moratorium ended.\n“Even without (the moratorium), the policy laid down by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry is to continue the ban on new permits for clearing forest for oil palm plantations,” he said during an online press conference.\nSpeaking virtually at the United Nations General Assembly last week, Mr Widodo also stressed that a “green and sustainable economy” would be prioritised due to Indonesia’s strategic place on climate change. He said Indonesia has succeeded in reducing forest fires by 82 per cent last year, compared to the previous year.\xa0\n“Deforestation rates have dropped significantly, the lowest in 20 years,” he said.\xa0\nMeanwhile, head of the Indonesian Palm Oil Farmers Association Gulat Manurung said that what is most important now is to increase productivity and the moratorium has helped to maintain the price of crude palm oil, so it is still needed.\nDespite the current uncertainties, Prof Saharjo\xa0opined that everyone plays a role in mitigating deforestation.\xa0\n“Efforts to reduce the rate of deforestation are actually the responsibility of all of us and not solely the government.”\nCNA has approached the environment ministry and the presidential spokesperson for comments on whether the moratorium would be renewed.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ', '     climate change ', '     deforestation ']}"

      Air quality in Singapore improved in 2020, with slowdown in economic and transport activities: NEA report
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Air quality in Singapore improved in 2020, with the decrease in economic and transport activities due to\xa0COVID-19 contributing to this improvement, said a\xa0report on Singapore\'s environment.\nThe air quality in Singapore was in the Good\xa0to Moderate\xa0range on all days of 2020, according to the inaugural\xa0State of the Environment: Air and Water Quality Report published by the National Environment Agency (NEA).\nThe relatively wet weather during the traditional dry season in the second half of 2020 also helped to keep pollutant levels down, said NEA.\nThe ""circuit breaker"" period saw a 28.8 per cent reduction in the atmospheric levels\xa0of fine particulate matter or PM2.5, a 38.1 per cent\xa0reduction in nitrogen dioxide, a 5.6 per cent\xa0reduction in carbon monoxide, and 58.1 per cent\xa0reduction in sulphur dioxide over levels in the same time period in the previous three years.\nThe ambient air quality in Singapore is continuously monitored through a network of air monitoring analysers. These sensors\xa0measure the level of six criteria air pollutants: Sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (both PM10 and PM2.5), and a variety of volatile organic compounds.\nNEA primarily benchmarks Singapore’s air quality against the World Health Organization\'s Air Quality Guidelines.\nWhile Singapore was able to meet the WHO limits for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, the limits for particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), sulphur dioxide\xa0and ozone were exceeded, the report said.\nParticulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5):\xa0In 2020, the annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels exceeded WHO guidelines. However, they were the lowest recorded over the last 10 years.\nApart from the elevated levels in years affected by severe transboundary haze, the trend shows that the levels of PM10 and PM2.5 have been decreasing over the past decade.\nSulphur dioxide:\xa0Singapore’s maximum 24-hour SO2 mean in 2020 was 30 µg/m3, the lowest over the past 10 years. However, this is still above WHO guidelines of 20 µg/m3.\nIndustrial and shipping activities are the main sources of Singapore’s SO2 emissions. The reduction of industrial activities was the likely key reason for the improved performance.\nNitrogen dioxide:\xa0The annual NO2\xa0mean of 20 µg/m3\xa0n 2020 was the lowest it has been in the last 10 years.i\nSingapore has been meeting the WHO baseline\xa0of 40 µg/m3\xa0over the past decade.\nCarbon monoxide:\xa0Singapore’s maximum 8-hour\xa0mean for CO in 2020 was 1.2 mg/m3, well within\xa0the WHO standard of 10 mg/m3. It was also the lowest recorded concentration over the last 10 years.\nFor water quality, Singapore\'s\xa0inland, coastal, and recreational beach waters, have met their respective water quality guidelines.\nSeven popular beaches achieved a Good\xa0banding on NEA’s recreational water quality guidelines, consistent with primary contact recreational activities.\nThese activities are those that\xa0involve immersion in water, such as swimming, windsurfing\xa0and other water sports.\nMr Ram Bhaskar, NEA\'s deputy chief executive officer (environmental protection) and director-general of environmental protection said:\xa0“We enjoy clean ambient air and inland and coastal waters throughout most times of the year.\n""This is achieved through a multi-prong pollution management strategy comprising upstream planning controls, surveillance and enforcement, and downstream environmental monitoring.\n""The state of our air and water quality serves as a gauge in assessing the effectiveness of the pollution management strategies and drives policy reviews, as we continue to strive towards achieving international environmental standards.""\nNEA said it has been conducting trials of new monitoring technologies, including the use of low-cost air quality sensors. These sensors will provide a higher spatial resolution of the dispersion of air pollutants, added NEA.\nThe low cost and portability of the sensors make it possible to obtain air quality measurements in more locations, such as along roadsides, in areas where\xa0there is\xa0high pedestrian activity, or near sources of pollution that may not have space to site an air quality monitoring station.\nThe agency is also collaborating with research institutions to ""tap on additional scientific support"".\nFor example, there is a project with the National University of Singapore’s Environmental Research Institute (NERI) to better determine if smoke haze incidents could be due to peatland burning.\nDuring the 2019 haze episode, the peat forest smoke indicator developed by NERI was used and it established that PM2.5 mainly originated from peatland burning in the region, as analysis conducted on it revealed higher fractions of the unique ratios of organic carbon in the carbonaceous profile of PM2.5.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     National Environment Agency ', '     NEA ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced a series of targets for Malaysia to achieve in its 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP), which he unveiled on Monday (Sep 27) in parliament.\xa0\nThe five-year plan, to be implemented from 2021 to 2025, aims to reduce income disparities, as well as the gulf in development between more developed areas such as the Klang Valley and less developed ones such as Peninsular Malaysia’s east coast and the Bornean states of Sabah and Sarawak.\xa0\nIn addition, the government forecasted gross domestic product (GDP) to hit between 4.5 and 5.5 per cent growth between 2021 to 2025, while also committing to Malaysia being a carbon neutral country by 2050 at the earliest.\xa0\nMr Ismail Sabri also said the government would continue to fulfil its commitment towards reducing Malaysia’s greenhouse gas emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent come 2030. Greenhouse gas intensity is the ratio of a country’s emissions to the economic value it generates.\nThe 12MP also aims to tackle inequalities by closing the income gap and prioritising development for Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia and other less developed states in the peninsula.\xa0\nIn examining the goals announced, experts cautioned that their implementation would require further consideration and planning.\xa0\nTake the carbon tax as example, a climate activist told CNA that the government has to make sure that it would not turn out to be an additional financial burden on the ordinary people.\xa0\nMalaysia should not rely on external conditions, but has to do much more to improve its competitiveness and investment climate in order to achieve the aforementioned GDP growth targets, said an economist.\xa0\nThe 2050 carbon neutral timeline was in itself a problem, climate change activist Ili Nadiah Dzulfakar said, citing a warning by the Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG) that net zero targets were no longer sufficient to avoid climate disaster.\xa0\nQuoting findings by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report, the CCAG said last month that net negative, instead of net zero (not adding new carbon emissions to the atmosphere), strategies were required.\xa0\xa0\n“2050 might be too late for us to be carbon neutral,” Ms Ili Nadiah, who heads the non-governmental organisation Klima Action Malaysia (KAMY), said.\xa0\nThe transition towards natural gas was also problematic, she added, as methane - a byproduct of burning natural gas for power generation - was many more times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\xa0\n“Instead of spending money going towards renewable energy sources, the money is being spent towards natural gas to transition out of coal,” she said of the pledge to stop building new coal power plants.\nMs Ili Nadiah also questioned whether Malaysia was ready to embrace carbon neutrality as an overarching policy.\xa0\n“Although 12MP is a five-year plan, sub-sector policies such as the country’s plan for energy generation do not match up with the aim to reduce carbon emissions,” she said.\nAs an example, 12MP would see more roads being constructed, including 2,800km of tarred roads planned for Sarawak, Sabah, Pahang and Negeri Sembilan, which were estimated to cost nearly RM700 million (US$167 million) to boost land connectivity for rural areas.\xa0\nOther road projects included the West Coast Highway running between Selangor and Perak, a Central Spine Road project from Bentong in Pahang to Kuala Krai in Kelantan, and a highway connecting Kota Bharu, the state capital of Kelantan, and Kuala Krai.\nThis could translate into more cars on the road, Ms Ili Nadiah said. “But at the same time, we are pushing concepts like carbon neutrality.”\n“Malaysia does not have any proper studies being done on how to achieve this (carbon neutrality), and it’s problematic, as in you have good policy statements, but no implementation,” she said.\xa0\nWhile applauding the government’s plan to introduce carbon tax and carbon trading as part of Malaysia’s move to tackle carbon emissions, the activist said the government had to be sure on whom the burden of the carbon tax would fall later. “Because it should not be a burden on the ordinary people,” she said.\xa0\nShe pointed to Singapore, where a carbon tax rate of S$5 (US$3.69) per tonne of greenhouse gas has been imposed on taxable industrial emitters.\xa0\n“S$5 might be low, but it’s a start. So in Malaysia, how are they going to set the pricing?”\xa0\nSeveral conditions need to be lined up in order for Malaysia to hit 4.5 to 5.5 per cent GDP growth in the next four years, according to Sunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng.\xa0\n“Given that Malaysia’s total imports and exports accounted for about 125 per cent of annual GDP over the past five years, a favourable external environment is necessary, but not a sufficient condition for Malaysia to achieve this five-year plan target,” he said.\nHe added that the country\xa0would have to improve its investment climate and create a conducive operating environment. This is\xa0so that its manufacturing sector could continue to expand, invest and upgrade, particularly for the electronics and electrical industries.\xa0\nMalaysia would also need to further modernise its infrastructure, as well as upgrade both its industries and the quality of its human capital, to remain competitive and stay ahead of fast-advancing regional competitors, especially Vietnam and Indonesia, Prof Yeah said.\n“Outside the plan’s scope, you also need outstanding institutional reforms and reconfiguring of the political system and structures to bring about political stability, good governance and trust in the government,” he said.\nMoreover, investor confidence would be buoyed if there was a continued commitment to the plan’s policies and programmes.\xa0\nWIthout the political conditions, as well as a sustained policy and strategy focus, the best laid plans typically fell far short of the targets set, as had happened in previous long-term plans, the economist added.\nFailure to attract private investment in the plan’s priority sectors and private sector participation in technological adoption, digitalisation or green growth development would mean that the various game-changing strategies in the five-year plan would come to nought, he cautioned.\xa0\nIn Monday’s 12MP unveiling, Mr Ismail Sabri stated that at least 50 per cent of the plan’s development allocation - the largest ever at RM400 billion - would be allocated to the more underdeveloped states of Kelantan, Kedah, Terengganu, Perlis, Sabah and Sarawak.\xa0\nSingapore Institute of International Affairs senior fellow Dr Oh Ei Sun, who is a Sabahan, said the East Malaysian states could only hope that they could get the lion’s share of that 50 per cent.\xa0\n“Frankly speaking, Sabah and Sarawak are so lagging in development that basically any amount helps.\xa0\n“It’s just the way it is. The two East Malaysian states are very often almost like an afterthought,” he said.\nThe 12MP aims to reduce the GDP gap between the central territories (generally comprising Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and the federal territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya) to a 1:2.5 ratio for Sabah, and 1:1.2 for Sarawak.\xa0\nCommenting on this, Dr Oh pointed out that nothing was assured in present conditions.\xa0\nThese targets, he added, were estimates for Malaysia to plan its future economic development.\xa0\n“These five-year plans are even more unpredictable than national budgets for the next year, which are already dicey enough,” he said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     economy ', '     development ', '     environment ']}"

      Climate education still a ‘peripheral topic’ in Southeast Asia’s syllabus amid calls to make it compulsory
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: When children step into Green School Bali, their experience is designed to be intimately entwined with nature. From the bamboo classrooms and jungle surrounds, to lessons focused on solving the challenges facing the planet, the notions of what education has traditionally looked like and sought to achieve have been upended here.\n“A big part of educating for sustainability is finding that reconnection with nature that humans have lost over the years. It’s embedded in everything we do,” said Sal Gordon, the school’s head of teaching.\n“It’s the rain, it’s the mud, it’s the snakes, it’s the gardens, it’s the rice fields. Our campus and nature itself is part of our classroom.”\xa0\nThe curriculum here is focused on empowering young people to become community-minded citizens with the skills to make an impact now and into the future. Sustainability is at the heart of the school’s mission and the challenges of climate change take centre stage.\nLearning facts and taking tests, elements of schooling ingrained in classrooms across the globe, are replaced by projects with real-world applications and impact.\n“Our students are able to understand that their learning is connected to the natural world even if it’s just through the physical environment and that their learning can have a positive impact moving towards a sustainable environment as well,” Gordon said.\n“Education has been stuck in a time capsule for 200 years. It’s out of date but if you can change that model you will automatically start educating for a sustainable future.”\nModels like this one are rare anywhere in the world, let alone Southeast Asia, where the wider implementation of climate education has been challenging.But there is a push for action to make learning focused on climate change, the environment and civic engagement, a greater priority for governments.\xa0\xa0\nAt upcoming climate change talks in Glasgow next month, a coalition led by non-governmental organisation EARTHDAY.ORG will be pushing for climate change education to be made compulsory in every classroom in the world.\nHundreds of organisations have signed up to a letter to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the influential International Trades Union Confederation and Education International, both representing millions of teachers and workers.\nThey want new standards and ambitions that could end up resonating in classrooms across this region and the world.Nick\xa0Nuttall, the international strategic communications director for EARTHDAY.ORG said climate education as a concept has long been present in international doctrines but rarely been a priority for collective action and overshadowed by temperature rise targets and emissions accounting.\nRight now, it is largely absent from national curriculums and only taught piece-meal by enthusiastic teachers or forward thinking schools, the former spokesperson for the UNFCCC told CNA.\n“The fact is that only one country in the 20 years that governments have been talking about this under the climate change treaty has grasped the nettle and included climate change education and woven it right across their national curriculum. And that’s Italy,” Nuttall said.\xa0\nAt present, Italy is the only country to have placed climate change and sustainability at the core of its school curriculum. Beginning in September last year, students aged between 6 and 19 have had these topics engrained into their daily lessons.\nResearch shows that the impacts of such education can be significant globally when measured.The Brookings Institution found that if just 16 per cent of high school students in high and middle-income countries received climate change education, the result would be a nearly 19 gigaton reduction of carbon dioxide by 2050.\nThat number can be amplified by educating millions of girls who remain out of school in the developing world, the study found. It suggests that education could be a more powerful lever to combating climate change than increasing investments in solar or wind energy.\xa0\nIn addition, reductions in climate change vulnerability to extreme weather events and temperatures in the developing world could be realised simply by educating young women.\n“Technology will get you so far, but what you need is a behavioural change that comes through education. Because you need citizens to be able to hold governments to account for their inspiring actions or their failed decisions,” Nuttall said.\n“You need to build a green consumer movement and you also need to build the entrepreneurs and creative skills for the new kinds of technologies, policies, business models that some people broadly call the green economy,” he said.\n“This case is being made very clearly right now. Why are we educating young people about climate change? It’s their future and it’s going to be a very different future.”\nIn Southeast Asia, a region already feeling the impacts of climate change, the rollout of education programs with an emphasis on sustainability has been slow.\nWhile some countries have provisions for sustainability in their education plans, there are gaps, inconsistencies and inequities.\xa0\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) admits the hurdles are steep in this region, despite some positive signs of a willingness to take education on sustainable development (ESD) more seriously.\xa0\nIn a policy review report this year, it concluded that climate change education (CCE) “has not emerged as an independent field” and is “still very much in its infancy” in Southeast Asia.\n“CCE is still a peripheral topic in both educational research and practice. It is important to anticipate the possible scenarios under which this minor educational theme could develop into a central focus of education and become established as an independent concept and focus area,” the report stated.\nThe divide between urban and rural schools, international schools and state schools and those in national languages against ethnic dialects is a problem for education generally. But it widens when it comes to climate change topics.\n“Already there are deeply embedded inequalities in education where access to equitable education for the poor is a major challenge,” said Faryal Khan, a programme specialist for education, based at UNESCO in Bangkok.\n“Do they have access to climate change education? And are their teachers prepared? This is questionable. We can guess somewhat at the answers. It’s not a very equal situation.”\xa0\nBut Khan says there are signs of slow progress. The Adiwiyata Green Schools program in Indonesia tries to integrate ESD into the classroom and create an eco-friendly atmosphere for environmentally-conscious students.\nThailand and Vietnam both have sustainability built into their national education frameworks, while Philippine schools have largely focused on individual actions, with students taught to care for in-school gardens and understand waste management,\nActivists there are hoping to persuade regional education departments to include tailored lessons about climate adaptation and broader science about the man-made causes of climate change.\xa0\n“Some teachers are very open to changing their ways of teaching. But as of right now, it’s very outdated and focused more on the individuals rather than holding the major polluters accountable,” said Xian Guevarra, the national coordinator for Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines (YACAP).\xa0\n“People have always been saying, ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’, and ‘live a zero waste lifestyle’. And while we’re not saying that’s bad, it’s not actually the solution. We need to change the system to fix the climate crisis that we’re currently facing,” he said.\nWhile frameworks and guidelines are in place, UNESCO wants to see improved national level policies that filter down to schools of all kinds.\n“While countries are making advances, some of the challenges that remain are at the policy level,” Khan said.\n“ESD is interpreted with a very narrow focus on topical issues rather than with a holistic view and there are gaps between governments’ initial policy commitments and implementation.\n“Teachers are really at the heart of ESD, but often they are not prepared. They have to sometimes scramble to find resources, because most of the in-service training that teachers have does not include education for sustainable development or climate change,” she said\nHOW CAN SCHOOL SYSTEMS MOVE FASTER?\nWhile institutions like Green School Bali can move dynamically, adjusting their curriculum to changing world events and situations, the sometimes slow moving nature of national ministries makes it hard for learning materials to stay modern and relevant.\nSunita Rajakumar, the founder of Climate Governance Malaysia, spends her working days speaking with top company leaders. She says even private businesses are struggling to keep pace.She has backed the plans to make climate education compulsory, but worries about the ability of large government ministries in Malaysia to make systemic changes fast enough to contend with the urgency of climate change.\xa0\n“The Ministry of Education is one of the largest in the government. It’s this huge aircraft carrier. It’s not going to be able to pivot on a dime,” she said.“When there’s something disruptive, it really takes a lot to have this paradigm shift. The measure to increase resilience has to be educating this next generation.”\nCOVID-19 has hampered progress in this space. Students across the region have missed hundreds of days of in-person learning. The result has been school systems falling back on what has always been done, in the form of traditional teaching.Harriet Burrows, Green School Bali’s head of high school says she believes the solution is for national systems to move away from a focus on content and instead build students’ skills.“Do we ask our students to show up every day with the willingness and eagerness to question, to think critically and to solve and adapt? \n“That’s a big shift for national systems because they’re rooted in the idea of memorising content to prove you’re intelligent, you’re ready for the workforce and you’re ready for the world,” she said.\n“It will take some of these young people to get into those systems and be given voices in those systems to really enable that change to happen.”\xa0\nThe lack of government-mandated climate education has opened the door to education entrepreneurs to fill a gap.\nThe founders of Earth Warriors, a global early childhood education curriculum, noticed a lack of climate education content available to any children under the age of 11. Keya Lamba and Shweta Bahri have designed materials suitable for those aged between 3 and 7, which they hope will be adopted by schools around the world. Their courses have been peer reviewed and supported by climate scientists.\n“Our whole mission and belief is that if you build these sustainable habits at a young age, then being a conscious citizen that cares about the planet comes as naturally to these kids as brushing their teeth,” Lamba said.\n“There’s a lot of evidence that shows this is true. It can also nudge the adults around them as well,” she said. \n""We try to show that kids are the ones demanding and making the changes. Climate change education has to be everywhere at every age group. It’s so critical and it’s surprising that it’s not taken very seriously or urgently.”\nThey aim to challenge assumptions that learning about climate change is too complex or daunting for children, and eventually advocate for governments to include this type of material themselves.\nFrom their research, they say there is no formal inclusion of climate education in Southeast or South Asia. But they first plan to deliberately target schools with higher fees, like those that use international curriculums.\xa0 “We made a very conscious decision. Research shows that it’s people from higher income backgrounds that are contributing a lot more to climate change than people from lower income backgrounds,” Bahri said.\nChildren are already highly exposed to the impacts of climate change. The recently released Children’s Climate Risk Index from UNICEF found that more than 99 per cent of children are exposed to at least one major climate and environmental hazard, shock or stress, “creating a child’s rights crisis”.\nClimate impacts such as flooding, cyclones, water scarcity, disease and air pollution overlap and compound in many parts of the world. Children in those often-poor parts of the world face even more future risks.\nIt is a further reason why experts want to accelerate the ability of young people to contribute to solutions and feel empowered to tackle these inherited issues. “There’s a growing recognition that we owe something to them, that they have a voice and a seat at the table,” Rajakumar of Climate Governance Malaysia said.\n“And there’s no silver bullet. There’s no dashboard, no roadmap, so why not invite the children to the table as well?”\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     education ', '     United Nations ', '     environment ']}"

      Coastal protection projects to build resilience of Singapore’s coastlines at Pulau Ubin
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The National Parks Board (NParks) will implement “nature-based solutions” to build the resilience of Singapore’s coastlines at Pulau Ubin, it announced on Saturday (Sep 25).\nA nature-based solution refers to the use of nature to tackle socio-environmental challenges to benefit both humans and biodiversity.\nAn upcoming coastal protection project will be along approximately 2.2km of the northern coastline of Pulau Ubin, complemented by a mangrove restoration project at Sungei Durian, located along Pulau Ubin’s southern coastline.\n“By planting trees and shrubs, as well as enhancing and restoring our mangroves along our coasts, we can help to defend ourselves from rising sea levels, while at the same time, providing key habitats for marine and coastal species to thrive,” said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at the launch of NParks’ 10th edition of Festival of Biodiversity on Saturday.\n“This will restore the island’s coastlines and mangrove habitats, and bring back more of the island’s rich biodiversity by addressing ongoing erosion and habitat loss.”\nThe upcoming Pulau Ubin coastal protection projects come after similar projects at Pulau Tekong and Kranji Coastal Nature Park.\xa0\nThe coastal resilience solutions are part of Singapore’s efforts to strengthen its climate resilience, a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.\nAnother measure involves intensifying and enhancing nature in our green spaces. This will help to cool the environment.\xa0\nMr Lee said that NParks will set aside another 1,000ha for green spaces, like nature reserves, parks, and park connectors, in addition to the existing 7,800ha.\nNParks will also plant an additional one million trees through the OneMillionTrees movement.\xa0\n“These trees and green spaces can sequester carbon, improve our air and water quality, provide shade for pedestrians, and cool our urban environment, especially in some of our hotter areas, such as our industrial zones,” he said.\xa0\nSingapore will also naturalise its blue spaces to improve flood resilience, said Mr Lee. Such blue spaces include waterways and water bodies.\n“Over the past decade, we have been widening and deepening our existing drains, and building larger new drains, to improve our flood resilience. But we are also naturalising our waterways and water bodies, by transforming concrete canals into natural rivers or streams, or reservoirs into natural lakes,” he added.\xa0\n“This will help to reduce the risk of flash floods for adjacent properties. At the same time, it creates new habitats for wildlife and more recreational spaces for Singaporeans to enjoy.”\nMr Lee cited Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Jurong Lake Gardens as examples of such spaces.\xa0\nThe nature-based solutions will also improve Singapore’s ecological resilience, by creating new habitats and connecting existing ones, added Mr Lee.\nOne example of an NParks’ biodiversity conservation programme is the species recovery programme, which makes special effort to conserve the country’s key native flora and fauna, especially “rare and threatened” species.\xa0\nUnder the species recovery programme, NParks will set “more ambitious targets”, he announced.\xa0\nIts recovery efforts will be increased from 90 plant and 40 animal species currently, to 100 plant and 60 animal species by 2030.\xa0\nAnother programme is the NParks’ Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef programme, which experiments with a new mineral accretion technology that “stimulates corals through low-voltage electricity to promote coral growth”.\nMr Lee also recognised marine conservation efforts, pointing to the Singapore Red List, which includes the conservation status of plants and animals that are vulnerable or endangered.\nMore than 40 of Singapore's animal species are now more resilient, he said.\xa0\nThe Sunda Slow Loris and the Lesser Mousedeer are among these species that are less threatened now.\xa0\nThis year’s Festival of Biodiversity includes a virtual webinar on Singapore's rainforests, as well as in-person tree-planting with safe-distancing measures in places.

      ‘Endangered’ status puts spotlight on Komodo dragon protection as Indonesia government defends upgrade projects
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Weighing up to 150kg and growing up to 3m long, the Komodo dragons are the world’s largest lizards only found in Indonesia’s Komodo National Park and neighbouring Flores Island.\nThe cannibals eat deer and pigs, and are even capable of attacking humans with their shark-like teeth and poisonous venom.\nDespite that, the scaly-skinned animals attract many people to\xa0the World Heritage-listed Komodo National Park, which is known for its unique savannah landscape.\n“The Komodos are interesting because they have a character unlike any other animal,” tourist guide Yon Johannes in Labuan Bajo, Flores, told CNA, adding that they live on the edge of forests or savannahs.\nIt is believed the Komodos have existed for millions of years, but they face increasing threats from climate change and infrastructure projects.\xa0\nEarlier this month, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) changed the Komodo dragons’ status from a vulnerable animal to endangered in its Red List of Threatened Species, the first update for the monitor lizards in more than 20 years.\xa0\nThere are only about 3,000 Komodo dragons in the wild and the IUCN said the impacts of climate change are threats to the rare animal.\nHuman activities such as cutting down forests to make way for infrastructure projects could also threaten the Komodos’ habitat and their existence, said researchers interviewed by CNA.\xa0\nWith IUCN’s reclassification of the monitor lizards, locals have called for the government to reconsider the ongoing projects and pay more attention to environmental protection.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nThe government, on the other hand, said the IUCN acknowledged that the lizards in the national park were well-protected. The infrastructure projects there were only meant to upgrade old facilities, a minister added.\xa0\nThe IUCN announcement came after a peer-reviewed paper stressed that global heating would affect the Komodo dragons. Thus, urgent conservation actions are needed to save them from extinction.\xa0\xa0\nThe organisation\xa0said rising global temperature and\xa0sea levels as a result of climate change were expected to reduce the Komodo dragons’ suitable habitat by at least 30 per cent in the next 45 years.\xa0\nHerpetology curator Evy Arida, who has researched the Komodos extensively, said IUCN’s\xa0classification is justified given the number of the Komodos.\xa0\n“This endangered status is a warning that Indonesia does not take its endemic animals seriously,” she said.\n“We also must bear in mind that climate change does not only threaten one species. It so happens that this one species (the Komodo) is endemic to Indonesia so it’s in the limelight, but there are also other animals (in the Komodo National Park),” Mdm Arida, who works\xa0at Bogor’s Zoology Museum, said.\xa0\nMr Wiratno, director general of natural resources and ecosystem conservation with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said he was aware of the findings.\nHowever, he pointed out that the IUCN said Komodo’s subpopulation in the national park was stable and well-protected. \nHe claimed that the problem was with the lizards in Flores, which\xa0is not part of the Komodo National Park. The giant lizards there are under the care of the local government.\n“We have been monitoring the Komodo’s population for 17 years in the national park.\n“And we protect them by holding patrols, as well as by ensuring their prey such as deer and buffaloes are not being hunted,” Mr Wiratno, who goes by one name, said.\nHe claimed that the IUCN had never been to the Komodo National Park and he did not understand how the organisation came to its conclusion.\nMr Wiratno opined that the IUCN should have consulted the Indonesian government.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“We have installed chips on about 1,200 Komodo dragons, under their skin.\n“We have something like a barcode and if we catch one, we know whether it is one which we have identified before or a new one.\xa0We have enough data,” Mr Wiratno told CNA.\xa0\xa0\nNonetheless, he said officials\xa0have yet to identify\xa0rising sea levels as a threat.\xa0\n“We know the Komodos’ behaviours and habitats. It is dangerous for them to be near the beach.\xa0\n“So we will need to predict the sea levels and how far the sea could reach,” said Mr Wiratno.\nMdm Arida of Bogor’s Zoology Museum said many human activities in Flores endanger the Komodos. These include hunting, smuggling of the animal and burning of the savannah, which causes deer, the Komodos’ prey, to migrate.\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is also concerned about infrastructure projects in the Komodo National Park.\nAbout two years ago, the Indonesian government started to develop the Komodo National Park as part of an integrated tourism master plan for the site and Labuan Bajo, a town west of Flores which is the gateway to the park.\nSome have dubbed the infrastructure project “Jurassic Park” after images of a Komodo believed to be on Rinca Island facing a truck went viral last year.\xa0\nAt the 44th session of UNESCO’S World Heritage Committee (WHC) in July, it requested, among others, the authorities to revise the environmental impact assessment for the tourism infrastructure projects on Rinca Island, one of the main islands in the national park, and to resubmit it to the World Heritage Centre for review by IUCN.\nIt also urged the Indonesian government to halt all tourism infrastructure projects in and around the area that have the potential to impact on its Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), one of the main criteria used by the committee to decide whether a site should be granted a World Heritage status.\xa0\nSpeaking at a virtual press conference on Sep 6, Indonesia’s Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno said the current constructions did not violate any World Heritage rules and were meant to repair rundown facilities. \n“What has been done, including in the Komodo National Park, was repairing rundown facilities which were fragile and needed renovation, such as shelters for the rangers and so on. And these were according to the needs.\n“And it is not like what people have been discussing, as if it is a massive development. We can guarantee it is not like that,” said Mr Uno.\xa0\nThe minister also said that the projects would be completed by October or November, in time for Indonesia’s G20 presidency as the park would be one of the meeting venues.\xa0\nThe new plan would entail certain restrictions to allow sustainable tourism, he added.\nCommenting on the infrastructure projects, Mr Wiratno of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry said they were mainly to renovate the old information centre and build an elevated deck for visitors’ safety. These do not affect the OUV, he added.\n“The Komodo dragons can walk under the elevated deck,” he said, adding that the infrastructure projects were meant to improve the World Heritage site and the affected area was just 1.3ha. The national park covers an area of\xa0173,000ha, according to the Indonesian government. \n“Yes, there are Komodo dragons there, but none of them have been a victim of the development,” he claimed, adding that the development projects were only on Rinca Island. \nHowever, Mr Cypri Jehan Paju Dale, an anthropologist at Kyoto University’s Center for Southeast Asian Studies who researches on conservation, ecotourism and interspecies co-existence at Komodo, was not convinced.\xa0\n“The Indonesian government and business communities should take the IUCN report and UNESCO’s reminder seriously.\xa0\n“The central government should revise the whole master plan of tourism development inside Komodo National Park and annul all the business concessions,” he said.\nCommenting on the environment ministry’s claim that the development projects only affected 1.3ha of Rinca island, Mr Dale said the effects of such activities were far-reaching.\xa0\nWhile the giant lizards only live on several plots in the coastal areas with water sources and forests, the rest of the terrestrial and marine areas are the supporting habitat, he said.\xa0\nThe visitor centres and resort concessions said to be taking place at the islands would harm the specific habitat of the Komodo dragons, he added.\nMr Johannes, the tour guide in Labuan Bajo, confirmed many developments were taking place in the town and its surroundings.\n“There are a lot of developments here, from infrastructures to new properties, so the pollution levels here are unusually high,” said the Labuan Bajo native.\xa0\nAnother tour guide, Mr Ahmad Fadil, said he was concerned about the well-being of the Komodos.\n“That is why I always remind visitors not to take everything, except pictures. Don’t kill anything, except time, and don’t leave anything behind, except footsteps,” he said, adding that tourists should not take corals home or litter when visiting the national park.\nLabuan Bajo-based Muhammad Sunardi said he was also very worried about\xa0climate change and the developments in the area.\xa0\nHe pointed out that the developments on Rinca Island, currently closed for visitors, could be useful for tourists, but the animals could suffer.\xa0\n“As a local, I hope the government would consider\xa0developments that do not disturb the Komodo dragons. The government should not just think about itself and the stakeholders in developing this Komodo tourist destination.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     climate change ', '     sustainability ', '     tourism ']}"

Global poverty rates are lower, infant mortality and life expectancies are better, and education rates are much higher,” Bezos, 57, said in the statement.\n“There is a notable exception - the natural world is not better today than it was 500 years ago, when we enjoyed unspoiled forests, clean rivers, and the pristine air of the pre-industrial age. We can and must reverse this anomaly.”\xa0\nBezos, the world’s second-richest person and founder of Amazon.com, has promised to distribute US$10 billion by 2030. His current net worth is around US$194.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nConservation is the first of a three-part “nature strategy” the Earth Fund will support, with future commitments for landscape restoration and food-system transformation.\nSo far, the fund has distributed US$864 million. Earlier this month, Bezos announced he would give an additional US$130 million to groups supporting the Justice40 Initiative, an effort by the Biden administration to fight climate change and support disadvantaged communities, by the end of the year.\nThe Earth Fund’s statement quoted world leaders lauding the pledge, including Amina Mohammed, United Nations deputy secretary general, John Kerry, US special presidential envoy for climate, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\xa0\n“I look forward to working more with the Bezos Earth Fund in our shared fight for the planet in the run up to COP26,” Johnson said, referring to the international climate change meeting to be held in Glasgow, Scotland starting in late October.\nJohnson was scheduled to meet Bezos on Monday, with the prime minister saying beforehand that he planned to tell the billionaire that Amazon must pay its fair share of taxes in the country and address working standards for UK employees. Johnson also said he would congratulate Bezos “on his massive forestry initiative”.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     conservation ', '     climate change ', '     biodiversity ']}"

      Commentary: Could corporate gifts like mooncakes be cut down as more work from home?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Each Mid-Autumn Festival, mooncakes draw flak for the food and packaging waste they generate\xa0-\xa0and it is easy to see why.\nThey have come to represent an arms race of unnecessary packaging, with increasingly lavish boxes rolled out each year. Lacquered, embroidered, sequined, or adorned with ornaments, they are not only almost impossible to resist, but also to recycle.\nMooncakes have been a common gift companies and organisations routinely send to business partners and clients as a form of goodwill to maintain network ties and cultivate social capital. \nIt makes good business too when some 20 to 50 per cent of mooncake businesses come from corporate sales.\nThis is the second Mid-Autumn Festival celebrated under the shadow of the pandemic. With many companies maintaining work-from-home arrangements, should organisations scrap the giving of mooncakes?\nMore than half of the businesses and households surveyed said that they would rather not receive mooncakes, according to a pre-pandemic 2019 survey in Hong Kong. \nWith many offices largely empty on most days, it seems pointless to send perishable gifts to workplaces, and it is unclear if people are comfortable revealing their home address just to receive corporate gifts at home instead. \nIn Singapore, firms also told the Business Times last year they planned to reduce or stop the practice of giving mooncakes altogether, to mitigate costs after losses suffered from COVID-19. Anticipating a sharp drop in demand, many mooncake businesses, like Tai Chong Kok, ordered 30 per cent fewer ingredients like lotus seeds.\nThis trend of organisations moving away from corporate gifting during the Mid-Autumn Festival may aid in Singapore’s drive to reduce waste.\nAbout 40 per cent of mooncake packaging is unnecessary and wasteful, according to the Singapore Environment Council. \nA major paper recycling company in Singapore interviewed by CNA in 2019 estimated receiving just under 5 tonnes of paper and cardboard waste from mooncake boxes alone every year. It processed about 5,000 to 8,000 tonnes of waste paper monthly in 2019.\nMost mooncake boxes end up in the incinerator. More fanciful designs and inner linings to prevent damage during delivery invariably result in more waste. The outer frills added to attract customers make mooncake boxes difficult to recycle.\nMooncake-associated waste also goes beyond the extravagant packaging.\nIn Hong Kong, food recycling organisation Food Grace reported that over 2.88 million mooncakes were discarded last year - an average of 1.07 mooncake thrown away by each household.\nThe main reason for dumping them? People did not like the flavour of mooncakes they received.\nAnd with more new-fangled mooncake flavours developed each year, including Mala, pandan or milk tea, that risk of more seeing the bin grows.\nBut should corporate gifts be done away with completely? In the era of remote work, such actions can be pleasant reminders of our human relationships. \nThere is an inherent symbolism to the gift of mooncakes in the corporate world - a time-honoured emblem of fullness, bountiful harvest and togetherness - a value that has never been closer to our hearts as we remain socially distanced during the pandemic.\nGivers and recipients understand it is the gesture of appreciation that gives meaning to business relationships. The mooncake box, or indeed the mooncake itself, are symbols of the sentiment, albeit with shiny bells and whistles.\nA survey found that employers in the United States actually handed out more corporate gifts during the pandemic. Most reported doing so to motivate their teams and maintain connections with their clients. \nOn their part, mooncake producers have also been experimenting with more ways to reduce packaging waste, by rolling out containers that can be reused or repurposed.\nRecent mooncake boxes have taken the form of tiffin carriers, jewellery boxes, wine cases, leather bags and storage drawers. Zero-waste community groups have also shared creative suggestions on how to transform simpler packaging for alternative uses though it remains unclear what happens if recipients themselves have no need for such storage options.\nThe practice of corporate gifting is unlikely to disappear completely although the pandemic has made companies relook corporate practices for their financial implications.\nSpending on items steeped in tradition and culture – while incorporating consideration about their sustainable production and consumption, in the spirit of saving the environment - is a win for all parties.\nUsing simpler packaging and reducing the use of materials can have their own ecological appeal. This effort can be linked to elements of the festival: The moon, plants and harvest, all parts of nature. It is relevant at a time when companies are striving to mitigate their environmental footprint and hiring chief sustainability officers.\nE-vouchers that allow the recipients to select mooncakes of their choice, fewer if they would like to, and even collect them with their own containers can curb waste, while arrangements to donate mooncakes to charity organisations and other beneficiaries can also provide new meaning to the business relationship.\nGoing green does not have to take an all or nothing approach. \nSimply getting rid of mooncakes as corporate gifts to reduce waste comes across as a piecemeal approach that ignores the deep cultural significance and benefits they bring.\nCompanies can, as part of their own sustainability practices, choose to support retailers who can help them preserve valuable and joyful traditions in a sustainable manner. \nThis is a mindset that should extend to broader gift-giving customs including new year greeting cards, other holiday presents and conference packs. \nGift-giving and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. We can have our mooncake and eat it too. \nAudrey Chia is an associate professor of management and organisation at the National University of Singapore Business School.\xa0The opinions expressed are those of the writer.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Mid-Autumn Festival ', '     mooncakes ', '     environment ', '     go green ']}"

      The Big Read: The rise of the ethical consumer – can it uplift low-wage workers too?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In 2015, Ms Jasmine Hussain watched a documentary titled Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret, which showed how animal agriculture had become the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption and\xa0pollution, and an even greater emitter of greenhouse gases than the transportation industry.\nThe film opened her eyes to the environmental impact of livestock production, and set her off on the journey towards becoming an ethical consumer.\xa0\n“I kind of made the decision to go vegan overnight after watching it ... It was the least I could do since I was studying ecology and environmental science,” said Ms Hussain, who was then a 19-year-old undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.\xa0\xa0\nChanging her consumption habits even further after that became a “very natural transition” for her, she said. It was also made easier by the fact that such behaviour was seen as the norm among her like-minded classmates.\xa0\n“If I was already being vegan and conscious about my eating habits, I was also going to be conscious about my spending habits as well, and be willing to spend a bit more on going to the zero-waste stores,” added Ms Hussain, who is now 25 and works in the green finance industry.\nZero-waste stores operate in a similar fashion as regular grocery stores, but they do away with excessive packaging by encouraging patrons to bring their own containers and buy only the amounts they need.\xa0\nSome also sell organic produce and products that are touted to be more environmentally friendly, though often at higher prices.\xa0\nThe ready availability of such stores in Edinburgh had made it easier on the wallet for Ms Hussain to sustain her lifestyle, as the “price range was more affordable” compared to what she found when she returned to Singapore in December last year.\nNevertheless, Ms Hussain has continued with this lifestyle and is part of a nascent but growing group of ethical consumers in Singapore.\xa0\nEthical consumerism is broadly defined as buying products and services produced in a way that minimises social or environmental damage, or both. This could range from buying cosmetic products that are free of animal testing to buying only from companies which pay their workers decent wages.\xa0\nWhile combining ethics and shopping can be a rewarding experience for some, there are those who are not ready to embrace it yet since the price tag attached to such purchases is often perceived to be higher than normal.\nThough the presence of stores selling sustainable alternatives in Singapore is not as widespread as what Ms Hussain had encountered in Scotland, various businesses in this sector said that they have witnessed a sharp growth in demand.\nMs Florence Tay, the co-founder of Singapore’s first zero-waste grocery store UnPackt, said that when she and her business partner Jeff Lam started their business at Sembawang Hills Estate in 2018, knowledge about sustainable consumer practices was limited.\n“At that point of time, people were only aware about the problems caused by single-use straws and plastic bags,” she said.\nIn the months prior to the store’s opening, a heartbreaking video of sea turtles with straws stuck up their nostrils had gone viral, sparking a global debate about the environmental problems caused by plastic products.\xa0\nUnPackt has since seen its customer base grow by at least 30 per cent, estimates Ms Tay, who declined to provide specific numbers.\xa0\nLikewise, bigger competitors such as Scoop Wholefoods – which originated from Sydney, Australia – has seen its number of outlets multiply since it set up shop here in 2019.\xa0\n“The demand has grown significantly over the last two-and-a-half years with more and more people wanting to be a part of our zero-waste mission,” said Mr Vishesh Juneja, the chief executive officer of Shopping Bag, a company under the Singapore-based lifestyle group Gill Capital which manages Scoop.\nScoop has expanded from its lone store at Tanglin Mall to six outlets now, with another two scheduled to be opened later this year.\nConversations about sustainable living in Singapore have been ongoing for some time, though it was only around 2015 that community groups started forming, according to Mr Mayur Singh, the co-founder of the Green Collective, a store located at Funan mall that curates sustainable brands.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nMeanwhile, developments around the world in recent years have given even greater impetus\xa0to such discussions.\xa0\nFor instance, Swedish teenager and environmental activist Greta Thunberg first came into the global spotlight in 2018 for walking out of class on Fridays to protest in front of the Swedish parliament about her government’s inaction over climate change.\nOn Sep\xa020 the following year, Ms Thunberg led the Global Climate Strike, a worldwide movement to protest against what youths perceived as a lack of effort from their respective governments to tackle the climate crisis.\xa0\nThis, in turn, led to the inaugural Singapore Climate Rally at Hong Lim Park a day later, which was held in solidarity with Ms Thunberg’s movement.\xa0\xa0\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also affected global awareness about environmental issues, based on a 2020 survey of about 3,000 people across eight countries.\xa0\xa0\nThe survey was conducted by the management consulting company Boston Consulting Group. It showed that about seven in 10 respondents were now more aware, compared with before the pandemic, that human activity threatens the climate, and that degradation of the environment, in turn, threatens humans.\nIt also found that 40 per cent reported that they intend to adopt more sustainable behaviour in the future, which includes reducing household energy consumption, increasing recycling and composting, and buying locally produced goods.\nThe Singapore Government, too, has also stepped up its efforts to promote a more liveable and sustainable future here, through initiatives such as its Zero Waste Masterplan unveiled in 2019, and the announcement of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 this year.\xa0\xa0\nPointing to the Climate Index published last month by OCBC Bank and digital media company Eco-Business, Mr Singh said he was happy to see discussions on the environment and sustainability “becoming more mainstream”.\nThe index, which was based on a survey of 2,000 Singaporeans between the ages of 18 and 65, had asked the respondents, among other questions, to rank which of the five key areas unveiled under the Green Plan was the most important to them.\xa0\nIt found that eight in 10 respondents ranked “sustainable living” as the most important, followed by “energy reset” (61 per cent), “city in nature” (55 per cent), “green economy” (54 per cent) and “resilient future” (49 per cent).\nThe index also gave Singaporeans a score of 8.3 out of 10 on sustainability awareness – that is, they were aware of almost all environmental issues.\nHowever, it also found that Singaporeans scored only 6.5 and 5.6 when it came to adopting green practices and advocating them, respectively. This meant they only did it some of the time, and advocated some of these issues and practices to their families and friends.\nWhile ethical consumption is growing in Singapore, it has yet to become a norm here, unlike in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States.\nDr Jimmy Wong, a senior lecturer at the School of Business at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), said that Asian cultures “tend to be more interdependent and collectivistic”.\nWhat this means, he said, is that Singaporean consumers tend to follow social norms, and at present, it is still not the norm for most to consider whether a product is sustainably or ethically sourced before making a purchase.\nInstead, consumers here are by and large pragmatic and cost-conscious when it comes to consumption, said Assistant Professor Stephanie Lin from the business school INSEAD.\xa0\n“It is my impression that, in general, your average Singaporean is less concerned about ethical consumption than in other parts of the world, like the West,” she said.\nStill, Asst Prof Lin believes that younger consumers here are gradually becoming more ethically minded, and they want to connect more with the brands that they consume.\n“This is partially due to a global trend of brands becoming more socially responsible; they are using more sustainable materials, ensuring ethical labour sourcing, connecting with social issues like racial equality, and often contributing part of their sales to other good causes,” she said.\nThe other factor is the role which social media plays in influencing younger shoppers, said the experts interviewed.\nAssociate Professor Ang Swee Hoon, from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Business School, said social media has helped to amplify consumers’ views of not only brands, but also ideas and movements, as well as accelerated the role of word-of-mouth communication.\xa0\nAsst Prof Lin added that social media also gives brands a more direct connection to their consumers, and allows emotional relationships – instead of just functional ones – to be established.\xa0\xa0\nDuring the course of her research, Asst Prof Lin found that consumers like to share content on social media that is in line with their personal values, so that they can display their “best selves” to the world.\xa0\n“Consumers sharing about their support of ethical brands to each other further perpetuates ethical consumption as a growing norm,” she said.\xa0\nSocial media also gives consumers a voice to speak out against unethical practices of organisations, allowing them to informally police brands.\xa0\n“For instance, when certain organisations in Singapore were found to be underpaying employees, people posted about it on social media, spreading the word about the brands’ unethical practices and affecting brand equity,” she said.\nWhile Asst Prof Lin did not single out any company, media reports of homegrown bakery chain Twelve Cupcakes underpaying their employees had resulted in widespread backlash online, with some calling for a boycott of the business.\xa0\n“Firms are sensitive to optics right now. Sometimes, big campaigns backfire, with ads getting pulled for being insensitive or brands being criticised for greenwashing, causewashing or hypocritical behaviour,” said Asst Prof Lin.\nShe added: “It seems like a lot of firms have learned the lessons of these pitfalls. That’s why you see firms engaging in responsible behaviour, like donating to good causes, without loudly advertising and seeking recognition for it – this can lead to greater brand loyalty.”\nMr Melvin Yong, the president of the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), pointed out that businesses which do not respond and adapt to consumer preference are likely to lose out in the long term.\nNoting the “dynamic” relationship between consumers and businesses, Mr Yong, who is also the Member of Parliament for Radin Mas, said: “Consumer behaviour can be shaped by what the marketplace is offering, and consumers can collectively effect change in the marketplace by exercising their right to choose.”\xa0\xa0\nAs a show of loyalty to their preferred brands that are aligned with their ideals, some consumers vote with their wallets, said NUS’ Assoc Prof Ang, even if the benefits are sometimes not evident until further down the road – such as in the case of climate change.\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“So while it may appear not pragmatic (due to the higher pricing) in the immediate future, consumers, especially the Gen Zs, have longer-term ideals. Being younger, their actions today may well affect their life in the future,” she said.\xa0\nIndeed, such an outlook was reflected in Ms Hussain and other younger consumers who are trying to make sustainable consumption part of their lifestyle.\nMs Hussain’s friend, Ms Natalie Tan, 25, said her decision to embark on a sustainable lifestyle was partially influenced by Ms Hussain, and in part by what she had learnt while studying about global health and the environment.\n“I don\'t want to contribute to capitalism, and also harm the environment,” said Ms Tan, who recently graduated from the Global Studies programme at NUS.\xa0\xa0\nMs Tan said she would rather pay more for a certain product if she knows that it can fulfil\xa0her criteria. Apart from deciding whether she actually needs the product, she also researches whether a company pays its workers a living wage or if it practises greenwashing – that is, deceiving the public into believing it is helping the environment – and if the product is durable or not.\n“Of course, it can’t also be exorbitantly priced because I’m not super rich,” said Ms Tan.\nOne example of a purchase she made with these factors in mind was a pair of durable slippers made of recycled tyres which cost her around S$60.\nWhile she could have gotten a cheaper pair, she said this would wear out quickly and she would have ended up contributing more waste by buying another pair of slippers to replace them.\nAs for 26-year-old teacher Natasha Paul, she has been trying her best to reduce her meat intake due to the increasing amount of talk about ethical consumption and sustainability.\nShe is doing so by substituting recipes that require meat with plant-based alternatives. This has led her to think further about how else she could do her part to help the environment as a consumer.\nOne other way to do so would be to buy locally grown vegetable produce even though the prices might be higher than some imported ones. These local vegetables are not only fresher, but have a lower carbon footprint since they do not have to be transported over a long distance, said Ms Paul.\nHowever, not everyone shares the same consumer philosophy. Some of those who do not said\xa0that whether an item is ethically sourced or helps the environment is never a consideration in their purchasing decisions.\n“I have a young family to support, so I just go for items that are value for money, or things that are on offer,” said Mr Shaun Ho, a 35-year-old operations manager.\nAn accountant, who is also 35 and wanted to be known only as Mr Chan, said he had just bought a house and is preparing to start a family, so he needs to be more prudent with his expenditure.\nHe said that for example, he could not justify paying more for organic free-range eggs that “taste just like normal eggs and are of the same size”.\nHowever, advocates of ethical consumption said it is a misperception that shopping ethically is expensive.\nMs Hussain said she typically buys her staple food such as fruits and vegetables from the wet market, which are not only priced affordably but come without packaging.\nShe said she only visits a zero-waste store every one-and-a-half months to buy packaging-free soap and shampoo, or any other specialty products which she cannot get elsewhere. Such visits only set her back between S$20 and S$50 each time, she added.\nUnPackt’s Ms Tay said the idea is to buy only what one needs. As such, a customer may still end up paying less even if the price per weight for an item at a zero-waste store is more than its pre-packaged counterpart at a conventional store.\nMoreover, pre-packaged items could lead to both a waste of resources and money if they are not used up entirely, she added.\nStill, some consumers, such as Madam Audrey Lee, are not convinced.\nMdm Lee is an administrator of the Facebook group Taobao Addicts, where members can get help with shopping on the Chinese e-commerce platform.\nAs her days are busy, Mdm Lee, who is in her 50s and declined to reveal her occupation, said she “doesn’t want to waste her time window shopping”, let alone think about ethical consumption.\xa0\nTo her, it is all about convenience and pricing.\xa0\xa0\nWhile the general perception is that younger shoppers are more aware of ethical consumption, not all from the older generation are indifferent.\xa0\nFor example, Madam Lee Lay Peng, 53, said she and her friends are discerning when it comes to making purchases.\xa0\xa0\nMdm Lee, who works in the information technology sector, said she is not against paying more for certain products if she knows for certain what the actual benefits of doing so are.\n“Personally, I wouldn’t mind paying more for food if it is homemade or prepared without preservatives, instead of being mass-produced,” she said.\nMdm Lee pointed out that one reason why older consumers may be generally slower in adopting sustainable consumption habits is because many are not on social media and do not get the same amount of exposure as their younger counterparts on the importance of doing so.\n“So that may be the reason why we are not part of this wave, because of the lack of awareness,” she said.\nSeveral of the business owners spoken to highlighted the importance of creating awareness in order to change behaviour.\nMr Laurent Stevenart, Singapore’s country manager at Impossible Foods, said one of the biggest barriers the firm faces is the perception by meat-eaters that plant-based meat just does not taste as good, or does not taste like the “real thing”.\n“In many of our product roll-outs and launches, we focus heavily on sampling, and we often say ‘tasting is believing’,” he said.\xa0\nMs Paul, who still describes herself as a meat-eater, said one of the hurdles she initially faced in trying to cut back on meat in her diet was that the alternatives, including the mock meat that is commonly found at vegetarian stalls, were not to her liking.\nShe was “not drawn into the fold” until brands such as Impossible Food and Beyond Meat introduced their plant-based meat alternatives in Singapore which better suited her taste buds.\xa0\xa0\nMeanwhile, both UnPackt’s Ms Tay and the Green Collective’s Mr Singh spoke about the importance of outreach efforts to show the public that adopting sustainable practices is not out of reach or burdensome.\xa0\n“We are not working on getting people to buy a product, we are actually getting people to buy a lifestyle … and when they do, this causes a behaviour change,” said Mr Singh.\nFor example, Ms Tay said: “Sometimes when I\'m busy, I don\'t have a reusable cup with me, but I still make the effort to sit down for 10 minutes to drink my coffee (from a cafe’s refillable mugs) instead of having it as a take-away order.”\nMr Singh said ultimately, these outreach efforts need to be relatable and the target audience must be made to understand why there is a need to do things in a certain way.\nAmid the growing awareness of responsible consumption, another facet of the issue has come to the fore recently: Will Singaporeans be willing to pay more for products or services to improve the wages of low-income workers, such as those in the retail, and food and beverage industries?\nIn announcing several measures to uplift such workers during his National Day Rally on Aug 29, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that the cost of higher wages for them will have to be shared, not just by workers and employers, but consumers as well.\xa0\xa0\n“So all of us, as consumers, must also chip in. Pay a little bit more for some of our favourite things, like bubble tea or bak chor mee to help the shop cover higher cleaning and waste-collection costs,” he had said.\nOver the years, there have also been spirited public discussions on whether hawkers should charge higher prices to improve their lot.\xa0\nMost consumers interviewed\xa0generally felt that they would only be prepared to pay more if they know for sure that the additional amount they pay goes directly to the workers.\nOthers said they are concerned about how it will affect their cost of living.\nAmong those who said they would pay more was Ms Tan, who said she has always wondered why hawkers price their food so cheaply.\xa0\n""They have to wake up early every day and put in so much effort to make that one dish,"" said Ms Tan, adding that they ought to be better compensated for their efforts.\nNevertheless, she acknowledged that this would raise the cost of living especially for low-income families, and suggested that those who can afford it should sponsor meals for the needy.\xa0\nSUSS’ Dr Wong said the idea of paying more to create an inclusive society is an abstract idea that will be hard for most people to connect to. “They will say, ‘You’re telling me if I pay 20 or 50 cents more for my bak chor mee, the uncle at the coffee shop downstairs will be better off?’” he said.\xa0\nTo gain the acceptance of consumers, CASE’s Mr Yong said businesses not only need to show that any additional premium paid by their customers goes towards supporting the welfare of these workers. There must also be discernible improvement in the services over time, he added.\xa0\n“At CASE, my view is that businesses should not see this as an excuse to raise prices without justification. CASE will not hesitate to act against businesses who take this as an opportunity to profiteer,” said Mr Yong.\nInstead of passing on the cost to consumers, Dr Wong said that a better idea would be for companies to cut costs on unnecessary areas – overly elaborate packaging for example – and channel that difference towards the workers’ salaries instead.\nINSEAD’s Asst Prof Lin described Singaporean culture as very “communal”.\xa0\n“On the one hand, Singaporeans are very concerned about doing their civic duties and being responsible members of the community,” she said. “On the other hand, it may be difficult to think about low-income workers as part of their immediate community that they have a responsibility to help.”\xa0\nShe added: “Humanising low-income workers and emphasising their part in a local or global community might be helpful in increasing empathy to low-income earners.”\nIn any case, Associate Professor Hannah Chang, from the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at the Singapore Management University, said it generally takes “a lot of time and discussion” to result in any meaningful change in consumer attitudes and behaviour.\n“We can see that\xa0over the years, consumers have started caring more about the environment and social causes,” she said.\xa0\n“Similar to how the importance of sustainability and green consumption have been highlighted … if people can be shown how they can play a part in (uplifting wages) by paying just a bit more with each purchase, it\'s more likely that people will start showing a buy-in.”\nFor more news like this, visit\xa0todayonline.com.\n', 'related_topics': ['     The Big Read ', '     sustainability ', '     environment ', '     Consumers Association of Singapore ']}"

      Survey reveals Southeast Asians’ concerns about lack of regional climate change action
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: A new survey on Southeast Asians’ attitudes and perceptions of climate change reveals genuine concerns among respondents about the crisis but pessimism around whether regional governments are doing enough to tackle it.\nThe survey, which was conducted online by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute (ISEAS), probed 610 people from all 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states in a range of different sectors, including academia, business, government, media, students and international organisations. This is the second year that ISEAS has conducted the survey.\nSeventy per cent of those surveyed said they believe climate change is a serious and immediate threat to the well-being of their country.\nBut only 15.7 per cent believes that their government considers climate change an urgent national priority and has allocated sufficient resources to address this threat.\xa0\nLess than a quarter of respondents think that their country’s climate policies and laws are aligned with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as agreed under the Paris Agreement, while only 31.8 per cent agreed that ASEAN is effective as a regional organisation in tackling climate change.\xa0\nThere is some optimism, however, around the ability of climate change investments to provide a boost to economic competitiveness, especially from those surveyed in Vietnam, which has made large inroads on its renewable energy rollout plans in recent years.\nYet only just over 15 per cent overall thought that their government had seized on the chance to use COVID-19 stimulus money to contribute to a green recovery.\xa0\n“The results show that Southeast Asians believe that more should be done to address climate change issues, with a majority viewing climate change to be as much of a crisis as the COVID-19 pandemic,” Choi Shing Kwok, the director and CEO of ISEAS, said in a statement.\nHe added: “Survey respondents also believe that better and more innovative climate change policies can result in higher economic competitiveness. This will translate into strong support for governments and private companies pursuing climate change initiatives in the region.”\nRecent separate analysis from ISEAS showed that regional governments were missing the opportunity to weave green components into their recoveries, while keeping many harmful subsidies to high polluting industries.\n“They need to wean off fossil fuel subsidies but that seems to be the easiest stimulus dollar to give at this time when livelihoods are threatened, jobs are lost, economic activity is down. Choosing a green recovery will mean short-term pain but long-term sustainability,” ISEAS senior fellow Sharon Seah told CNA.\n“Deep decarbonisation, economic transformation does not happen overnight. Political will is needed,” she said.\nAccording to the survey, those from Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam felt that the main government priority should be to encourage businesses to adopt green practices.\xa0\nSingapore-based respondents thought the main government priorities should be to allocate more public financial support to low-carbon solutions as well as to encourage businesses to adopt green practices.\xa0\nIn Myanmar, there was an overwhelming call for the enactment of climate laws.\nThroughout the region, the looming threats of worsening disasters are a concern, the survey shows.\nThe latest assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it clear that unless excessive global warming is reined in by mid-century, Southeast Asia will experience a range of worsening conditions and disasters, including dangerous heat waves, intense rain events, powerful tropical cyclones and coastal cities inundated by rising sea levels.\nIn Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos, Indonesia and Brunei, respondents said flooding was the most serious climate change impact for their country.\nResearch shows there is merit to such concern, with the region’s cities among the most vulnerable in the world and projections that once in a 100 year flood events could be happening every year by 2100.\nSingaporeans were most worried about sea level rise, which regionally is being experienced faster than the global average and will continue around Asia over the coming decades.\nMeanwhile, Thais thought drought was the biggest climate change impact faced and Cambodians selected biodiversity loss.\nOnly 21 per cent believe that their country has a policy and plan to protect agriculture against climate change, even though the overall majority thought that their country’s food supply was threatened by climate change.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     ASEAN ', '     COVID-19 ', '     environment ', '     agriculture ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Smoking at windows and balconies at home should be made illegal, said Member of Parliament Louis Ng\xa0(PAP-Nee Soon) on Monday (Sep 13) as he questioned why an existing law is not being used to tackle the issue of secondhand smoke from neighbours.\xa0\nSpeaking\xa0in his adjournment motion on using deterrence to tackle secondhand smoke in homes, Mr Ng noted that\xa0Section 43 of the Environmental Public Health Act (EPHA) empowers the National Environment Agency (NEA) to take necessary steps to “remove nuisances of a public nature”.\nSuch nuisances include\xa0“the issue of any fumes, vapours, gases, heat, radiation or smells in any premises which is a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health”.\n“That sure sounds like secondhand smoke,” said Mr Ng. “Why is the Government not using this law to take a clear stance that smoking near windows and at balconies is illegal?”\nResponding to Mr Ng after his speech, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor said that the named sections in the Act cannot be used to prohibit smoking at windows and balconies.\n“This part of the EPHA was enacted in the context of 1960s Singapore to provide for quick mitigating action to arrest public nuisances from specific industrial activities. It is not the purpose of the EPHA to deal with smoking prohibition,"" she explained.\nDr Khor added that the Act addresses nuisances affecting the public at large, and not private nuisances affecting a person’s use or enjoyment of his property.\n“To achieve deterrence, not only do we need the appropriate law, we also need effective enforcement. Unfortunately, the National Environment Agency\'s (NEA)\xa0assessment is that this is not achievable with current enforcement modalities and technology,” she said.\nThis is the\xa0second adjournment motion that Mr Ng has filed on secondhand smoke in homes. In October last year, he also called for a ban on residents smoking near windows or balconies.\nIn his speech on Monday, Mr Ng said that about one person in Singapore dies every day due to secondhand smoke, based on 383 deaths reported in 2016, with the number “growing each year”.\nAccording to him, this is five times the number of people who have died in motor accidents, seven times the number who have died from the coronavirus and 12 times the number\xa0who died from workplace injuries.\n“Unlike these other causes of death, there is no preventive measure you can take against secondhand smoke at home,” he said.\nMr Ng went on to share stories from\xa0several residents of\xa0Housing\xa0Board flats and condominiums who tried unsuccessfully to get their neighbours to stop smoking.\nCiting studies, he added that exposure to secondhand smoke makes children more likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), along with a host of respiratory illnesses.\nMr Ng suggested a three-tier approach to deterrence, calling it “a power that we have not sufficiently drawn on”.\nFirst, the Government should make it illegal to smoke at windows and balconies, he said.\n""To be clear, the Government Parliamentary Committee\xa0for Sustainability and the Environment is not calling for smoking at home to be illegal,"" he explained.\xa0\n""We know that it will be almost impossible to enforce a ban on smoking at home ...\xa0Sir, we are calling for the Government to make clear that smoking at windows and balconies is illegal.""\nBy using the Environmental Public Health Act, the Government can reduce the problem of secondhand smoke in homes, as “Singaporeans are terrified of breaking the law”, he said.\n""It would also help neighbours mediate, as the offenders can no longer say that their behaviour is perfectly legal,"" he told the House, adding that it would also ""give more bite"" to NEA officers.\nThe second tier is awareness, Mr Ng\xa0said, pointing out that NEA could use the LCD screens at HDB lobbies for such campaigns.\n“These screens are near to where offences happen and are most likely to have a significant impact,” said Mr Ng.\nThe last tier is to enforce the law.\nHe noted Dr Khor’s comments in October when\xa0she said that in order for enforcement to be done,\xa0cameras must capture the smoker in the act. She pointed out that as smokers can hide behind barriers to avoid detection, ""this may entail deployment of significant resources without achieving effective outcomes"".\nMr Ng argued that smokers are unlikely to hide behind pillars,\xa0windows or curtains to smoke.\n""As a former smoker, I can tell you that smokers smoke at open windows and balconies precisely to get the smoke out of their homes; it would defeat the purpose to hide behind some cover,"" he said.\n\xa0\n""If they do hide like how SMS (senior minister of state)\xa0Amy describes, then it would be a good thing, not a bad thing, because it would help contain most of the secondhand smoke within their home.""\nOn the effectiveness of camera surveillance, he said it would be the absolute last resort, adding that the “vast majority” would comply once they are aware that smoking near windows and balconies is illegal.\n“For a small number of cases where smokers continue to smoke at windows and balconies, then enforcement kicks in,” he said.\nWhen smokers repeat their offences despite advisories or nuisance orders, Mr Ng suggested collecting evidence from complainants. NEA could also conduct stakeouts, he said. For the “small number of cases” where surveillance cameras need to be used, the Government can maintain privacy by pointing it at the facade of the building, he added.\nProhibiting smoking at windows and balconies will only ensure that smokers will find ways to avoid being caught, said Dr Khor.\n“They could smoke in balcony corners, or in toilets with windows or ventilation fans, which some already do. Smoke will inevitably seep out and can still travel to neighbouring units,” she said, adding that NEA cannot prosecute “based solely on complaints of smoke, or smell or smoke wafting from neighbouring units”.\nComplainants are often unable to “accurately identify” the source of the smoke, she said. As such, each case will require “extensive manpower and resources to investigate with no guarantee of successful enforcement”.\nConducting investigations would require “significant social trade-offs”, said Dr Khor, as cameras would have to be of sufficient resolution and trained directly into the units. This could potentially include innocent neighbours, she added.\nDr Khor\xa0noted that NEA has stepped up its enforcement actions. In 2020, it issued 11,000 tickets for smoking in prohibited areas in common HDB areas, compared to 7,100 in 2019.\nMost smokers “cooperate”, she added, noting that less than 10 per cent of feedback the ministry receives recur within a year.\nDr Khor also said that other jurisdictions that have attempted regulation have done so on a “very selective basis” and “have not experienced clear success”.\nStanding in support of the motion, MP Poh Li San (PAP-Sembawang) suggested that the Government continue to have targets to bring down the number of smokers over the next five to 10\xa0years.\xa0\nShe noted that a recent announcement in July showed that Singapore has achieved a smoking rate of 10.1 per cent, just “slightly shy” of the 10 per cent by 2020 target that Singapore set in 2018.\n“It would be good if we could introduce more aggressive campaigns to help those who sincerely wish to stop smoking, and also to introduce a convincing message on the dangers of smoking to our children at an early age,” she said.\nIn response, Dr Khor said that Singapore has expanded smoking prohibition “extensively” to more than 32,000 places.\xa0\n“We are now looking into extending the smoking prohibition to even more places,” she said.\n“Concerted efforts” have\xa0driven Singapore’s smoking rate down to 10.1 per cent in 2020, half the global average of 20 per cent.\n', 'related_topics': ['     smoking ', '     environment ', '     Ministry for Sustainability and the Environment ', '     Singapore Parliament ']}"

      Commentary: Reusable containers are not always better for the environment than disposable plastic ones
  </h1>, 'text': 'MANCHESTER: We are facing a waste crisis, with landfills across the world at full capacity and mountains of “recycled” waste\xa0dumped\xa0in developing countries. \nFood packaging is a major source of this waste, giving rise to an industry of “environmentally friendly” reusable food and drink containers that is projected to be worth\xa0£21.3 billion (US$29 billion)\xa0worldwide by 2027, well over double its 2019 value of £9.6 billion.\nBut while it might seem like reusing the same container is better than buying a new single-use one each time, our research shows that reusable containers could actually be worse for the environment than their disposable counterparts.\nReusable containers have to be stronger and more durable to withstand being used multiple times - and they have to be cleaned after each use - so they consume more materials and energy, increasing their\xa0carbon footprint.\nOur research\xa0set out to understand how many times you have to reuse a container for it to be the more eco-friendly choice, in the context of the\xa0takeaway food industry.\nWe looked at three of the most widely used types of single-use takeaway containers: Aluminium, polypropylene\xa0(PP) and\xa0extruded polystyrene\xa0(commonly known as\xa0Styrofoam, but correctly referred to as EPS). \nWe compared these with commonly used reusable polypropylene food containers, popular among eco-conscious consumers.\nThe results showed clearly that Styrofoam containers are by far the best option for the environment among single-use food containers. \nThis is mainly due to their use of only 7.8g of raw materials compared with PP containers’ 31.8g. Also, they require less\xa0electricity\xa0for production compared with aluminium containers.\nEven a reusable container would have to be reused between 16 and 208 times for its environmental impact to equal that of a single-use Styrofoam container.\nWe assessed 12 environmental impacts across the entire life cycle of a food container. These included the container’s contribution to\xa0global warming\xa0and to\xa0acid rain, its toxicity to humans and\xa0natural ecosystems\xa0and its effects on the\xa0ozone layer.\nTaking these into account, you would have to reuse a container 16 times to counteract the impact on air pollution of using the single-use container - and 208 times to counteract the impact of resource consumption.\nWhen it comes to endangering our landscapes, reusable containers are always a worse option - regardless of the number of times used - due to the electricity required to heat the water for washing them. This is thanks to the emission of substances like heavy metals in electricity generation, which are\xa0toxic\xa0to many land-based organisms.\nSimilar results to ours have been reported for coffee cups, with\xa0one study\xa0concluding that it takes between 20 and 100 uses for a reusable cup to offset its higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to a disposable cup.\nA common criticism of Styrofoam containers is that they are not currently recycled.\n\xa0Although technically possible, the low density of Styrofoam (containing 95 per cent air) means that vast amounts need to be collected and compressed before they can be shipped to a recycling plant, making Styrofoam recycling economically tricky.\nHowever, we found that increasing recycling rates for the three types of single-use takeaway containers to the level of the European Union’s 2025 packaging waste\xa0recycling target\xa0- 75 per cent for aluminium and 55 per cent for plastic - would reduce their impacts by 2 per cent to 60 per cent. \nThis includes an annual drop in carbon emissions equivalent to taking 55,000 cars off the road.\nThat does not mean that reusing containers is always worse for the planet. We just need to be realistic about the number of reuses it takes to make environmental sense. \nBut reuse is a considerable challenge for an industry optimised for on-the-go consumption.\nUnless it is highly convenient or they are offered an incentive, such as money back, customers are not likely to carry around empty containers until they can return or reuse them. There are also potential issues with\xa0liability\xa0for food poisoning and cross-contamination from allergens when reusing containers.\nDespite this, reuse has been shown to work in the takeout sector, as with reusable box schemes like\xa0reCIRCLE\xa0in Switzerland. However, systems like this require considerable investment, particularly to help customers return containers.\nA more promising model may be one where the vendor directly collects empty containers from the customer to be refilled with the same substance, in the style of old-fashioned\xa0milk delivery rounds. Similar models, like Terracycle’s Loop, aim to reuse each container up to 100 times.\nUnfortunately, single-use takeaway containers frequently end up contaminating natural environments.\xa0Almost half\xa0of the plastic polluting the world’s oceans comes from takeaway containers.\nBut instead of switching from single-use, a better environmental solution may be to encourage food companies to invest in more efficient recycling systems worldwide.\nThe takeaway message?\nIndividual packaging choices will have limited influence as long as the whole system remains in need of a complete overhaul. For example, a consumer might opt for a compostable container, but that will not help if their area does not have an industrial composting facility.\nIt is time we shifted packaging design from being product-based - focused on providing maximum features and functionality - to\xa0user-centred, focusing on improving customers’ lives by empathising with their desires for a cleaner world.\nThat means coupling environmentally sound and low-impact materials with a waste infrastructure that appreciates how humans\xa0actually behave\xa0and is designed to help them lead sustainable lives. \nWhen convenience and sustainability are pursued together, everyone wins.\nAlejandro Gallego Schmid is Senior Lecturer in Circular Economy and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment at the University of Manchester.

      Tonle Sap Lake, the beating heart of the Mekong basin, is on ‘life support’ 
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake reached historically low water levels at the end of last month, raising further concerns about the situation of a critically important ecosystem that feeds the reaches of the lower Mekong river basin.\nCambodia’s Tonle Sap, an expansive lake that can swell across a floodplain up to 20 times the size of Singapore during the monsoon season, is experiencing a third consecutive year of dire conditions.\xa0Station readings recorded a level of just 3.86m\xa0on Aug 31, nearly 1m\xa0lower than in 2020 and about half the normal average at this time of the year.\n“At the end of August, the Tonle Sap reached a historical low at a time when the lake should be saturated with water and fish,” said Brian Eyler, a senior fellow and director of Energy, Water, and Sustainability, Southeast Asia at the Stimson Center.\n“The lake was 80cm below its previous low - recorded in 2020 - and 4m below average. The beating heart of the Mekong is on life support,” he said.\nUpstream dams, constructed along the upper Mekong river in Laos, Thailand, Myanmar and China - where the river is known as Lancang - withholding water are a contributing factor to the lower levels of flow into the lake.\xa0\nData from the Mekong Dam Monitor, an online platform that tracks indicators in the Mekong basin, shows that more than 12 billion cubic metres of water have been held back by 45 upstream dams since early July.\xa0\nAt some points along the Mekong river, 25 per cent of natural flow is missing, according to estimations from Eyes on Earth, using satellite data, physical river gauges and remote sensing.\nThese factors combined with below average rainfall have resulted in the unseasonal delay in the annual reverse of the Tonle Sap, a unique phenomenon where water starts to flow in an opposite direction due to flooding in the Mekong, drawing in huge amounts of fish into the lake system.\xa0\nThe lake acts as a natural storage that fills up and empties out in critical parts of the year. The more water that is stored upstream, the longer the delays to the Tonle Sap’s reversal.\nClimate change is also creating havoc with the timing and intensity of the monsoon season, further disrupting the natural behaviours of the lake system and decimating agriculture in Cambodia.\n“The Tonle Sap is the beating heart of Cambodia and the Mekong basin. The heart requires the annual flood pulse, which provides water, nutrients and sediments, to remain healthy,” said Gary Lee the Southeast Asia program director for International Rivers, a non-profit organisation.\nBased on historical precedent, it is expected that the upstream dams will continue to hold water over the coming months, suggesting there is little likelihood of a quick fix for the situation in the Tonle Sap.\nThe Mekong River Commission (MRC), an inter-governmental body that aims to manage shared water resources, says it has known for some time that reservoirs along the Mekong would disrupt the timing and flood pulse. But conditions now are particularly worrying, a spokesperson for the MRC Secretariat told CNA.\n“Over the last few years, we have seen both the increase in storage, reduced rainfall volume and timing of the monsoon rains affecting the volume and timing of the reverse flows into the Tonle Sap,” the spokesperson said.“This, together with increased fishing pressures, pollution, reduced sediment transport and barriers to fish migration, poses an existential threat to the Lower Mekong River ecosystems.\n“What we may be seeing now is a perfect storm of reduced and delayed rainfall, the total storage in the basin at the end of the previous dry season and the operations of that storage into the wet season.”\nAside from the environmental and ecological impacts, there are social impacts on the millions of people who rely on the Tonle Sap lake for their livelihoods and survival. The situation has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFishing is no longer the viable income-earner it once was, with locals forced to move to urban areas for low-paying and notoriously difficult construction work, according to Oudom Ham, an independent Cambodian consultant on climate change and river issues.\n“Now they cannot even catch fish for their own consumption. They need to buy, which is ridiculous because they are fishermen but they cannot find fish for themselves,” he said.\nThe economics are not sustainable for those living close to the poverty line. A typical day’s earnings from fishing in the wet season previously could be close to double that working in the city.“Fishermen compensate for depleting fish catches by taking out loans to help them get by but fishermen can’t do this in perpetuity. Something is going to break, either the livelihoods of millions or regional food security,” said Eyler of the Stimson Center.\xa0\nAt the same time, migrant workers who normally do construction jobs in neighbouring Thailand have been forced to return to their local communities, only to find that the situation is desperate.\nIllegal fishing and the grabbing of land around flooded forest areas are compounding the problems.\n“Now, resiliency is reducing. It’s surprising how quickly it’s happening, environmentally and socially,” said Oudom, the independent consultant.\nThe geopolitical challenges are steep surrounding the management of the shared Mekong river resource.\nChina disagrees with the downstream assessments that its dams are responsible for the dropping water levels, blaming “interval rainfall” for the problems being experienced.\nAn inaugural dialogue on water security between the MRC and ASEAN last month could help boost protection for the river and place more scrutiny on the ways China utilises it.\xa0\nThere is increased urgency to come up with solutions that account for the views of regional stakeholders, given the recent observations.\n“The downstream needs to negotiate with China to help return natural flow patterns to the Mekong,” Eyler said.\n“China’s dams are reducing the annual flood pulse effect but so are scores of downstream dams in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. Restoring some semblance of natural flow is fraught with political difficulties but not impossible.”\nWhile data sharing has increased, river campaigners want more transparency from Beijing.\xa0\n“The major challenge or problem is being caused by the dams upstream, it has become very obvious,” Oudom said.\nBut the MRC has suggested that more studies will be needed to further assess the upstream impacts of major dam storage, as well as the effects of climate change. It still sees merit in controlled releases of water by the mainstream dams “to minimise the water, food and energy risks, while mitigating against some of the adverse impacts of development”, its spokesperson said.\n“The MRC is gradually swivelling towards these perspectives.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     Mekong River ', '     ASEAN ', '     environment ', '     China ', '     Cambodia ']}"

Minister Desmond Lee.\xa0\nThe 450m stretch, which is the first section of the park,\xa0runs from Pasir Panjang MRT station to the Jalan Pelepah residential estate.\xa0\nThe entire park, which is expected to be completed by 2026, will showcase the ""natural and cultural history"" of Pasir Panjang, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nThis is the first park to be designed and built together with the community, under the Friends of the Parks Engagement Programme, said the National Parks Boards (NParks) in a separate media release.\xa0\nAbout 170 stakeholders were involved, including residents engaged through the Telok Blangah Residents’ Committees and the Pasir Panjang East Association Neighbourhood Committee.\nAccording to Mr Lee, the first section of the park\xa0used to be part of a “natural sandy beach” running from Batu Berlayer to the junction of Clementi and West Coast Roads.\nIt later became Pasir Panjang Wharves and then the Pasir Panjang Container Terminal.\n“Special care has been taken to landscape the park to reflect the area’s formerly sandy coastline, and to restore the coastal vegetation that once permeated the area,” said the minister.\xa0\xa0\n“The park will also pay tribute to Pasir Panjang’s history as home to one of Singapore’s major ports, the Pasir Panjang Container Terminal.""\xa0\nThe Government previously announced that the container terminal would move to Tuas as part of its plans to transform the Greater Southern Waterfront.\nTo commemorate the history of the park, horn bollards used at the Tanjong Pagar Terminal since 1972, along with other maritime

character of the West Coast area, native coastal species will be used in these plantings,"" said Mr Lee.\xa0\nThese nature ways will strengthen ecological connectivity by forming a “green corridor” connecting north towards Sungei Buloh and east towards Labrador via the West Coast, said NParks.\xa0\nIn addition, NParks will rewild up to 14 sites near existing nature areas, such as the Southern Ridges and Rail Corridor, said Mr Lee.\nThis will be done with native trees and plants to “enhance habitats for local biodiversity”.\nMRT stations along the upcoming Jurong Region\xa0Line will be ""greened up"" in three stages over the next 10 years, said Mr Lee.\nCurrently, Buona Vista, Dover and Boon Lay stations along the East-West Line have already undergone such greening.\nNParks will also plant 150,000 trees in Jurong industrial estates by 2030, as part of previously announced plans to plant 170,000 trees in industrial estates.\n“The aim is to cool these areas, one of the hotter areas in Singapore and improve air quality,"" said NParks.\xa0\n""At the same time, this will create a more attractive and conducive work environment by bringing the therapeutic effects of greenery close to people’s workplaces.""\xa0\nSensors will also be deployed at Jurong Estate and Jurong Island to measure thermal comfort to help NPark assess the effectiveness of greenery in mitigating the urban heat island effect in those areas.\nUp to\xa030 more community and allotment gardens will be added across the heartlands in the West Coast area, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nThis is in addition to the existing 120 such gardens across housing estates, schools and organisations in the West Coast.\nTwo new therapeutic gardens will also be introduced in Jurong Central Park and West Coast Park.\nThese

      'Should have started this years back': Most hawker centre diners clear trays on first day of enforcement
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Most patrons at hawker centres have been clearing their trays and leaving behind clean tables, as enforcement rules against table littering kicked in Wednesday (Sep 1), observed workers at these public dining places.\nThere were a handful of diners who did not do so, but most cleaners and patrons CNA spoke to said they welcomed the new regulations and that the clearing of trays was a “good” practice to cultivate.\nThe National Environment Agency (NEA) announced in May that diners at hawker centres must clear their tables of used trays, crockery and litter after their meals, with enforcement starting from Sep 1. This comes after a three-month advisory period.\nFirst-time offenders will receive a written warning. Second-time offenders will face a composition fine of S$300, while subsequent offenders may face court fines.\nHowever, enforcement will not be taken against those who are “clearly unable” to return their trays, such as the frail elderly or young children who are unable to purchase and carry their own food to the table, said the National Environment Agency in an update on Monday. \nFrom Jan 1 next year, the table littering rule will also be enforced for diners at coffee shops and food courts, after an advisory period from Nov 1 to Dec 31.\nWhen CNA visited Chinatown Complex Food Centre at about 11am, there were some empty plates and bowls left behind on tables.\nMdm Lim Kim Huan, a cleaner at the hawker centre, said that cleaners had been instructed not to collect trays and crockery that had been left behind. However, she noted that the situation was “better”, with more diners cleaning up after themselves.\nCNA also visited Amoy Food Centre and Maxwell Food Centre during lunch hour. Despite the crowd, most diners at both hawker centres were observed putting their trays and cutlery back at the tray collection point.\nMdm Lee, a cleaner at Amoy Food Centre, said that more people have started clearing their tables since August.\xa0\n“Almost everyone returned their trays (today),” she told CNA in Mandarin. “Only some foreigners or young people don’t read the news so they don’t know.”\nAnother cleaner from Maxwell Food Centre, who declined to give his name, said that he had seen a marked improvement from Tuesday, the day before enforcement kicked in.\nAlthough there were about 20 per cent of patrons still leaving their trays behind, he said: “So far so good.”\nMr Pang, 67, a retiree who was dining at Chinatown Food Complex, said that the new rules were ""very good"".\n""We should have started it 20 years ago.

When approached by CNA, he promptly returned it, saying that he had forgotten.\nHe added that he usually returns his trays and crockery, and started doing so because of the new enforcement measures.\nHe said that the policy was “very good”, but noted that he was part of an older generation that are not used to returning their trays.\xa0\n“(The officers can) just ask them to take (the trays and crockery),” he said, adding that many of them may not be doing it on purpose, but have forgotten.\n', 'related_topics': ['     NEA ', '     hawker centres ', '     environment ']}"

      Tuk the turtle swallowed more than 300 pieces of trash, and its rescue highlights Thailand's marine waste problem
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Marine veterinarians in Phuket say a young green turtle found to have ingested hundreds of pieces of marine trash is expected to be able to return to the wild after its treatment.\nIt was rescued last month after being found stranded on a local beach and has been receiving care at the Phuket Marine Biological Center (PMBC).\nThe turtle, named Tuk by veterinarians, was weak, could not eat by itself and had trouble swimming. Subsequent examinations and X-rays revealed that it had ingested a shocking amount of plastic bags, hard plastic, cloth and other trash, which were obstructing the turtle’s gastrointestinal tract but were later defecated.\xa0\n“We were surprised. This is the first sea turtle that had ingested more than 300 pieces. Normally we have sea turtles that have ingested 10 or 20 pieces. This one is like, wow,” said Araya Boonkasemsanti, the marine veterinarian caring for Tuk at PMBC. \n“It’s quite a serious matter for the turtle’s health.\xa0\n“Right now she’s still weak but she can swim and eat by herself. She needs more nutrition and we need to check on her external wounds,” she added.\n“If the X-rays show no impaction, then she can go back into the wild,” she said, referring to the possibility of a mass of stool that can’t be pushed out by the turtle.\nThis is just one example of a much wider problem affecting sea turtles, as well as other marine life in Thailand.\nFar from being an isolated case, prominent Thai marine scientist Thon Thamrongnawasat said he receives reports of turtles being stranded every day. Many of them are suffering similar issues after eating debris.\n“There are normally 500 to 600 turtles per year. Every day we have almost two turtles stranded and 50 per cent of them, we find some plastic inside,” said the researcher from Kasetsart University.\n“If they’re stranded, they could be dead within a few days or weeks or cannot go back to the sea anymore. Life can adapt to some things, but not that much.”\nDespite the grim statistics, Thailand has had great success in building up local networks to identify and rescue vulnerable marine creatures and then return them to the wild. Thon said their target of 80 per cent returns is currently being met successfully and the country has good facilities and trained staff to treat such cases.\xa0\nBut, he admitted that the problem of marine plastic is getting worse, leaving more animals in distress.\n“We are doing this very well. We are trying to work very hard to save their lives. We are moving forward but sometimes the problem is moving faster than us,” he said.\nA WAVE OF PLASTIC\nA new research study has found that juvenile turtles are especially prone to eating polyethylene and polypropylene, both types of plastic commonly used in single-use packaging, as well as hard plastics and fibres from fishing nets.\xa0\nThe report, released this month in Frontiers in Marine Science, studied a variety of turtle species in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and found that many young turtles had not developed adequate behavioural instincts to determine what was food and to avoid plastic.\nTheir oceanic habitats were also found to overlap with highly polluted areas. Among green turtles studied in the Pacific, some 83 per cent were found to have ingested plastic in some form.\nThese plastics can cause dire health effects from malnutrition and chemical contamination and can result in death if the debris causes internal lacerations or blockages.\nThailand is among the world’s top offenders when it comes to contributing to marine pollution. \nA 2015 report by Washington DC-based environmental advocacy group Ocean Conservancy showed more than half of plastic waste in the ocean originated from five rapidly growing economies - China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.\nAbout 51,000 tons of uncollected and improperly disposed plastic waste in Thailand gets washed into the sea each year, according to SEA circular, a United Nations initiative.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been a major contributor to a worsening problem, as the use of single-use plastic has skyrocketed, due to hygiene reasons and a surge in food delivery services.\nBangkok city data showed that plastic waste increased in April by 62 per cent compared to last year. That equates to up to 3,432 tonnes of plastic thrown away every day.\n“It is a shame. I think Thailand was making some really good progress up until COVID. We had the plastic bag bans, the styrofoam bans, the plastic straw bans and I think the level of awareness among the general population was really high,” said Dominic Thomson, the Southeast Asia deputy director of the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF).\n“I think it will take a long time to get back to what we had in 2019 and early 2020. It’s going to be a real struggle unfortunately,” he said.\nThis waste is making the natural habitats of turtles and other animals much more unhealthy and dangerous.\n“We hope that if the COVID situation passes, we can reduce the number but not right now. We don’t know what to do right now,” said Thon, the marine scientist.\n“I feel very sad. I know the exact problem and I know that sometimes I cannot deal with the problem. At the moment we just can’t find a way.”\xa0\nEJF\xa0launched a project last year called Net Free Seas, which the organisation hopes can play a role in removing debris and preventing it entering marine ecosystems in the first place.\nIt specifically targets discarded fishing gear, of which at least\xa0 640,000 tonnes of gear are estimated to be left in the seas around the world every year. The plastic from this so-called ghost gear can entangle wildlife and become a mistaken food source for animals like turtles.\nThe project works with about 100 Thai coastal communities, who assist with collecting and then recycling or upcycling the debris into useful products with the aim of\xa0 “diverting as much tonnage from the marine environment as possible”, Thomson said.\xa0\n“If we can tap into that economic benefit for these communities then that’s a really attractive way to accelerate wider plastic recycling and awareness to hopefully address it on a wider scale,” he said.\n“It’s due to our own negligence and mismanagement that this has proliferated to such an extent globally, that these kinds of plastics are used so frequently and just thrown away with so little thought or care and then they have a devastating impact on so many different charismatic species.”\nWhile the plight of Tuk looks to be heading towards a happy ending, the marine veterinarians at PMBC know that the next case of a struggling animal in need will not be far away.\xa0\n“Everyone is worried about the situation in the sea. It’s not a situation that can be resolved by just one unit or a vet,” Araya said.\xa0\n“Cases like this will happen again and again until we take care of this properly.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     wildlife ', '     pollution ', '     environment ', '     Thailand ']}"

      Youths urged to adopt sustainability as a 'core value' to help Singapore's green journey
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Friday (Aug 27) urged youths to adopt sustainability as a core value, such that it becomes a part of “what it means to be Singaporean”.\n""Wherever you go, you can help make sustainability a part of our lives,"" said Mr Lee at the Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum organised by the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) students’ political association.\xa0\n""We need all of you to come on board our sustainability drive,"" said Mr Lee said in his keynote address.\nMr Lee called on youths to take action for sustainability, saying that sustainability commitments require resolve.\n“Above all, what we hope for is a deep shift in our culture, such that we adopt sustainability as a core value and a part of what it means to be Singaporean living in a city state,” said Mr Lee in his speech.\nMr Lee\'s address was followed by a dialogue that was not for open for media coverage.\xa0\n“Just as multiculturalism is one of our defining traits, so too should sustainability be so ingrained in us and our\xa0future generations that it informs our actions and decisions, and the kind of society that we strive to be,” said Mr Lee.\xa0\nAdding that climate action will be the “defining fight of our times” and for future generations, the National Development Minister said the Government “cannot do this” on their own.\xa0\nEveryone needs to play a part with diverse skills and perspectives, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nAs students graduate and enter the workforce, they can help to power many of Singapore\'s Green Plan initiatives, he added, addressing those in the audience.\xa0\n“Some of you, as future engineers, could work to electrify our vehicles, upgrade our charging infrastructure, or enhance our green energy capability. As an ecologist or conservationist, you could help us to green Singapore further, protect our biodiversity for future generations,” he said.\xa0\n“As architects, developers, engineers, builders, you could design and build super low energy or even net-zero energy buildings, or even positive energy buildings. As teachers, you can teach and groom future generations about sustainability, and many more. ”\xa0\nThe Green Plan 2030 was unveiled in February, unveiling Singapore’s green targets for the next 10 years.\nThe plan positions Singapore to achieve its long-term net-zero emissions goal “as soon as viable”.\xa0\nIt also strengthens Singapore’s commitments under the United Nations\' 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Paris Agreement, said the Government at the time.\xa0\nAmong the Green Plan initiatives, Mr Lee touched on Singapore’s conservation measures. Singapore has reserved about 7,800ha of land for nature reserves, nature parks and other dedicated green spaces, he noted.\xa0\n“That’s more than 10 per cent\xa0of our land area, and doesn’t include all the other pockets of greenery around our island, like trees planted along our roads, or our military training areas,” he added.\xa0\nSingapore is already seeing positive results from its conservation efforts, said Mr Lee. For example, several local mammal species have had their conservation status downgraded compared to 2008, and are considered less endangered than before.\xa0\nSingapore is also making headway in the public transport area, by building more MRT lines and testing new technologies such as driverless or electric buses, he added. The Government aims to phase out all internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040, or about 20 years from now.\xa0\n""The cars on the road that you\'re used to seeing and take for granted all these decades will no longer exist from 2040, which\xa0means that your children could grow up in a Singapore where all vehicles run on much cleaner energy sources,” said Mr Lee.\xa0\n“That’s a fundamental overhaul of our transport system, which will need major infrastructure upgrades, like new charging stations everywhere.""\xa0\nThe country’s cycling network will be more than 1,300km long by 2030, or long enough to cycle to Phuket from Singapore, he added.\xa0\nBuildings and towns, as well as Singapore\'s power sources\xa0will be more green. About 50 per cent of HDB blocks will have solar panels affixed to their roofs over the next two to three years, and 70 per cent by 2030, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nSingapore will also try to import more green electricity from other countries in the region that have better access to renewable energy like hydropower, he added.\xa0\n“We want to bring sustainability right into our daily lives. In fact, we’re making our HDB towns, where 80 per cent of Singaporeans live, more sustainable through the Green Towns programme,"" said the National Development Minister.\xa0\n""By using technologies like smart lighting, we aim to reduce energy consumption in existing towns by 15 per cent more from 2020 to 2030.”\xa0\nEven if Singapore does its part, global emissions may still not fall fast enough, and the country must\xa0be protected from the worst effects of climate change, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nLong-term moves like improving flood resilience and defending the coastline against rising sea levels could cost Singapore S$100 billion or more over the next 50 to100 years, he added.\xa0\nSingapore also aims to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030 because climate change may cause crop failures, which could disrupt food imports, said Mr Lee.\xa0\n""We must also remember that all these endeavours will involve some trade-offs, even painful ones. And as young people, your leadership is important.""\xa0\nAll Singaporeans ""need to take action in our own ways"", said Mr Lee in closing.\xa0\n""Going beyond ideas and discussion, as valuable and important as these are, to roll up our sleeves, get to work, experiment with different solutions, figure out the ground issues and how we can overcome them,” he added.\xa0\n“And who better to take this action than young people like yourselves, with your ambition, your energy, your inspiration\xa0and your conviction. Not just when it comes to sustainability, but also in tackling all the other challenges coming Singapore’s way.\n“Because that’s the wonderful gift of youth, that sense of endless possibility, that confidence to open new doors, the willingness to take risks, to explore the unknown, because so much of your life lies ahead of you. And that brings with it a certain responsibility too, to march forward bravely and to blaze new trails, and bring the rest of society with you.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Ministry of National Development ', '     Singapore Green Plan 2030 ', '     sustainability ', '     climate change ']}"

      Net-zero buildings: More than design or engineering, but about 'better quality of life'
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The drive down Clementi Road might be peppered with greenery alongside several schools, but the National University of Singapore’s School of Design and\xa0Environment 4 (SDE4) is still a sight to behold.\nStanding six storeys tall at 8 Architecture Drive, the multidisciplinary space boasts a large oversailing roof, airy and open spaces, floor-to-ceiling glass panels\xa0and concrete surfaces that resemble marble — and its sleek facade is only enhanced by weaving in the surrounding mature trees into its design.\xa0\nBut one thing stands out: Singapore’s first net-zero energy building to be built from scratch doesn’t have a green facade. And this decision was intentional.\xa0\n“Green facades are very popular now. This is a great idea, there’s nothing wrong with it. But we realised our building is (already) surrounded by all this dense greenery. When you come to our campus, you\'ll see large trees and amazing flora. It felt like putting a green wall was just lip service to green sustainable thinking,” explained Dr Nirmal Kishnani, associate professor at NUS SDE, to\xa0CNA.\xa0\n“Not to mention, green walls still place a certain burden in terms of water consumption. Again, (green walls) have value, they provide cooling, they do a lot of things, but we evaluated the idea and decided it wasn’t what we wanted to do for this particular site.”\xa0\nMr Giovanni Cossu, associate director of sustainability services at the Dean’s Office in NUS SDE, added that there was “a lot of discussion on how to preserve the existing vegetation, primarily the trees, which are literally encapsulated in the structure”.\xa0\nSuch meaningful decisions are necessary in creating a net-zero building like SDE4, as these buildings are “an absolute key to a sustainable future”, said Dr Kishnani.\xa0\nUnder the Singapore Green Plan 2030, one of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan\'s key targets is to green 80 per cent of its buildings by 2030. Aside from NUS SDE4, some notable players in the market include Keppel Bay Tower, which is\xa0Singapore’s First Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) Commercial Building, and the Building and Construction Authority\'s (BCA) zero-energy building.\nYet, despite being known to be good for the environment, net-zero buildings are hardly springing up across the island.\n""The basic premise of net-zero is when the building produces enough power by itself, and matches its consumption. It equalises the load that is consumed by the building.""\n""Zero means the building is at zero every day, every minute, every second. In the definition of how the industry looks at it, net-zero is assessed over a period of one year, where you’re zero most of the time.\n""After all, there are days or hours that you may end up producing more power than the building is consuming, and there are days when it’s on the opposite end. Therefore it’s net-zero over a 365-day period.""\xa0\n""In an off-grid building, you don’t need to connect it to the grid. You put a bunch of batteries in it, and then whenever you are producing more than you’re using, you store it in the battery.\n""In net zero, you don\'t install the batteries for a reason. Singapore’s grid is better than a battery. So when we make extra (energy), we’re putting it into the grid; when we need some, we’re taking it from the grid. But it should net out to zero.""\nSource: Mr Erwin Chong, Group Head of Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration at DBS, and Mr Prescott Gaylord, Head of Sustainability for Corporate Real Estate at DBS. \n\xa0\nFor a start, many companies might not have an incentive to build net-zero buildings, because it “isn’t their primary business to be net-zero” or focus on energy, suggested Mr Ang Kian Seng, group director of the environmental sustainability group at BCA.\xa0\n“If you\'re in the business of healthcare, for example, your main priority is how you deliver healthcare to patients in a cost-effective manner. So energy is secondary, and therefore it’s never high up (on your priorities),” he explained to CNA.\xa0\n“But having said that, because of the climate emergency, like just this morning there was a flash flood, everything can be attributed to global warming. There is more extreme weather. People are beginning to realise we all need to do something.”\nAs a result, net-zero buildings can be part of the solution to fight climate change, added Mr Lei Zhang, founder and CEO of Envision Group and Envision Digital, whose company aims to address\xa0sustainability challenges with technology solutions.\xa0\n“Buildings in Singapore account for over 20 per cent of the country’s carbon emissions. Given the high emissions footprint of buildings, using design and technology to enable them to be net-zero can help mitigate climate change in a meaningful way,” he told CNA.\xa0\nMr Zhang also cited the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which he said suggested that “globally, we will see more floods, changes in temperatures, more frequent rainfall”.\xa0\n“A third of Singapore, including its central business district, is less than 5m above mean sea level. Singaporeans have cause for concern, as it will literally be a situation of sink or swim if nothing is done,” he added.\nOne company that will soon walk the talk is DBS.\xa0\nBuilding on its commitment to achieve “net-zero operational carbon emissions” by 2022, the bank will transform an existing four-storey office building at 135 Bukit Timah Road into Singapore’s first net-zero development by a bank, DBS said in a press release in July.\xa0\nModifying an existing building is known as “retrofitting”.\n“We thought, what can be more green than not tearing down the building that we already have? … We said, hey, let’s truly challenge ourselves. Can we actually turn it into a net-zero building?” shared Mr Erwin Chong, Group Head of Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration at DBS.\xa0\n“(There’s) carbon that has already been used. There’s concrete, there’s cost, there’s everything that has already been built. (So that) set the ambition and the way we look at it. All of that fits with our responsible business practices and goals.”\xa0\nAnother principle guiding DBS in the process is that their building should “blend in with the existing environment”, much like the NUS SDE4 building.\xa0\n“We’re very near Botanic Gardens, a nice green patch of land in Singapore. The last thing we want is to create a building that looks like a concrete thing. We also wanted to make sure that we give back to the environment and the community,” added Mr Chong.\xa0\nSpeaking to CNA about BCA\'s zero-energy building that was built more than a decade ago by retrofitting a building within the BCA Academy, Mr Ang pointed to the concept of “passive design”.\xa0\n“It’s about harnessing the energy from the external environment to create a space that’s conducive for the end-users. This is probably the first step that most buildings must take - deploy as many passive design strategies as possible,” he said.\xa0\n“One concept that we\'re trying to promote very aggressively is the use of natural ventilation, even in office space. We recognise that it\'s challenging, because now I think the acceptance of air conditioning is almost the (default) mindset.\n“I think we need to do a lot of demonstration projects around what we call mixed mode ventilation, which means that you have a hybrid kind of system.”\nMr Ang also said BCA employs “smart energy management”, which is the opposite of a “one size fits all” approach in many offices, where a central system controls the lights and air-conditioning for the entire building.\xa0\n“We wanted to give power to the individual, in terms of air-conditioning and lighting. For instance, they will (gauge) the right level of light for their own workspace; if other people are not using the space, then the light might not be so bright\xa0… We need to make sure that the demand is met just right, so we don\'t waste energy unnecessarily,” he said.\xa0\nBut engineering and design challenges aren’t the only hurdles in adopting net-zero buildings.\xa0\nIt’s also about changing deep-rooted mindsets, whether it’s about embracing sustainability in our daily lives or accepting a lack of need for air-conditioning, said experts.\xa0\n“My own opinion is that people are guarded by mindset. They (often) think of a traditional (type) of building, especially in a tropical climate like Singapore, with the air-con and all that. It’s a big deciding factor as to why people don\'t adopt this (net-zero concept). Because it’s not traditional, or it’s not the general (way that things are done),” said DBS’ Mr Chong.\xa0\xa0\nConcerns around cost and air-conditioning need to be addressed, added Mr Ang.\xa0\n“One concern is the cost (of net-zero buildings). What is the incremental cost? … There is a premium, but it will pay for itself, because the savings from running the operation will offset the upfront incremental costs.”\xa0\nAnd where Singaporeans’ love for air-conditioning is concerned, changing their behaviour might take more than a little convincing.\xa0\n“We started to have discussions around what indoor air comfort is, and it’s probably a function of three factors: The temperature you maintain within the space, the humidity and the airflow. When you talk about these three things together, I think people’s acceptance level (of using less air-con) becomes higher,” said Mr Ang.\xa0\n“They realise that with a bit of draft, you can do with a higher temperature. It’s more comfortable that way. When the temperature is low, it might not be so good for the skin.”\nChanging individual mindsets will mean that more companies make plans to build or retrofit their own net-zero buildings –\xa0and DBS hopes theirs can eventually be a blueprint of sorts.\xa0\n“We’re not trying to just make this one net-zero building. This is part of an overall change in how we\'re looking at our space. We want to apply it to everything. Should all of our space be net-zero, we wanted to do it right,” shared Mr Prescott Gaylord, Head of Sustainability for Corporate Real Estate at DBS.\xa0\n“We wanted to use technologies, try things, such that it could be applied to our whole portfolio, and that it was accessible enough so that anyone else could copy us. We\'re not trying to hold on to any of our information. It will all be publicly available on the BCA website, if nothing else. We wanted to have a (greater) impact with our net-zero thinking.”\xa0\nMr Chong echoed his sentiments, hoping that big companies can think about net-zero beyond their premises and use their influence to encourage other companies to consider doing more.\n“It is still important to go do your CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities, like cleaning the beach every now and then. But if it’s not part of your core business activities, where you can implement this at a\xa0(higher) level or (bigger) scale, then you’re not doing your duty, since you are able to (have more) impact,” he said.\xa0\n“When I talk to Singaporeans about it, I think there is a great kind of camaraderie and civic understanding in doing your part. … I think people in general understand that we have to take care of each other,” added Mr Gaylord.\xa0\nUltimately, experts agreed that the concept of net-zero buildings might be difficult to grasp if it’s seen as too technical for the layman. Instead, consider this: Net-zero is fundamentally about improving the individual’s quality of life.\xa0\nWhenever NUS’ Dr Kishnani talks to people about zero energy, they assume it’s a “cost-saving issue or a technology issue”, but the SDE project has shown him that it makes for “a much better quality of life”, he said.\xa0\n“The hybrid cooling system is not just saving us money; it\'s improving the health of our students and staff who use the building because it\'s 100 per cent fresh air, as compared to a conventional air conditioning system which is recirculated air. So we have less risk from spread of pathogens or build-up of carbon monoxide indoors,” he shared.\xa0\nThe zero-energy target is not something that “stands on its own as a numerical target”, and neither is it solely “an engineering problem”, he added.\xa0\n“It’s a different way of thinking about design. And if you think about it creatively, you bring to the table a lot of other benefits to the quality of our lives, and to our safety and our health\xa0… It’s a design problem, an everyday life problem.”\xa0\nDr Kishnani pointed out that it would help to reframe the issue of sustainability so that people don’t see it as a sacrifice or ask what they must give up.\xa0\n“If you think about sustainability in the right mindset, it’s a bonus to our lives. It creates pleasure, beauty and a higher quality of life. I think this is the thing that gets lost in the conversation, because there is a climate emergency so we\'re all reacting to that, and then there are issues of cost. They don\'t look at what value it brings to our lives, like how it changed the way we teach or how we experience the indoor environment,” he said.\xa0\n“We have to see (sustainability) not as an either/or situation, but as an and/also situation: If we do that, we get this as well.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     climate change ', '     environment ']}"

      Greener system of cooling buildings may be set up in Tampines, paving the way for more eco-friendly towns
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Several buildings in Tampines central may soon be retrofitted with a cooling system that is more energy efficient, after a feasibility study found that it could lead to a 17 per cent reduction in electricity consumption.\nKnown as distributed district cooling, the proposed network for Tampines involves having the existing cooling systems of selected buildings produce chilled water to serve the building and others around it.\nThe buildings will all be interconnected via insulated pipes that can distribute and circulate the chilled water in a closed loop.\nIn the study conducted by Temasek and SP Group, 14 buildings in Tampines central were involved, including retail malls, commercial and public offices, data centres and a community sports hub.\nOn Thursday (Aug 19), the owners of seven of those buildings, including CapitaLand and Frasers Property, signed letters of intent with SP to pledge their interest in subscribing to the distributed district cooling network.\n“I am hopeful that the adoption of this green cooling solution will bring Tampines closer to our ambition to be an Eco Town by 2025 and pave the way for district cooling to be explored across other towns and built-up areas,” said the adviser to Tampines Grassroots Organisations Masagos Zulkifli, who is also Minister for Social and Family Development.\n“Sustainable towns and districts are essential for Singapore to meet our sustainability goals under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.”\nThe proposed cooling network for Tampines differs from the usual district cooling systems in greenfield sites – or new developments planned from a clean slate –\xa0such as the upcoming Tengah precinct, where the systems are incorporated into the design of the new development.\nIn Tampines, where existing buildings already have their own chiller plant systems, a “distributed” district cooling network can be a “game changer”, said SP Group and Temasek in a joint media release.\nA district cooling system can be likened to a giant air-conditioner that can cool an entire district of buildings rather than just individual ones. Chilled water is generated in a central cooling plant before being piped to various buildings through an underground network to provide air conditioning.\nWarmer water is then circulated back to the cooling plant, so that they can be chilled again and redistributed to buildings.\nOne area that has implemented a district cooling system is Marina Bay. Designed and operated by SP, the underground system serves 16 developments in the area, including Marina Bay Sands, the Marina Bay Financial Centre, as well as One Raffles Quay.\nBy centralising the production of chilled water, about 25,000 sq m of prime land space was freed up for other uses, as buildings did not have to build their own chiller plant.\nThe upcoming Tengah precinct will also house Singapore’s first residential centralised cooling system.\nOn Thursday, Temasek and SP also released a white paper that consolidated key findings from the feasibility study that started last year on the 14 Tampines buildings.\nThe report outlined the economic and environmental benefits of having district cooling systems in existing developments as well as the challenges in setting them up.\nAmong the findings, the study found that implementing such a system could lead to a 17 per cent reduction in energy consumption and significant cost savings.\nIt estimated that S$4.3 million can be saved annually due to lower energy consumption, reduction in equipment replacement and maintenance costs, as well as potential earnings from freeing up chiller plant space which can be converted into retail or office space.\nReductions in energy usage and the amount of refrigerant used to cool buildings can also result in an 18 per cent cut in carbon emissions.\nHowever, rolling out such a system in an area that has already been developed is not without challenges.\nThe district cooling system provider will have to navigate the existing built environment and may face several constraints such as having to minimise disruptions to existing operations in order to implement the system.\nGiven these challenges, Temasek and SP said the white paper can serve as a “useful blueprint” for other districts looking to reduce their energy consumption from cooling, as Singapore looks for solutions to address the climate emergency, they said.\nProviders can also work with the building owners to optimise and incorporate district cooling considerations right from the design stage of the projects.\nSP said it will work closely with the building owners to factor in their considerations in the commercial terms of the supply agreement.\nDuring the installation and retrofitting period, the group said it will also engage relevant government agencies on ways to lay the chilled water pipes in order to optimise resources while minimising inconvenience to the public.\nMeanwhile, discussions with the other building owners who supported the study are continuing, Temasek and SP said.\nBoth parties will work together to launch the first phase of the network in Tampines.\nIf the distributed district cooling network is installed in Tampines central, SP said it could also be extended to nearby HDB blocks in future.\nThe group added, however, that it is important to ensure that the base operations are stable before looking into the possibility of extending the network into residential areas.\nOpportunities to scale brownfield district cooling systems in other parts of Singapore will also be explored.\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     environment ', '     Heat ', '     climate change ', '     Tampines ']}"

      NTU scientists develop sweat-powered battery for wearable devices
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have developed a\xa0sweat-powered battery, capable of generating enough energy to operate commercial temperature sensors.\nThe prototype battery, which measures 2cm by 2cm, only requires 2ml of sweat to discharge 20 hours worth of electricity.\nThe stretchable battery\xa0is\xa0meant to be used on wearable devices like watches and health sensors. It also does not require charging.\nMaterials scientist\xa0Professor Lee Pooi See, who led the study, told reporters at a media briefing on Monday (Aug 16) that the\xa0device is also sustainable as it does not contain heavy metals or toxic chemicals, thus reducing harmful electronic waste.\xa0\nOther members of the research team include NTU’s School of Materials Science and Engineering’s Dr Lyu Jian and Dr Gurunathan Thangavel.\xa0The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances in July.\xa0\nThe battery is created by printing ink that contains\xa0silver flakes and hydrophilic poly(urethane-acrylate), which function as the battery electrodes, onto stretchable fabric.\nWhen sweat comes into contact with the battery, it improves the conductivity of the silver flakes\xa0and also causes an electric current to flow.\xa0\nAs the stretchable textile used is\xa0very absorbent, it retains a lot of sweat, allowing the battery to remain powered even when the rate of sweating is inconsistent.\xa0\nThis is vital for consistent functioning of the battery as the amount of sweat produced by people varies and depends on factors such as the area of the body, environmental conditions and time of day, added NTU.\xa0\nThe device is also “more durable” than current technology, said Prof Lee, as the team has shown that it can withstand strain from a wearer’s daily activities and repeated exposure to stress or sweat.\nThe slimness of the battery additionally addresses two problems in wearable technology: It is sleeker and thus more attractive to consumers compared to traditional button batteries and it carries enough charge to last throughout the day, unlike current thinner batteries.\nHowever, Prof Lee noted some challenges in the use of the battery, including its ability to last longer\xa0when there is not enough sweat, or when faced with the inconsistent sweating rate for different people.\nAssociate Professor Irene Goldthorpe from the University of Waterloo’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who is not involved in the research, said the study may open a “new paradigm” in the design of wearable electronics.\xa0\n“It is well-known that electronics do not like moisture and thus wearable devices are typically fully encapsulated to shield them from sweat,” she said, adding that the study turns sweat “from a hindrance into an asset”.\nA patent application for the sweat-powered battery has also been filed through the university’s enterprise and innovation company, NTUitive.\nThe researchers plan to further explore the effects of other components of human sweat and how factors such as body heat may affect the performance of the battery, added NTU.\xa0\nIn an email\xa0to CNA, Associate Professor Stefan Adams from the National University of Singapore\'s Department of Materials Science and Engineering raised concerns that the battery contains heavy metals. \nHe said that the battery used by Prof Lee and her team uses zinc and silver nanoparticles, silver oxide or silver chloride, adding that both are heavy metals.\nIn response, the NTU team said that silver and silver oxides in the battery are ""stable, non-toxic and not in nanoparticles\xa0form"", while the zinc undergoes reduction to zinc oxide during the electrochemical reaction.\n""We do not use hazardous heavy metal such as mercury that was used in conventional aqueous batteries.\n""We recognise that silver in certain forms could pose an environmental threat, but the silver flakes, in their current form in the battery, do not form major free ions and are not considered an environmental risk.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     NTU ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      UN sounds clarion call over humans 'irreversible' impact on climate
  </h1>, 'text': 'The UN panel on climate change sounded a dire warning on Monday (Aug 9), saying the world is dangerously close to runaway warming – and that humans are ""unequivocally"" to blame.\nAlready, greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere are high enough to guarantee climate disruption for decades if not centuries, scientists warn in a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\xa0\nThat’s on top of the deadly heat waves, gargantuan hurricanes and other weather extremes that are happening now, and are likely to become more severe.\nDescribing the report as a ""code red for humanity"", UN\xa0Secretary-General António Guterres urged an end to the use of coal and other highly polluting fossil fuels.\n“The alarm bells are deafening,” Guterres said in a statement. “This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet.”\nThe IPCC report comes just three months before a major UN\xa0climate conference known as COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where nations will be under pressure to pledge much more ambitious climate action, and substantial financing to go with it.\nDrawing on more than 14,000 scientific studies, the report gives the most comprehensive and detailed picture yet of how climate change is altering the natural world - and what could still be ahead.\nUnless immediate, rapid and large-scale action is taken to reduce emissions, the report says, the average global temperature is likely to cross the 1.5 degree Celsius warming threshold within the next 20 years.\nSo far, nations’ pledges to cut emissions\xa0have been inadequate for bringing down the level of greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere.\nGovernments and campaigners reacted to the findings with alarm.\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose country will host the climate conference, said the next decade would be ""pivotal"" to securing the future of our planet:\n""I hope today’s IPCC report will be a wake-up call for the world to take action now, before we meet in Glasgow in November for the critical COP26 summit.""\nEmissions “unequivocally caused by human activities” have already pushed the average global temperature up 1.1\xa0degree Celsius\xa0from its pre-industrial average - and would have raised it 0.5\xa0degree Celsius\xa0further without the tempering effect of pollution in the atmosphere, the report says.\nThat means that, even as societies move away from fossil fuels, temperatures will be pushed up again by the loss of those airborne pollutants.\nScientists warn that a rise of more than 1.5\xa0degree Celsius\xa0above the preindustrial average could trigger runaway climate change with catastrophic impacts, such as heat so intense that people die just from being outdoors.\nAny further warming will also boost the intensity and frequency of heat extremes and heavy rainfall, as well as droughts in some regions. Because temperatures fluctuate from year to year, scientists measure climate warming in terms of 20-year averages.\n""We have all the evidence we need to show we are in a climate crisis,"" said three-time IPCC co-author Sonia Seneviratne, a climate scientist at ETH Zurich who doubts she will sign up for a fourth report. ""Policy makers have enough information. You can ask: Is it a meaningful use of scientists\' time, if nothing is being done?""\nThe 1.1\xa0degree Celsius\xa0warming already recorded has been enough to unleash disastrous weather. This year, heat waves killed hundreds in the Pacific Northwest and smashed records around the world. Wildfires fuelled by heat and drought are sweeping away entire towns in the U.S. West, releasing record carbon dioxide emissions from Siberian forests, and driving Greeks to flee their homes by ferry.\n""Every bit of warming matters,"" said IPCC co-author Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading in Britain. ""The consequences get worse and worse as we get warmer.""\nGreenland’s ice sheet is ""virtually certain"" to continue melting, and raising the sea level, which will continue to rise for centuries to come as the oceans warm and expand.\nIt is already too late to prevent these particular changes. The best the world can do is to slow them down so that countries have more time to prepare and adapt.\n“We are now committed to some aspects of climate change, some of which are irreversible for hundreds to thousands of years,” said IPCC co-author Tamsin Edwards, a climate scientist at King’s College London. “But the more we limit warming, the more we can avoid or slow down those changes.”\nEven to slow climate change, the report says, the world is running out of time.\nIf the world drastically cuts emissions in the next decade, average temperatures could still be up 1.5\xa0degree Celsius\xa0by 2040 and possibly 1.6\xa0degree Celsius\xa0by 2060 before stabilising.\nIf the world does not cut emissions dramatically, but continues the current trajectory, the rise could be 2.0\xa0degree Celsius\xa0by 2060 and 2.7\xa0degree Celsius\xa0by the century’s end.\nThe earth has not been that warm since the Pliocene Epoch roughly 3 million years ago - when humanity\'s first ancestors were appearing, and the oceans were 25 metres\xa0higher than they are today.\nIt could get even worse, if warming triggers feedback loops that release even more climate-warming carbon emissions - such as the melting of Arctic permafrost or the dieback of global forests. Under these high-emissions scenarios, Earth could broil at temperatures 4.4\xa0degree Celsius\xa0above the preindustrial average by 2081-2100.\n“We have already changed our planet, and some of those changes we will have to live with for centuries and millennia to come,” said IPCC co-author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.\nThe question now, he said, was how many more irreversible changes could be avoided.\n""We still have choices to make.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     environment ', '     global warming ', '     climate change ', '     IPCC ']}"

      Singapore exploring partnerships to capture, store carbon dioxide as part of low-carbon push: Tan See Leng
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As Singapore lacks suitable known geological formations needed to store\xa0carbon dioxide permanently underground,\xa0it is exploring partnerships with companies and other countries to do so .\n“Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore,” said Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng on Tuesday (Jul 27).\nHe was responding to parliamentary questions by Dr Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) on the current state of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and the assessment of potential technological advancements in the sector for the next decade.\nAccording to Dr Tan See Leng, who is also the Minister for Manpower, one of Singapore’s key thrusts of its enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions and Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy is to adopt advanced low-carbon technologies to decarbonise its economy. These technologies include CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen.\nCARBON CAPTURE, UTILISATION AND STORAGE\nA “small number” of pathways for CCUS are at a technologically advanced stage, but they require further development to be commercially viable in Singapore, said the minister.\nCarbon capture and storage is one of these pathways. While there are more large-scale projects developed internationally, Singapore faces challenges in deploying it domestically as it does not have known geological formations suitable for the permanent storage of carbon dioxide underground, he said.\n“We are therefore exploring partnerships with companies and other countries with suitable geological formations to enable carbon dioxide storage opportunities.”\nCarbon capture and storage is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it can be released into the atmosphere.\xa0\nThe Government is also exploring carbon capture and utilisation pathways, where carbon dioxide is captured and recycled, said the minister. The recycled carbon dioxide can be used to produce reclamation aggregates or building materials.\n“There are a number of companies developing test-beds for use in Singapore and examples of commercial-scale operations in other countries,” said Dr Tan See Leng.\n\n\nIn addition, captured carbon dioxide can be used to manufacture synthetic fuels and chemicals such as kerosene and methanol. They can be used as aviation and marine fuels.\n“However, most pathways for synthesising fuels or chemicals from carbon dioxide are not mature and they are relatively nascent,” said the minister. Some are more expensive than conventional methods of production, some remain at lab-scale and others require “significant amounts” of energy in the form of low-carbon hydrogen.\nLOW-CARBON HYDROGEN\nDr Tan Wu Meng also asked questions on the state of Singapore’s low-carbon hydrogen sector.\n“Low-carbon hydrogen is a key technology for Singapore to decarbonise,” said Dr Tan See Leng, adding that a recent feasibility study showed that hydrogen could decarbonise maritime, electricity generation, heavy transportation and some industrial process.\n“However, until CCUS is commercially viable, Singapore cannot produce low-carbon hydrogen at scale,” he said. As such, Singapore is exploring other sources.\nA key challenge of scaling up the supply of hydrogen is the high storage and transportation costs, said Dr Tan See Leng. It is thus a “significant engineering challenge” to transport and store hydrogen in a commercially viable manner.\n\n\nListing several methods of transportation, the minister noted that there is currently no global consensus on which method would dominate in the future or when the long-distance transport of hydrogen and the processes to liberate hydrogen from hydrogen carriers might become viable.\nIn a supplementary question, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) asked if the Government would consider public transportation as part of its low-carbon push.\nDr Tan See Leng said this was something that the Government could “potentially” look at on a “limited basis”, depending on the proposals it receives.\nHowever, he added that the Government is “actively pursuing” renewable energy imports from ASEAN countries and countries that have “maximum geographical advantage” in producing renewable energy with “very low carbon or zero carbon”.\xa0\n“Those are the immediate short-term measures that we will be moving forward to reduce our carbon footprint,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Tan See Leng ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      IN FOCUS: As fishing rises in popularity, concerns grow about overfishing and litter
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: While Saturday mornings may be a time to relax for many people, Mr Eugene Heng\xa0is busy.\nHopping onto his motorboat, the 72-year-old sets out across the still waters of Marina Reservoir. Along the river, near Kallang riverside park, he slows the engine and steers the boat closer to the bank.\nThe area, a designated fishing site, is often teeming with recreational fishers hoping to land a catch or two for the day. However, Mr Heng doesn’t look at the shore. Instead, he squints at the water surface and soon\xa0finds what he has been searching for - litter that has ended up in the water.\xa0\nDipping his net, he scoops a ball of tangled fishing lines out of the water before tossing it onto his boat.\nThis has been his mission for the past 20-odd years\xa0since he founded the Waterways Watch Society (WWS), a non-profit organisation that organises weekly cleanups at waterways.\nHowever, Mr Heng’s workload has grown heavier amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with growing waste volumes. In the first half of this year, more than three tons of litter was collected from the Marina reservoir, he said. That is more than half of\xa0what was collected in 2018, despite having fewer patrols and volunteers.\xa0\nAnd among the piles of waste, Mr Heng has noticed a growing proportion of fishing litter, such as nets, lines and hooks.\nMORE HOOKED ON FISHING\nSince the country exited its ""circuit breaker"" last year, visitors have thronged the area to escape their homes and get some fresh air. In particular, there has been a surge in the number of anglers fishing at Marina Reservoir, said Mr Heng.\nWith travel off the cards, fishing has soared in popularity here, as people look for ways to keep themselves busy and entertained.\nSporting goods retailer Decathlon told CNA that sales of fishing equipment have\xa0grown by 118 per cent\xa0compared to last year.\nThe biggest increase, it said, came from the sales of beginner fishing equipment, with products such as rod and reel combos flying off the shelves.\nMr Varun Singh, who runs a store selling camping and fishing equipment, said he has also observed an increase in the number of beginners buying fishing equipment.\nThey range from teenagers to those in their 50s, he said in an interview with CNA.\n“Previously, a lot of people would have been buying (fishing) equipment for overseas use, (such as) a two- or three-day trip to Malaysia, but demand for heavier equipment has slowed down, and more people are buying lighter tackle to do freshwater fishing here,” he said.\n“Last time, we would see about 50 per cent of our customers buying light tackle equipment but now, they make up about 80 to 90 per cent of our customer pool.”\n\n\nThis rising interest in fishing has a downside: Some anglers leave lines and hooks behind, while there are also concerns about overfishing.\xa0\n“When we go out on our boat patrols, our engine propellers get clogged up with fishing lines, and we also come across floating fishing lines, or even fishing nets,” said Mr Heng.\n“Invariably, when we do that, we\'ll find fish, tortoises or anything in the water that\'s been caught with a hook or with the net.”\nSuch litter could also pose safety risks for the public and for workers maintaining the reservoir.\nAccording to national water agency PUB, there have been incidents in the past where pedestrians were injured by stray fish hooks cast by careless anglers.\nTo encourage the proper disposal of used fishing lines and hooks, special bins have been placed at designated fishing sites at Marina, Bedok and Pandan reservoirs.\nSet up in July last year, the bins have been “well-utilised” by anglers, with bins in areas such as Bedok reservoir having to be cleared almost daily, said PUB.\nIt added that around 30 more bins will be installed at reservoirs and waterways by this year.\nTACKLING THE PROBLEM\nInland fishing, such as in reservoirs and waterways, is only allowed at designated sites, and the use of live bait is banned.\nThe rules\xa0are enforced by PUB to ensure safety and water quality.\nAccording to Associate Professor Darren Yeo from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) department of biological sciences, if too much live bait ends up in a reservoir, it could affect the quality of raw water.\n“When the bait dies and breaks down, it basically contributes to organic material and nutrients which will affect our water quality (because) all these nutrients will enhance algal growth.”\nCoupled with favourable\xa0conditions\xa0such as warm water and sufficient sunlight, this could encourage rapid\xa0algae growth and spawn algae blooms which could cause mass fish deaths, he said.\nTo monitor illegal fishing activities, a network of more than 200 surveillance cameras equipped with video analytics\xa0has been set up at hotspots near reservoirs.\nWhen they detect unauthorised activity, such as a person fishing illegally at the shoreline, an alert will be sent to officers, who will sound a warning through an audio system.\nHowever, some people remain undeterred.\nWhen CNA visited the reservoir last Saturday (Jul 10), at least two anglers were spotted using dead fish and meat as bait, despite signs\xa0warning them not to do so.\nOne of the men claimed that he did not see the sign and continued to fish.\nThe other told CNA that he was not aware of the rules and that he “just” wanted to catch a fish to bring home and eat.\nOn average, PUB hands out more than 100 penalties each year for illegal fishing. Those caught fishing at no-fishing areas or using live bait at reservoirs can be fined up to S$3,000.\nIn areas managed by the National Parks Board (NParks), offenders can be fined up to S$5,000 for fishing in no-fishing areas and up to S$50,000 in nature reserves. As of Jul 5, there have been 26 cases of illegal fishing this year in\xa0areas managed by NParks.\nThe agency added, however,\xa0that cases in these areas have been declining in recent years. Last year, there were\xa0around 70 cases of illegal fishing, down from about 120 cases in 2018.\n\n\nBut trying to clamp down on illegal fishing is like playing a cat and mouse game, said Mr Heng, whose organisation works with PUB to engage and educate anglers on fishing rules and regulations.\n“Most of the (anglers) actually know where they can fish and where they cannot fish, so when we catch them, they’ll just apologise and leave but then they’ll come back,” he said.\n“Even in areas where PUB has put up the CCTV cameras, they’ll (either) just avoid those areas or hide at an angle so that the CCTV can’t catch them.”\nSince the pandemic began, the problem of illegal fishing at Marina Reservoir has worsened.\n“(We’ve seen) at least a 20 per cent increase in anglers (flouting the rules) at Marina reservoir, despite us having fewer boots on the ground due to COVID-19 restrictions,” he said.\n“If we had more frequent patrols and volunteers, it is safe to conclude that we would sight more.”\nEYES IN THE SKY\nAn extra pair of eyes in the sky could help to improve the situation on the ground.\nSince the end of May, drones have progressively been rolled out to several reservoirs, including Marina Reservoir, to observe water quality and to look out for excessive growth of aquatic plants and algal blooms.\nThey are also able to detect activities such as illegal fishing.\n\n\nEquipped with remote sensing systems and a camera for near real-time video analytics, the drones can\xa0survey\xa0large areas of the reservoir, saving time and manpower resources.\nWhen an illegal fishing activity is spotted, a “near real-time” alert will be sent to PUB officers’ mobile phones, allowing them to respond to cases quickly.\nBut the idea of a drone hovering over their heads has stirred unhappiness among some members of the fishing community.\n“Imagine you\'re fishing in a legal area, and you\'re just trying to enjoy a quiet morning or evening,” said a spokesperson from sustainable fishing group Marine Stewards Singapore. ""Then you hear the loud buzzing noise of the drones.""\n“It’s invasive and disruptive, and it’s not something the community is really liking.""\nWhile Mr Rizal Sam, an experienced angler, agreed that it would be uncomfortable being under constant surveillance, he said the drones could also spur better fishing etiquette.\nFrustrated by the inconsiderate behaviour of some anglers, the 30-year-old, who has been fishing for more than 20 years in areas such as Upper Seletar Reservoir, now frequents pay ponds instead. These have a more controlled and pleasant environment, he said.\n“At reservoirs, you see some people using really smelly live bait, such as chicken guts or walking catfish, because they want to attract the fish to the smell,” he said.\n“If you were me and you were watching them baiting the fish with disgusting, smelly bits of rotten meat, how would you feel? This is the water we’ll end up drinking.”\n“So, when I see a lot of people baiting, I’ll just go to a fishing pond and spend a bit more money, ” he said.\n“There\'s a lot of fish\xa0there and they have specific rules such as only using artificial lures, and people follow them because it’s a private place, so it’s cleaner.”\nA DIFFERENT BALL GAME\nAround the coast of Singapore\xa0and further out at sea,\xa0recreational and commercial fishing also creates issues.\xa0\nLast month, a marine biologist posted pictures of at least 12 young black-tipped reef sharks, along with other marine creatures, found dead in a 500m-long gill net at Pulau Semakau.\nIn May, a dead hawksbill turtle caught in a gill net was discovered in the waters off Pulau Hantu, according to the Singapore Marine Guide,\xa0a platform for the boating and\xa0leisure marine\xa0community.\xa0The critically endangered species,\xa0native to Singapore, had been found with its head severed and body badly decomposed.\nThere is also the issue of fishing gear ending up in the sea.\nAccording to a report published by the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) last year, between 500,000 and\xa01 million tons of fishing gear end up in the world’s oceans every year. These make up at least 10 per cent of all marine litter, the report said.\nCalled ""ghost gear"", these lost and discarded items are haunting oceans,\xa0catching and entangling marine creatures such as sea turtles, sharks\xa0and seabirds, often killing them. They can also damage critical marine habitats such as coral reefs.\nBut how big a problem is this in Singapore’s waters?\nAccording to Dr Zeehan Jaafar, a lecturer at NUS\'\xa0Department of Biological Sciences, the answer is unknown.\n“We do not have a good handle on what\'s there (in the water), so to say more is being taken out right now is difficult,” she said.\n“Recreational fishing is extremely big in Singapore, even before COVID-19, but what is the impact, we have no idea because we’re only beginning to understand and study it.”\nWhile there are existing laws to protect and conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystems, experts said\xa0there is scope for more to be done.\nIn 2018, marine biologists and environmentalists, including Dr Jaafar, presented a 230-page proposal that outlined ways to better protect marine ecosystems in Singapore. The proposal, called the Singapore Blue Plan, was submitted to the Government.\nDuring the launch of the plan in October 2018, Second Minister for\xa0National Development\xa0Desmond Lee said that agencies will study the recommendations in detail and explore how they can work with the marine community to realise some of the common goals.\xa0\nA year later, NParks updated\xa0its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to bolster the country\'s efforts in biodiversity conservation. It included national targets such as updating a national database system with biodiversity-related information and conserving\xa00.5 per cent\xa0of coastal and marine areas as natural areas.\n\n\nAmong the suggestions raised, the proposal called for existing legislation to be amended, in order to fill gaps in regulation and detection of maritime offences.\nFor instance, the Fisheries Act, which regulates the fishing industry, could incorporate the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act, it said. This would make it illegal for fishing vessels to indiscriminately dispose of their equipment in the sea and endanger marine life.\nEnvironmentalists have also suggested regulating the use of gill or drift nets. Currently, the Fisheries Act only prohibits the use of poisons, explosives and trawl nets\xa0in Singapore’s waters.\n“A lot of people do it to try and catch fish (because) it is quite an effective way of catching fish since the net can cover a lot more area, for example, a long net could be 100m to 300m long,” said the Marine Stewards spokesperson.\n“It’s a real concern because (nets) are an indiscriminate killer, it can catch a lot of bycatch.”\nBycatch refers to\xa0fish or other marine species that have been caught unintentionally while trying to catch another type of fish.\nHowever, tracking down the culprits of marine litter will be “almost impossible”, said Dr Jaafar.\n“It\'s very hard to pinpoint (the abandoned gear) to any one person,” she said. “Even if you tag a net, when the nets are out at sea, they may break apart and then you may not be able to trace it.”\nOn the ground, however, efforts to study the impact of recreational fishing and tackle the problem of fishing\xa0litter are gaining momentum.\nSustainable fishing group\xa0Marine Stewards said it is looking to collect local data on fishing activities, including netting and angling, to assess how prevalent the problem is.\nIn certain sites such as coastal areas managed by NParks, net fishing and the use of wire mesh traps have been prohibited, as they pose a threat to wildlife and marine creatures.\nWith more people observed fishing in Singapore’s waters, concerns about over-fishing have also surfaced.\nTo safeguard marine biodiversity, NParks said it has designated areas such as the Sisters’ Islands Marine Park and Chek Jawa Wetlands as “no fishing” areas.\xa0These areas are managed as sanctuaries for fish to flourish and grow to maturity, said Mr Ryan Lee, the group director of NPark’s National Biodiversity Centre.\nHe added that NParks takes a balanced approach to recreational fishing, with outreach and education as key strategies for biodiversity conservation.\nThe agency works with groups like the Marine Stewards to promote best practices for recreational fishing, such as voluntary catch-and-release, where fish are released back into the sea if they are not to be eaten.\n“This is especially for juveniles, and endangered and threatened species,” said Mr Lee.\nTO LICENSE OR NOT?\nSome jurisdictions have implemented licensing or permit schemes for recreational fishing, to track fish stock and ensure sustainability.\nFor instance, in the US, most states require anglers to obtain a fishing licence. According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s website, “100 per cent” of licence fees go directly toward conservation and restoration.\nThis means funds raised from the sale of fishing licenses contributes to fish management, species and habitat restoration, research, and public access for fishing and boating.\nIn the UK, certain types of fish such as salmon and sea trout are regulated, which means anglers need to apply for a rod fishing licence before catching them. There are also national rules and local laws on areas where people cannot fish as well as the size of fish they can keep.\nWhile such schemes aim to protect fish stocks and make fisheries sustainable, they have drawn mixed views from the fishing community here.\n“There are actually anglers who are welcoming the concept of licences precisely because they don\'t want people who are fishing unsustainably or not practising good fishing etiquette, but there\'s also a group of people who don\'t want another licence under the law to restrict their actions,” said the Marine Stewards.\n“If they understand that fishing licences are not really restricting them, but (ensuring) fisheries management so that everyone gets more fish then I think it\'s something that might be possible to push.”\nHowever, given the myriad people who fish in Singapore’s waters, implementing a legislative framework for recreational fishing may not be so simple, warned Dr Jaafar.\n“There are different kinds of people who fish, some of them are actually artisanal fishermen ... some of them do it daily to relax or to get food,” she noted in an interview with CNA. “It’s not just one homogenous group, it’s many people with different statuses and needs, so it’s actually quite complex.”\nIn addition, with more than 600 marine species on Singapore shores, Dr Jaafar said implementing restrictions on the type and size of fish could be a challenge.\n“If we say (the fishing community) should only take up things which are mature, then they have to remember the maturity length for so many species and actually, for a lot of the species, the maturity length is actually unknown and the information may, sometimes, not be available,” she said.\n“To flesh out a legislative framework to figure out what are the punitive measures and all that takes a lot of time, and then once the legislation is passed, then comes the question of how do we enforce it?”\n\n\nTo better understand legislation surrounding fishing activities, Dr Jaafar said discussions are ongoing between stakeholders and government agencies.\n“It\'s a very sensitive issue and so while it\'s easy for us to say (we should) ban it, what about the people who aren’t able to find other kinds of livelihood? I don\'t think there’s any easy solution or quick fix for this.”\nBeyond law and enforcement, ground-up initiatives have also sprung up to encourage responsible fishing.\nLast year, the Marine Stewards came up with several guidelines for fishermen, which includes releasing juvenile, threatened and endangered species. It also urged anglers to keep hybrid groupers as they may compete with native fish for food and disrupt the local ecosystem.\nIt has put up information on its website on the maturity lengths for about 50 species of fish\xa0commonly found in Singapore waters.\nFISHING SUSTAINABLY AND RESPONSIBLY\nUltimately, education and more awareness will help to pave the way for sustainable and responsible fishing.\n“You must remember that, in the past, fishing was allowed everywhere, then the PUB came and (some areas) were made into reservoirs, so in a way, we started restricting what was not restricted in the past,” said Mr Heng.\n“So it became more and more challenging because people would say: Why can\'t I fish when I could last time?""\nTo spread the word, organisations like the WWS and the Marine Stewards regularly engage anglers to educate them on responsible fishing as well as the benefits of catch-and-release.\nStudies have shown that\xa0with proper handling, the survival rate of fish released by anglers is typically above 90 per cent. However, in order to ensure high levels of survival, anglers must avoid playing the fish to exhaustion or keeping it out of the water for too long. In some cases, especially when the fish has swallowed the hook, cutting the line instead of extracting it could help to increase survivability.\xa0\nThe public, as well as the authorities, could also work closely with the fishing community\xa0to make the sport more acceptable, said the Marine Stewards spokesperson.\n“Honestly, fishing is not a bad sport, it’s just people going outdoors to cast a line and try to catch a fish,” said the group’s spokesperson.\n“Most of the people in the fishing community are responsible but it just takes one joker or bad example to end up in the news, to create an image that is not representative of the community.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     pollution ', '     wildlife ', '     In Focus ', '     environment ']}"

      China slams Henan, Yunnan provinces for environmental shortcomings
  </h1>, 'text': 'SHANGHAI: The Chinese provinces of Henan and Yunnan have failed to meet public expectations when it comes to tackling pollution and cleaning up their air, rivers and soil, the environment ministry said after the completion of inspections.\nThe central government launched its fifth round of environmental audits in late May to see how Henan, Yunnan and six other provinces and regions had managed to comply with laws and regulations.\nThe inspection teams set up hotlines for local whistleblowers and are given powers to make spot checks at firms and summon any official for interview. During the inspections, firms can be punished and fined, and officials even face dismissal or detention in the most serious cases.\nIn separate statements referring to the two provinces, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said both Henan in central China and Yunnan on the southwestern border had made some progress but neither meet ""the requirements of the central government or the expectations of the public"".\n\n\nBoth provinces have been ordered to draw up rectification plans and submit them to the cabinet within 30 working days. Failure of firms and individuals to rectify the problems will result in fines, closures and potentially criminal punishment.\nThe local governments of Henan and Yunnan could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe ministry said Henan, home to some of China\'s most smog-prone cities, failed to meet energy efficiency requirements over the 2016 to 2020 period and did not properly shut down obsolete industry.\nHenan\'s Anyang, which ranked as China\'s smoggiest city in 2020, failed to meet a requirement to close 6.6 million tonnes of inefficient coking capacity last year, the ministry said.

The province had failed to tackle issues like energy efficiency, sewage treatment and water pollution, and had not protected a number of major lakes from overdevelopment, the ministry added.\nIt pointed out that the Dianchi Lake had been ""invaded by real estate projects"".

      Crunching up refrigerators, TVs and more: A look at Singapore’s first fully automated recycling plant for home appliances
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: A spent refrigerator inches up a long conveyor belt, into the mouth of a towering machine that starts up with a huge groan.\xa0\nIn a matter of minutes, the refrigerator that weighs almost 100kg folds and bends, gets crushed and is turned to dust. The machine then separates what comes out into foam, plastic and ferrous or non-ferrous metals.\xa0\nThis is Singapore's only fully automated recycling plant for large household appliances, located at Tuas View Square.\xa0\nRun by EWR2, the plant processes used appliances like washing machines\xa0and dryers. The recycling facility also accepts and processes other e-waste like computers, desktops and TV screens.\n“The main components, we recover quite a lot of metals. We have copper, we have aluminium, we also have plastics,” the facility’s managing director Jonson Lai told reporters on Tuesday (Jul 13) during a visit\xa0to the EWR2 facility.\xa0\nHere, about 95 per cent of the materials from large home appliances can be recovered and about 80 per cent can be recycled, he added.\xa0\n\n\nThere were more than\xa020 spent refrigerators sitting in front of the huge machine waiting for their turn with it. Plastic parts that have been stripped from their refrigerator shells sit in large bins next to them.\xa0\nBefore they enter the large home appliance recycling plant, another machine extracts the refrigerant from the end-of-life refrigerators. Workers also use another machine to cut open the refrigerator compressor motors to retrieve the copper coils inside.\xa0\nThe plant started operations in March, and has processed more than 1,000 tonnes of e-waste so far, said Mr Lai. This includes about 500 tonnes of large home appliances.\xa0\n“For incoming goods, like refrigerators, when they come in, some of them are really very dirty and smelly. Some of them even have rotted food inside. So these are things we need to clean up before we can recycle them,” he added.\nSingapore generates more than 60,000 tonnes of e-waste, or electrical and electronic waste, every year, and this is expected to increase, said the National Environment Agency (NEA).\xa0\n\n\nThe agency launched the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for e-waste on Jul 1, making producers responsible for managing the end-of-life disposal of electrical and electronic products they supply to the Singapore market.\xa0\nRegulated products include infocomm technology equipment, large appliances, light bulbs and tubes, batteries and solar photovoltaic panels. \xa0\n“With the recently launched Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for e-waste, regulated products that reach their end-of-life will need to be sent for proper treatment and recycling,” said Senior Minister of State for the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor, who was at the visit.\xa0\n“This will protect the environment and public health from hazardous substances and also ensure that the precious materials, as well as working components within the e-waste, can be recovered and reused.”\xa0\nLarge household appliances like air conditioning units, washing machines and refrigerators are “typically more challenging” to recycle than other types of e-waste, said Dr Khor.\xa0\n“And this is because the recycling process for LHAs (large household appliances) requires highly specialised tools and machinery. And the recovered components are typically of lower value,” she added.\xa0\nOn top of the recycling plant for large household appliances, EWR2 also has a printed circuit board (PCB) processing plant\xa0that can take 300kg of boards at a time.\xa0\nSome appliances like CPUs or computer and LED screens have to be taken apart first by hand because they contain some hazardous materials.\nMost PCBs they receive first go into a component dismantling machine, which uses friction and heat to knock off or melt the separate parts attached to the board.\xa0\nThe parts that drop off are sent to the precious metal recovery plant on the third floor of the facility, and metals like gold, silver and palladium are extracted using acids. There are also wastewater and acid treatment plants to support the precious metal recovery plant.\xa0\nWhat remains of the PCBs is processed in the processing plant, separated into metals and plastic.\xa0\n\n\nThe facility also houses a laboratory and a material testing room, which test the purity of the precious metals recycled in the plant.\xa0\nA manual large household appliance recycling plant would usually need about 10 to 15 people to operate, but since EWR2’s plant is fully automated, it needs only three to four people on site to operate it, said Mr Lai.\xa0\nPre-sorting the appliances still “takes some time”, but he estimates that the fully automated plant only needs 20 to 30 per cent of the man-hours needed by a manual recycling plant.\nWhen the volume of e-waste they receive grows, Mr Lai hopes to expand the facility’s operations.\xa0\n“Presently in Singapore, not many people automate their equipment to do recycling of e-waste, and we’re doing this for household appliances because there is a need to do so, and there is volume,” said Mr Lai.\xa0\n“In Singapore, there are many tonnes of refrigerators that need to be processed. With automation, we can cut short the manpower and increase the volume (that we can process).”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     NEA ']}"

      Public sector sets more sustainability targets with launch of new green movement
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From ramping up solar capacity\xa0to replacing government vehicles with cleaner energy models, the public sector is setting new sustainability targets to meet its goal of peaking carbon emissions around 2025.\nThis will come under its new sustainability movement, GreenGov.SG, which was officially launched on Monday (Jul 12). The initiative is part of the Singapore\xa0Green Plan 2030 that was unveiled in February\xa0to advance the national agenda on sustainable development.\xa0\nThe Green Plan charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years\xa0and is spearheaded by five ministries: The environment,\xa0education, national development, trade and industry,\xa0and transport ministries.\xa0\n\n\nUnder GreenGov.SG, all premises will deploy solar photovoltaics ""where feasible"". The public sector\xa0will increase solar energy deployment to 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2030, which is equivalent to powering more than 260,000 households a year.\xa0\nThis will account for three-quarters of the national solar target of 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment\xa0Grace Fu, who was speaking at a forum to kick off\xa0Climate Action Week 2021.\nTo pave the way for greener transport, all new government cars will have to be cleaner energy models from 2023. By 2035, all government cars will run on cleaner energy.\nTargets have also been set to improve resource efficiency within the sector. By 2030, the public sector aims to cut energy and water use\xa0by 10 per cent from the average of the last three years, said Ms Fu.\nThe sector has also committed to reducing the amount of waste disposed by 30 per cent from 2022 levels.\nAs for buildings, all new and existing public sector buildings will be required to achieve the Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy\xa0standard or equivalent, which is the highest rating under the system that evaluates a building’s environmental impact and performance. All government data centres will have to achieve the Green Mark Platinum standard by 2025, said Ms Fu.\n\n\nThe scope of GreenGov.SG will be expanded to include public sector infrastructure and operations, such as public transport infrastructure and healthcare facilities. This will double the number of premises covered, from 800 to 1,600 facilities, said Ms Fu.\nFor example, the Government is looking to halve the amount of energy used to produce desalinated water and is exploring new technologies in reverse osmosis to improve the production of NEWater.\nIn the defence, a sustainability office will be set up to drive the planning and implementation\xa0of green efforts.\xa0By 2030, the Defence Ministry (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will reduce their carbon emissions growth by two-thirds by doubling their solar adoption in camps and bases, electrifying their administrative vehicle fleet, and trialling green aviation fuels.\n""These targets will apply to the whole spectrum of public sector operations, and ensure that sustainability is embedded at the core of public sector functions,"" said Ms Fu.\n“By integrating sustainability and climate resilience into our policies and programmes, we will engender a shift in our companies and across our economy, as consumers and investors increasingly prioritise low-carbon products and solutions,” she added.\nShe added that the Government will support Singapore companies in the transition, through incentive schemes such as the Energy Efficiency Fund and Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy.\n\n\nA new initiative called the Enterprise Sustainability Programme will also help to support local companies in building capabilities in sustainability and in developing new products and solutions for the green economy.\nUnder GreenGov.Sg, public officers will also be encouraged to contribute actively in the country’s green efforts.\nRegular sharing sessions will be conducted\xa0within the public sector to promote the exchange of ideas, best practices, and the latest technological solutions. This will help to ""inspire and support public officers to champion ground- up initiatives"", said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) in a media release.\nCampaigns will also be organised to raise awareness and encourage public officers to take simple steps to lead a more sustainable lifestyle.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Road trips, battery safety and competing for chargers: 10 electric car queries answered
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Are electric vehicles (EVs) truly better for the environment than petrol cars? Are their batteries safe in a car crash? How much cheaper than a petrol car would it be to power an EV?\nQuestions like these came in after Talking Point recently discussed what the phasing out of internal combustion engines by 2040 will mean for Singapore, and how the electrification of public transport has made a difference to Shenzhen, China.\nCNA Insider compiled a list of what readers wanted to know and sought answers from Electric Vehicle Association of Singapore vice-president Paul Welsford.\nQ\xa0Are EVs more environmentally friendly than petrol vehicles?\nA Yes, they lead to lower emissions over their lifetime, plus they have no roadside emissions and produce less heat and sound for a nice living environment.\nWATCH: Solar-powered electric public transport? Shenzhen’s experiment (3:03)\nThe great thing about EVs is they can be powered by renewables if owners have the option. Conventional cars are stuck with emissions, no matter what.\nCNA Insider: Using data from the United States’ Argonne National Laboratory, Reuters recently analysed how soon a Tesla Model 3, an EV, becomes cleaner than a Toyota Corolla in terms of lifetime carbon footprint: After 13,518 kilometres, if the Tesla is plugged into a grid supplied by hydroelectric power.\nThe Tesla would break even with a Corolla after 126,655 km if it is plugged into a coal-powered grid. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel — it emits more carbon dioxide than natural gas, which generates most of Singapore’s electricity.\n\n\nQ\xa0Do EVs really cost less to drive than petrol cars?\nA Yes.\nCNA Insider: The average car in Singapore travels 17,500 km a year. According to Hyundai distributor Komoco Motors, this means the monthly fuel costs of the Kona 1.6 Turbo, with a fuel efficiency of 100 km per 6.7 litres, would be S$246.\nBy comparison, the monthly charging fees of the Kona Electric, with an efficiency of 100 km per 15 kilowatt-hours, would be about S$120. This means the cost of powering the EV is roughly half that of a petrol car.\nQ\xa0Where are charging points currently located?\nA I recommend downloading the PlugShare app, which has a map of EV charging stations round the world.\nThere are already a number of charging points in Housing and Development Board car parks and for the BlueSG car sharing scheme, some of which are open to the public too.\n\n\nThe Singapore EV Guide 2021 explains the plan to reach 60,000 charging points by 2030. And the government has invited its first tender for 600 charging points, which will be in place at some point next year.\nQ\xa0Will drivers need to fight over a charger?\nA The ratio of EVs to charging points is nearly 1:1 now. In future, we will have to learn to share. We will need some innovative technology to try to make sure that people can charge when they need to charge.\nNot everyone is going to need it every day. EV batteries now have a range of over 300 km, and given the average distance people drive each day, they would be charging every four to six days.\nQ\xa0What if the battery dies in the middle of a road?\nA\xa0You would be in the same position if you ran out of fuel — you would have been given plenty of warning by the vehicle.\nBut if you do run out of battery and suddenly stop, you probably would need somebody to come and help you.\nThere are services coming up that will provide a quick top-up using a mobile battery to give you a bit more range to get to the nearest charging point.\nOr they will be able to tow your car to the location you need to get to, where there will hopefully be a charging point too.\nQ\xa0Can I take road trips to Malaysia, or drive to Johor on a single charge?\nA You can definitely drive to Johor on a single charge. And in Johor Baru, there are fast chargers that can add hundreds of kilometres to your range in 30 to 40 minutes.\nWATCH: Ask an electric car expert: Fuel costs, charging in HDB carpark, driving to Malaysia\xa0(10:02)\nWith vehicles like Hyundai’s Kona Electric, whose long-range version can cover more than 400 km, you could drive to Kuala Lumpur in one go.\nAnyway, you may want to stop and top up a bit, because it is a long drive and you may want to stretch your legs or eat something.\nMalaysia has already started to roll out EV charging. As more chargers get placed along the North-South Expressway, we will definitely be able to make those road trips without any problems.\nQ\xa0What about battery swap stations, which Chinese car-maker Nio has?\nA Battery swapping is cool, but I am still unsure about whether it is the solution. Nio’s service in China is a world leader but also quite unique, and we must think about what is the most practical for people.\nEV batteries are heavy — a Tesla Model 3 battery pack weighs around 480 kilogrammes — and battery swap stations must be large enough to have a bank of fully charged batteries and then to take the batteries that are running out.\nRecharging those batteries before putting them back into vehicles also requires a lot of energy. And not every vehicle’s battery pack is the same; they are made by different companies, so we do not have a standardised industry pack.\nCharging stations are more universal. All the EVs in Singapore use the same type of plug for alternate-current charging, and the majority use the same plug for fast direct-current charging.\nQ\xa0Are batteries safe if the car is involved in a crash?\nA No crash, whether involving an EV or a traditional car, is inherently safe. Any situation where a car, EV or not, may be compromised is dangerous.\nWATCH: Talking Point’s episode 1 in full — Switching to electric car: Is it worth it? (22:20)\nThe good thing is that fire services round the world, including in Singapore, are prepared to handle these types of fires.\nAlso, EV batteries — which take up most of the space at the bottom of the car — are a lot more sophisticated than batteries in other consumer electronics.\nInnovative battery management systems keep the batteries cool and control the amount of power output and input. This is what keeps the EV battery safe. And car-makers are getting better at making these systems even safer.\nQ\xa0In terms of battery replacement, is there a warranty?\nA Most car-makers now provide at least an eight-year warranty on the battery. Some even provide a 10-year warranty — so for the full term of the Certificate of Entitlement, the battery can be replaced under warranty.\nEven the batteries of early-generation EVs have lasted a long time. There are Nissan Leafs that are a decade old in Europe and other countries that are still running. Their range has reduced, but they are working perfectly fine.\nQ\xa0What about potential environmental hazards when batteries are discarded, or the environmental cost of extracting minerals to make batteries?\nA Owing to the size of EV battery packs, they have the potential for a “second life”.\nEven if a battery pack with over 30 kilowatt-hours has lost 15 to 20 per cent of that amount, it is still useful for things like home energy storage and grid-level storage.\n\n\nWhen we start to involve more renewables in Singapore’s energy grid, we may want to store some of the excess solar energy captured during the day in batteries. Instead of making new batteries, we can reuse old EV batteries.\nWATCH: Episode 2 in full — Electric cars: Can vehicles really be zero-emission? (23:43)\nE-waste recycler TES’ factory in Singapore can also recycle lithium-ion batteries. If we can put those raw materials back in new battery packs, then the disposal of batteries may not be something we will see often.\nThe last thing we want is batteries ending up in a landfill or not being disposed of properly.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     transport ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Are you aware of air pollution’s invisible toll on your health?
  </h1>, 'text': 'Toxic substances like fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone form primarily when fossil fuels are burned and enter the atmosphere in the exhaust from motor vehicles,\xa0heating units and smoke from wildfires.\xa0Inhaling such pollutants can cause bodily damage\xa0that lasts for years, if not for life, and may even lead to death.\nAir pollution has long been recognized as a human health hazard, prompting the enactment of the Clean Air Act of 1963.\xa0Under the act, air quality standards are periodically revised by the Environmental Protection Agency. Though these standards are meant to be based on up-to-date research, they are subject to economic and political pressures, sometimes at the expense of public health.\nThose most vulnerable to illness and premature death related to air pollution include children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with pre-existing heart or lung disease. The risk is greatest among people who live in poor neighbourhoods, many of which are close to major roads or near industrial sources of pollution.\nSince 1990, implementation of the amended Clean Air Act has resulted in about a 50 per cent decline in emissions of key air pollutants. Still, new research has shown that this decline is not nearly enough to protect the most vulnerable Americans from the damaging effects of air pollution.\nA 17-year study based on hospital records of more than 63 million older adults has shown that as recently as 2016, as a group they faced serious health risks from breathing levels of pollutants even at pollution levels that are below current national and international guidelines. For example, for each unit increase in long-term exposure to fine particulates in the air (measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter and invisible to the naked eye), 2,536 people were hospitalised with strokes.\nThe report,\xa0published in the journal Circulation, found that years of breathing low concentrations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone “poses a significant risk to cardiovascular and respiratory health among the elderly population of the United States.” Translation: Older people are more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation and pneumonia because of air pollution, resulting in thousands of additional hospital admissions each year.\nA team of 12 scientists, headed by Mahdieh Danesh Yazdi of the Harvard School of Public Health, based this finding on an analysis of air pollution exposure and health outcomes among all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older who were living in the United States between 2000 and 2016.\n“Each unit increase in levels of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone were associated with thousands of additional admissions” to hospitals each year, the team reported. Dr Yazdi, a professor and research fellow in environmental health, said in an interview that “hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved” by improving the quality of the air that Americans breathe.\nWith half the population of the United States routinely exposed to levels of common pollutants shown to be hazardous in the study, the researchers concluded that “this issue should be of great concern to clinicians and policymakers alike.”\nBy making the data on air quality and health outcomes publicly available, Dr Yazdi said, the team hoped to give people “some power” to improve air quality and better protect public health.\n“Both clinicians and patients can be advocates and apply pressure on public officials to control the sources of pollution and improve the air we all breathe,” she said. “Even if air pollution can’t be fully mitigated, we should strive to do better. Levels of pollutants now considered safe can still have harmful effects and result in bad outcomes.”\nThe team also suggested that people pay attention to the air quality where they live and do their best “to avoid harmful exposure over long periods of time.” There was a dramatic example of such avoidance last summer when wildfires burned across the state of California, forcing many people to remain indoors with windows and doors shut to minimize breathing smoke-related pollutants.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, “Larger and more intense wildfires are creating the potential for greater smoke production and chronic exposures in the United States, particularly in the West.”\nBut while such extreme short-lived instances of severe air pollution are readily identified, so-called background levels remain unnoticed and unmonitored by the general public, leaving millions of people susceptible to the insidious damage they can cause. You can get a reasonable estimate of these levels by checking the\xa0Air Quality Index\xa0where you live each day, and avoiding prolonged or heavy exertion outdoors on\xa0days when air quality is poor.\nWorldwide, an international research team reported last year, air pollution “accounts for about 9 million deaths per year,” they\xa0wrote in Frontiers in Public Health. “The health of susceptible and sensitive individuals can be impacted even on low pollution days.”\nParticulate matter contains tiny liquid or solid droplets that are easily inhaled. In addition to damaging the lungs, these microscopic particles can enter the bloodstream and have damaging effects elsewhere in the body, including the brain.\nPeople over 75 in the new study were more likely to be hospitalized than those closer to 65, and whites faced a greater risk of admission than Black individuals from exposure to particulate matter. But exposure to nitrogen dioxide, also a product of burning fossil fuels, was shown to be more harmful to Blacks than to whites.\nFurthermore, for the study population overall, the greatest risk of hospital admissions occurred at lower concentrations of air pollutants, the team reported.\nOther studies have shown that even short-term exposure to low levels of pollutants can be hazardous to people with conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Exposure to air pollution early in life can result in\xa0respiratory, cardiovascular, mental and perinatal disorders, according to the United States Global Change Research Program.\nAir pollution can also have indirect health effects because of its\xa0close link to climate change. Pollutants increase the amount of sunlight that reaches the earth, warming it, and\xa0warmer climates increase the spread and intensity of infectious diseases\xa0that can result in epidemics.\nGiven that most of pollutants we inhale enter the atmosphere from sources like industrial machinery, power plants, combustion engines and cars, efforts to switch from fossil fuels to clean energy sources like wind power and powering vehicles with electric energy instead of gasoline and diesel can have a major impact on air quality.\nBy Jane Brody © The New York Times\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/well/live/air-pollution-health.html\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     environment ']}"

      'Baunya luar biasa': Sukarelawan bertekad untuk membersihkan sungai Indonesia dari popok bekas
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: Ketika Prigi Arisandi naik perahu karet dan menyusuri sungai, dia mencari suatu barang khusus - popok sekali pakai yang kotor.\nPendiri Brigade Evakuasi Popok dan timnya yang terdiri dari sekitar 30 sukarelawan secara berkala melakukan perjalanan di pulau Jawa untuk membersihkan sungai.\n“Popok adalah sampah residu. Tapi kenyataannya, jika kita melihat sungai kita, kita bisa melihatnya mengambang di mana-mana.\n“Ini menjijikkan. Sungai itu sumber air minum, tapi ironisnya kita sering menemukan popok di sungai,” ujarnya.\nIndonesia memproduksi sekitar enam miliar popok setiap tahun, dan provinsi Jawa Timur, tempat tinggal Prigi, memproduksi 15 juta popok setiap hari, katanya.\nPopok sekali pakai diketahui mengandung bahan plastik.\nIndonesia adalah negara penyumbang\xa0sampah plastik ke laut terbesar kedua di dunia setelah Cina.\nSebuah penelitian Bank Dunia yang diterbitkan pada tahun 2018 menunjukkan bahwa 55 persen sampah Indonesia adalah plastik, dan 21 persen adalah popok bekas, kata Prigi.\n“Jadi saya percaya jika kita bisa membersihkan sungai kita dari popok, itu bisa mengurangi sampah kita hingga 21 persen.\n“Ini masalah lokal, tapi berdampak global,” ujarnya.\nPrigi dan timnya memulai dengan Kali Surabaya di Jawa Timur pada Juli 2017.\nSaat itu, beberapa penduduk setempat bahkan secara spontan bergabung dengan mereka.\nSetelah tiga hari, ke 25 orang tersebut membawa popok bekas yang mereka kumpulkan ke kantor walikota Surabaya dan menuntut pemerintah melakukan sesuatu untuk mengatasi masalah tersebut.\n\n\nSejak itu, mereka keliling pulau Jawa, Bali dan bahkan Kalimantan untuk membersihkan sungai dari popok bekas.\nPrigi, yang juga merupakan seorang direktur untuk lembaga swadaya masyarakat lingkungan Ecoton, mengatakan salah satu alasan penting mengapa popok berakhir di sungai adalah karena sistem layanan sampah di Indonesia hanya mencakup 30 hingga 40 persen dari populasi.\n“Artinya 60-70 persen penduduk Indonesia membuang sampah sembarangan, termasuk popok,” ujarnya.\nDalam satu sesi bersih-bersih, kelompok itu bisa mengumpulkan hingga satu ton popok.\nMereka bahkan pernah mengambil enam ton popok dalam dua jam dari sebuah sungai di perbatasan Surabaya dan Sidoarjo.\nBAU KUAT MEMAKSA BEBERAPA UNTUK BERHENTI\nSebelum melakukan aksi bersih-bersih sungai, Brigade Evakuasi Popok biasanya melakukan penelitian mendalam mengenai sungai mana yang dipenuhi sampah popok.\nLalu, mereka mencocokkan temuan mereka dengan citra satelit dan menghubungi kelompok lingkungan di daerah tersebut.\nSaat tim menyisir sungai, mereka selalu mengenakan jas 'hazmat', sepatu bot, masker, dan sarung tangan untuk memastikan keselamatan mereka.\nMereka mengambil popok dengan tongkat panjang dengan capit atau langsung dengan tangan mereka yang sudah dilapisi sarung tangan.\n“Sebenarnya, kotoran bayi kebanyakan tidak menularkan penyakit. Bayi di bawah dua tahun biasanya tidak makan banyak. Jadi kami tidak merasa jijik menangani popok.\n“Tapi masalahnya adalah baunya. Baunya luar biasa, apalagi popok yang baru saja dibuang,” ujarnya.\nBaunya begitu kuat sehingga beberapa sukarelawan mengalami sakit kepala. Beberapa bahkan muntah dan berhenti.\n\n\n“Makanya kami sampaikan kepada beberapa produsen agar membuat SOP (standar operasional prosedur) tentang cara membuang sampah.\n“Yang juga mengejutkan kami adalah, terkadang kami menemukan popok dewasa juga,” katanya.\nEDUKASI MASYARAKAT MERUPAKAN PRIORITAS\nSelain\xa0membersihkan sungai, Brigade Evakuasi Popok juga fokus mengedukasi masyarakat.\nPrigi mengatakan tantangan terbesar adalah mengedukasi masyarakat bagaimana beralih dari popok plastik ke popok kain, atau jika memang harus menggunakan popok plastik, cara membuangnya harus benar.\nDia mengatakan beberapa orang membuang popok bekas ke sungai karena kepercayaan setempat mengatakan bahwa jika bayi sakit, dia akan sembuh jika popoknya dibuang ke sungai.\nBrigade Evakuasi Popok telah mengadakan berbagai seminar tentang konsekuensi membuang popok ke sungai, seperti pencemaran sumber air dan gangguan ekosistem.\nMereka juga membuka toko yang menjual popok kain dan membuat tempat sampah dan titik pembuangan\xa0sampah untuk popok sekali pakai.\nSelain itu, mereka juga membentuk kelompok masyarakat lokal yang terdiri dari ibu-ibu rumah tangga yang mengedukasi tentang bahaya popok karena beberapa popok disebut-sebut mengandung bahan kimia dan dapat membahayakan kesehatan bayi.\nBrigade Evakuasi Popok juga menjelaskan kepada orang-orang bahwa popok kain lebih ekonomis dan sebenarnya jika menggunakan popok selama dua tahun, orang-orang di Indonesia rata-rata akan menghabiskan sekitar 10 juta rupiah yang hampir sama dengan harga sepeda motor.\n“Masyarakat biasanya ingin berubah jika bisa merasakan dampak langsungnya,” kata Prigi yang merupakan pemenang Anugerah Lingkungan Goldman 2011 atas usahanya di Ecoton membersihkan sungai-sungai Surabaya dari limbah industri.\nAnugerah Lingkungan Goldman dikenal sebagai Penghargaan Nobel Hijau.\nMELIBATKAN PEMERINTAH\nSelain konsumen dan produsen popok, pemerintah juga menjadi elemen penting dalam memastikan popok tidak dibuang ke sungai, kata Prigi.\nOleh karena itu, Brigade Evakuasi Popok meminta pihak berwenang di daerah yang mereka kunjungi untuk mengangkut sampah popok yang mereka peroleh setelah aksi bersih sungai mereka.\n\n\nNamun, ada kalanya permohonan mereka diabaikan.\nUntuk menarik perhatian publik, Prigi mengatakan mereka kemudian membuang popok yang mereka kumpulkan ke jalanan.\nOrang-orang menjadi tidak nyaman dan marah, sehingga pihak berwenang terpaksa membersihkan dan mengangkut sampahnya, tambahnya.\nPada 2019, Gubernur Jawa Timur yang baru terpilih Khofifah Indar Parawansa mengatakan bahwa salah satu targetnya dalam 99 hari pertamanya sebagai gubernur adalah membersihkan sungai dari popok.\nIni membanggakan\xa0bagi Brigade Evakuasi Popok, kata Arisandi, meskipun pemerintah provinsi tidak bekerja secara langsung dengan mereka.\nAtas perintah gubernur, kamera televisi sirkuit tertutup (CCTV) dipasang di berbagai jembatan di seluruh provinsi untuk mencegah orang membuang sampah.\nPrigi mengatakan mereka senang mengetahui bahwa kerja keras mereka telah berdampak positif.\n“(Di Indonesia,) 80 persen air minum kita dari air permukaan.\n“Dan popok meracuni sungai kita. Apa yang kita buang itulah yang akan kita konsumsi,” ujarnya.\nDia mengungkap, menurut penelitian mereka di sungai Brantas di Jawa Timur, ikan-ikan tersebut mengonsumsi partikel atau mikroplastik yang mirip dengan yang ditemukan pada popok.\n”Kalau kita mau realistis, ini tugas yang sulit.

      'The smell is extraordinary': Indonesia volunteers aim to free rivers of soiled diapers
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: When Prigi Arisandi gets into an inflatable boat and paddles down a local river, he looks for one specific item - soiled disposable diapers.\xa0\nThe founder of Diaper Evacuation Brigade and his team of about 30 volunteers regularly travels across the Java island to clean up\xa0rivers.\n“Diapers are residual waste. But the fact is, if we look at our rivers, we can see them floating everywhere.\n“It is disgusting. Rivers are a\xa0drinking water source, but ironically we often find diapers in the rivers,” he\xa0said.\nIndonesia produces about six billion pieces of diapers yearly, and East Java province, where Arisandi\xa0is based, produces 15 million pieces daily, he said.\nDisposable diapers are known to contain plastic materials.\nIndonesia is the world’s second-biggest ocean plastic polluter after China.\nA World Bank research published\xa0in 2018\xa0showed that 55 per cent of Indonesia’s waste is plastic. Diapers made up about a fifth of the total waste, said Arisandi.\xa0\n“So I believe if we can clean our rivers of\xa0diapers, it can reduce our waste by 21 per cent.\xa0\n“It is a local problem, but it has a global impact,” he pointed out.\nArisandi and his team began with\xa0the Surabaya River in East Java in July 2017.\xa0To their surprise,\xa0some locals joined them\xa0spontaneously.\n\n\nAfter three days, the group of 25 brought the used diapers\xa0they collected to the office of Surabaya’s mayor and demanded the government\xa0do something about the problem.\nSince then, they have travelled through Java, Bali and even Kalimantan to pick up soiled diapers from the rivers.\xa0\nArisandi, who is a director at environmental non-governmental organisation Ecoton,\xa0said one crucial reason these diapers end\xa0up in the rivers was that Indonesia's waste service system only covered 30 to 40 per cent of the population.\xa0\n“This means that 60 to 70 per cent of Indonesia's population throw their waste carelessly, including diapers,” he said.\nIn one clean-up session, the group could collect up to a tonne of diapers. There was once they retrieved six\xa0tonnes of diapers in two hours from a river at the border of Surabaya and Sidoarjo.\xa0\nSTRONG STENCH FORCED SOME TO QUIT\xa0\nPrior to a clean-up trip, Diaper Evacuation Brigade\xa0usually conducts thorough research on the garbage-filled river. It matches its\xa0findings with satellite images and contacts local environmental groups.\nWhen the group combs the rivers, the team members are always dressed in hazmat suits, boots, masks and gloves to ensure their safety.\nThey pick up the diapers with long\xa0tongs or with their\xa0gloved hands.\xa0\n“Actually, baby poop is mostly not infectious. Babies below\xa0two years old usually don’t eat a lot of food. So we don’t feel that disgusted about handling the diapers.\n“But the problem is the smell. The smell is extraordinary, especially\xa0diapers that have just been discarded,” he noted.\n\n\nThe smell was so strong that some of the volunteers experienced headaches. A few even vomited and quit.\xa0\n“That’s why we have told some producers that they should put an SOP (standard operational procedures) on how to dispose of waste.\n“What also shocks us is, sometimes\xa0we come across\xa0adult diapers too,” he said.\nPUBLIC EDUCATION A PRIORITY\nBesides doing clean-ups, Diaper\xa0Evacuation Brigade\xa0also focuses on educating society.\xa0\nArisandi said the biggest challenge is educating people on how to move away from plastic diapers and use\xa0a cloth nappy, or if they really must use diapers, how to dispose of them correctly.\nHe claimed that some communities discarded\xa0soiled diapers into the rivers because local belief has it that babies\xa0would recover from sickness if their diapers were thrown into the waterways.\xa0\nDiaper Evacuation Brigade\xa0has held numerous seminars about the consequences of throwing diapers into the rivers, such as pollution of water sources and disruption to the ecosystem. It has also opened a shop that sells cloth nappies and set up garbage containers and\xa0dropping points for disposable diapers.\nIt also set up local community groups consisting of housewives who spread awareness about the danger of diapers as some are said to\xa0contain chemicals and could harm a baby’s health.\nBesides, they explain to people that cloth nappies are more economical and that by using diapers regularly, people in Indonesia would on average spend about 10 million rupiah (US$691) in two years which is about the same price as a standard motorbike.\n“People usually want to change if they can feel a direct impact,” said Arisandi, who is the winner of the\xa02011 Goldman Environmental\xa0Prize for his work at Ecoton cleaning\xa0Surabaya's rivers of industrial waste. The Goldman Environmental Prize is commonly known as the Green Nobel Prize.\xa0\n\n\nENGAGING THE GOVERNMENT\nApart from diaper consumers and producers, the government is also a\xa0key element in ensuring that diapers do not get thrown into rivers, Arisandi said.\xa0\nDiaper Evacuation Brigade\xa0would request the local authorities to pick up the diapers after each river clean-up, but he said there have been instances where their pleas were ignored.\xa0\nTo catch public attention, Arisandi said they then threw the diapers they collected onto the streets. People grew uncomfortable and angry, which forced the authorities to show up to clean up the mess, he added.\xa0\nIn 2019, newly-elected East Java Governor Khofifah Indar Parawansa said that one of her targets in her first 99 days as governor was to clean up the diapers in rivers.\xa0\nIt was a big boost to Diaper Evacuation Brigade, Arisandi said, even though the provincial government did not work directly with the group.\xa0\nAt the governor's orders, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras were set up at bridges across the province to deter people from throwing\xa0their garbage.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bArisandi said they were delighted to know they had made an impact.\n“(In Indonesia,)\xa080 per cent of our drinking water is from surface water.\xa0\n“And diapers poison our rivers. What we throw is what we will consume,” he said.\nHe revealed that according to their research on Brantas river in East Java, the fishes consume particles or microplastics which are similar to the ones found in diapers. \xa0\n”If we want to be realistic, this is a difficult task. This is not a priority.\n“It is a small problem, but if we cannot solve this, what about other problems? We don't have to talk about going to Mars if we cannot even solve the problem of baby poop.”\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia here.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     health ']}"

      No extension to advisory period for returning trays; enforcement to start Sep 1: NEA
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From Sep 1, diners who do not return their trays and crockery after their meals will be issued warnings and fines, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) in a statement on Tuesday (Jun 22).\nNEA had announced in May that it would\xa0have a three-month advisory period from Jun 1 to help diners familiarise and adjust with the new rules. During this period, the agency had said that it would not take enforcement action.\nHowever, dining-in at eateries including hawker centres had been barred\xa0due to tightened COVID-19 measures\xa0and was only allowed to resume on Monday.\nDespite this, enforcement of the rules will still be carried out on Sep 1 as planned.\xa0\n\n\nSpeaking to reporters during a visit to North Bridge Road Market & Food Centre, Senior Minister of State of Sustainability and the Environment Dr Amy Khor said authorities will intensify outreach and publicity efforts to raise awareness.\n“We have more than two months of this advisory period left till Sep 1, we think that that should be sufficient to raise awareness and also to get more people to pick up this habit of clearing their tables,” said Dr Khor.\xa0\n“Even when we start enforcement on Sep 1, I think we need to remember that we will still continue to advise diners to return their used trays and crockery and to clear the tables.”\n“It’s only if - on advice - they do not comply, then we may issue them a warning on the first offence and then subsequently, there could be a fine or a court attendance,” she added.\nMORE DINERS RETURNING THEIR TRAYS\nWhen CNA visited 85 Fengshan Market & Food Centre at around noon, most diners cleared their trays after eating. Only a handful of tables had used crockery left behind.\nSG Clean Ambassadors were also spotted patrolling the area, reminding diners to clear their tables after eating.\nAt the tray return racks, cleaners worked in pairs to clear the trays in order to free up space.\nMdm Tan Suey Suey, who works as a cleaner at the hawker centre, told CNA that she had seen a\xa0big improvement in cleanliness.\n“Previously, I would be very busy trying to clear the tables and there would be a lot of crockery all over the place,” she said in Mandarin.\xa0\n“Now, it’s more manageable.”\n\n\nAt 16 Bedok South Market & Food Centre, which has installed automated tray return systems, hawkers and cleaners also observed an uptick in customers cleaning up their tables after eating.\nMs Amy Lee, a stall assistant, estimated that up to 70 per cent of patrons now return their trays, up from around 30 per cent previously.\n“You can see a difference ... People used to leave tissues on the table, along with their used crockery, and this would end up flying all over the place, but now you can see that it’s much cleaner,” she said in Mandarin.\n""There are also fewer birds because there’s no food left on the table,” she added.\nMdm Pu Ai Lian, a cleaner at the hawker centre, said the new rules mean she has more time to do other work.\n“We still have to clean the tables or pick up things from the floor, but it’s less tiring,” she said.\n“There will be others who can’t return their trays like the elderly or those who can’t really walk, so I can help them,” she added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     environment ']}"

      Electric vehicles may be fast and low-maintenance, but are they a real climate solution?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Five years after he became the first owner of a Tesla Model S in Singapore, Joe Nguyen still enjoys his electric ride.\nIt is low-maintenance and cheaper to drive than a petrol car, he said. He spends roughly S$0.06 per kilometre’s drive, compared to about S$0.15 for a typical petrol car. With no carburettor and no transmission because it is single-gear, the car also has fewer moving parts to maintain.\nHe has not needed to change the brakes in five years because of the Model S’ regenerative braking system, he told Talking Point host Steven Chia.\nThe programme takes a glimpse at what a switch to electric vehicles (EVs) will mean for Singapore, which plans to phase out vehicles with internal combustion engines by 2040 to improve public health and fight climate change.\nThere are also lessons to be learned from China, which has made greater strides in low-carbon transport.\nCHARGING, FAST AND SLOW\nAs at May 31, there were 1,485 electric cars and 616 plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars in Singapore. And for drivers, the biggest difference when they switch to EVs is the need to charge their vehicles.\nThe Government aims to have 60,000 EV charging points by 2030, of which 40,000 will be in public car parks and 20,000 on private premises — up from 1,800 charging points in the country at the end of last year.\n\n\nThis will enable it to cease new diesel car and taxi registrations from 2025 and require all new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner-energy models from 2030.\nWATCH: Electric car vs petrol car: Costs, performance, emissions and range (3:57)\nGoing by this goal, EV chargers will be deployed in most, if not all, car parks over the next decade, said EV Association of Singapore’s vice-president Paul Welsford.\nThere will be charging points that offer quick top-ups — what he calls opportunity charging — as well as slower top-ups at places like homes or workplaces where cars remain for hours at a stretch. He calls the latter destination charging.\nFast chargers can now be found at selected Shell stations and take 40 to 50 minutes to juice up a car like Hyundai’s Kona Electric from zero to 80 per cent.\nAccording to Welsford, these rapid chargers are often powered to around 50 kilowatts. Chargers rated up to 350 kW exist in some countries, so there is the potential for higher charging speeds in future — from zero to 80 per cent in 20 to 25 minutes and possibly quicker, he cited.\nRapid direct-current charging is, however, more expensive than slower alternate-current charging. It can cost 10 times more in some cases, he said.\nBut compared to their predecessors, today’s EVs can run farther before needing a recharge. Chia, who drove about 100 km in the Kona Electric using less than half the battery, found that there was “no real need for range anxiety”.\nIn China’s Shenzhen, where all public buses and taxis are electric, a fully charged bus can cover up to 300 km — more than enough for a day’s work, said Shenzhen Bus Group’s head of international development, Hallie Liao.\nCan the batteries be charged excessively, however, and do they carry a higher risk of catching fire than fossil fuel vehicles?\nNo, they cannot take more energy than they can store. Welsford said EV batteries have sophisticated battery management systems that communicate with EV chargers to make sure that only the required energy is provided to the car.\n“That said, there are best practices when it comes to charging, especially with rapid direct-current charging, where it’s usually best to not charge above 80 per cent as this will help the battery maintain its range better,” he said.\nAdvances in battery technology are helping to reduce the effects of rapid direct-current charging, he added.\nThere is currently no evidence indicating that EVs are a higher fire risk, he noted. But it is difficult to make a comparison with fossil fuel cars, mainly owing to a lack of data; EVs represent a small percentage of vehicles globally.\nWhile incidents of EV fires generate more attention, said Welsford, “safety is a core part of EV and battery manufacturers who are always looking to improve their technology — and the battery management systems are there to maintain temperatures and reduce the risks”.\nThe lithium battery is, however, the most expensive component of an electric car, and EV production volumes are a fraction of petrol vehicles’, said Ong Lay Ling, group managing director of car distributor Eurokars Group. “As a result, they’ve yet to achieve economies of scale.”\nSo EVs cost more than petrol cars. But with the various incentives and rebates in Singapore, prices can be similar.\nFor instance, the MG HS, a petrol sport utility vehicle, costs S$130,000 with a Certificate of Entitlement. The MG ZS electric vehicle costs S$129,000 — after factoring in a S$20,000 EV Early Adoption Incentive and a S$25,000 rebate under the Vehicular Emissions Scheme.\n\n\nChia was pleased to know that EVs are also fast and deliver instant torque. In contrast, vehicles with internal combustion engines take time to reach maximum torque, which means they take longer to accelerate.\nWhen he and motoring journalist Sheldon Trollope raced the Kona Electric and the Hyundai Venue, a petrol car, to see which could go from zero to 60 km per hour faster, the Kona Electric won easily.\nThe latter has 395 Newton-metre of torque while the Venue has about 150 Newton-metre.\n“Even if you had a petrol car with the same amount of torque, (the Kona Electric) would have an advantage because it’d (reach) that maximum torque immediately, whereas the petrol car has to build up the (revolutions per minute) and get to that point,” said Trollope.\nELECTRIC VEHICLES'\xa0CLIMATE CREDENTIALS\nChia was disappointed to know, however, that the absence of tailpipe emissions did not mean EVs are zero-emission. This is because Singapore generates most of its electricity from natural gas, a fossil fuel that emits carbon when burnt.\nWATCH: Episode 1 in full — Switching to electric car: Is it worth it? (22:20)\nWhile natural gas burns more cleanly than coal, drilling and the extraction of the gas causes methane, a heat-trapping gas, to leak into the atmosphere.\nNonetheless, EVs are important in curbing global warming. Recent studies have found that they emit less carbon than fossil fuel cars in their lifetime — more so in countries that generate most of their electricity from renewable energy. They also help reduce choking air pollution, which kills people prematurely.\nIn Shenzhen, 70 per cent of electricity is from clean sources such as solar and wind, said Liao, whose company generates some of its own power from on-site solar panels.\nIn one depot, for example, the energy from panels installed there is enough to power six taxis a day. The energy is stored in a battery system fashioned from used bus batteries, allowing taxis to be charged day or night.\nWATCH: Solar-powered electric public transport? Shenzhen’s experiment (3:03)\nShenzhen, a city with 12.5 million residents, is also home to BYD, one of the world’s biggest EV makers.\nAs cities worldwide switch to electric mobility, however, environmentalists have warned of an impending flood of e-waste and the need to recycle disused lithium-ion batteries.\nAccording to advocacy group Greenpeace East Asia’s detox campaigner Zheng Mingyang, more than 12 million tonnes of the world’s EV batteries will be retired by 2030. In China, this figure will hit seven million tonnes over the decade, he said.\nIn Singapore, e-waste recycler TES has a facility that is also able to extract EV batteries.\nThree minerals — lithium, cobalt and graphite — are extracted in TES’ recycling process, said group chief financial officer Diana Ong. They can be used to make new batteries, reducing the need to mine new minerals.\n“Our research and development folks are working very hard in terms of tweaking the mechanical and chemical process to … cope with the recycling of EV batteries,” she said. “So in time to come, we’ll … cope with the volume.”\nTo reduce the carbon footprint of its recycling process, TES has rooftop solar panels connected to its energy storage system, she added.\nIt is still early days for Singapore’s low-carbon mobility push, but for Chia, it is clear the task is not simple.\n“What’s been most eye-opening to me in the search for low-emission transportation is that it doesn’t just start and end with the vehicle,” he said.\nWATCH: Episode 2 in full — Electric cars: Can vehicles really be zero-emission? (23:43)\n“It’s crucial to also think about what produces the fuel for the vehicles, be that electricity or hydrogen, and what happens to their parts when they’re no longer in use,”\xa0he noted.\n“The last thing we want is for our greener transport solutions to become the next climate problem.”\nWatch these two episodes of Talking Point here and here.

      Don't feel hungry when it’s hot? Some animals in Australia are starving as climate change drives up temperatures
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Animals are suffering and starving despite having ample amounts of food as climate change drives up temperatures and exacerbates heatwave events, according to new research.\xa0\nA study focused on marsupials by researchers at the Australian National University found that wild animals eat less when they are hot, which can be fatal in certain sensitive and vulnerable species.\xa0\nDigesting and metabolising food creates energy and raises body temperature, so small increases in temperature can trigger some animals with sensitive diets to lose their appetites, just like it can in humans.\xa0\n“If it’s really hot outside, we don’t feel like eating a big meal. Animals feel the same way,” lead author Dr Kara Youngentob told CNA.\n“The scary part is heat alone - and heat we’re already seeing with climate change is making hotter nights - is enough to put these animals off their food,” she said.\n\n\nThe research, published last month in Trends in Ecology & Evolution, looked closely at nocturnal Australian marsupials, including greater gliders, whose populations have been shrinking, even in environments unexposed to normal threats like bushfires and logging.\nDespite these animals being active during the cooler hours at night, and primarily sheltering during the heat of the day, they were still highly exposed to temperatures that their bodies struggle to adapt to.\n“Some animals have more leeway and capacity to deal with temperature changes. Other animals will already be at the limit of what they can deal with,” Dr Youngentob said.\n“Greater gliders have a single point threshold of 20 degrees Celsius. Nighttime temperatures are exceeding thresholds and impacting their ability to eat enough food to get enough nutrition to stay alive.\n“It shocked us because we didn’t expect to see a climate change problem in animals that didn’t experience the extremes of daytime temperatures. It wasn’t on our radar and realising that even they are vulnerable to climate change was really a wake-up call,” she added.\nMarsupials rely on eating eucalyptus leaves, which are very low in nutrition and provide minimal energy, meaning the animals are unable to build up fat stores. They also get all their water from the leaves that they eat.\xa0\n“Fasting more than one night could be fatal and even reducing their food night after night, if there was a heatwave, could cause them to not meet their minimum nitrogen balance or they could dehydrate from not having enough water.”\nDr Youngentob said this type of research looking at climate change heat impacts on wild animals has been widely overlooked by the scientific research community, despite heat impacts being well understood in agriculture.\xa0\nShe said the findings could be relevant to a whole range of different animals and birds in different parts of the world, including Asia.\nThose at risk, she explained, are mainly small plant-eating animals with low energy stores,\xa0narrow diets and restricted times of the day for feeding.\n\n\nWhile the more extreme impacts include mass die-offs during heat waves or individual mortalities, longer term effects include lower survival rates for offspring, missed reproductive cycles with reduced offspring numbers and, over time, greater population susceptibility to other threats.\n“When I first saw this happening, I was sad about it because I didn’t see a solution, and still the solutions are tenuous. It’s overwhelming. I was thinking these animals were gone,” she said.\nBut there are possible solutions, she said, including trying to maximise coolness in forests, avoiding monocultures and conserving and restoring landscapes with the best quality of food for these animals.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     animals ', '     environment ', '     Australia ']}"

      OBS to 'carefully plan' construction of new Coney Island campus to minimise environmental impact
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Construction work\xa0for a new Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) campus on Coney Island will be “carefully planned” to “minimise adverse impact” to the island\'s flora and fauna, said Outbound Bound Singapore (OBS) on Tuesday (Jun 8).\xa0\n“In line with our Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan (EMMP) during construction, we will also work with NParks (National Parks Board) on the careful handling of wildlife found within our developmental site, and the transplanting and re-planting of flora,” said a spokesperson.\nOBS announced on Friday in a Facebook post that it had begun construction of a new campus on Coney Island as part of a “necessary expansion” of its campuses.\nFacebook users left comments on the post\xa0expressing\xa0concern over possible destruction of the local flora and fauna, with several questioning the need for a new OBS campus.\nIn response to CNA’s queries, OBS said on Tuesday that the new campus was part of the Government’s efforts to expand outdoor adventure education for all students through the National Outdoor Adventure Education Masterplan announced during Budget 2016.\nOBS@Coney will be “instrumental” in developing “social cohesion, ruggedness and resilience” among youth in Singapore, said a spokesperson.\nOBS noted that the area used for OBS@Coney is on reclaimed land zoned for sports and recreation. Its location is close to the Pulau Ubin campus and connected to mainland Singapore, providing greater access to training areas and more flexibility to use expanded areas on mainland Singapore.\n“As OBS embarks on the development of OBS@Coney, we strive to minimise environmental impact while maintaining the quality and safety of our programmes.\n“OBS has been working closely in consultation with the National Parks Board (NParks), nature groups\xa0and various stakeholders to incorporate their feedback and suggestions for the development of OBS@Coney,” said the spokesperson.\nOBS said on its website that the Coney Island campus will occupy about 10 per cent of the island and will feature “new advanced obstacle courses”, with the aim of catering to a “larger profile of participants”.\xa0\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY\nAccording to OBS, an environmental impact study completed in 2018 looked into minimising the environmental impact of OBS@Coney.\nRecommendations and insights from the study were incorporated into the design of the campus, which will integrate nature and include eco-friendly features such as rainwater harvesting to reduce potable water usage.\nIt will also optimise natural ventilation to reduce reliance on air-conditioning, said the spokesperson, adding that OBS had consulted nature groups on introducing greenery into the campus to enhance biodiversity.\nIn addition, OBS has\xa0invited members of the public to provide feedback on environmental sustainability in OBS programmes or environmental mitigating measures for the construction of OBS@Coney.\nDEVELOPMENT HAS ""POSITIVE ASPECTS"": ACRES\nCNA reached out to the Animal Concerns Research & Education Society (ACRES), which was one of the nature groups consulted for the campus.\nCEO Anbarasi Boopal told CNA that ACRES observed “positive aspects” in the OBS development, including\xa0creating new habitats for animals, promoting coexistence through education programmes in the long run and incorporating natural design elements.\nThe local wildlife group was consulted once in early May for its thoughts on the developments, recommendations and mitigation measures from the environmental impact study. ACRES was also asked for its opinion on the ecological principles behind the design and operations of the facility.\nThe group shared feedback on the design, construction and operations of the campus, said Ms Anbarasi.\nOn the design front, ACRES recommended that there should be no food provision for wildlife - directly or indirectly - around the premises.\nIt also requested that the wild pigs on the island not be removed or culled while clearing the land.\n“We also shared concerns on more clarity on wildlife management measures on site during the clearing, offered to conduct briefing for on-site personnel for heightened awareness on wildlife encounters and other aspects such as wildlife-friendly construction measures,” said Ms Anbarasi.\nWildlife-friendly construction measures could include the use of erosion blankets that do not trap small burrowing snakes.\n\n\nAs the design elements would create new habitats that could attract wildlife such as bats and civets, ACRES urged OBS to “strongly incorporate” coexistence into its site management measures when the campus is operating, said Ms Anbarasi.\nShe added that wildlife, such as bees, sighted on campus should not be treated or managed as pests. Any native wildlife that has to be removed from the building must be released within the island and not relocated unless the assessment calls for it.\nThe organisation pointed out as well that the campus could be used by animals as a connecting site to cross over.\n“Clearing forests will undoubtedly affect wildlife in any site and loss of greenery, whose land use is already designated on the master plan.\xa0\n“However, certain measures such as preserving trees of a certain width, restricting night time activities to allow natural behaviour of nocturnal animals and\xa0stricter measures on site with animal sightings ...\xa0will help minimise the impact,” said Ms Anbarasi.\n“Additionally, we observed that the site development includes creating terrestrial and aquatic habitats, green buffers, other nature-friendly practices such as reusing the certain trees for the development itself and water treatment facility on-site.\xa0\n“We appreciate that the design itself has quite a few sustainability measures in place and encourages wildlife to enter. We do hope that these measures are adhered to\xa0and are adopted by more development sites in Singapore.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Outward Bound Singapore ', '     environment ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Many Singaporeans are probably aware that food waste is a problem, but what may surprise many is that not all of it comes from leftovers.\nA large chunk of the food waste occurs before it ever reaches the consumer.\nThis can be food that is rejected due to quality control, or discarded because it is too near the expiry date.\nFor Travin Singh, this represented a huge waste of potential.\nMr Singh is the founder and CEO of CRUST Group, which started out as a brewing company but has now evolved into a food tech company that looks for solutions revolving around surplus food.\nMr Singh first learnt how to brew beers at home with the help of YouTube.\n""I tried a couple of ventures at home, you know, failed quite miserably. All my friends didn’t like it. Even I didn’t like it,"" he said.\n\n\n\n\nMuch research and experiments later, Mr Singh\'s confidence grew.\nCRUST later tied up with Tiong Bahru\xa0Bakery, taking their surplus baguettes and turning them into beer. The result - Beerguette.\n""They were actually the first B2B company that we did a beer for,"" said Mr Singh.\nCRUST\'s beers are priced between S$6 and $8.50 a bottle, which is comparable to other local craft beers.\nBut bread is not the only by-product CRUST uses.\nThe company has also used rice, tea, coffee, fruits and vegetables, and have also expanded into the Japanese market with a beer made with surplus rice and bread.\nIn addition to alcoholic drinks under the CRUST brand, Mr Singh also sells non-alcoholic beverages under the CROP label.\n‘We are constantly doing R&D on different kinds of wastage just to see what we can convert it into,"" said Mr Singh.\nWe want to expand our portfolio into the food side and eventually packaging. We want to do a lot more but one step at a time ... We are quite adamant about proving that there are better ways to do things,"" he added.\n\n\n\nCRUST keeps costs down by doing away with a physical store, and tapping existing breweries to brew their beverages.\nFor back-end research and technical facilities, they collaborated with the Bright Science Hub facility, which was set up by Dutch health and nutrition company DSM.\nMr Anand Sundaresan, vice president, human nutrition and health at DSM, said: “If you think of startups, there’s a lot of effort that also needs to go in in terms of collaborating with them, whether it’s prototype development, idea generation, proof-of-concepts scaleup, testing, regulatory support, and commercialisation. The innovation hub can play a role in helping to incubate as well as to develop a wide host of technologies working with startups and with the small- and medium-sized enterprises.”\nDSM said startups like CRUST are key to tackling the world’s food waste problem.\n“Food waste is an unseen and hidden problem because we really don’t realise the amount of food which gets wasted and thrown in landfills. And that has a big social economic impact – not just in terms of greenhouses gases that go into production and distribution. Then when the food waste gets put into a landfill, that leads to the creation of methane which is 21 times more potent in terms of greenhouse emissions than carbon dioxide.”\n\n\n\nStakeholders say that startups play a key role, as Singapore aims for its 30 by 30 goal – the target of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.\nSingapore can also position itself as a sustainable technology hub in the Asia Pacific.\nWith the Asia-Pacific region poised to be one of the main drivers of world growth, billions of people have a stake in making that growth sustainable.\nAs for green tech entrepreneurs like Mr Singh, he is hoping that his brewing solutions can help to reduce global food waste by 1 per cent by 2030.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     environment ']}"

      Filipino scientist takes first ever journey to third deepest ocean trench on Earth, finds plastic
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: When Dr Deo Florence Onda found himself more than 10,000m\xa0below the surface, in the third deepest trench on the planet, he was on the lookout for mysteries hidden in the darkness.\nThe Emden Deep, part of the Philippine Trench, is one of Earth’s final frontiers, an unexplored section of one of the oldest seabeds in the world. Until just a couple of months ago, no human had ever been there.\nThe 33-year-old microbial oceanologist from the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute considers himself “very adventurous” - despite being from\xa0the tropics,\xa0he completed his doctoral\xa0studies on the North Pole. But this was something entirely different.\nDeep-sea adventures are rare and complex, making them akin to venturing into outer space.\n“The feeling itself, no one can prepare for it. You don’t know what to expect. It was really the mental preparation, being in a small submersible without freaking out while you’re diving and saying goodbye to the world,” he recounted.\nOver a 12-hour period in March, Onda and American explorer Victor Vescovo from Caladan Oceanic, a private organisation dedicated to advancing undersea technology, descended and explored the trench, hoping for just a glimpse of life below.\xa0\n“If you look at the Philippine Trench, the first description was in the 1950s and then the more detailed one was in the 1970s. The technology then was not that good yet, or accurate. It was an opportunity for us to see what’s happening down there, which has never been seen before,” Onda said.\n\n\n“When we were about to reach the bottom I was expecting to see scary, crawling things sneaking in or peeking into the windows.”\nInstead, what greeted them in the depths was something far more familiar - something that had also travelled from above the surface.\xa0\n“There was one funny scene when we were exploring the area. There was one white material floating around. I was saying ‘Victor, that’s a jellyfish’. We went there and approached and it was just plastic.\n“The only unusual thing there was the garbage. There was a lot of garbage in the trench. There were a lot of plastics, a pair of pants, a shirt, a teddy bear, packaging and a lot of plastic bags. Even me, I did not expect that, and I do research on plastics,” he said.\n“Seeing it for the first time was a privilege as a human being, representing 106 million Filipinos and billions of people of the world. But being a witness to the extent of pollution, and being a witness to the gravity of the plastics problem from the surface to the bottom of the ocean, is another thing.\n“It becomes my responsibility to tell people that their garbage doesn't stay where they put it. It goes somewhere else and it will sink.”\nWhat was originally planned to be a scientific research mission had to be changed to a purely record-setting trip, due to the COVID pandemic and bureaucratic difficulties in securing permission for further deepwater study.\nStill, he said this endeavour gave him fascinating insights and a platform to detail the issues facing the deep-sea environment, an area that is difficult to research in the Philippines due to logistics and costs.\n\n\nOnda’s main research focus is on the life cycle and role of microorganisms, such as phytoplankton, which help produce oxygen and are among the main drivers of energy and biomass build-up in the marine ecosystem.\nThe discovery of plastic in the trench was shocking for Onda, who is concerned that the transboundary nature of plastic spread in the oceans is having unknown but profound consequences on marine ecosystems, and in effect, on the very foundations of life on the planet.\n“Microorganisms are the main drivers of carbon storage, which then drives climate change. When phytoplankton consume\xa0carbon, taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, they convert it into particulate organic matter that sinks to the bottom of the ocean and gets stored for millions of years,” he said.\n“We actually do not know the extent of biodiversity in these deep-sea environments. We do not know yet the full extent of their roles in terms of biogeochemical processes, how they regulate the weather and the climate. But we are already changing it. I don’t see it stopping soon.”\nStudies show that the deeper layers of the ocean are warming at a slower pace than the surface. Yet for wildlife and organisms in these environments, exposure to climate warming may be more severe and pose greater risks.\nMeantime, how trash reaches the most remote depths, through various different water densities and great distances, still requires more research. But it is proof that the ocean is a continuum where impacts know no boundaries.\nWhile Onda wishes he could have learnt more from his journey, he admits it was still an unparalleled chance to promote Philippine science and deepen his own understanding of the region.\n“As an oceanographer and professor myself, most of the things I teach in the books were made by western scholars. But seeing it myself was like a fairytale ... each and every page of my oceanography book coming into reality,” he said.\n“I was seeing how light dissipates with depth. I was seeing how pressure increases which then decreases temperatures and all of these physics and chemistry and biology of oceanography coming into reality. It was a fantasy for me.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Philippines ', '     climate change ']}"

      Commentary: Could hydrogen be our solution to climate change?
  </h1>, 'text': 'WALTHAM, Massachusetts: Tehran, 1943: Joseph Stalin, Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill – hosted by the young Shah Reza Pahlavi – agree on plans for the two-front attack on Hitler while sketching out the east-west division of Europe.\xa0\nHolding the meeting in Iran, with separate consultations with the shah, was no mistake. Gulf oil was a critical resource to the Allied war effort. Oil has flowed under the surface of political conflicts ever since.\nFast forward to today, and political antagonists and energy players are again forging a messy path forward, this time focused on long-term energy transitions as disparate countries try to slow and eventually stop climate change.\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement was a groundbreaking diplomatic effort – 196 countries committed to prevent average temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius, with an aim of less than 1.5 degrees Celcius.\xa0\n\n\nTo meet that goal, scientists argue that fossil fuel use will have to reach net zero emissions by mid-century.\nThe genius of the Paris climate accord was getting all the major parties to agree – particularly major greenhouse gas emitters including Russia, China, India, Brazil and members of OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nNow, the challenge is implementing the multiplicity of solutions needed to bend the global warming curve.\xa0\nThe Paris Agreement is not a treaty – countries set their own targets and determine their own strategies for meeting them. Each signatory has its own politics, economic structure, energy resources and climate exposure.\n\n\nThe commitments from countries are still falling short as President Joe Biden hosted\xa0a virtual climate summit with international leaders on Earth Day, Apr\xa022, and carried\xa0out the hard diplomatic work with Russia, China and other countries to develop implementable solutions.\nAs an energy economist, I am familiar with countries’ evolving responses to climate change and companies’ shifting investments and different visions of the future. One technology attracting attention from groups on all sides is hydrogen.\nDIFFERENT VISIONS OF ENERGY’S FUTURE\nAs the world’s population and economies grow, energy demand is expected to increase by as much as 50 per cent over the next 30 years, so making the right long-term investments is crucial.\nEnergy companies and policymakers have widely different visions of that future. Their long-term scenarios show that most expect fossil fuel demand to remain steady for decades and possibly decline. However, many are also increasing their investments in cleaner technologies.\nThe International Energy Agency – which countries often look to for future scenarios, but which has a history of underestimating demand and clean energy – forecasts that renewable energy will meet about one-third of the global energy demand by 2040 in its most optimistic scenario.\xa0\nThat would be in a world with higher carbon taxes and more wind power, solar power, electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage. Greener technologies may come close to keeping warming under\xa0 degrees Celcius, but not quite.\nFOSSIL FUEL REMAINS\nExxon, on the other hand, forecasts a path dependent on a fossil fuel-based economy, with slower transitions to electric vehicles, steady demand for oil and gas, and a warmer world.\xa0\nExxon is also investing in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, but it believes oil and gas will provide half the global energy supply in 2040 and renewable energy will be less than one-fifth.\nOPEC, whose members are among the most exposed to climate change and dependent upon oil and gas, also sees oil and gas dominating in the future.\xa0\nNonetheless, several Gulf nations are also investing heavily in alternative technologies – including nuclear, solar, wind and hydrogen – and trying to transition away from oil.\nBP proposes a more focused shift toward cleaner energy. Its “rapid scenario” forecasts flat energy demand and a more dramatic swing to renewables combined with a growing hydrogen economy.\xa0\nThe company expects its own renewable energy to go from 2.5 gigawatts (GW) in 2019 to 50 GW by 2030, and its oil production to fall by 40 per cent.\n\n\nOthers are also exploring hydrogen’s potential. Much as with utilities’ shift from coal to natural gas, hydrogen may ease the transition to cleaner energy with enough investment.\nSince this fuel is getting so much industry attention, let’s look more closely at its potential.\nHYDROGEN AS A CLIMATE SOLUTION\nHydrogen has the potential to fuel cars, buses and airplanes, heat buildings and serve as a base energy source to balance wind and solar power in our grids.\xa0\nGermany sees it as a potential substitute for hard-coal coke in making steel. It also offers energy companies a future market using processes they know. It can be liquefied, stored, and transported through existing pipelines and LNG ships, with some modifications.\nSo far, however, hydrogen is not widely used as a clean-energy solution.\xa0\nFirst, it requires a upfront investment – including carbon capture capacity, pipeline modifications, industrial boilers for heat rather than gas, and fuel cells for transportation – plus policies that support the transition.\nSecond, for hydrogen to be “green,” the electricity grid has to have zero emissions.\n\n\nMost of today’s hydrogen is made from natural gas and is known as “grey hydrogen.”\xa0\nIt is produced using high-temperature steam to split hydrogen from carbon atoms into methane. Unless the separated carbon dioxide is stored or used, grey hydrogen results in the same amount of climate-warming CO2 as natural gas.\n“Blue hydrogen” uses the same process but captures the carbon dioxide and stores it so only around 10 per cent of the CO2 is released into the atmosphere.\xa0\n“Green hydrogen” is produced using renewable electricity and electrolysis, but it is twice as expensive as blue and dependent on the cost of electricity and available water.\nNATURAL GAS IN THE MIX\nMany electric utilities and energy companies, including Shell, BP and Saudi Aramco, are actively exploring a transition to a hydrogen-mixed economy, with a focus on blue hydrogen as an interim step.\xa0\nEurope, with its dependence on imported natural gas and higher electricity costs, is setting ambitious net-zero energy targets that will incorporate a mix of blue and green hydrogen coupled with wind, solar, nuclear and an integrated energy grid.\nChina, the world’s largest energy user and greenhouse gas emitter, is instead investing heavily in natural gas – which has about half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal – along with carbon capture and storage and a growing mix of solar and wind power.\xa0\nRussia, the second-largest natural gas producer after the US, is expanding its gas production and exports to Asia. Some of that gas may end up as blue hydrogen.\nRamping up blue and green hydrogen as clean-energy solutions will require substantial investments and long-term modifications to energy infrastructure.\xa0\n\n\nIn my view, it is not the magic bullet, but it may be an important step.\nOf course, technology investments cannot assume away the messy politics of the world. People and leaders around the globe still have differing views on the urgency of the climate crisis and need for greener energy investments.\nPerhaps the leaders gathered will find some common ground as seas rise and temperatures break records. What is critical for meeting the Paris goals is that countries invest now in a cleaner future.\nJohn W Ballantine, Jr, Professor of International Business at Brandeis University, is a specialist in energy/climate change, corporate finance, and political economy.

      Locals fear water conflict as new industrial boom arrives along Thailand’s eastern seaboard
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: As Thailand embarks on an ambitious industrialisation drive\xa0along its eastern seaboard, local communities and conservationists fear a brewing war over water.\nThe Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) Development Plan is a long-term public project aiming to accelerate development in eastern\xa0Thailand, namely three provinces - Rayong, Chonburi and Chachoengsao.\xa0\nIt is attracting global investors in priority sectors to power a national strategy - Thailand 4.0. The types of industries being targeted include next-generation automotive, biotechnologies, AI, robotics, automation and aerospace from countries like Japan, Singapore and China.\n“Thailand has identified key projects and key elements that will take Thailand forward and get Thailand out of the middle income trap. To do that, Thailand knows that what we need is technology,” said Luxmon Attapich, the deputy secretary-general of investment and international affairs at EEC.\nAt the same time, the development plan is raising community worries and stirring conflict. Central to those concerns is the availability of water.\xa0\nThe landscape in\xa0the EEC area is shifting fast already. From farms to factories, what has long been agricultural land is transitioning to accommodate new industry. Huge swathes of land - 48,000 ha\xa0in total - have been re-zoned to allow such changes to occur.\xa0\nLocal communities and small-scale farmers fear the changes they are viewing with their own eyes. New, ever-widening roads plunging through the heart of their provinces, factories replacing fields and the movement of masses of water into reservoirs that are not for them.\nThe realities of climate change are hanging\xa0over this region; devastating droughts in recent years took a heavy toll on eastern Thailand’s water resources and plunged local farmers into\xa0desperation. Flooding is a regular threat too and saltwater intrusion into rivers and along the coastline is worsening.\xa0\nAs a result, the allocation of precious water resources, which must be shared among various stakeholders including new and existing industry, large and small agriculture, and cities and villages has become a flashpoint.\nThe EEC blueprint includes plans for multiple new industrial cities and parks, the expansion of an international airport and ports, new railway infrastructure, urban expansion and a medical hub. All of them will need access to a finite amount of water.\xa0\n“Even before the EEC, there was a troublesome lack of water in the eastern seaboard area,” said Somnuck Jongmeewasin, a conservationist and research director at EEC Watch, a group studying the impacts of the project.\n“In my local community, there’s a lack of water. If we want water, we have to buy and it’s very expensive,” he said.\n“The industrial sector can get the water because they have money. This is the inequality. How to live together peacefully? There is no way. The conflict is still there.”\nAs well as ongoing legal action against the project, Somnuck predicts that locals will start to escalate their opposition to the EEC through protest or by blocking access to key areas of development or infrastructure, if the government does not take measures to ensure fairness and sustainability.\xa0\n“It’s feasible. (But) if the government does not do as per my suggestions, I think we could not survive and we will see people blocking water, people blocking land, blocking the seashore and you cannot develop anything,” he said.\xa0\n“It will be the next civil war for the EEC area.”\n\n\nGIVING UP ON THE LAND\nIn parts of Chachoengsao, shrimp farms dot the land close to the Bang Pakong river. Each needs a steady supply of fresh water for the ponds where the shrimps grow and are harvested. They rely on canals that draw water from the main river.\xa0\nIt is a water-intensive industry, and the operations of local farmers are now at risk. Due to a lack of water resources, which are increasingly salty, many have switched to an alternative crop, or are on the brink of walking away from their farms.\nOne of Chamlong Horracharttrakul’s two ponds is now bone dry, its mud surface cracking in the sun. “All the canals are dried up. The weather is very hot as well,” he said.\xa0\n“In the dry season, I can only do one pond at a time now because I need another pond to keep water. It’s been like this over the past four or five years.\n“Frankly speaking, if I didn’t own these ponds, I would have given up already.”\nNearby, Boonserm Charoenrattana-opas has been maintaining his shrimp operation for 25 years. His output is already low due to salinity and rising water temperatures, which cause disease in his produce, and he worries about the impacts of more industry setting up around him, especially upriver.\n“If wastewater is released into the river, negative impacts will definitely happen. The water system cannot be used and this will be a problem. The chance of keeping shrimps sustainably will be gone,” he said.\n“I am just a small villager. I cannot compete against a big investment group. This is the problem.”\n\n\nFurther south in Chonburi, Threelathagorn Phanusamporn, a local pig farmer and community activist, is trying to empower locals on water management issues.\xa0\n“The main issue in this area is water. We are short of water for consumption and water for agriculture. Villagers cannot quite produce enough to reach their target. There used to be paddy rice crops but they don’t have them now,” she said.\nA small, central reservoir available to residents is close to empty and benefits from a large nearby dam do not reach them. Threelathagorn says there is a mistrust of authorities and a feeling that “poor and struggling villagers” are being left behind.\nIt is a feeling reflected in Rayong province, where fisherman and fruit grower\xa0Manu Darat says local communities like his have never been consulted about the EEC\'s development, nor how water allocation\xa0might change.""We just saw them putting water pipes here and there,"" he said.\xa0""Let’s face it, the water demand from the industrial sector increases more and more. I don’t know if they\'re taking\xa0water from us for sure, but no one has told us anything.""\nMOVING WATER AROUND THE COUNTRY\nIt is evident\xa0that the management of massive water storage areas is crucial both to the EEC’s success, and the lives of millions on the eastern seaboard.\n“The problem is not really big but the problem is really complicated,” says Somkiat Prajamwong, the secretary-general of the Office of National Water Resources.\nHis department is primarily tasked with\xa0moving, adjusting and managing Thailand’s water resources. When it comes to quenching the EEC’s thirst, the task is akin to a giant jigsaw puzzle.\xa0\nWeather patterns are unpredictable in Thailand. This\xa0means that rain does not always fall in the right places at the right time. Catchment areas that the country has long relied on cannot be trusted under worsening climate change conditions.\nIn the next decade, water diversions, the construction of new reservoirs and inter-provincial pipelines are set to be key strategies to pump an extra 706 million cubic metres of water into the EEC zone. Most of the water will be drawn from Thailand’s far east, close to the Cambodian border where demand is less and existing reservoirs are healthy.\n“On the topography map, we cannot move the reservoirs but we can change the channels to take more water or harvest more water into a reservoir. We know we have uncertainty from climate change - we cannot forecast more than a year - so storage is really important,” Somkiat said.\nIn total, some 38 projects with a budget of about US$1.6 billion are earmarked for water supply projects for the ECC, while additional projects will address water loss, agricultural usage plans and groundwater. About 30 per cent of water in the area will be reserved for emergency use.\nA desalination plant involving private sector investors is also under consideration.\nSomkiat says a top priority is ensuring that water allocations for agricultural use are not brushed aside in light of rising demand\xa0from industry. He hopes better communication and transparency will help overcome local concerns.\n“We have a fixed amount of water for the agricultural sector and for the industrial sector with some conditions that if the water is below a certain level, we don’t want to transfer to other sectors except agriculture,” he said.\n“We try to set up the plans in advance so the people know how many crops they can grow, how much water they can use and how much they will suffer in the future.\n“If we have some problems with water demand or water availability, we may think about how we’re going to use other measures to reduce demand. We know demand never stops, it only increases.”\nHe says many farmers have in recent years shifted to water-intense activities, especially growing durians instead of rice, due to their popularity and high price in export markets. Those farmers will need to make provisions to be more water smart and have their own storage systems.\xa0\nHe also believes that paying for water will become an inevitability for all parties. But those mechanisms are largely still being designed.\xa0\nSucharit Koonthanakunwong, an associate professor advising the government on the ECC, in an official capacity as part of the Collaborative Office on Strategic Water Management, says helping farmers install their own water reserve ponds through government subsidies is part of the EEC wider plan.\n“The recent drought is not a crisis, but the new normal for the future,” he said. “People have some time now to sit down and see what they should prepare for. They have experience of the drought already. They know now what a crisis is.”\xa0\n\n\n""WE DO NOT WANT TO REPEAT ANY MISTAKES""\nIn this part of Thailand, there remains the lingering imprint of past industrial projects that have polluted water sources and poisoned the air and soil. But the ECC has promised to ensure that this undertaking will be different.\xa0\n“We do not want to repeat any mistakes that happened in the past. We are very clear that we would like to take care of the environment, the health and wellbeing of the people in the EEC area,” said Luxmon, the deputy secretary-general.\nCrucial to the sustainability of the EEC will be regulations around the type of companies that can set up within it, and the rules they will need to follow to match its green ambitions. While the next few years will see a further build-up of essential infrastructure to support new industries, space has been made available\xa0for investors to move their operations into the EEC now.\xa0\n“We need to understand that back then, 30 years ago, those were heavy industries and they seemed to have impacts. We do not want that so that was built into our initiative from the very beginning,” she said.\nShe admits that climate change was not an integral part of the initial planning of the EEC, but starting from this year, boosting the scheme’s green credentials has been a focus.\n\n\nHowever,\xa0Somnuck believes that official predictions of future water demand in the ECC are “wrong”, grossly underestimating how much of the resource will be needed.\xa0\nIn light of that, he has called for a clear 6R scheme to address water use throughout the three target provinces - reduce, reuse, recycle, rethink, redesign and regulation. He says some factories have already proven that recycling water is possible but the same attitudes and practices are not being fully adapted.\xa0\n“Imagine if everyone could recycle 20 per cent, you can drop the demand for water a lot.

      Commentary: Funding Singapore’s major infrastructure projects a tricky business
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore’s move to fund infrastructure projects through borrowing comes at an epochal time in global efforts to “build back better”.\xa0\xa0\nNewly elected US President Joe Biden is working hard to pass a massive infrastructure package of roughly US$2.2 trillion through the United States Congress.\nThe move highlights the recognised need for infrastructure development in the US.\xa0It is also a robust response to the narrative that the US has lacked recent funding for infrastructure relative to other countries.\xa0\nThe US knows China has acted aggressively on the infrastructure front over the past decade.\nChina has developed the world’s largest high-speed rail (HSR) network over the last two decades, accounting for more than half of the world’s total length of HSR tracks.\nThis transportation network has grown by over 25,000 km over just the last 10 years, with ambitious plans to increase the coverage by more than 50 per cent over the next decade.\xa0\nPAYING FOR SUCH PROJECTS TRICKY\nFunding this and other types of infrastructure developments can be tricky business.\nFinancing such projects is typically undertaken by governments. Infrastructure works are typically seen as public goods, which benefit a large portion of the society and yet are not economically viable for private sector funding, where recouping returns on investments can complicate how such transport networks are run for the benefits of their intended users.\nIndeed, Mr Biden’s plan largely hinges on increasing the US government’s balance sheet via a substantial increase in corporate taxation rates.\nThis is a marked shift from a reliance on a mix of taxes on petrol and other transportation taxes to fund public projects through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 and the establishment of the Highway Trust Fund, and incentives and credit assistance to boost private projects through the Transportation Infrastructure and Innovation Act of 1998.\nBut increasing taxes is always difficult with constituents who bear the brunt of such spending. \xa0\nWith the pandemic-induced economic shrinkage, paying for infrastructure expenditures whose benefits will be enjoyed by future generations is unlikely to be popular with this current generation of voters and politicians.\nBut this opposition predates the coronavirus downturn.\xa0Even during good times – the US economy has grown almost uninterruptedly since World War II – politicians and voters tend to allocate less than what is necessary to maintain and improve existing infrastructure network and facilities.\nIn more recent years, competing needs have put greater pressure on scarce fiscal resources at a time when global growth is slowing.\nBut the warning bells have been sounded. Renowned think tank, the US Council on Foreign Relations in early April called US infrastructure “dangerously overstretched” and “deficient”, with knock on impacts for economic competitiveness and human safety.\nINFRASTRUCTURE BONDS BRIDGE THE TRANSFER\nSingapore’s recently announced Singapore Government Securities (Infrastructure) bonds should be judged in this context.\nIn response to the chronic reluctance to inter-generational transfer, governments and other public entities have actively participated in infrastructure bonds.\nIn so doing, the balance sheet of the public sector can be increased without commensurate, immediate increase in taxpayers’ burden.\nInfrastructure bonds are particularly useful for infrastructure projects whose cash flows will be quite stable, to support the interest payments in the future.\xa0\nIn this context, infrastructure bonds can be seen as an efficient way to perform inter-generational transfers, where future users of infrastructure projects provide the guarantee for future payments to bondholders.\nIf the cash flows fall short of the required interest payments, the issuing government may have to increase the tax rates for future taxpayers to pay for the shortfall.\nPRUDENCE IN BORROWING\nThe Government has announced the proceeds of this new borrowing, proposed under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, will fund MRT lines such as the Cross Island and Jurong Regional lines, and tidal walls to protect the country against rising sea levels.\nThe S$10 billion Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, a water superhighway to channel used water to reclamation plants, will also be one such project.\nAsking future taxpayers to shoulder the additional burden seems reasonable to the extent that they benefit from the infrastructure project.\nHowever, situations could arise where infrastructure bonds result in future interest payments associated with projects that have limited benefits.\xa0This could risk increasing prices of fundamental services, such as transportation and water, negating the benefit for the intended users: Future generations of Singaporeans.\nThis potential negative scenario highlights the importance of restricting which projects to fund with infrastructure bonds.\xa0\nThe S$5 billion cap on interest payments could place a ceiling on such an outcome, just as the S$90 billion cap on projects to be financed would restrict the types of projects to be funded through such means.\nHaving an efficient bond capital market is useful in reducing potential government waste in this context. Potential bondholders pay close attention to this type of issues and may shun bond issuances that are likely to run into potential shortfalls.\nSuch shortfalls in other countries could result in looser monetary policy, where governments would print money to pay the interest accrued to bondholders.\xa0This is a less viable option for Singapore where monetary policy is centered on managing exchange rates to ensure price stability needed for sustainable economic growth.\xa0\nInstead, this would constrain the fiscal space of future Singapore Budgets, with the opportunity cost being the reduction of financing for other strategic initiatives.\nDIVERSIFIED STREAMS OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES KEY\nRelying solely on infrastructure bonds could also result in under-investment in such projects.\nGovernments therefore will have to make the difficult decision of identifying strategic – but risky – projects that must be funded by taxation, either directly by increasing tax rates or indirectly by introducing or increasing usage fees.\xa0\nFor now, the Singapore government seems to have set aside sufficient investments in strategic projects like the Changi Airport T4 terminal.\nIf these strategic projects end up being successful, future generations will benefit from lower tax rates, higher quality of life, or both.\xa0\nJohan Sulaeman is a Dean’s Chair and an associate professor in the Department of Finance at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.

      How businesses are responding to sustainability-conscious millennials
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Social enterprise Ugly Food is on a mission to change Singaporeans’ perception of blemished fruits.\nOn Instagram, its comic strips on talking fruits explain how fresh produce gets scarred in the supply chain journey and how people can help save them.\xa0\nUglyFood hopes the caricatures will build public awareness and help reduce Singapore’s growing food waste.\nUglyFood started out as a school project. It takes in blemished and excess fruits from importers, supermarkets and wholesalers.\nThe idea is that beauty is not just skin deep, and that produce deemed “ugly”, can also be delicious – and less wasteful.\nAccording to a 2019 study by the Singapore Environment Council and Deloitte, Singapore imports about 2 million tonnes of food. About 393,000 tonnes, or almost 20 percent, is lost in the supply chain yearly.\nFruits and vegetables account for about 167,000 tonnes in food loss that occur during the post-harvest stage, processing and transportation.\nSince it was founded in 2016, UglyFood said it has saved 200 tonnes of food – a big leap from just less than 100kg of fruits initially. \n""We want it to be the global brand or global face in terms of food wastage of fresh produce,"" said Mr Augustine Tan, co-founder of UglyFood.\n""It’s definitely making a difference. Big or not is relative ... We do hope that can we can shave off at least one-seventh or one-eighth of the total wastage that Singapore has,"" he added.\n\n\n\n\nThis desire to make a difference is one shared by many in the millennial demographic.\nAccording to a global survey by Deloitte, millennials see climate change and protecting the environment as a top concern – overtaking anxieties over health, jobs and personal safety.\nIn its primary poll, 83 per cent of millennials agreed that climate change is occuring and is caused primarily by humans. And only 40 per cent believe current and future efforts to protect the planet will be successful.\nThough optimism remains low, millennials are making changes in their daily routine to improve the planet.\nPrior to the pandemic, 58 per cent said they had increased use of public transport, while half had cut their purchases of fast fashion and 64 per cent were cutting down on single use plastic and recycling more.\nAccording to Ms Yvonne Zhang, lead sustainability director at Deloitte Singapore, millennials are making important life decisions based on sustainability concerns. These include questions such as how many children to have, or whether they should have children at all. Other key decisions include those about daily diet.\n\n\n\nDeloitte said millennials are in a position to create wider awareness and effect changes on sustainability, as they become consumers, policymakers, investors and workers.\n“The millennials are concerned with more than just profits, with more than just self-interest,"" said Ms Zhang.\n""Millennials want to contribute actively to reducing consumption, removing some of the biases and impediments facing society, as well as rehabilitating society for environmental concerns, social concerns, and also improving governance and transparency. They have a lot of preferences and a lot of asks for entities to do better and show that they are doing more,” she added.\nFor small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), this presents an opportunity to transform their operations and benefit from the growing clamour for sustainable practices.\n“For a lot of SMEs, the whole pandemic has been a chance for them to rethink their positioning, their marketing,"" said Mr\xa0Ang Yuit,\xa0vice president of the Association of Small\xa0&\xa0Medium Enterprises (ASME).\n""So I think many may actually go down the path of repositioning themselves with the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) goals. In some cases, maybe pivoting to one that has more alignment with environmentally sustainable goals, that would allow them to reach out to a different market.”\n\n\nFor retailers and food industry players, going green could mean using less plastic for packaging or adopting practices to avoid wastage.\nFor others, this could entail changing equipment, materials and processes or even revamping the entire business model.\nAccording to Mr Ang, this may pose a challenge for some businesses.\n“The barriers are that a lot of firms have a fixed way of doing their business. And that inertia would then continue - I use whatever that\'s there, established suppliers that don\'t have to change. Because even if it is cheaper, establishing new suppliers and supply routes will cost me time. So that\'s still imputed costs,” he said.\nDeloitte said there remains a lack of clear sustainability benchmarks that can result in actual benefits for companies. In addition, the pathway to profitability to justify investment in environmental and social goals may not always be clear.\nChallenges aside, many still see sustainability as a way forward due to its potential impact to bottom lines.\n“What we are noticing is because of the change in demand and a slight change in the way the overall government has been pushing for this, people are starting to move towards that direction,” said Mr Ang.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     climate change ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      The eco-entrepreneurs waging war on plastic pollution in oceans
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From straws to takeaway containers, plastic bags and personal protective equipment - the amount of plastic that is used every year is growing.\nDespite a global push for recycling and reducing single use plastics, much of this ends up as waste in the world’s oceans.\nEvery year, about 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceans. That is equivalent to more than 15 bags of garbage, on every metre of coastline around the world.\n“We can immediately see the impact this has on the marine life. But what we do not know for sure now is the extent of the impact on human health,"" said materials expert Yvonne Lin from WWF Singapore.\n""The plastic \xa0in the ocean breaks down into microplastics, and these then could enter the food chain when people eat seafood,” she added.\nAccording to a 2015 report by the Ocean Conservancy and McKinsey, 60 per cent of all plastic waste in the ocean comes from five Asian countries – China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.\nAlthough Singapore does not contribute much to plastic pollution in the ocean, experts say we still have a part to play in the clean-up.\n“Anyone who has gone to East Coast Park in the morning would have seen the amount of plastic waste that’s being washed ashore. So this really shows that this is a transboundary problem,"" said Ms Lin.\n""It doesn’t matter where the plastic comes from, whether it originates in Singapore or some other countries. Solving the plastic waste problem requires a coordinated effort globally and shared responsibility in a collective approach.”\nThe materials expert said that Singapore is well-positioned to drive leadership in this area.\nThe Incubation Network was founded in Singapore in 2019 with just that goal in mind.\nThe focus is on supporting entrepreneurs.\nIts director Simon Baldwin said that it views\xa0entrepreneurs as ""the engine room for changing systems"".\n“So think of us as being able to source, support, and scale the best and brightest ideas to address this problem. Now, entrepreneurs by themselves aren’t going to solve this problem alone, so we also work with other key stakeholders, to ensure a more enabling environment for entrepreneurs, businesses to scale,"" said Mr Baldwin.\nHe added that the organisation also works with large companies and governments to help them implement policies that could potentially de-risk an entrepreneur from moving into the space.\n\nOne of the programmes run by the Incubation Network is the Plastic Data Challenge, which attracted hundreds of entrepreneurs from around the world.\nOn offer were innovative ideas on working with data to understand how material flows through waste systems across the region.\nOne of the finalists is a start-up called Clearbot, which uses a swarm of robots to collect trash from oceans or rivers.\nThe Incubation Network has helped Clearbot to find suitable mentors and connected them with an accelerator in Surabaya to trial their prototype.As one of the finalists of the challenge, they also received US$10,000 in funding.\xa0\xa0\n\nMr Baldwin said entrepreneurs with specific solutions for local problems are key to cleaning the oceans.\xa0\n“We’re finding that there’s lots of people with ideas but there’s such little coordination within the ecosystem,"" said Mr Baldwin.\n""We really think that we’re able to help wayfind, help navigate some of these start-ups through this emerging and exciting space. We’re able to help them connect to mentors ... connect to early grants and funding that allows them to experiment and scale.\n""They’re too risky at the moment for venture capital. But our idea is that through these pilot studies and through these projects, that we can support them with building relationships and building connections into the region.”\nHe also welcomed the Government’s recent Budget announcements and the Green Plan, which he believes will help create a market for start-ups.\n“When governments create goals and aspirations and set targets, it allows to de-risk entrepreneurs moving into that space. We saw in the Singapore Green Plan really ambitious goals for improving waste sorting technology, increasing recycling, turning ash from incineration into building materials. These are all great examples of opportunities for entrepreneurs.\n""We can help you, we can help expose you to this opportunity and in a way de-risk the entry into that space because they know that there is a market for the types of technologies that they that they’re working on.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     environment ']}"

Malaysia is not included in either category,” he added.\nThe minister also pointed out that other countries that stand out in the global climate change agenda such as Sweden, Switzerland and Thailand were also not invited.\n\n\n“The summit is a one-off event which does not affect negotiations and decisions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,” he said.\xa0\nAdditionally, Mr Tuan Ibrahim stated that the government is formulating five new policies under a national climate change management strategy.\xa0\nHe elaborated that this includes revising existing climate change policies, the policies and management of a carbon market mechanism and forming a greenhouse gas inventory among others.\nLast month, the White House said that 40 world leaders, including those from China, Japan, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and New Zealand, have been invited to attend a virtual leaders summit on climate change. The summit will be held on Apr 22 and 23.\n\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Democratic Action Party Secretary General Lim Guan Eng said in a statement that the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government has failed to push “green policies” when compared to the Pakatan Harapan administration.\xa0\n“Malaysia’s exclusion from a climate action summit featuring world leaders from 40 countries, including neighbours Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam has become a sad joke on the declining state of Malaysia’s previous leading activism on promoting climate change.\n“Malaysia’s exclusion from the United States Climate Action Summit confirms that Malaysia is viewed as more of a dumping ground for plastic waste than a strategic environmental partner,” he said.\xa0\nMr Lim noted that former environment and water minister Yeo Bee Yin was at the forefront of returning shipping containers of plastic waste back to their country of origin and amending the classification of plastic waste\xa0under the Basel Convention, to restrict the import of such waste.\n“Despite denials by the PN Environment and Water Minister Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man, the PN government has allowed Malaysia to slowly become the US dumping ground for ‘clean’ plastic waste,” he said.\n“Tuan Ibrahim should wake up and set his vision on how to integrate climate change measures into the work of government agencies and the way forward to reclaim our climate change\xa0reputation,” Mr Lim added.\xa0\nIn response, Mr Tuan Ibrahim said in his statement that the issue of plastic waste should be seen separately from the climate summit.\n\n\n“It needs to be clarified that current policies relating to the recycled plastic industry is allowed as determined by the Federal Government through the Ministry of International Trade and Industries (MITI).\n“In terms of governance, MITI is responsible for the direction and policy of the recycled plastics industry and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) regulates the issuance of import permits (AP) only for clean and homogenous plastics. The Department of Environment (DOE) acts as the authority to ensure compliance with the Basel Convention,” he explained.\xa0\nHe stressed that strict action has been taken against those who failed to comply to existing laws, including sending back the imported containers of plastic waste to the original countries under the provision of paragraph 31 (1) (g) of Act 127 of the Environmental Quality Act 1974.\n“The government policy is to make the plastic recycling industry in line with the development of the circular economy as a catalyst to green industries in line with the Green Technology Master Plan 2017-2030,” said the minister.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     climate change ', '     global warming ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

It recently awarded nearly S$11 million to six projects researching new technologies for this purpose.\nTRANSFORMING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT SECTOR\nAs part of the Government’s effort to shift the built environment sector away from its reliance on manual labour, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research will develop a 5G-enabled Smart Construction concept.\nThey will look into integrating 5G technology with drones, robots and artificial intelligence to monitor construction sites.\n“Technological breakthroughs from around the world can help us to build faster, safer, and more efficiently – for example, through greater use of robotics, automation, and digitalisation,” said Mr Lee, adding that this could include incorporating robot-oriented design in construction.\n\n\nA CITY TO FORGE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS\nAnother priority for the Government is to strengthen Singapore’s urban social sciences.\n“We aspire to build a city that not only meets our physical needs, but that also enables us to forge strong relationships and deep emotional connections with each other,” said Mr Lee.\n\n\nTo understand how the well-being of residents is affected by Singapore’s built environment, the Government will combine social science knowledge with big data analytics, in a project that is said to be the first of its kind.\n“If this effort is successful, our findings will inform our planning strategies and interventions, to build a socially more resilient and sustainable city,” he said.\nCLOSER PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN RESEARCH, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS\nHDB and A*STAR will sign a Memorandum of Understanding which aims to take the research findings from the Ministry of National Development’s agencies and turn them into commercial applications before scaling up, said Mr Lee.\nHe noted that this would make Singapore’s built environment industry more competitive.\nSaid the minister: “I encourage all our industry and research partners to tap on these platforms for collaboration and turn your ideas into deployable solutions and bring them to market.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     RIE2025 ', '     Desmond Lee ', '     climate change ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      NTU scientists transform discarded durian husks into antibacterial gel bandages
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Discarded durian husks could soon have a second life – as antibacterial hydrogel bandages.\nThe bandages, created by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) scientists, were developed in line with Singapore's push towards zero waste, said\xa0Professor William Chen on Thursday (Mar 25).\nProf Chen, the director of NTU's Food Science and Technology Programme,\xa0is the scientist behind the durian husk project.\n“Twelve million durians are consumed every year. However, most of the durian fruit is discarded,” he said.\xa0\nThe husk, which comprises about 60 per cent of the durian, is usually discarded and incinerated, “posing an environmental issue”, said NTU in a media release.\nThe low-cost bandage is both biodegradable and non-toxic, which means it has a smaller environmental footprint than conventional synthetic bandages, the university said.\nMAKING THE BANDAGE\nProf Chen and his team created the bandages by extracting high-quality cellulose from the durian husks. They converted the husks into cellulose\xa0powder through slicing, freeze-drying and ball-milling, before removing impurities.\nThis is a “significant reduction” in cost compared to traditional methods of using enzymes, said Prof Chen. The traditional method costs about S$27,000 per kg, while Prof Chen’s method costs about S$120 per kg to extract the same amount of cellulose.\nAfter extracting the cellulose, researchers combined the extract with glycerol –\xa0a waste by-product from the biodiesel and soap industry –\xa0to make a soft gel. The gel, which is similar to silicon sheets, can be cut into bandages of various shapes and sizes.\xa0\nThe scientists then added organic molecules produced from baker’s yeast, making the bandages deadly to bacteria.\nThe bandages remain functional in extreme weather conditions, added Prof Chen.\nHe estimates that he can extract 200g of husk powder from a 3kg durian, of which 40g is pure cellulose. This 40g is enough to make 66 pieces of 7cm by 7cm hydrogel, which is enough material for about 1,600 plasters measuring 1cm by 2cm each.\nWHY HYDROGEL?\nThere are various applications for hydrogels, including wound dressing and wearable electronics, said Prof Chen.\xa0\nAbout 80 to 90 per cent of hydrogel\xa0is water, said Associate Professor Andrew Tan, who was invited to Thursday’s media briefing as an independent expert. He is vice dean (faculty) at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.\nIt is “well-established” in many clinical trials that hydrogel\xa0helps\xa0wounds to heal, added Assoc Prof Tan. For instance, the water keeps the wound area cool and moist, accelerating healing. Hydrogel also reduces\xa0scarring.\nWhile durians were not the only possible choice to make these bandages, Prof Chen said he chose the fruit as there was “sustainable supply” and it was high in fibre content.\nHowever, he noted that this was platform technology, and the method of extracting cellulose can be used on other materials.\nCHEAPER THAN CONVENTIONAL HYDROGEL PATCHES\nAccording to Prof Chen, conventional hydrogel patches on the market are made of synthetic materials. Those with antimicrobial properties use metallic compounds like silver or copper ions.\nThese materials make conventional hydrogel patches more costly than Prof Chen’s hydrogel, which is made from natural waste materials.\nA typical hurdle for university research to market is scalability and cost-reduction, said Prof Chen. So it was important to keep the process simple, low-cost and green, he added.\nThe durian husks are low in cost\xa0and Prof Chen’s extraction method\xa0–\xa0which uses environmentally friendly detergent – is simple, so the project could be scaled up for production, he said.\nAlthough currently just a proof of concept, if cellulose can be extracted in a sustainable\xa0and cost-effective\xa0way, then there is “great potential” for the durian husk-based hydrogel to replace current hydrogels already on the market, Prof Chen said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     science ', '     technology ', '     NTU ']}"

      Commentary: Bottled water should be a luxury, not a necessity
  </h1>, 'text': ""LONDON: Emmanuel Faber’s ousting this week as chief executive of Danone, the French maker of Activia yoghurt and Alpro soya milk, was a victory for activist investors who disliked his style.\nHe might have lasted longer but for the pandemic’s heavy toll on one of Danone’s biggest products — bottled water.\nBottles of Evian from Évian-les-Bains and of Volvic from the Auvergne sold well across Europe until COVID-19.\nAs many restaurants and offices closed, people spent less on mineral water and drank more of their own water at home. Danone’s like-for-like sales of bottled water fell 17 per cent in 2020.\nA LESSON IN BARE NECESSITIES OF LIFE\nIt feels like a lesson in the bare necessities of life: Most of us have perfectly good water, literally on tap, and do not need to drink spring water from plastic or glass bottles.\nAs Richard Wilk, an anthropology professor, once wrote of bottled water, “getting people to pay for things that they already have in abundance” is a perverse feat.\nThis is not the only objection to products such as Evian, or Nestlé's Perrier and S Pellegrino.\nTransporting water long distances in bottles that can end up in landfill sites or oceans, rather than piping it in bulk, hurts the environment in ways that companies have been slow to address.\nBut fancy mineral water drunk by people who already have potable water on tap is a luxury that can pay for its environmental remedies.\nThe greater problem is that billions of people drink bottled water out of necessity, either because the public alternative is not safe, or because there is none at all.\nAdam Smith, the 18th-century economist, identified the paradox that water, which is essential to life, was priced lower than diamonds, a luxury.\nThe answer was that someone who has plenty of water does not value another glass of it highly — its marginal utility is low. Natural diamonds are scarce, so each additional one is valuable.\nTHE RISE OF BOTTLED WATER\nMineral water’s rise in popularity is a story of companies such as Nestlé persuading consumers that the liquid that comes in bottles is healthier and tastier than that from pipes.\nBy branding it and controlling supplies, they turned it into a scarce consumer good with a high price. Voilà!\nIt is not wholly an illusion; Badoit and Perrier do have a distinctive taste and fizz.\nBut if you have a water filter and a SodaStream machine at home, as I do, you can save a lot of money, effort and waste while drinking carbonated water that is just as satisfying as most supermarket “spring water”.\nUNHEALTHY FOR THE PLANET\nIt took too long for companies to recognise that bottled water was good for people, but not very healthy for the planet.\nThey are still some way from making these brands ecologically responsible by using recycled plastic for bottles, and curbing transport emissions, although Evian was certified as carbon neutral last year.\nThe good news is that luxury water is pricey. A bottle of S Pellegrino costs about four times as much a litre at a British supermarket as a pallet of Costco’s private label Kirkland Signature “bottled at source in Chase Spring, Lichfield”.\nThe profit can pay for environmental offsets such as replenishing water tables.\nThis is the special stuff. Most bottled water does not flow from a French spa: It is from humbler aquifers, or is just purified municipal water, such as Coca-Cola’s Dasani.\n\nMuch is sold in countries where the public water supply is contaminated or scarce — 70 per cent of Danone’s bottled water sales by volume fall into this category, such as its Aqua brand in Indonesia.\nMAKE ORDINARY WATER SAFE\nThat is a more pressing worry than whether Evian bottles are ferried across Europe by train or truck from Évian-les-Bains.\nAccess to drinking water should be a human right, but even bottled water in Nigeria can be contaminated with bacteria, and half a billion people in the world face severe shortage all year round, according to one study.\nThe US is not immune — supplies were contaminated in Flint, Michigan, in 2014 after the city pumped water from the Flint River, forcing citizens to drink from bottles instead. Nestlé, which used spring water elsewhere in Michigan for bottling, faced a backlash and last month sold its North American brands including Poland Spring, Deer Park and Arrowhead.\nCompanies such as Danone are not primarily to blame for the failures of cities and countries to distribute clean water: I am grateful for bottles when visiting China or India. But private water should not displace public supplies.\nNongfu Spring, China’s largest bottled water group, is valued at about US$65 billion thanks to its extraction rights to 10 water sources,\nClimate change and water scarcity add to the challenge in many countries, and tempt them to hand over responsibility to the private sector.\nThat is one reason why Morgan Stanley places bottled water at the top of its “Magnificent Seven” group of consumer staples with global growth prospects.\nBut bottled water should be a luxury, not a necessity. When the pandemic ends, restaurants will serve more Evian and Perrier again, but the prime task is to make ordinary water flow safely.\nWas COVID-19 the jolt we needed to make us rethink our hygiene habits?\xa0Jaime Ho speaks with Edward D'Silva of the Public Hygiene Council and Jack Sim of World Toilet Organization on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     water ', '     environment ']}"

      With movement restrictions eased in Malaysia, reforestation efforts pick up momentum again 
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR:\xa0Carolyn Lau and Lydia Lubon from the Free Tree Society (FTS) were getting a trio of first-time participants ready for a tree-planting session at Federal Hill, a hill behind the upscale Bangsar neighbourhood.\nThis is the first trail planting session for the non-governmental organisation (NGO) since the restriction on social activities in Kuala Lumpur was lifted on Mar 5.\xa0\xa0\nLau and Lubon\xa0placed some\xa0saplings in reusable bags, and the group set off. They were going to plant fruiting trees such as ficus and bachang, as well as Rangoon creeper which\xa0serves as a source of pollen and food source for animals.\nAlong the short trail created entirely by FTS members, Lau explained that trail planting is to help repopulate the area’s biodiversity.\n""Previously, Bangsar and Federal Hill\xa0used to be hectares of rubber estate during colonial times, and even though the hill is now considered secondary forest, one can still find full-grown rubber trees and rubber saplings,"" she said on Mar 10.\xa0\nThe saplings were\xa0planted at different parts of the trail as Lau led\xa0the volunteers further in.\xa0The Rangoon creeper, the last to be planted, took some time\xa0as the group discovered household waste buried at the spot, presumably\xa0dumped by irresponsible parties in the past.\xa0\xa0\nVivitha Naidu, a volunteer who took part in the trail planting, found the experience rewarding and an educational one.\n""It\'s not just about planting trees, but learning about our own country and the implications of clearing forests.""\xa0\xa0\n""You get to learn about biodiversity and our own tropical rainforests.\xa0It was an eye-opener for me. I only thought we only had one kind of palm - the oil palm, but I\'m surprised to learn we had so many types of palm trees growing here,"" she said.\xa0\nIn the Klang Valley and across the country, organisations such as the FTS\xa0and private corporations\xa0are attempting to repopulate the land with native trees\xa0in an attempt to reforest and\xa0restore Malaysia’s biodiversity.\nUsually, tree-planting events are done with public participation in an effort to get more saplings planted, as well as to spread the environmental message to the wider Malaysian public.\nAlthough COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns since last year have put a damper on some of these public events, some efforts have managed to go on. With movement restrictions eased in most parts of the country,\xa0organisers\xa0are up and at it again with physical workshops and\xa0tree-planting sessions.\xa0\nRESOWING FORESTS\nDespite last year’s lockdowns, FTS\xa0founder Baida Hercus said the NGO still managed to plant more than\xa0400 native trees and other plants along the Pulai\xa0trail at Federal Hill.\xa0\nWhile the land is government owned, FTS actively maintains the trail.\xa0\n“One goal of the Pulai trail exercise\xa0is to help repopulate its biodiversity. The other\xa0is to make sure it becomes beloved by the community, as with another part of Kuala Lumpur where the community came together to protect their green space,” said Hercus.\xa0\n“All (of the replanting) is aimed at supporting wildlife in the area, and eventually increasing biodiversity in what used to be a rubber estate and now a recovering jungle,” she said.\nNot enough importance is given to secondary forests in urban areas, she continued, for potential rehabilitation and conservation.\n“But they are important as carbon sinks and flood mitigators in cities like Kuala Lumpur, and as they are undervalued, they become very vulnerable to threats like unchecked development,” she said.\xa0\nIt was hoped, Hercus said, that by maintaining the trail and planting a diverse range of local plant species, more people would grow to appreciate such green spaces in the city.\n“So far we\'ve been seeing increased attention to the trail on neighbourhood Facebook pages with people from the surrounding community coming to walk the trail and participate in trail maintenance, which is very encouraging,” she added.\nAll in all, Hercus said, FTS has\xa0given away over 40,000 plants since they started in 2013.\xa0\nFor other corporations, the number of replanted trees are targeted in the millions.\xa0\nFor instance, Nestle Malaysia Berhad aims to replant 3 million trees in Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia by 2023\xa0through its RELeaf Project which kicked off last September.\xa0\nFor Nestle Malaysia CEO Juan Aranols, this project has proceeded in sequence since\xa0October\xa0with field planting activities in Sabah’s Kinabatangan Wetlands and Merisuli in Lahad Datu.\xa0\nThe company’s replanting effort has also seen local Orang Asli communities living on the fringes of the Klang Valley being engaged for the reforestation project as well.\n“By mid-2021, we aim to commence reforestation efforts along the peninsula’s Central Forest Spine, and the riparian (wetlands adjacent to rivers) and forest reserves around oil palm\xa0plantations,” said Aranols.\xa0\nThis RELeaf Project is an extension or an earlier, small-scale reforestation effort called “RiLeaf” which took place in the Kinabatangan River area.\xa0\nThese two efforts, Aranols said, would result in a total of 4 million trees being planted by the target year of 2023.\xa0\nIn Peninsular Malaysia, another environmental NGO, the Global Environment Centre also has tree-planting goals. Its spokesperson said that\xa0over the next two years, it was working with the various corporate social responsibility (CSR) arms of Malaysian and international corporations to plant over 100,000 trees.\xa0\nAt the same time, the effort would include fire prevention, rewetting (especially for degraded and dried-out peatland, which is a fire hazard), post-planting care and maintenance.\xa0\nAlthough no specific trees were listed, GEC said the species selected for restoring the degraded forest and riverine areas are local ones which can tolerate hot and wet conditions and thrive in degraded areas.\nREPLANTING UNDER COVID-19\nAs Malaysia underwent its first and second lockdowns, traditional public outreach programmes such as tree planting and sapling or plant giveaways had to be reworked to comply with social distancing limits, or cancelled entirely.\xa0\nIn GEC’s case, tree-planting in 2021 was currently being done at a very small scale\xa0for select degraded mangrove and peatland sites.\xa0\n“The tree planting is mainly conducted by trained local communities at the adjacent forest reserves, and not open for public participation due to COVID-19 and movement control rules,” GEC’s spokesperson said.\nIn addition, the NGO had prepped items such as personal protective equipment, comprising face mask, hand sanitiser, gloves and drinking water for the local community members taking part.\nPlanting time is limited to one hour, involving 10 to 20 people. In one session,\xa0300 to\xa0600 trees are planted.\xa0\nFor FTS, it\xa0pivoted online to continue its public outreach efforts, hosting online programmes and workshops on topics like composting, planting and gardening basics, and environment-themed talks.\xa0\n“Our nurseries (at Bangsar and Taman Tugu) are actually rather full at the moment, but we can’t conduct mass giveaways because of the pandemic. Likewise, our usual hands-on environmental stewardship programmes have been impacted as well,” said Hercus.\xa0\nDespite the lack of physical programmes, FTS’s employees and volunteers still tended to the new Pulai trail and the nurseries.\xa0\nAnd as of Mar 9, the NGO had restarted its physical workshops and trail plantings.\xa0\nMeanwhile,\xa0Nestle\'s RELeaf project, which is still in its early phases, has been proceeding apace.\xa0\nNestle and its project partners are currently working with the local communities they have\xa0engaged to maximise seedling production, which will then feed into the reforestation effort.\n“These activities are proceeding, and haven’t been much impacted by the movement restrictions,” Aranols, the CEO, said.\nMANAGING EXPECTATIONS\nAlthough reforestation efforts are always encouraged, it\xa0is only one half of the equation\xa0for activists like Hercus.\xa0\n“We need to emphasise\xa0that the best strategy for ensuring our forests’ survival\xa0is to stop logging and conserve the forest areas we have left,” she said.\xa0\nWhile FTS was proud of its work in contributing towards replanting and rehabilitation, these were still actions taken after destruction had been wrought already. Hence, a lot of its programmes focus on knowledge sharing to prevent the loss of trees in the first place.\xa0\nAs with other NGOs last year, the economic downturn accompanying the pandemic meant funding was tight. In addition, Hercus had to manage donors’ expectations.\nSponsorship, she said, was often tied to donors’\xa0wants.\n“Having to navigate these kinds of issues is more commonplace as corporations are increasingly seeking to align themselves with environmental causes, while lacking the knowledge to create an effective environmental programme.”\xa0\n“As such, we do our best to create the most impactful programme with receptive corporations or channel their funds into our existing programmes that are already effective in reaching the people and changing mindsets to build a greener Malaysian society,” Hercus explained.\xa0\nPatience\xa0or instant gratification is also a factor NGOs have to navigate.\n“There needs to be a better understanding of the time scale we’re working with when it comes to forests and trees. Forest replanting and rehabilitation are not quick work,\xa0as it takes decades for a forest to grow,” Hercus said.\nRestoring a degraded forest can be challenging and complicated,\xa0the GEC said, as the effort involved a variety of ecological and social systems which were not always fully accounted for\xa0or understood.\nBesides managing\xa0participation and knowledge transfer by and to\xa0the local community and stakeholders, replanting is also fraught with issues such as\xa0weather, fires, pests and regular maintenance.\xa0\nHowever, more fundamental was the objective of reforestation itself.\n“It’s not just a matter of tree species, but environmental ethics. Deciding what tree species to plant\xa0leads one back to the question of what is the reason for reforestation,” the GEC spokesperson said.\n“More recently, we have seen large reforestation projects taking place under the Voluntary Carbon Market, where the purpose is to create large banks of carbon offsets.”\n“The type of trees planted then become important in terms of which species absorb the most carbon and are the fastest growing species,” GEC added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     environment ']}"

      Bailey, anjing pendeteksi satwa liar pertama di Indonesia
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Dengan indera penciumannya yang tajam, Bailey kerap ditemukan sedang mengendus tas dan koper bawaan penumpang serta puluhan truk yang sedang melewati pelabuhan kapal yang menghubungkan dua pulau terbesar di Indonesia.\nAnjing ini juga kerap diterjunkan ke pelbagai penjuru Nusantara untuk membantu para penegak hukum mencari penjahat dan menemukan tempat mereka menyimpan barang hasil kejahatan mereka.\nSetidaknya sekali seminggu, Bailey menemukan apa yang ia cari dan segera memberitahukan pawangnya akan bau yang tak asing lagi baginya – bau satwa yang dilindungi dan terancam punah.\n“Kebanyakan dari satwa yang Bailey temukan masih dalam kondisi hidup dan diperdagangkan sebagai binatang peliharaan,” kata Femke den Haas, seorang aktivis perlindungan satwa, kepada CNA.\nFemke adalah salah satu pendiri Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN), sebuah organisasi nirlaba yang merawat Bailey.\nBailey juga terkadang menemukan satwa-satwa langka yang telah mati, baik secara utuh maupun berupa produk seperti kerangka tulang, gading dan tanduk, kata Femke. Produk-produk ini diperuntukkan sebagai cendera mata ataupun sebagai bahan pembuat obat-obatan tradisional.\nAnjing Cocker Spaniel yang sebentar lagi berusia empat tahun ini adalah anjing pendeteksi satwa liar pertama di Indonesia.\nMenurut Femke, Bailey telah menyelamatkan setidaknya 6.000 hewan hidup dan menggagalkan pengiriman satwa mati yang tak terhitung jumlahnya dalam kurun waktu kurang dari tiga tahun.\nBailey juga telah membantu para penegak hukum dalam membongkar kasus-kasus besar perdagangan satwa langka di Indonesia, di mana terdapat ratusan jenis hewan unik dan langka; sehingga menjadi salah satu pusat perdangangan satwa yang dilindungi dan terancam punah.\nMenurut Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan, perdagangan gelap satwa liar telah merugikan negara Rp13 triliun setiap tahunnya. Angka ini di luar biaya yang harus dihabiskan untuk merehabilitasi satwa-satwa yang diselamatkan.\nBAKAT ALAMI\nBailey terlahir di sebuah tempat pengembangbiakan anjing di Belanda yang kemudian menjualnya kepada sebuah keluarga di sana. Beberapa bulan kemudian, Bailey tumbuh menjadi seekor anjing yang hiperaktif dan tak suka duduk diam.\n“(Bailey) bukan tipe anjing yang cocok untuk tinggal di rumah. Ia terkadang loncat ke atas meja. Ia selalu sibuk. Ia selalu aktif. Keluarga itu seakan mau gila dibuatnya. Mereka tak mampu memelihara dia. Mereka ingin menyingkirkannya,” kata Femke.\nPada saat bersamaan, Femke, seorang aktivis asal Belanda yang sudah hampir 20 tahun tinggal di Indonesia, mulai memikirkan cara untuk menghentikan perdagangan satwa liar.\n“Saya berpikir anjing pendeteksi mungkin adalah cara yang tepat untuk mencium jejak mereka. (Anjing pendeteksi) sudah sering dipakai di Afrika untuk melawan perdagangan satwa dan saya merasa teknik yang sama bisa diterapkan di sini,” katanya.\nFemke pun mendekati beberapa organisasi untuk mendiskusikan idenya. Salah satunya, Scent Imprint for Dogs (SIFD), yang punya pusat pelatihan di negara asalnya, setuju untuk bekerja sama.\n“Saya tidak pernah berencana untuk membawa anjing dari Belanda, tetapi saat saya di Belanda untuk melakukan pelatihan, saya bertemu Bailey,” katanya. “(Mantan pemilik Bailey) telah menghubungi SIFD. Mereka tak ingin menyerahkan (Bailey) ke keluarga lain (sebagai peliharaan) karena ia lebih cocok sebagai anjing pekerja.”\nKebanyakan aparat penegak hukum dan perusahaan jasa keamanan yang menjadi mitra institusi tersebut lebih suka dengan anjing besar yang kekar dan bertampang sangar daripada anjing Cocker Spaniel yang kecil dan ramah seperti Bailey.\nNamun, di mata Femke, Bailey adalah sosok anjing yang sempurna untuk keperluannya.\n“Kita membutuhkan seekor anjing yang tidak menakutkan seperti anjing German Shepherd. Apalagi konsep anjing pendeteksi satwa liar adalah sesuatu yang baru di Indonesia, dan di Indonesia, banyak orang yang takut dengan anjing karena alasan agama.\n""(Bailey) sangat cocok karena ia tak menakutkan, ia kecil dan mudah dirawat,” kata Femke.\n“Semuanya terjadi secara kebetulan pada saat yang tepat. Saya pun tinggal lebih lama di Belanda untuk lebih mengenali (Bailey) dan berlatih bersamanya. Bailey sangat ramah ke siapapun. Ia seekor anjing yang baik hati dengan energi dan kemauan untuk bekerja yang besar.”\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nBailey baru berusia sembilan bulan saat ia menyelesaikan pelatihannya di Belanda di bulan Februari 2018. Sebelumnya, ia telah dilatih untuk mendeteksi berbagai satwa, mulai dari primata yang dilindungi sampai burung-burung langka yang hanya ditemukan di Indonesia.\nFemke lalu membawa Bailey ke Indonesia di mana ia kemudian menghabiskan beberapa bulan menyesuaikan diri dengan iklim tropis di tanah air serta berkenalan dengan tim JAAN.\nMENANGANI KASUS BESAR\nBailey mulai menangani kasus pertamanya di bulan Mei 2018, selang beberapa hari setelah ulang tahun pertamanya.\n“Kepolisian Belanda menghubungi kepolisian di Indonesia dan juga kami untuk mengumpulkan bukti terhadap seorang pedagang (satwa liar) asal Belanda,” kata Femke.\nOtoritas Belanda mulai menangani kasus ini sejak 2016 saat beberapa kargo berisikan berbagai cendera mata yang terbuat dari binatang langka asal Indonesia disita oleh petugas bea cukai di kota Rotterdam.\nSetelah mereka bertahun-tahun menyelidiki kasus ini, kepolisian Belanda akhirnya mengetahui bahwa barang-barang tersebut diselundupkan oleh seorang warga negara Belanda yang tinggal di Bali. Orang ini ternyata telah menyelundupkan ratusan satwa langka dari Indonesia sejak 2013.\nKepolisian Indonesia akhirnya menangkap orang tersebut dan Bailey membantu polisi menggeledah rumahnya serta beberapa toko barang antik tempat orang tersebut membeli produk satwa langkanya.\nPemilik toko-toko tersebut juga akhirnya ditangkap dan dari tangan mereka polisi menyita ratusan barang-barang yang terbuat dari satwa Indonesia yang dilindungi.\nKasus ini menyita perhatian banyak orang baik di Belanda maupun di dalam negeri. Petugas polisi dari kedua negara yang terlibat di penyelidikan kasus tersebut pun mendapat penghargaan atas kerja keras mereka.\n“Bagi kami, (kasus itu) istimewa karena Bailey turut terlibat dan kasus pertamanya adalah kasus yang sangat besar. Kami sangat bangga,” kata Femke.\nSejak saat itu, Bailey telah membongkar banyak sekali kasus perdagangan satwa, mulai dari penyelundupan puluhan bayi orang utan sampai pengiriman ratusan penyu hidup yang dagingnya biasa dikonsumsi dan cangkangnya dijadikan cendera mata.\n“Bailey menemukan binatang hampir setiap minggu dan dalam jumlah yang besar karena pedagang satwa langka tidak pernah menyelundupkan binatang dalam jumlah kecil,” kata Femke.\nBailey kini bekerja dari sebuah lokasi di Sumatra, tempat asal kebanyakan primata yang diperjualbelikan sebagai binatang peliharaan di Jawa dan Bali.\nIa juga kerap bepergian ke segala penjuru Indonesia untuk membantu penegak hukum mengumpulkan bukti melawan pedagang dan pemburu satwa liar.\nMENJADI BAGIAN SEBUAH KELUARGA BESAR\nSetelah Bailey, JAAN telah melatih dan mempekerjakan lima anjing pendeteksi satwa liar. Mereka ditempatkan di berbagai daerah di Indonesia. Saat ini, lembaga itu sedang melatih anjing pendeteksi satwa liar mereka yang ketujuh, kata Femke.\n“Mentor (dari SIFD) juga datang ke Indonesia agar keterampilan para pelatih dan pawang kami terus terasah. Sebelum COVID-19, mereka bisa datang tiap beberapa bulan sekali. (Kini) mereka terus memantau kami dari jauh dan memberikan konsultasi,” lanjutnya.\n“Kami juga bekerja sama dengan organisasi (nirlaba) yang lain. Bersama mereka, kami bisa membuat jaringan unit anjing pendeteksi satwa liar dalam skala yang lebih besar.”\nFemke mengatakan anjing-anjing JAAN yang lain kini mulai mengimbangi reputasi dan keteladanan Bailey. “Mereka sama piawainya (dengan Bailey).”\nNamun, sebagai anjing pendeteksi satwa liar pertama di Indonesia, Bailey akan selalu mempunyai tempat khusus di hati Femke.\n“Bailey adalah seorang megabintang bagi kami. Ia punya karakter yang luar biasa. Kami sangat beruntung punya (Bailey) di tim kami. Ia adalah pahlawan bagi satwa liar di Indonesia,” kata Femke.\nBacalah cerita ini dalam\xa0Bahasa Inggris.\nBaca juga\xa0artikel berbahasa Indonesia tentang seorang pria yang bisa membaca dan menulis 30 aksara Indonesia kuno, sebagian di antaranya berusia 500 tahun.\nIkuti akun CNA di\xa0Facebook\xa0dan\xa0Twitter\xa0untuk membaca artikel-artikel terkini.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     wildlife ', '     environment ', '     crime ']}"

      From Singapore to Hong Kong, how urban farming can help tackle food waste — but is it enough?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE and HONG KONG: As an urban farmer, Andrew Tsui values his relationship with food. And he\xa0frets that\xa0many humans of Hong Kong and Singapore, the two cities he grew up in, do not.\xa0\nThe problem, according to the 43-year-old, is the “instant-noodle city lifestyle”.\n“If we need something today … we can either use our smartphone (or) go downstairs. There’s always a convenience store,” he said. “Food becomes a lifeless thing that’s being put on the shelf.\n“And the moment we kind of productise food, it’s the start of the broken relationship.”\nIt is this “consumer mindset”, for one thing, that leads to over 3,600 tonnes of food — the weight of about 250 double-decker buses — being thrown into Hong Kong’s landfills every day.\nIn cities like Hong Kong and Singapore, more than half of food wastage happens at the retail and consumer stage.\nEver tossed half-eaten food into the bin? Or stuck some vegetables in the fridge and forgot about them until they had wilted, only to shrug it off and buy new provisions?\nSingaporean Amanda Woon remembers one time she was with her boyfriend at a supermarket. “I dropped this apple … and he was like, ‘(It’s) spoilt already, don’t buy,’” recounted the 24-year-old.\nChanging these mindsets to rebuild city dwellers’ relationship with food is one of the solutions that Andrew and others like him have been pursuing for some time. And they are doing it by bringing food production to the city.\nThe urban farming movement is not only catching on, but also addressing several issues at the heart of food wastage, CNA Insider finds out.\nWATCH: Can urban farming fix our broken relationship with food? (17:00)\nCULTIVATING AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT\nWhile food loss happens at every stage of the supply chain, attitudes in industrialised countries often cause wastage at dining tables.\n“Perhaps one of the most important reasons for food waste at the consumption level in rich countries is that people simply can afford to waste food,” stated a report from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nThere is also a danger of children growing up “largely desensitised to the issue of food waste”, warned Singapore University of Social Sciences senior lecturer and psychologist Tania Nagpaul.\n“Generational amnesia is something that scientists are talking about a lot these days … Younger generations are completely oblivious to what life was perhaps 20 years before they were born.”\nIn the context of food, affordability is not the only salient fact — with food so conveniently at hand, people do not need to think about how it is actually grown, even animals.\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if the way supermarkets portray food becomes the norm for our younger generations because this is what chicken means to them, and they’ve not really ever seen a live chicken,” said Nagpaul.\nIn short, the effort and resources needed in food production may be beyond their imagination, for example the time it takes to grow potatoes (up to 120 days) and the amount of water to produce a kilogramme of apples (822 litres).\nIs there a way, however, for things like that to come into people’s mind, say, when they see a bruised apple? Michelle Hong thinks so.\n“The main solution that I could see was to bring the farms into the city rather than bringing the people into the farms out there,” said the Singaporean co-founder of Hong Kong social enterprise Rooftop Republic.\n“The idea for us when we first started out … was to make farming very commonplace.”\nSince 2015, Rooftop Republic has been helping organisations to design and run their own urban farms on top of their office buildings, hoping to expose city folk to the basics of food production.\nThe difference that makes, she said, is “you’re connected to food on a daily basis, in proximity to where you live, where you work and where you play”.\nAnd it fits into the sustainability practices of more and more companies nowadays, like developer Sino Group, which is integrating urban farming across its property portfolio.\n“We treasure the food and the produce that we can harvest together,” said the company’s senior sustainability manager, Melanie Kwok.\n“In a city area like this, we can actually set aside our worries … and just enjoy nourishing the mind and body.”\nOver in Singapore, Edible Garden City is on a similar mission, helping to set up farms in schools, malls and office buildings since 2012. Both Rooftop Republic and Edible Garden City are DBS Foundation grant winners.\n“We want people to experience the entire process of growing their own food and … how hard it is,” said Bjorn Low, the social enterprise’s 39-year-old co-founder.\n“It’s that individual journey they have to go through to make them appreciate food a little more.”\nHOME GROWERS\nThere is also a movement of home growers building up in Singapore, going by the urban farming groups sprouting online, with members ranging from beginners to advanced gardeners and living even in small flats.\nWoon, for example, started growing pak choi and\xa0kangkong\xa0(water spinach) on her balcony in September.\n“I wanted to engage with the process of growing (food) so that I could understand what it feels like, what it means to produce my own food and to allow that to feed my family,” she said.\nBut her first few attempts did not go smoothly. “Every single morning, I’d wake up and (be) like, ‘Why aren’t you sprouting yet?’” she recalled. “You should be germinating in three days, and why aren’t you doing that?”\nAfter having to wait, her seedlings turned out limp. “I got very anxious. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I can’t fail,’” she said.\nI think I put more effort into growing\xa0kangkong\xa0and bok choy than I did for my A levels.\nWhen she finally got to see her plants grow from “this small dot” into luscious vegetables, she was “wowed”.\nBut did growing her own food really make her waste less? “When I was younger, I didn’t eat a lot of stems … Now I’m like, ‘You know what? Just eat it,” she cited.\n“I appreciate what I’m eating and therefore I just eat the bulk of it as much as I can.”\nAnother home grower, Gerald Foo, realised that with his own vegetables, fruits and herbs within reach, he buys less in the supermarket and thus wastes less.\n“In the past, when I wanted to cook a pasta or something, and I needed … basil or parsley, (I’d) pop down to the shops. And you know you’ve got to buy a whole packet,” said the 44-year-old.\n“The rest (of the packet) ends up going to waste, whereas now I grow my own stuff … I just go and cut up (what’s needed).”\nIt makes his family more aware of their “impact on nature”, like the carbon miles of their food purchases.\n“We’d think about … the meals that we’re going to cook in the next two or three days. And what do we need to make those meals? And then we’d buy just those things,” he added.\nHaving become conscious of every bit of waste they generate at home since they started growing food, both Woon and Foo are composting their scraps.\n“We most recently thought about food waste as … the ends of our vegetables (that we cut off). That’s also food, and it’s now being used productively,” said Foo. “It becomes fertiliser for the next thing that I want to grow.”\nWoon even has about 100 worms to produce vermicompost. “My parents also started saving their food peels for my worms,” she said proudly. “They’re aware that this is important for growing.\n“Food isn’t a linear process … There’s a way of making things exist in a more circular manner.”\nGOING NATIVE\nUrban farming is not just about changing the way city folk value food, however; it has a hand in reducing global food wastage because “it offers an alternative supply chain”, said food waste expert Daisy Tam.\nSingapore and Hong Kong currently import more than 90 per cent of their food, and this supply chain is flawed.\n“In the global food system, food loss and food waste happen at every step of the way, from the field — from production — to distribution to storage,” noted Tam, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University.\n“Because the supply chain is so long, we’re inevitably participating in a very wasteful system. So shortening the supply chain is one way of not participating in that.”\nNotably, urban farming is one of the areas in Singapore's Green Plan —\xa0unveiled last month —\xa0where there will be initiatives to strengthen the Republic as a location for global and local companies to develop new sustainability solutions.\nGrowing the demand for native edible plants may have a part to play in that effort.\nSome of the vegetables Singaporeans like to eat, such as choi sum, pak choi and\xa0kailan, “aren’t climatically suited for Singapore”, pointed out Low. “They’re nicer to grow in colder climates.”\nOn the other hand, food such as\xa0sayur manis,\xa0ulam raja\xa0(a herb) and cat’s whiskers (another herb) grow well on the island. “(It’s) so much more ecological to grow those because they’re perennials — they don’t need re-seeding,” he said.\nPaying more attention to long-neglected local species could then be a way to replace more imports. The idea is to “create a more productive landscape” beyond just urban farms.\n“Instead of growing an ornamental tree, perhaps we could be growing a food-producing tree,” he suggested. “Instead of having a green plot ratio, could we come up with a nutritional index?\nSo if we plant one moringa tree (horseradish tree), how much protein is that producing for the community?\nThere are already more than 1,600 community gardens across Singapore, so he has hopes of seeing increased decentralisation in the food system. “Perhaps more community farms can also be their (supermarkets’ and wet markets’) source of supply,” he added.\nThese are opportunities not to be sniffed at in cities like Singapore or Hong Kong, believes Tsui — not when the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that relying “so heavily” on the “global industrial food chain” can leave populations vulnerable to disruptions.\n“There are a lot of other untapped spaces, like car parks, like playgrounds, like other open areas,” said the chief executive officer of Rooftop Republic and also Hong’s husband.\n“We truly believe that (by) tapping into those untapped resources … we’re able to actualise and implement a local, decentralised food system.”\nSo far, the social enterprise has converted 65 rooftop spaces into productive farms spanning 70,000 square feet, and worked with clients including hotels and restaurants. The potential cultivable space on Hong Kong’s rooftops, however, soars to six million square metres.\n“That area is equivalent to the land that’s currently being farmed in Hong Kong,” noted Hong. “Essentially, if we were to convert all the rooftops into farms, we’d be doubling the amount of food that Hong Kong is producing.”\nMORE WAYS TO GET INVOLVED\nTo get more people involved and create more talent for future urban farms, the Rooftop Republic Academy was started in 2019 with support from the DBS Foundation. It offers workshops for beginners as well as professional vocational courses.\n“The idea behind the academy is … for city dwellers from all walks of life to get their foot in the door,” said Rooftop Republic co-founder Pol Fabrega, 56.\nLooking at how far they have taken urban farming, Hong said the co-founders are “very encouraged”.\n“I quit my job (in communications and advertising) to start Rooftop Republic. And I was like, ‘Oh dear, after … one year, am I going to (have to) eat my own veggies to survive?’” she recalled with a laugh.\nLike her, Low quit the advertising industry when he became an urban farmer. At this point, he is also striving to “build capacity within local people and local spaces”, to ensure that there is “knowledge”, “infrastructure” and “excitement”.\n“So when there’s a time of need, everyone can go out and participate in that process. Everyone will have some knowledge of sowing a seed and growing food,” he said.\nIt may take “some time to unlock it”, thinks Nagpaul, but she does not doubt that urban farming “has a lot of potential” to create a ripple effect.\nIt helps that growing food at home “doesn’t cost much”, said Woon, who recommended starting with\xa0kangkong\xa0to those thinking of giving it a shot.\n“Even if you fail … it’s a matter of just being okay with failure,” she added. “That was also something that I learned.”\nStill, not everybody gets to grow their own food at home. And one group in Taiwan has found another way to connect consumers directly with their food supply, by letting them share in the experiences of farmers.\nOn the Buy Directly From Farmers e-commerce platform, consumers can adopt a plot of land and watch, in real time, as farmers battle with the elements to plant and harvest crops.\n“You’d be able to better understand the difficulties,” said the social enterprise’s founder, King Hsin I. “Then (consumers) would cherish their food better. When they make their choices, they won’t choose perfectly round pears or perfectly red apples.”\nAlso, while shopping on the site, they can get to know the growers and put a face to the food they buy.\nBuy Directly From Farmers goes so far as to advise consumers that every bit of their vegetable or fruit, right down to its skin, can be eaten.\nFor example, one can fry eggs with dragon fruit peel or cornsilk, and “it’s delicious”, cited King. “Then you’d reduce a lot of food waste — you make good use of the food that’s grown … for months.”\nLast year, when the social enterprise launched food boxes that included seemingly unusable products, DBS was “very supportive” in buying boxes, she added.\nConsumers, too, can support enterprises like this that are fighting against food wastage. They can also shop differently by buying only the groceries they need and not throw away food that is slightly blemished or close to expiry.\nIt seems such a big, global problem, but the man or woman in the street can make a difference.\n“Whether (by) exercising our consumer rights and requesting different practices (in) the shops, to voting with your dollar and buying in different places … to lobbying or advocating different practices, these are all ways in which we can participate,” said Tam.\nThis article by CNA Insider was done in collaboration with DBS.

      Why our food supply chain is flawed, and these champions’ efforts to stop the waste
  </h1>, 'text': 'MUMBAI and JAKARTA: Singapore had a taste of it during the “circuit breaker” — when egg distributors were throwing away eggs amid an oversupply, with imports up while demand fell.\nOne merchant discarded as many as 250,000 eggs after they went bad in storage. Worldwide, many more eggs were smashed, vegetables and fruits were destroyed and milk dumped.\nIt is one thing, however, to have it happen in a place like Singapore, ranked number one in the Global Food Security Index; it is another to dump food in countries struggling to combat hunger, malnutrition and poverty.\nBut the latter happens every day because of flaws in the global food supply chain, even before COVID-19.\nIn Asia, up to 40 per cent of food is lost after harvesting, during handling and storage — never making it to the shops at all.\nThat is what is happening in India, home to a third of the world’s malnourished children. Indian authorities have estimated that close to 60 million tonnes of grains, fruits and vegetables are lost out of total annual production.\n“It means that every week, every family in India could be gifted with 5kg of fruit and vegetables ... if we save these losses,” said Vaibhav Tidke, the 34-year-old chief executive officer of food preservation company S4S Technologies.\nIn Indonesia, one of Singapore’s main partner countries for food imports, there are also food losses of up to 40 per cent due to inefficiencies in the supply chain, noted I Made Supartha Utama, a professor from Udayana University.\nWATCH: Why so much food is lost in the supply chain (15:23)\nAs CNA Insider finds out, it is an uphill battle for fresh produce in these countries to reach consumers. But there are solutions too, and what is being to stop the food waste could help farmers in the process.\nWHEN THE RAINS COME\nOne of the biggest problems faced by players in India’s food supply chain is the country’s erratic weather. In 2019, for example, it “rained extensively”, pointed out onion wholesaler Abdul Rahman Shaikh.\nIt is not an uncommon issue — traders in Singapore and Malaysia have recently lost vegetable supplies amid the rainy season.\nBut India is particularly vulnerable because farmers do not have proper storage facilities. Sometimes they even use road surfaces to dry their produce.\nNeither is there adequate infrastructure such as refrigeration during the long market routes across rural India, nor at the distribution or wholesale centres.\n“In (the case of) potato, if water touches it … it rots after two days or three days. It reduces the shelf life of the produce,” cited Sanjeev Maniyal, an onion and potato wholesaler in Mumbai.\n“Generally, within 24 hours (or) the same day, we (have to) sell it … Keeping (produce) in cold storage or storerooms isn’t advisable because the electricity (charges) are high here.”\nTonnes of produce, especially staples like onions, end up rotting. “Quite often … the stock is damaged and can’t be used,” said Abdul Rahman. “There’s no other way but to throw it away.”\nDuring the rainy seasons in Indonesia, food loss also increases by 10 to 20 per cent, according to Muhammad Firdaus, a professor from Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB) University.\n“(The farmers) have very bad packaging … to protect the fruits, to protect the staples, and (the rain) damages the products,” he said.\nAnd with climate change, there is now the threat of more unseasonable weather in more countries.\nSCIENCE FOR SOCIETY\nBut what if food loss could be prevented right after harvesting?\nThat question led seven university friends in Mumbai to start S4S (Science for Society) Technologies as a social enterprise in 2013. And they have a simple but effective solution to food spoilage: Solar conduction dryers.\n“We’re taking out the moisture from (perishables). And because of that, it gives them an extended shelf life of one year (without chemicals),” said co-founder Tushar Gaware, 37.\nTheir patented, United Nations award-winning technology dehydrates a range of produce, like onions, turmeric, ginger, garlic and potatoes, which S4S buys up from farmers and sends for processing in villages nearby.\nThey even take lower-grade produce, the type that middlemen reject.\n“What we’re proposing to farmers (is) you take out something that goes as waste, which is good food but which cannot be sustained during the entire logistics from farmer to consumer,” said Tidke.\n“(We) do the processing so that (they) get a good rate.”\nS4S sends its dehydrated products to India’s National Institute of Nutrition for testing, and the data shows that “almost 90 to 95 per cent” of the nutrients are retained, said Gaware.\n“The nutrition (is) one of the highest in the globe,” said Tidke. “It makes the product as good as the fresh product.”\nThe dried fruits and vegetables are finally sorted, graded and packed at S4S’ factory in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, before they are sold.\n“That material is rightly packed so that there’s no moisture that goes in, and then the freshness remains intact during the entire processing,” added Tidke.\nThe products go to\xa0more than\xa0700 industry customers, including Nestle, Indian Railways, hotels and restaurants across the country. For restaurant owner Naresh Shetty in Mumbai, it means there is no longer the wastage of the past when he orders onions.\n“Mostly, the lower part of the (onions) got totally rotten,” he said. “It affected the revenue of the restaurant.”\nInitially, however, he was not convinced S4S’ dehydrated onions would be the answer; he was concerned that his regulars would tell the difference in his gravy. But they did not.\n“My chef tasted it, my staff tasted it, everyone said it was good,” he said.\nS4S believes that its model of reducing food loss is also good enough for the rest of the farming world.\nIts products are now used in over a million meals daily, and it is looking to grow the business with mentorship from DBS Foundation.\n“In every other (Indian) state, and even every other Third World country … there are also the same issues,” said co-founder Ashwin Pawade, 33. “Their produce goes to waste because of a lack of processing.\nThe scale is huge, and that’s how the potential for impact is also huge.\nPEELING BACK THE LAYERS\nOne country that sees a lot of food loss in the traditional supply chain is Indonesia. Here, fresh produce passes through several layers, from farmers to village traders to wholesalers to distributors and finally to retailers.\nFood is passed from hand to hand and squashed into trucks.\n“(The middlemen) pack 60kg of fruits in wooden boxes,” said Firdaus. “If someone picks up 60kg of fruits in a wooden box, they’d pick it up slowly, but they’d put it down very fast.”\nNot only is damage caused by poor handling such as this, but also the transport of food can span a few days, which means more time without proper storage.\n“It’s a fragmented sector, and most of the players are traditional, and they don’t have this cold storage,” said Pamitra Wineka, the president of agri-tech start-up\xa0TaniHub Group.\n“This is basically why … middlemen always take quite a big mark-up — because they also lose a certain amount.”\nHis solution is to shorten the supply chain. In 2016, he and his co-founders set-up their company to help farmers sell fresh produce through its business-to-business e-commerce platform, TaniHub.\nIt has five distribution hubs in Bandung, Bogor, Surabaya and Yogyakarta on the island of Java and in Bali. Goods go straight from the farms to these hubs, where they are sorted, and then to customers.\n“We can transport the goods as soon as possible,” said Wineka. “(Customers) get their vegetables in a fresh condition, and we also don’t need to compensate for … waste shrinkage.”\nTaniHub’s warehouses are equipped with cold storage facilities, with different temperatures suitable for tropical fruits and that are much lower, for example around eight degrees Celsius for leafy vegetables.\nTo improve productivity, the company built a packing and processing centre last year in Malang, East Java, where machines are used to wash, dry, wax and sort fruits.\nWith minimal human touch, there is even less poor handling, and the processing time is also reduced.\n“Your hands sometimes produce sweat, right? And it would ruin the quality of the goods,” said Vincentius Sariyo, the director of TaniSupply, the company’s supply chain services unit.\n“(The sorting camera) can take around 30 pictures of each fruit to see the blemishes … If there’s very damaged skin, it would go back and be re-sorted.”\nThe company still helps farmers to sell “ugly” fruits, by finding willing takers and thus reducing food waste further.\nFood-maker Malang Strudel, for example, does not choose its apples based on the smoothness of the skin. “We want fresh fruits. The fresh fruits have to also be delivered on time,” said chief executive officer Budi Sudarmono.\n“The waste produced (before working with TaniHub) was around 10 to 15 per cent, but now there’s no more waste. The apples that we receive are good-quality apples. They’re all ready for production on our side.”\nHELPING FARMERS REAP THE HARVEST\nTaniHub also helps farmers by encouraging them to adopt best practices. “We tell them, ‘Look, if you pile up (the produce), this is your rejection rate … (which) in the end will also lower the value of your product,’” said Sariyo.\nIf you, for example, divide (the transport) into two trips … it means that there’s more chance for (you) to sell more.\nFood spoilage is not the only major issue, however, in long supply chains. Small-scale farmers have little to no contact with consumers, so they do not know how much to produce to match market demand.\nFor many of them, like Totok Harianto from Malang regency, that sometimes led to overproduction — and food waste.\nDuring the year-end wet season, for example, he usually found that 40 to 50 per cent of his supply of pisang\xa0mas\xa0(a banana variety) “wasn’t absorbed by the market”.\n“It’s really a waste because the quality was still good,” said the 43-year-old.\nSariyo has seen some farmers even throw their crops into the river. “They’re frustrated,” said the 45-year-old. “They say, ‘If I do the harvesting, the harvest cost is higher than my product (value).’”\nThat is why TaniHub is bridging the gap between farmers and consumers by advising farmers on what, and how much, the market wants so they can better plan their harvests.\n“In helping to reduce food loss, of course we need to start … from the planning itself,” said Sariyo. “After working with us, it’s proven that they can significantly reduce their food loss or waste (by) more than 95 per cent.”\nHarianto has seen instances of oversupply “greatly decreasing” on his part, and appreciates the complementary role played by TaniHub, which has partnered more than 30,000 smallholder farmers.\nWith market clarity provided by the company, he also agreed to grow Honi pineapples recently because this variety is more in demand. “I hope that by planting this new variety … we’ll be able to enjoy higher profits,” he said.\nHIGH-TECH SOLUTIONS FROM SINGAPORE\nSo when it comes to reducing food supply leakages, it is clear that innovative technology — to prevent food from going bad quickly — and minimising the number of stages in the supply chain are two things that make a difference.\nBut the solutions can be found not just in nations with a vast agrarian sector. A country like Singapore can play a part too.\nFor example, scientists at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology are taking silk from silkworm cocoons and turning them into a coating that stops food from rotting. The material is both water-resistant and edible.\n“It makes a barrier … that’s very thin, and it’s transparent. And the barrier is very good at keeping … micro-organisms out,” said Benedetto Marelli from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and its research enterprise in Singapore.\n”It lasts until you wash it away or you’ve eaten (the food).”\nIt works “very well” on avocado, cherries, fish fillet, mango, meat and zucchini, according to the assistant professor. “We know it works on strawberries and bananas from the early experiments. It works very well on leafy greens as well.”\nHe added: “This technology can have a big impact … in the region, (where) you don’t have the cold chain … while (food) passes from one hand to the other or when it’s exposed to bad weather.”\nHis team is not the only one thinking about the possibilities for reducing loss in the food supply chain.\nAnother group of scientists at the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a process for turning pineapple leaves into a low-cost aerogel that, when treated with active carbon powder, can keep food from rotting for at least two weeks.\n“This can be used for preserving vegetables and fruits during transportation,” pointed out NUS associate professor Duong Hai Minh.\nBesides these types of technologies, consumers and food and beverage businesses can also help by buying locally and, where possible, sourcing produce from farmers directly or from organisations that support them and have good practices, such as TaniHub and S4S, which is a DBS Foundation grant awardee.\nIt could go a long way towards changing the food industry for the better.\nThis article by CNA Insider was done in collaboration with DBS.

      When over 7 tonnes of chicken is discarded daily — the alarming scale of food waste in Asia
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: They would have made juicy chicken breasts, drumsticks, legs and wings, enough for hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans. But these chickens are not making it to your dinner plates.\nBecause that is the amount of chicken meat being wasted at slaughterhouses here — every day.\nSocial entrepreneur Nicholas Lim was shocked when he saw it with his own eyes, after a chicken supplier let him on a little-known market problem: The supplier was throwing away seven to 15 tonnes of perfectly good, usable chicken parts daily.\nThat is equivalent to 70,000 to 150,000 meals of chicken. And there are many more suppliers in Singapore — about 13 distributors supply more than 90 per cent of the fresh chicken products here.\n“I was like, ‘How much money are you guys throwing away every single day?’” said Lim, co-founder of TreeDots, a start-up that redistributes food supplies.\n“And then it hit me. It’s not just seven to 15 tonnes of food being wasted, but seven to 15 tonnes of lives that are being thrown away.”\nIt is happening not only to chickens either. Singapore, along with many cities in Asia, is losing all kinds of food.\nIn 2019, Singapore generated 744,000 tonnes of food waste, while more than half of global food wastage happens in Asia. Most of this happens before consumers buy their food, so all those resources used in food production are wasted too.\nIn a three-part series, CNA Insider hits the regional food trail – from the retail and distribution stages all the way to the farms – for a deeper look at why these food supply problems exist, and the efforts on the ground in places like Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore to fight food waste.\nAnd as it turns out, consumers can also help to ensure that more food becomes available for all instead of being lost.\nBUFFER STOCKS\nOn the surface, there seems to be little risk of supermarkets here running out of food — an assurance given even at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd to make sure of that — for example when it comes to fresh chicken — supermarkets and other retailers tend to contractually bind their suppliers to bring in a 10 to 20 per cent buffer stock daily, just in case.\nThese are live chickens imported from farms around the region and slaughtered here. But if there is no surge in consumer demand, retailers do not need to take the surplus stock.\n“(Suppliers) try to sell it. If they can’t, they store it. If they store it for too long, they throw it (away),” said Lim, 28. “They need avenues to try and clear it every day … Storage space is expensive.”\nBuffer stocks are thus one of the biggest contributors to food waste. While retailers do make sales projections, these are not 100 per cent accurate.\n“In theory, if you’re 70 per cent accurate in your forecast, you’re considered very accurate already,” said Lim. This makes buffer stocks “the easier way out” compared to “trying to improve on the forecasting model”.\n“(Retailers) kind of need the buffer because households can’t stand the fact that certain common products are out of stock,” he added.\n“For example, if I … want to buy a chicken whole leg, and if a supermarket doesn’t have chicken whole legs, it’ll cause quite a big fuss in the supermarket.”\nIf there is overstocking, on the other hand, there are “no repercussions” for retailers. The competition between suppliers means retail buyers call the shots.\n“(A supplier) would rather have a buffer than have … a buyer go to another supplier,” Lim said. “The cost of lost sales is higher than the cost of buffer stocks or the disposal of buffer stocks.”\nBEAUTY STANDARDS\nSince 2018, Lim has been looking into the ways businesses generate meat waste in Singapore. And he found that these situations arise for reasons as simple as “cosmetic” filtering.\nEven the weight of a chicken can determine what retailers sell or choose not to. The standard chicken size, for example, is 1.2kg. But “there’ll be situations where they’re just not the weight that’s stated” — either undersized or oversized.\n“They can still be eaten, but simply because of cosmetic business requirements, they get lost in the end in the entire process chain,” he said.\nSometimes the chickens suffer broken bones or get bruises while being transported to Singapore. These are also rejected by buyers, in lockstep with consumer perception that “that’s not a normal chicken anymore”.\n“Because supermarkets have to display the nicest out there … this becomes your standard perception of how food should look,” he said, citing chicken rice stalls as another example that reinforces the idea of how “nice” food should look.\n“But in reality, it’s not the case … When you catch a chicken to slaughter it, (it’s) going to struggle and … get injuries.”\nColour makes a difference too. For example, beef that is darker than the usual bright red, but of good quality and just as safe, does not normally make it to supermarket shelves.\nEven centimetres matter, like in the case of mushrooms. Ban Choon Marketing, Singapore’s leading importer and wholesaler of fresh produce, has to measure the size of its mushroom heads because buyers are unwilling to accept uneven sizes.\n“I think it’s because consumers want the best when they pay,” said executive director Michelle Tan. “That trickles down to perhaps (our) customers being more stringent in their requirements.”\nIt also trickles down to farmers, who sometimes must go to great lengths to meet the expectations of retailers and consumers.\nFor example, Hou Chun Nan in Taiwan used to stick paper on his\xa0ponkan\xa0(a type of mandarin orange) to prevent skin discolouration, which happens if one side of the fruit is always exposed to direct sunlight while it is growing.\nAnd if the skin colour of a fruit is uneven, it would be removed during the grading process. “It doesn’t sell well in the market because when we buy fruits, we tend to choose the prettier ones,” he noted.\nWATCH: Why are we throwing away perfectly edible food? (16:13)\nNOT EXPIRED, BUT NOT USED\nFood also tends to go to waste when it has passed half of its shelf life, even if there are six months to a year left before expiry. This affects dry products and processed foods, for example.\n“If these products … aren’t moved at the rate that we’d agreed upon or a rate that we thought would be optimal, then that results in products sitting out here in our warehouse with less than that required period,” said Tan.\nIf the food is already on the shelves, retailers would typically return it, as consumers have a habit of buying food with the latest manufacturing date.\nChilled items, with a shorter shelf life, are particularly susceptible to wastage.\n“We used to throw (away) 100 tubs of yoghurt … about 50kg of yoghurt whenever we had issues with flight delays,” said Hay Shiwei, the founder and director of food distributor Atasco, which focuses on supplying online grocers.\nIts organic yoghurts, for example, have a 14-day shelf life. “So when we list the items, whatever they buy has to have a minimum shelf life of eight days,” he cited.\n“When (one) shipment was delayed for five days … we had only nine days of shelf life left when the product finally arrived in Singapore. So we only had one day to sell everything that we’d planned to sell for a week.”\nIn supermarkets, food such as milk is arranged accordingly, with items closer to their expiration date displayed at the front. But there are consumers who take the ones with a longer shelf life instead.\nRetailers also return food that is approaching its best-before date, while some consumers do not know the difference between the best-before and use-by dates. The latter is the date after which the food must not be sold.\n“I’ve had lots of products way past their best-before dates, and they’re still very good for consumption,” noted Hay.\nSo whenever there’s wastage, I’d think, ‘How am I going to use these products? In what way can I save them? Would anyone want them if I were to give them away?’\nREACHING OUT TO CONSUMERS\nThe 38-year-old found the answers in June 2019 when he discovered Treatsure, a mobile platform connecting suppliers and businesses like hotels that have surplus food to everyday consumers.\n“Where we come in is as a secondary channel for them (companies) to start selling items that they couldn’t have (sold through) other channels,” said Preston Wong, the 31-year-old chief executive and lead innovator at Treatsure.\n“Consumers see whatever there is (put up by suppliers), then they go about ordering as you would on an e-commerce platform.”\nIn the past year, the number of subscribers to Treatsure’s app has grown by three times and now stands at over 20,000 users who are seemingly not so fussed about food that comes with little dings or are nearing expiry.\nThey are saving not only food but also money, as Treatsure works out a “special rate” with its partners for their excess products.\nIn Hong Kong, a group of young people have gone even further.\nThe three founders of GreenPrice — who were university students when they started their social enterprise — have opened stores that sell nothing but near-expiry goods, also known as short-dated food. The goal: To change Hongkongers’ attitude towards these foods.\n“They aren’t that willing to purchase items that are short-dated … thinking that the quality would’ve deteriorated,” cited GreenPrice co-founder Terence Hon, 23.\nThis is why the young co-founders “put a lot of energy into developing stores” — to educate consumers about the different product labels with a little personal attention.\n“Our staff usually go up to customers to introduce them to the best-before dates and the use-by dates,” said Hon.\n“(We) even provide some samples for (customers) to taste the products … so that they can make the right decision and have confidence in short-dated items.”\nThat confidence is growing “bit by bit, year by year”. Based on consumers’ “acceptance” levels, GreenPrice sells food items that go up to three months past the best-before date.\nFour years since its first store opened, GreenPrice has four stores now helping nearly 700 suppliers to sell these goods, mainly to younger, eco-conscious and white-collar customers.\nUNWANTED NO MORE\nOver in Taiwan, social enterprise Goodwill Foods is helping farmers to minimise food waste by increasing the use of “off-grade products” as much as possible, said co-founder Lin Ya Wen.\nHou is one of these farmers who sell the so-called “ugly” fruits in their harvest to Goodwill Foods, which turns them into jams for sale.\n“This kind of\xa0ponkan\xa0is very suitable for the processing industry,” said Lin, explaining that the side of the orange more exposed to sunlight has less juice, which aids in the drying process.\n“We tell the farmers directly that you just sell us the off-grade products that we need. Whatever price you want … we’ll accept.”\nThe jams are used by several food and beverage businesses, and doing so well that they have won awards. “As long as the products you’re making don’t rely on the fruit’s appearances, you can use these ‘ugly’ fruits,” Lin noted.\nGoodwill Foods has also collaborated with DBS Bank and other “large companies in recent years” that have bought the social enterprise’s products, which include dried fruits and a soon-to-be-launched fruit beverage.\nTreeDots is doing likewise in Singapore, by seeking out food businesses that are willing to buy unwanted, surplus meat and seafood. That includes animal parts that are less popular, such as chicken breast.\n“When a supplier or slaughterhouse terms a product as ‘unpopular’, it’s because they don’t devote resources to look for that small, niche segment that these unpopular products could cater for,” said Lim.\n“Healthier stalls, salad bars and stuff are more than happy to use fresh chicken breast … And all the gym people and (such) are happy to consume all this breast meat.”\nTreeDots is now redistributing food to more than 1,300 businesses at bargain prices. Last year, it reached out directly to consumers too, and now has 82 group-buy communities who shop with it.\nFor example, Rachel Lum and her neighbours in their condominium buy their groceries in bulk every week, and do not mind a little imperfection in their food.\n“We do this group buy so that everybody can enjoy the benefit of having cheaper prices of food,” she said.\nTreeDots is also teaming up with The Food Bank Singapore and DBS to donate supplies to underprivileged families, with a separate app for this initiative in the pilot phase.\nTreeDots, Treatsure and GreenPrice are supported by DBS Foundation, while Goodwill Foods and The Food Bank Singapore are DBS community partners.\nTHE RIPPLE EFFECT\nIn the three years since TreeDots started, it has saved about 2,300 tonnes of food, or the equivalent of 23 million meals. Lim called this “a drop in the ocean” of food waste in Singapore.\n“We’re not even near to clearing what the market requires us to,” he said, citing international estimates that 80 per cent of food waste comes from businesses.\nHe is “hopeful” about less food loss “because (he) can see the results of whatever we’ve done so far”. But he also knows that changing consumers’ perception is “not as easy as we thought”.\nFor instance, there are new TreeDots customers who ask why their chicken looks yellowish or has blood or feathers, or why their codfish has bones. Nonetheless, he treats these complaints as a “good” thing.\n“They raise (these questions) in group chats. So when we answer them, we see that as an opportunity to also educate everyone else in that particular group … There might be a ripple effect,” he said.\n“They could tell their kids or their friends … that these products are okay.”\nTreeDots is also gaining more reach by working with supermarkets like Hao Mart to have a segment of shelf space for the social enterprise’s non-cosmetically-filtered products, starting with red meat.\n“We want people to start to recognise that this is an issue,” Lim said. “The root cause (of food loss) comes from demand that’s flawed … (The needle) won’t move if consumers are still demanding super perfect products.”\nConsumers should also stop thinking that they cannot make an adequate impact as individuals, according to Singapore University of Social Sciences senior lecturer Tania Nagpaul. “People need to rise above these misgivings,” she said.\n“Once they become a part of the solution, albeit a very small part of the solution, they begin to influence others and take others along with them.”\nEchoing this, food waste expert and Hong Kong Baptist University assistant professor Daisy Tam said: “Consumers would say, well, supermarkets offer only these kind of choices. And then the supermarket says, well, consumers are only after these particular selections.\n“So I think both have a responsibility.”\nThis article by CNA Insider was done in collaboration with DBS.

      Malaysia needs better EV infrastructure to avoid 'anxiety' on road trips, drivers say
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mr Koh Jie Meng has driven from Singapore to different parts of Malaysia more than 20 times in his electric Hyundai Kona SUV since he bought the car in 2019.\nHe described the journeys as “smooth and seamless” now, but he acknowledged that this was not always the case during his first few attempts at driving from his home near Yishun to Kuala Lumpur for business meetings.\n“At the start, I had some anxiety because I started driving too fast on the highways. I learnt that you have to watch your speed, travel only at 100 to 110kmh so I can get there easily,” said Mr Koh.\nHe is now more seasoned but he did learn some lessons the hard way.\nHe figured out that speeding would deplete the car’s battery life sooner and would leave him scrambling to find an electric charging point along the journey.\nHe also shared that putting the air conditioner at\xa0full blast while being stuck in traffic congestion at the Causeway would also drain the battery fast.\nMr Koh outlined that the most important factor in completing the journey safely was planning.\n“You need to know your car’s battery range. For my Kona, it is a long-range electric car so I can do a single charge run. This means I can drive straight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in one shot without the need to charge along the way,” said Mr Koh.\nDrivers like Mr Koh have learnt that driving an electric car in Malaysia can be challenging given that the country still lacks the infrastructure that supports electric vehicles usage en masse.\nThere are only around 300 electric charging points across the country, with most of them concentrated along the west coast and the Klang Valley.\nFurthermore, these drivers are also aware that there are not enough workshops or repair services specific for electric vehicles in Malaysia, in case urgent work is needed.\nHowever, they note that the situation has improved recently and there is optimism that travelling with an electric car for a road trip in Malaysia could be a more viable option in the future.\nMORE CHARGING POINTS IN KL, NORTH-SOUTH EXPRESSWAY\nMr Shahrol Halmi, president of the Malaysian Electric Vehicle Owners Club (MyEVOC), told CNA that the charging situation has improved vastly along\xa0the west coast from when he bought his car four years ago.\n“When I first got the car, it was kind of pathetic - the kind of DC rapid charging infrastructure outside of Kuala Lumpur. So you fast forward to this year, actually there are already a pair of 50kW DC chargers in operation in Ayer Keroh Rest Stop, both north and south bound,” said Mr Shahrol.\nDirect current (DC) charging points are fast charging, and typically takes an hour to charge a car fully. Alternating current (AC) charging points could take up to eight hours.\nMr Shahrol bought his electric car, a Tesla S 75, in 2017. He is based in Kuala Lumpur but has used the car to travel across various parts of Peninsular Malaysia.\nHe noted that of the estimated 300 charging points in the country, only a handful are DC points, and these are mainly concentrated on the west coast of the peninsula.\nHe lauded the move by local company JomCharge, which announced last October that DC chargers will be installed at various points along North-South Expressway to reduce range anxiety for electric car drivers travelling between major\xa0cities like Johor Bahru, Melaka, Kuala Lumpur and Penang.\nBesides the chargers at Ayer Keroh rest stop in Melaka, JomCharge is also set to install DC fast charging points at rest and relaxation (RnR) pitstops in Skudai, Johor as well as Bukit Gantang, near Ipoh, Perak.\nMr Shahrol said: “For Singaporeans who want to come to Malaysia for a road trip or holiday, there are charging points along the way for their electric cars. If they want to head to KL, Ayer Keroh is conveniently located mid-journey. There are absolutely no issues.”\nHe added that in Kuala Lumpur, there are currently three DC charging points, with two more set to be built soon.\nA Singaporean driver who made regular road trips to Malaysia,\xa0Lee Hon Sing,\xa0expressed surprise at how little money he had to spend charging his car during the trips.\n“In KL, the fast chargers are free to use. Even the chargers at my hotel, near Sunway Lagoon, were free as well,” he said.\nThe IT programmer owns two electric cars which he uses for these trips – a Hyundai Kona and a Renault Zoe.\nBefore the borders were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Lee drove his Hyundai Kona, which is a long-range car, to Kuala Lumpur.\nOn paper, his car had enough range to complete the journey without recharging but he was worried and decided to charge at Ayer Keroh just in case.\n“It is possible to drive the car from my house near Jurong area to Kuala Lumpur. But the first time I did it, I was a bit scared,” said Mr Lee.\xa0\n“I did a top-up at Ayer Keroh for 40 minutes. But when I reached KL, I did my calculations and figured out that even if I did not top up, I would have had 80km of distance to spare. So it’s actually quite safe, and the range balance is comfortable,” added the 57-year-old.\nMr Shahrol shared that the MyEVOC community has also extended advice and help to Singapore drivers who have planned road trips with their electric cars.\n“I remember in 2019 a Singaporean guy was driving a 20kW (Hyundai)\xa0Ioniq\xa0up to KL. He needed to charge along the way so we were guiding him. I think he eventually stopped in Seremban for a charge, some of us were ready to go there and help,” he said.\n“But fast forward to this year onwards, it\'s pretty easy for any electric car to come up to Kuala Lumpur\xa0by fast charging at Ayer Keroh,” added Mr Shahrol.\nROAD TRIPS TO THE EAST COAST “A BIT OF A GAMBLE”\nFor Singaporean electric car owners who want to drive to Johor Bahru over the weekend when the border reopens, Mr Koh said a two-hour to three-hour congestion at the Causeway would only reduce the battery life by around 3 per cent if the driver sets\xa0the air-conditioner at full blast.\xa0\nIf drivers need to charge their cars, he pointed out that there are AC charging stations located at IKEA Tebrau, a popular shopping destination for Singaporeans.\nMr Shahrol also noted that most of the hotels in Desaru Coast, a popular beach holiday destination, have charging points for electric cars.\nHowever,\xa0there needs to be more DC\xa0charging points across the country, especially on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, he added.\xa0\nRoad trips to the east coast could be risky as there are barely any charging points, he said.\n“For trips to the east coast like Terengganu and Kuantan (in Pahang), Kelantan, it’s still a bit of a gamble, because there are only a few AC charging stations at some of the hotels in that area. It does require a bit more work, a bit more planning,” said Mr Shahrol.\nMr Koh recalled that he once drove his Hyundai Kona from Singapore to Kuantan, a 340km journey on the east coast.\nHe knew that there were no DC chargers along the journey so he would not recommend that route for drivers.\n“My (Hyundai) Kona is a long-range car so it had enough to complete the journey, there was also enough charge to overtake trucks along the way,” said Mr Koh.\nHowever, he had to travel inland the following day to Subang, near Kuala Lumpur, to charge his car fully at a DC point before heading back home.\n“When I arrived in Kuantan, I charged the car at my friend\'s landed house for a bit. The next day, I drove to Subang for a fast charge,” he added.\nLACK OF REPAIR OPTIONS\nBesides charging points, another factor that triggers anxiety for electric car drivers is the lack of repair options if things go wrong.\nMr Shahrol, the MyEVOC president, said that in case of breakdown or repair, there are merely “one or two” workshops in Kuala Lumpur\xa0that\xa0are able to resolve EV repair issues.\n“For such services, it’s still quite early yet (for Malaysia). Only these workshops are good at repairing EVs and they know not to mess things up when they look at it,” he added.\nOver the last four years, Mr Shahrol has had to send his Tesla S 75 to Hong Kong twice for warranty repair claims, after encountering issues with his central screen.\nAlthough the costs were covered as his car was still under warranty, he maintained that it would be more convenient if Malaysia had a Tesla workshop, or other electric car specialised workshops.\n“It’s just the inconvenience of loading it up into a container, going over there, servicing it, repairing it and transporting it back,” said Mr Shahrol.\nHowever, both Singapore drivers Mr Koh and Mr Lee said they have been lucky so far, and not experienced any breakdown or issues with their cars while travelling in Malaysia.\nMr Koh said: ”One thing that Malaysia doesn’t have is workshops to repair the EVs. So if anything happens, you have to tow it back to Singapore on a flatbed.”\nMr Lee recalled that he was involved in an accident, when his Kona was rear-ended by a Malaysian vehicle\xa0at a traffic light in Johor Bahru.\n“When it happened, my first immediate thought was I now need to get a flatbed truck to tow it back to Singapore and it’s going to really cost me,” said Mr Lee.\nHe said that his car survived the hit, and only suffered a small dent. Thankfully, he could still drive the car to the police station to make a report and subsequently back to Singapore.\nAccording to a transport expert CNA spoke to, Malaysia does not have electric vehicle repair facilities because there is a lack of human capital to support the EV industry.\nAssociate Professor Muhammad Zaly Shah, director of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia’s Centre for Innovative Planning and Development told CNA: “We don’t have programmes to train mechanic and engineers to be efficient in maintaining electric vehicles. So owners have to send their car back to manufacturers overseas.""\n“Addressing the manpower with the right technological know-how is a critical issue to support the EV industry,” he added.\nMORE CAN BE DONE TO BOOST EV TAKE-UP\xa0\xa0\xa0\nAlthough purchasing an electric car would be more expensive that a petrol car, Mr Shahrol said a handful of Malaysians still prefer going electric because of the smoother driving experience.\n“The biggest difference (between EV and petrol) is there’s no engine vibration, and you couple that with the fact that the torque of the motor is maximum when you start from standstill,” said Mr Shahrol.\n“This means that when you push down the accelerator in heavy traffic, the car glides silently, so you can enjoy podcasts and music,” he added.\nBased on May 2019 data, there are 194 battery EVs registered in Malaysia. In\xa0comparison, there are\xa01,274 registered electric cars in\xa0Singapore as of Jan 31 this year, according to the Land Transport Authority.\xa0\nMr Shahrol\xa0said\xa0“more can be done” to make EVs a more viable choice for drivers in Malaysia, such as introducing tax incentives and making more infrastructure available.\nHe expressed concern that Malaysia is in danger of being left behind by neighbouring countries like Singapore and Thailand, which are staking out bold pledges to transition from internal combustion engine cars to electric.\n“Malaysia launched its electric mobility master plan in 2015, which set targets for 2020 and 2030 and we’ve fallen way short of that. We are trying to tell the government that our neighbours are progressing, not only in helping users but also manufacturing, while we seem to be taking a wait and see attitude,” said Mr Shahrol.\n“So enough of the waiting and seeing. Let’s get going,” he added.\nMr Shahrol said one positive sign is that Malaysia’s Ministry of Environment and Water is set to launch a low carbon mobility action plan in 2021.\n“We look forward to that, hopefully there’s some positive news in terms of charging stations, more tax incentives for buying electric vehicles – the usual stuff that we have seen by governments in the region and around the world,” he added.\nHowever, Assoc Prof Muhammad Zaly wondered if the Malaysia government would simply back the transition given that the electric vehicle industry could be seen as threatening the future of government-owned oil and gas company, Petronas.\nHe added that local car manufacturers Proton and Perodua have also yet to produce electric cars.\nHe observed that policymakers must be seen to support firms like Petronas, Proton and Perodua to ensure they remain competitive in the automotive industry.\n“If (policymakers) want these local companies to survive, they must maintain petrol cars as the main option for users. If they transition to EV, Proton and Perodua cars would no longer have an edge over other brands,” said Assoc Prof Muhammad Zaly.\nHe also maintained that Malaysia’s position as the second-largest oil and natural gas producer in Southeast Asia would mean that it could stand to lose if more countries transition to EV.\n“The cost of petrol or diesel is relatively cheap in Malaysia, so even users would hesitate to switch their diesel or petrol-powered vehicles to electric,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     electric vehicles ', '     environment ', '     Malaysia ', '     technology ']}"

      First water, now energy as Singapore's key challenge for the next 50 years: Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After addressing the issue of meeting Singapore’s water needs for the past 50 years, meeting the country\'s energy needs sustainably\xa0will be the country\'s primary challenge for the next five decades, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing.\nMr Chan was speaking on\xa0CNA\'s The Climate Conversations podcast.\n“When we first became independent, our number one priority was to get enough water for ourselves. And over time, I think our water needs have also increased. Now, today we have pretty much gotten the technology to purify water, to recycle water and so forth. But that has just converted the dependence on external water supply to one of external energy supply,” said Mr Chan.\n“So I\'ve always said that if water has been the challenge for the last 50 years, energy will be our challenge for the next 50 years.”\nMr Chan was responding to a question from CNA Digital chief editor Jaime Ho, who had asked what Singapore\'s ""energy reset"" as defined by the Government would entail, and what the nation\'s energy transition would look like.\nMr Chan reiterated\xa0Singapore\'s challenges as an\xa0alternative energy disadvantaged\xa0nation, with limited access to renewable sources of energy.\n“The only renewable that we have is, perhaps, solar, and we have done the calculation, even if we cover every inch of our land area and sea area with solar panels, we will still not be able to generate sufficient renewable energy for our survival, based on the current technology,” he said.\nAs such, Singapore needs to continue finding more efficient ways to reduce its demand for energy, said Mr Chan.\nA CONSTANT CHURN\nAs part of efforts to tackle climate change, Singapore’s target is to halve its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to achieve net zero emissions ""as soon as viable"" in the second half of the century.\nResponding to a question on what Singapore\'s energy mix could could look like by 2050, Mr Chan said there will be a need to increase the proportion of renewable energy that is part of Singapore’s energy mix.\n“We hope that we will be able to up our proportion of renewable energy, and that depends on a few factors,” he explained.\nWhile Singapore has deployed solar panels across the island, it is still insufficient and there needs to be a “breakthrough” in current solar panel technology\xa0to allow more energy to be generated, said Mr Chan.\nOther solutions include bringing in clean energy from alternative sources, including from potentially as far away as Australia, Mr Chan noted.\xa0\nPETROCHEMICAL\xa0INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION\nIn light of global trends towards decarbonisation and moves away from fossil-fuel intensive industries such as petrochemicals, Mr Chan was asked if there would be longer-term moves in Singapore to lower the country\'s dependence on the sector.\nMr Chan said\xa0that the oil majors located in Singapore had started to make the transition towards sustainability some time ago.\n“Even before this current word ‘sustainability’ became fashionable in Singapore, that transition ... has already started many years ago. If we are looking at the oil majors that are present in Singapore, they have already started some of the transition - even before the Paris treaty came about,” said Mr Chan, referring to the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nMr Chan also spoke about jobs in the sector.\nShell Singapore said in November last year that it plans to repurpose its core business and halve its crude processing capacity at its Pulau Bukom oil refinery, as part of an overhaul in its journey towards a low-carbon future.\nAs part of the transition, Shell would cut 500 jobs by the end of 2023 at the Pulau Bukom site, which now employs 1,300 staff, a Shell spokesperson told CNA at the time.\nIn response to a question on his concerns regarding such\xa0developments in the sector, Mr Chan said that the process of the Government creating jobs for Singaporeans needs to be an ongoing one.\n“If we look at the economy - including the petrochemical industry - there will be a constant churn. And because Singapore is not the cheapest place to put all your production here, they will always concentrate the highest value-add production in Singapore, because our wages are higher than the rest. So there will always be a churn\xa0whereby some of the people with lower wages might be displaced,” added Mr Chan.\n“But we constantly seek to create better jobs for our people at the higher ranges of the wage ladder, and that must be an ongoing process for us.”\nWhen asked about the jobs available in the green economy, Mr Chan noted that it was not about defining what jobs would constitute clean jobs, but more of making each job a cleaner one over time.\n""We want every job to be a cleaner job over time. That means the same production -\xa0whether is it pet chems (petrochemicals), whether is it semi-con\xa0(semi-conductors,\xa0whether is it biomedical -\xa0we want every (one) of our products and processes to be greener, as we go along,"" he said.\n""And we want our companies and workers to be able to embrace the new technologies to produce products that are cleaner and greener.\nIn addition, new\xa0growth opportunities can lead to new jobs in the green industry, noted Mr Chan.\xa0\n""We won\'t put a target to say that we want \'X\' number of green jobs because actually our target is every job can become a greener job. And there are many more green jobs that today don\'t yet exist but can come about. And if we have the right skills and the right capabilities in our companies, we will be able to seize those opportunities against the global competition,"" he added.\nA QUESTION OF MAGNITUDE\nMr Chan also responded to questions on Singapore’s carbon tax.\nHe agreed\xa0that while the carbon tax could be the most\xa0“efficient and fair way” to\xa0transit to a greener economy, there needs to be a “clear, transparent and fair” carbon pricing across the board, including internationally.\n“We all know that Singapore is just a tiny fraction of the global economy. And so while we want to price the carbon externalities right, we actually need to move in tandem with the rest of the world,” he explained.\n“In the rest of the world, there are many countries with different practices in terms of their carbon pricing. Some of them have higher carbon prices, but they have all kinds of offsets which means that the effective carbon price is not as high as they claim it to be, then that causes all kinds of distortion to people\'s investment decisions and production decisions.”\nThe hope would be for the world to come together and embrace a common carbon price, so that the “externalities” are shared, said Mr Chan.\n“Having said that, we all know how difficult it is for the whole world to come and agree on a common carbon price, or even agree on a common mechanism to price carbon,” he said.\nAnnounced at Budget 2018, Singapore\'s carbon tax rate has been set at S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 to 2023. The Government said then that this would be increased to between S$10 and S$15 per tonne by 2030.\xa0\nThere have been a number of calls from Members of Parliament for Singapore to raise the carbon tax, most recently during a wide-ranging parliamentary debate in February.\xa0\nThis debate followed a motion tabled by members of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment to speak on climate change and its impact on Singapore.\nSpeaking at the unveiling of Budget 2021 in Parliament last month, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said Singapore would review the tax\'s ""trajectory and level""\xa0, and reveal the outcome at next year\'s Budget.\nMr Chan also noted that all sectors would be impacted by an adjustment in the carbon tax, and the main question would be the magnitude of the impact.\n“I don\'t think when we adjust the carbon price that only some sectors will be involved because I think all sectors will be involved (and) will be impacted in some way. The question is one of the magnitude, rather than whether they are or they are not impacted,” said Mr Chan.\nAs such, the Government will bear in mind various considerations and make sure that when it reviews the carbon price, it will\xa0fulfil its\xa0responsibility to future generations, but also take into account the impact on jobs and the cost of living for the current generations, he added.\nUltimately, the push for sustainability will come with trade-offs noted Mr Chan, but that does not mean that Singapore has not planned ahead.\n“I think there will be some trade offs, but … in the usual spirit of Singapore and Singaporeans, we always try to have our cake and eat it, and try to have the best of both worlds,” explained Mr Chan, who was asked about the overall costs that societies will have to bear in the name of\xa0climate action.\xa0\n“If we think back on our journey for the last 50 over years of nation building, in some sense, actually we have been ahead of the curve in having to pay this price.”\nThis has been demonstrated in how Singapore has accounted for nature in urban planning, and made sure buildings are energy efficient, among other measures, he added.\n“I don\'t think it is entirely mutually exclusive to say that we want a higher quality of life, we want a greener life and yet at the same time we want to mitigate the cost of living,” Mr Chan said.\n“All in all, I wouldn\'t be too pessimistic, to say that it is a binary option between one versus the other. The solutions are definitely not mutually exclusive, and we can, in the best of Singapore spirit, find ways that can combine the best of both worlds.”\nListen to the Mr Chan Chun Sing\'s full conversation with CNA\'s Jaime Ho in The Climate Conversations podcast:\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     oil ', '     jobs ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Waste management firms should develop competitive advantages to expand overseas: Chan Chun Sing

      Preserve, revive, restore: Indian ponds spring back to life
  </h1>, 'text': 'CHENNAI:\xa0It was only when the buffaloes disappeared from an almost-dry pond in Saligao, in India\'s state of Goa, that residents hatched a community plan to revive it - one now seen as a model for local efforts to shore up India\'s precarious water supplies.\nWorking together, local people pulled out trash and invasive species, replanted native plants and restored the pond\'s natural water flow.\n""We thought we will just clean the pond that my aunt, an artist, loved gazing at and sketching,"" said Sharada Kerkar, a 28-year-old member of citizen\'s group CatcH2o.\n""It was meant to be a very small initiative that some of us friends were doing but it has grown into something bigger. We have done five ponds now and keep getting calls to do others.""\nCatcH2o\'s success\xa0has come just ahead of the harsh Indian summer which, as climate change strengthens, is increasingly associated with parched cities and a worsening drinking water crisis across the country.\nA government think-tank report in 2018, when India suffered what was called the worst water crisis in its history, predicted that at least 40 per cent of India\'s 1.3 billion population will have no reliable access to drinking water by 2030.\nChanging that will likely require not just government efforts to shore up water security but community ones, conceived and carried out by residents, climate adaptation experts say.\nThe transformation of Goa\'s village ponds coincided with a new plan by the western state\'s wetland authority to encourage people to protect their own ecosystems.\nLaunched in February, the Shram Shakti se Jal Samrudhi (""water security through hard work"") programme for the first time allots funding for people to carry out projects they develop, as well as to join up the work of different government agencies.\n""The idea is to preserve, revive and restore water bodies,"" said Pradip Sarmokadam of the Goa State Biodiversity Board.\n""We will provide the technical assistance, but want people to own these water bodies.""\nGENERATING JOBS\nIn southern Tamil Nadu state, more than 1,000 women from 21 villages in Vellore district four years ago cooperated to build rainwater harvesting structures to boost the lagging flow of the nearby Naganadhi River.\nThose structures include recharge wells that trap rainwater runoff, including from roofs and roads, to help boost the water table, and check dams that slow down water flow on rivers or streams.\n""When we first heard the idea, we scoffed,"" said Vidya Bhaskaran, one of the women from Salamanatham village who worked on the recharge wells.\n""We were dependent on borewells, which were giving us muddy water only and thought it was impossible to find water again. But I am glad we were eventually convinced and worked on it.""\nChandrasekaran Kuppan, the man behind efforts to rejuvenate the Naganadhi, is now collaborating with district officials to take his model to 300 more villages, training 20,000 women in the process.\nIn a rare collaboration, the government pays the women via its rural employment guarantee scheme, while the humanitarian Art of Living Foundation bankrolls technical studies and Kuppan\'s charity oversees much of the execution.\n""The idea is simple,"" Kuppan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""When people in my village first mentioned the water crisis to me, I sat down with them to understand what could be done to resolve it.""\nThe answer was to combine the traditional knowledge of villagers with technical advice from geologists, Kuppan said.\nSuch efforts to consult with and source solutions from local people is seen as key to ensuring the success of work to build resilience to climate threats.\nIn Goa, CatcH2o achieved its successes with similar efforts to combine skills and knowledge.\nAfter getting technical experts on board, local people recruited migrant workers stranded at home during lockdown to provide labour to revive the pond in Saligao.\nWith plenty of labourers - who were paid the minimum wage - the group managed to avoid using heavy machinery, which could have damaged the pond\'s ecology.\n""The results are there to see,"" Kuppan said.\n""The dry villages have good groundwater now, the idea to work with communities is being used across the state and in the process employment is being generated.""\nONLY WAY OUT\nIn recent years, many city residents also have come together to clean lakes, better harvest rainwater and increase water storage capacity at home.\nBut tens of thousands are still dependent on deliveries by water tanker trucks, paying for each litre of clean water they need.\nMany areas in Goa, including tourism spots, struggle with providing drinking water, with chief minister Pramod Sawant telling reporters last month that the state faced a shortage of 76 million\xa0litres a day.\n""Traditionally Goans have not had any water storage mechanisms, given the great rainfall in the state and open wells,"" Sarmokadam said. ""But things have changed and therefore fresh efforts are needed.""\nBhaskaran, who helped revive water supplies in Salamanatham, could not agree more.\n""Making recharge wells was hard work but we sang songs, chatted and got it done,"" said Bhaskaran.\n""Now we have drinking water available all 24 hours rushing out of taps in every home.

      Don't squash it: Insects are helping to combat Singapore's food waste problem
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singaporeans love their food. Unfortunately, that also means that food waste is a big problem in Singapore too.\nAccording to the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore.\nThe amount of food waste generated in Singapore has increased by about 20 per cent over the last 10 years.\nIn 2019, Singapore generated 744 million kg of food waste – the equivalent of 51,000 double-decker buses.\nOnly 18 per cent of food waste is recycled, with the rest incinerated.\nFor Nathaniel Phua - the founder and CEO of a biotechnology company that uses insects to consume and repurpose food waste - the numbers were shocking.\nThe former fashion marketeer’s first foray into waste management came when he started working for his father-in-law at Tiong Lam Supplies, which transforms food waste into fish feed for aquaculture farms.\nTraditional waste management involves specific types of food waste, but Mr Phua began searching for something that could break down all types of food waste. That led him to the black soldier fly.\n\nThese insects are natural decomposers that spend most of their life eating.\nThey only eat when they are in their larvae form and can consume up to two times their body weight every day.\nThe flies do not simply get rid of food waste. They can themselves be turned into higher value products, like feed and fertiliser.\n""It was really a challenge for us to figure out what was the best condition for them to live in,"" said Mr Phua, who told Money Mind that the insects would constantly crawl out of their trays.\n""What would be the best condition for them to just eat all that food waste and to remain happy within those trays. It took it took a while for us to figure that out.""\nMr Phua set up Ento Industries last year, and in November was awarded a social enterprise grant by DBS\' foundation arm.\nWith proceeds from the grant, Ento Industries plans to move into a 5,000 sq ft facility with the capacity to process between 10 and 20 tonnes of waste per month.Ms Claire Wong, head of the DBS Foundation, said that Ento Industries\' efforts are aimed at a ""real problem"".\n""There is a real problem of food waste that they’re trying to solve that no one has really figured out how to get rid of waste and repurposing it right. So not just throwing it and burning it but finding a purpose for it,"" said Ms Wong.\n""There is a real problem that they’re solving ... With that problem comes a huge market potential as well,"" she added.\nDBS said that if Ento is able to scale up their existing capabilities, the possibilities for growth are huge.\nWith the government’s plan to produce 30 per cent of the nation’s food supply by 2030 and with the Lim Chu Kang area earmarked for development into a high-tech agri-food cluster, Mr Phua said that future prospects are bright.\nA commercial pilot is being planned, with the aim of recycling 1 tonne of waste a day.\n""Our vision for our support with the food manufacturers is to be able to take on their responsibility of dealing with that food waste. We want to be able to deal with that food waste for them and show them that the circular economy within the industry is possible,"" said Mr Phua.\n""We want to convert all that food waste into more feed ingredients so that we can put that back into our local industry and support the food production in Singapore.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     environment ']}"

      How an illegal logger’s switch to a greener job shows a way to save Indonesia’s forests
  </h1>, 'text': 'CENTRAL KALIMANTAN: He began illegally cutting trees when he was 13 or 14, after completing elementary school.\nCentral Kalimantan native Alianur had to help his parents out, so he accompanied his father on trips despite the risk of getting caught by the forestry police. Treks into the forest took two hours, he recalled.\nThe lack of education forced him to continue on this path. When he had a family of his own, logging missions meant being away from his wife and children for a month at a time.\n“Sometimes I worked with friends, but sometimes I was alone, and the risk was quite high,” the 40-year-old told the programme Insight. “Inside, the forest was really calm. We could only hear the birds chirping.”\nAlianur, who goes by one name, could cut 50 pieces of wood in a day, with each tree yielding two to three pieces about four metres in length. He said he could sell about eight cubic metres of wood a month to timber companies, earning eight million rupiah (S$740).\nThree years ago, he decided to switch to making coconut sugar.\nHe received training by a company called Rimba Makmur Utama, which manages about 157,000 hectares of land including peat forests in Central Kalimantan. That is more than twice the size of Singapore.\nAnd the company has adopted a climate finance model that could play an important role in saving Indonesia’s, and the world’s\xa0forests.\nWATCH: Deforestation in Indonesia — A waiting world catastrophe? (3:02)\n‘STRONGEST DEFENCE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE’\nForests are the ""strongest defence against climate change"", said Kiki Taufik, global head of advocacy group Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s forest campaign.\nBut between 2001 and 2019, Indonesia lost 9.6 million hectares of forests, according to data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. About 56 per cent of it happened in pulp and paper, palm oil and logging concessions, he said.\nThe country is now losing about 0.4 million hectares of forests a year, noted scientist Herry Purnomo of the Centre for International Forestry Research.\nRimba Makmur Utama, however, protects and restores the peat forests within its Ecosystem Restoration Concession granted by the government — in a project called Katingan Mentaya, named after two rivers that flow there.\nPeatlands are made up of partially decomposed plant matter and store large amounts of carbon, which is released into the atmosphere if the land is drained or burned.\nPeat fires have caused some of Southeast Asia’s worst haze episodes, including one in 2015 estimated to have caused over 100,000 premature deaths in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia and US$16 billion (S$21.5 billion) in economic losses in Indonesia alone.\nRimba Makmur Utama also protects the habitats of species such as the Bornean orangutan and creates sustainable employment for local residents like Alianur.\n“We can provide better livelihoods for them, better education, better health,” said chief executive Dharsono Hartono, who co-founded the company in 2007.\nIn doing so, it has avoided over 30 million tonnes in carbon emissions.\nIts climate finance scheme sees companies such as automaker Volkswagen and energy giant Shell buying carbon credits or offsets as part of their climate commitments. Each credit is equivalent to a tonne of carbon dioxide, and the money funds Katingan Mentaya’s initiatives.\nIn general, forest carbon credits cost between US$5 and US$10 each.\nAlthough 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Dharsono said it was a good year as clients continued to buy credits, certified by third parties.\n“More and more, customers understand the value of protecting nature,” he said. “Of course, we still have a long way to go.”\nKatingan Mentaya is part of REDD+ (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), a mechanism developed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that incentivises forest conservation by creating a financial value for the carbon stored.\nWHAT MORE MUST INDONESIA DO?\nRuandha Agung Sugardiman, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry’s director general of climate change, said Indonesia aims to further reduce its annual rate of deforestation to 250,000 hectares by 2030.\n“This is an extraordinary effort, especially on the part of law enforcement. Our main emphasis is on forest and land fires,” he said.\nSpatial technology has made it easier to identify areas that have been illegally logged.\n“Based on satellite images, we’d send our team and conduct an investigation on the ground. We’d know the size of the areas affected by illegal logging, the amount of wood and we can immediately calculate the damage,” he said.\n“Big companies won’t be able to escape because of the extremely heavy sanctions. It could be administrative sanctions or criminal sanctions.”\nIndonesia also aims to rehabilitate 12 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 using funds from its state budget and international supporters, said Ruandha. In addition, it aims to restore two million hectares of peatland by 2030.\nEnvironmentalists said the authorities are heading in the right direction, but challenges such as transparency in land permits, enforcement and business interests persist.\nThe Omnibus Law passed last year aims to create jobs, but will weaken environmental protection, said Greenpeace’s Kiki. The building of the Trans-Papua Highway in Indonesia’s easternmost region threatens the Papuan forests, Indonesia’s “last forest frontier”, he added.\nThe lack of transparency and public access to Indonesia’s land concession maps also make it difficult to know where exactly various concessions lie — coal mining or oil palm, for instance — where they overlap and where community areas are, he cited.\nWATCH: The full episode\xa0— Too little, too late for Asia’s largest rainforest? (48:50)\nIn the meantime, projects such as Katingan Mentaya are making a difference.\nCitrus farmer Aliansyah, 55, used to clear land using the slash-and-burn technique, but stopped five years ago after he received training in alternative land-clearing methods.\n“If you clear the land by burning it, the plants can only grow once. If we do it organically, the trees would grow well,” he said. “I support that approach.”\nThese days, Alianur gets to spend more time with his family in Sampit district and no longer has to worry about getting caught by the police.\nIn his former life, he was nabbed twice and said he had to pay bribes of around 500,000 rupiah each time to avoid jail.\nAmid the pandemic, he can earn around four million rupiah a month — demand for coconut sugar, produced in Katingan Mentaya’s buffer zone and used in cooking and baking, has held up.\n“If forests vanish, maybe people in Kalimantan will vanish too,” he said.\nWatch this episode of Insight here.

      Trade-offs and challenges ahead as Singapore moves towards cleaner energy: Tan See Leng
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore needs to obtain energy that is secure and reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable but seeking to achieve each means trade-offs for the others, said Dr Tan See Leng, Second Minister for Trade and Industry on Thursday (Mar 4).\nDr Tan highlighted this as he laid out how Singapore will move away from\xa0natural gas and find low-carbon energy sources to help alleviate climate change.\n""Therein lies the challenge for all of us here in Singapore – how can we obtain energy that is: One, secure and reliable; two,\xa0affordable; and three, that is environmentally sustainable, for ourselves over the long haul.\xa0\n""These three objectives constitute our \'energy trilemma\', as seeking to achieve each will entail trade-offs for the others,"" said Dr Tan in a joint segment on sustainability during the Committee of Supply debate.\nSingapore is\xa0greening its\xa0energy sources\xa0by developing\xa0four “supply switches” – natural gas, solar energy, regional grids\xa0and low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, he said.\nSingapore\'s main source of renewable energy is solar power and it is speeding up efforts to make full use of suitable solar deployment spaces, Dr Tan said.\xa0This means more solar panels on rooftops and open spaces, such as reservoirs, and using\xa0untapped spaces including existing land, canals\xa0and roads.\nWith more solar energy, Singapore\xa0will also have to increase\xa0Energy Storage Systems (ESS) capacity, and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) will test-bed solutions with the industry and researchers, said Dr Tan, who is also a Minister in the Prime Minister\'s Office and Second Minister for Manpower.\nEMA is piloting Singapore’s first floating ESS, which can power over 600 four-room Housing Board flats, and this will enable EMA to\xa0study how batteries can be stacked to reduce land use.\nFIRST ELECTRIC VEHICLE SERVICE STATIONS\nDr Tan also announced that a grant was awarded to a consortium led by local SME Eigen Energy to pilot\xa0Singapore’s first clean-energy powered service stations at three HDB towns, to be ready by the first quarter of next year.\nThese stations will provide one of the fastest public EV charging services here,\xa0he said.\nThree Shell service stations in\xa0Tampines, Pasir Ris, and Lakeview will have these fast charging EV points, EMA, Enterprise Singapore and Shell said in a press release on Thursday.\n""As we increase solar and ESS deployment, our power system will become more decentralised. To enhance our capabilities in grid planning, in maintenance\xa0and asset management, we are developing a digital twin of Singapore’s physical electricity grid,"" Dr Tan added.\nDr Tan said that EMA is also developing regional grids with countries in Southeast Asia.\n""This will allow us to tap on the abundance of hydropower and other renewable energies that some of our Southeast Asian neighbours have,"" he said.\xa0\nEMA will issue a request for proposal for a two-year trial of 100MW of electricity imports from Malaysia this month and is initiating cross-border power trade of up to 100MW under the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project.\xa0\nThese are pilots and the first steps towards a regional power grid, and MTI plans to import more electricity to diversify its energy sources, said Dr Tan.\nAddressing Nominated Member of Parliament Koh Lian Pin\'s concerns about the\xa0carbon footprint of Singapore\'s\xa0electricity imports, Dr Tan said that\xa0for the upcoming trial with Malaysia, EMA will put in place steps to verify the cleanliness of the\xa0inputs.\nThis includes requiring importers to submit proof of carbon output, and cleaner proposals will be scored more favourably, he said.\nMr Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) asked in a supplementary question\xa0if the ministry is studying the environmental impact of importing hydropower from Laos.\n""I hope that MTI can consider not just importing the renewable energy but making sure that it doesn\'t have that big an impact on the environment in other countries,"" he said.\nTo this, Dr Tan said that EMA will be getting all prospective energy importers to submit information on their energy sources and environmental studies to assess their impact.\nHe added that these measures will make Singapore\'s\xa0economy more sustainable, but solar deployment requires space, and with Singapore\'s land constraints, there will be added costs.\xa0\nELECTRICITY PRICES WILL\xa0RISE\nDr Tan then addressed MPs\' questions on electricity prices in Singapore and how consumers can be encouraged to cut\xa0electricity usage.\nThe minister explained that while\xa0wholesale electricity market prices are depressed today due to a glut in the electricity market, but this\xa0overcapacity is not likely to last.\n""Wholesale electricity prices will also rise and normalise, with rising demand driven by\xa0the growth of sectors such as data centres, 5G networks,\xa0agri-tech, as well as the adoption of EVs"" he said.\n""Over the medium to long run, electricity prices normalising is inevitable ... No company that\'s commercially run\xa0will sell electricity below cost perpetually. What we need to prevent is a swing from a glut to a severe shortage of capacity and this will result\xa0in sharp price spikes;\xa0perhaps\xa0even blackouts as we saw in Texas.""\nEMA has studied how other places have managed this and is consulting the industry on the way forward, he said, adding that more details will be announced later this year.\n""We are committed to smoothening these price surges and volatility,"" Dr Tan said.\xa0""Even if prices must go up, we will do our best to ensure that this increase is gradual, and the Government will act where necessary to minimise excessive surges.""\nDr Tan also pointed out that fuel prices dipped to their lowest in 20 years last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic but they will rise as global demand recovers and this will\xa0lead to electricity prices rising.\n""The Government will do our best to manage our \'energy trilemma\' by introducing more renewable energy in our energy mix, enhancing the efficiency of our power systems, and minimising the impact on prices,"" he said.\xa0\n""However, \'right-pricing\'\xa0energy is critical to encouraging prudent use of electricity. We must adopt\xa0energy conservation as a way of life for all of us here in\xa0Singapore.""\nFor example, Singapore households can switch from using gas to electricity appliances for cooking, he said.\xa0\n""It is also safer as the risks of gas leaks and fires are reduced. And some of the newer electrical cooking appliances, they do produce very, very good wok hei -\xa0the heat that is required to give you very good hor fun,"" said Dr Tan.\nTRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES\nSpeaking after\xa0Dr Tan, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said that\xa0existing industries need to produce and operate more sustainably.\nHe announced that Sentosa will become a carbon-neutral destination by 2030, when he expects that global tourism will have revived.\n""Through such efforts. we will strengthen Singapore\xa0as an exemplary sustainable tourism destination,"" said Mr Chan.\nSingapore is taking active steps to transform the Energy and Chemicals sector, he added.\n""We are also stepping up decarbonisation and resource optimisation efforts at the plant and systems levels, to transform Jurong Island into a sustainable energy and chemicals park.""\nThe country\xa0also needs to tap on new opportunities for green growth, such as carbon services sector and\xa0green financing, he said.\n""Singaporeans can take advantage of these bright spots by upskilling and re-skilling themselves,"" he said.\nHe concluded that Singapore\xa0aspires to be\xa0a ""bright green spark"", by being an inspiration to the world on how it overcomes sustainability constraints.\xa0\n""This is why under the Research, Innovation, and Enterprise Plan 2025, we are attracting companies to anchor their R&D activities in Singapore,"" he said.\xa0\n""We will continue to support the start-up and innovation ecosystems in sustainability-related sectors.

We aim to peak the public sector’s emissions around 2025, ahead of the national target of around 2030.”\xa0\nAs previously announced, Singapore will aim to halve its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to achieve net zero emissions ""as soon as viable"" in the second half of the century.\nThe GreenGov.SG initiative is part of the\xa0Green Plan, which was launched earlier last month, and aims to be a “whole-of-nation movement” to advance the national agenda on sustainable development.\xa0\nThe Green Plan charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years, and is spearheaded by five ministries, including the education, national development and transport ministries.\xa0\nGreenGov.SG will be a “living plan”, said Ms Fu, adding that details on the initiative will be released over the course of the year.\xa0\nThe initiative was previously known as the Public Sector Taking the Lead in Environmental Sustainability (PSTLES), which was introduced in 2006 before being enhanced in 2014.\nPart of these enhancements included setting targets for electricity and water consumption, as well as green buildings, and requiring each ministry to appoint a sustainability manager to drive efforts within their agency.\nIn response to queries from CNA, a spokesperson from the Ministry for Sustainability and the Environment said that the public sector’s emissions as of 2018 is estimated to be about 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e).\xa0\nThis figure includes emissions from Government offices, and public sector infrastructure and operations.\xa0\nFURTHER KEY SHIFTS\nIn addition to setting higher targets, the scope of GreenGov.SG will be expanded, said Ms Fu.\nIn setting its goals, it will go beyond government-owned offices to include other public sector infrastructure and operations such as public transport infrastructure and healthcare facilities.\n“With this expanded scope, the public sector will take on a greater responsibility to enhance the sustainability of our operations,” she noted.\nIn addition, the public sector will “embed"" sustainability practices\xa0in core business areas and influence service providers and suppliers to be more sustainable, Ms Fu said.\xa0\n“One key tool is in green procurement. As a major consumer of goods and services, the public sector can and will influence the industry towards sustainable business choices and practices by incorporating more sustainability requirements in our procurement framework,” said Ms Fu.\nWith GreenGov.SG, the Government hopes to build “a culture of sustainability” among public servants, said MSE\xa0in a press release.\n“While the public sector is taking the lead, achieving our goal of sustainable development is a whole-of-nation endeavour,” said MSE. “With the refreshed GreenGov.SG initiative, the Government hopes to inspire our people and partners to embrace green practices and make sustainability a way of life.\n“Together, we can chart our way towards a low-carbon and sustainable future for Singapore.”\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     global warming ']}"

      Green Plan not a 'compilation of existing initiatives' but long-term plan that will evolve: Grace Fu
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Green Plan 2030 is not a “compilation of existing initiatives”, but a long-term and living plan that will evolve as Singapore progresses, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Thursday (Mar 4).\n“Some have asked if the Green Plan is just a compilation of existing initiatives ... it is not,” said Ms Fu, who was speaking during the joint segment on sustainability at the Committee of Supply debate.\nThe plan, which is spearheaded by the education, national development, transport, sustainability and the environment, trade and industry ministries, charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years.\xa0\n“We will update our targets and strategies as new technologies and practicable solutions avail themselves. The Green Plan is also not just an MSE (Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment) or even a government plan, but a blueprint that we have set out for ourselves as a nation,” said Ms Fu.\n“Everyone must work together to achieve our vision. While some targets are existing, new and enhanced targets have been included.”\nSome new initiatives under the plan, which was unveiled last month, include requiring all new car registrations to be cleaner-energy models from 2030, and more than doubling the targeted number of electric vehicle charging points by 2030.\nThe plan also builds on Singapore’s 2030 aim to reduce the waste sent to the landfill by 30 per cent, aiming for a 20 per cent reduction by 2026.\nSingapore will also aim for at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon neutral by 2030 “for a start”, with the rest of the schools to follow, working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions in the sector by 2030.\xa0\nA COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT\nMs Fu noted that the Green Plan is a “commitment” from the Government to present and future generations to chart a common vision for a sustainable future and a roadmap for everyone.\n“Through the Green Plan, sustainability will shape our economy, our infrastructure, our way of life. It will fundamentally change how we live, work\xa0and play,” she added.\nMs Fu also noted that the Government will set the broad policy direction and the public sector will “lead the change”.\nShe also announced that the public sector will set a carbon emissions target for the first time as part of the Green Plan.\nIt is also important that the Green Plan sparks a national conversation and energises Singaporeans to take action, said Ms Fu.\nShe pointed out that sustainability is not without costs, and just as Singaporeans pay for security and social services, they will have to pay a bit more for greener goods and services, adjust to less convenience in daily lives, or re-skill for green jobs in new industries.\nThese costs cannot be incurred without a “national consensus”, Ms Fu said.\n“While climate change may feel abstract for individuals, it is our individual actions that determine the collective outcome … Our consumption pattern drive industry,” she added.\nThe minister also said the sustainability sector could bring new business opportunities that will benefit Singapore and Singaporeans.\nThe Green Plan would be a “solemn pledge” to future generations of Singaporeans that there will always be a Singapore, if they work together.\n“We will face many grave threats, but we will transform challenges into opportunities. This is the Singapore DNA,” she said.\n“We will take bold and collective action to create a sustainable and liveable home. This is a pledge that Singaporeans today must keep, to give our children the confidence to pursue their dreams, raise their families with hope and optimism and look forward to a brighter, better future.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     climate change ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Day 1 of Budget 2021 debate: 5 key themes
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament (MPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) on Wednesday (Feb 24) discussed the Budget 2021 initiatives presented by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat last week, as well as listed a number of suggestions for consideration.\n\nThis comes a week after Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, delivered his Budget speech, in which he laid out Singapore’s path of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMr Heng had said that as Singapore’s economy reopens, the focus of Budget 2021 will shift “from containment to restructuring”, but there will be targeted support for the hardest-hit sectors as the global battle against COVID-19 is far from over.\nHere are some of the key themes highlighted by various speakers on the first day of the debate:\nHELP FOR VULNERABLE WORKERS\nMPs pointed out that the measures in this year’s Budget will help to alleviate some issues faced by workers, but noted that two segments of workers could require more help, especially during the current pandemic.\nMP Koh Poh Koon (PAP-Tampines) noted that measures outlined in the Budget would ensure that workers have “good jobs and job opportunities”.\nAt the same time, Dr Koh noted that vulnerable worker groups have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may also face additional pressures in the new economy.\n“Ensuring that those in the lower wage rungs get a fair wage must be a manifestation of a more inclusive society. There will always be a group at the lower end of the wage ladder that we need to continually support,” he said.\n“It is something that we will always have to keep working on,” he added.\n\nWhile there is a need to start at the “right” wage level, there is also a need to ensure wage progression, Dr Koh said.\nThis can be done by narrowing the wage difference between the 20th percentile and the median income - or 50th percentile - of wage earners, and implementing ""vocational"" Progressive Wage Models to cover other lower-wage workers in job roles that are distributed across multiple sectors, he added.\nMP Henry Kwek (PAP-Kebun Bahru) touched on senior employability in his speech. He noted that senior workers he has spoken to have expressed their concerns over how they fit in Singapore’s future economy, or how they can overcome ageism.\xa0\nWhile the Government has implemented “forward-looking policies” for senior workers such as the Special Employment Credit and the Retirement and Re-employment Act, it is hard to fully remove ageism despite regulations, Mr Kwek pointed out.\n“Many companies, especially in the midst of (the) COVID (pandemic), are unwilling to take on the risk of hiring, or even retaining senior workers. These issues will get more serious as we continue to restructure, and as our workforce continues to age,” he said.\nTo help tackle the issue of ageism, the gig economy could come in handy, Mr Kwek pointed out.\nRather than helping seniors polish their resumes for a full-time job, the Government could consider identifying the “portfolios of skills” they have, explained Mr Kwek. These skills can be applied to part-time or micro-jobs within a variety of industries, he said.\nThe Government can take the lead in creating a gig economy for the elderly by doing three things, said Mr Kwek. These include: Creating micro-jobs for seniors starting with those in the social services, creating a national digital platform and app, and equipping seniors to do these micro-jobs through SkillsFuture.\nRECOGNISING CONTRIBUTIONS OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS\nMPs also welcomed the announcement in the Budget that salaries for nurses and other healthcare workers such as support care staff will be enhanced.\xa0\nAt the same time, they noted that wage increases are not the only way of helping healthcare workers.\nCalling the announcement “long overdue"", MP Darryl David (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) said he also hopes that the Government will continue to enhance the career prospects for nurses and healthcare professionals.\xa0\nIn particular, he noted the difference between “enrolled” and “registered” nurses, and suggested that the Government could consider putting in place a progression ladder for ""enrolled"" nurses that takes into consideration their job experience.\nMr David also pointed out that the Government should consider enhancing the work environment and conditions for nurses.\xa0\n“Singapore has traditionally depended heavily on foreign nurses ... to supplement our pool of local nurses … I believe the reasons as to why Singaporeans are generally unwilling to enter the profession perhaps go beyond just wages alone,” Mr David noted.\n“Perhaps they are deterred by the long working hours, the stress from having to deal and manage different patients, their family members and expectations, as well as potential disruptions to family life arising from irregular work shifts.”\nIn order to enhance the attractiveness of such roles, the Government can consider implementing mandatory leave and paid holidays as additional benefits for local nurses so that they can take a break from being on the frontline and recharge from time to time, Mr David suggested.\xa0\nMP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) said he was “heartened” that healthcare workers’ salaries would be enhanced, but stressed the need for adequate remuneration.\n“We have been able to attract nurses from other countries to come and work in Singapore. They make up for the shortage of local nurses. However, if remuneration levels are not considered adequate, we face the potential of our nurses being drawn to foreign shores,” he said.\n“This will make it even harder for us to handle the ageing population.”\nAs such, Mr Faisal proposed that the Government consider either pegging the salaries of Singapore’s nurses to a weighted basket of salaries from countries of a similar economic status as Singapore. Another possibility would be to use the salary scales of Singapore’s uniformed services as a benchmark, he added.\nTOUCHING ON TAXES\nMPs also addressed various forms of taxes, including the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nMr Heng had said in the Budget that the previously announced hike in the GST would happen between 2022 and 2025, and “sooner rather than later”, depending on the economic outlook.\nMP Jessica Tan (PAP-East Coast) noted that Mr Heng had said that foreigners residing in Singapore, tourists, and the top 20 per cent of resident households account for more than 60 per cent of the net GST borne by all households and individuals.\xa0\nAs such Ms Tan asked whether the amount of projected GST increase would be impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decrease in tourists.\n“Will (the GST increase) be sufficient to fund the increase in healthcare spending? And if not, then is the Government considering other forms of tax to fund increasing healthcare spending?” she asked.\n“If so, I do hope that it would be calibrated and that we would not be implementing a similar cap as we saw in Budget 2016 on total tax relief.”\nMP Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast) raised the idea of a wealth tax.\n“The trend of getting the wealthy to contribute more is gaining traction globally. In fact, the wealthy themselves are stepping forward to give back in significant ways, with philanthropy featuring as a key agenda in their wealth planning,” she said.\nMs Foo pointed out how from “various reports”, a one-off wealth tax may seem “economically efficient”, when structured as a one-off exceptional response to the pandemic.\xa0\n“When you consider that selected entities or individuals may have enjoyed outsized windfalls because of COVID-19, it may not be unreasonable to expect them to do more for the common good,” she said.\n“I would like to ask the Government if wealth tax is being contemplated and what the considerations for such a tax would be?”\nTRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT\nThe push for electric vehicles (EVs) and the raising of petrol duty rates was another topic raised by MPs during the debate.\xa0\nMr Faisal touched on the announcement made by Mr Heng on Feb 16 that petrol duty rates would be raised by 15 cents per litre for premium petrol with immediate effect. It was also announced then that the duty for intermediate petrol would also be raised by 10 cents.\n“There is no one who would disagree that we must take urgent action in order to address climate change. And I appreciate that the government intends to help all those affected by the increased duties by offering rebates which are expected to defray the increased costs for a year,” the WP MP said.\nHowever, he questioned the need for the increase in petrol duties to take immediate effect and echoed the call made by Leader of the Opposition MP Pritam Singh (WP-Aljunied) for the government to consider reviewing the hike.\n“Such an approach creates a shock amongst vehicle users, especially for those whose livelihood depends on internal combustion engine vehicles,” he said.\n“While it is important to set behavioural norms away from a reliance on fossil fuels, this is not an excuse to inflict unnecessary trauma on an already besieged group. By the time the rebates reach the pockets of the drivers, some of them may have resorted to drastic measures already to keep themselves and their families economically afloat.”\nMP Lim Wee Kiak (PAP-Sembawang) also questioned the need for the immediate hike in duties, given that some newly announced measures to further encourage the push towards EVs would only kick in down the road.\n“Why are motorists penalised or coerced to move into EVs when we haven’t even got enough infrastructures in place?” asked Mr Lim.\nMr Lim, who noted that the effect of higher petrol cost would impact all sectors of the economy, suggested that the Government bring forward the road tax rebates and additional petrol duty rebates.\n“Car ownership is an issue close to the hearts of many Singaporeans. And I hope those who are planning for policies on car ownership would think deeper and assess the implications before rolling out,” said Mr Lim.\nMANPOWER\nMPs also spoke on manpower issues faced by businesses.\nNewly appointed NMP Janet Ang noted a slew of initiatives already in place to help businesses, but noted that a key challenge for some is the availability of manpower.\n“They cannot find enough Singapore workers to take up the roles, especially when it comes to expertise and in-demand skills they need to recover and grow,” she said.\n“In the manufacturing sector, the reduction in S Pass sub-Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) announced in the Budget 2021 is worrisome for many of them, especially when Singaporeans may have expectation mismatches and not aspire to those jobs.”\nWhen it comes to professional, manager, executive (PME) jobs, MP Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) noted that there remains “ground concern” \xa0that the reliance on foreign PMEs has led to an “unnecessary increase” in competition in the job market and employment.\xa0\nWhile the qualifying salaries of both the Employment Pass and S Pass holders were recently raised in 2020, Mr Tay said this needs to be regularly reviewed and raised in line with rising median wages of PMETs.\nAmong other measures, the Government needs to look at ways to further strengthen the S Pass criteria, and also put in continued stricter enforcement against “errant companies with a weakening Singaporean core”, he said.\nHe added: “To safeguard the Singaporean core and curb discriminatory hiring, we must ensure that Singaporean PMEs have access to a level playing field for jobs while balancing companies’ manpower needs in the immediate and longer term.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2021 ', '     environment ', '     electric vehicles ']}"

      Kranji woodland clearance: ‘Gaps’ in project management, directions for ‘immediate’ follow-up issued, says Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Government has given directions for ""immediate\xa0follow-up"", after parts of a Kranji woodland site were erroneously cleared, said\xa0Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Feb 22).\n“It is clear to us that there were gaps in the way that the project was managed and supervised, and that we must do better,” he told reporters during a media briefing.\nLast week, JTC Corp said that plots of land earmarked for the development of the Agri-Food Innovation Park in Kranji were\xa0“erroneously” cleared ahead of the conclusion of a commissioned study. A “stern warning” has been issued to the contractor involved.\n“Upon this discovery, JTC instructed the contractor to stop all clearing works immediately. Since then, no further clearing has taken place on site and the contractor has been issued a stern warning,” it said last week.\nThe Agri-Food Innovation Park is part of the Sungei Kadut Eco-District. About 18 hectares of land has been set aside for the first phase of development for the Agri-Food Innovation Park in the district.\nThe Government has issued three sets of directions for immediate follow-up, said Mr Chan on Monday.\nThe relevant agencies –\xa0JTC Corp and the National Parks Board (NParks) –\xa0will conduct investigations into the clearance of the site. JTC will also conduct an internal review to check if public officers and private contractors have followed their current processes and look at how it can “better supervise” agencies and Qualified Personnel (QPs) as they implement the project.\nQPs are people involved in managing and coordinating a construction project.\nMeanwhile, NParks will identify breaches, if any, of the Parks and Trees Act and Wildlife Act. However, the Government will not make further comments on the ongoing investigations to avoid prejudicing the outcome, he said.\nThe minister added that Permanent Secretary (Defence Development) Joseph Leong, who was not directly involved with the site clearance, will be appointed to lead a review to identify “learning points” for project management, supervision, execution and inter-agency coordination.\nIn the course of his review, Mr Leong will have access to views from the public, private and people sectors, Mr Chan\xa0said.\nMr Chan, who is also Minister-in-charge of the Public Service, has also instructed all relevant agencies involved in land clearance projects to conduct an “immediate” check to make sure that their project supervision and implementation processes are in order, to “avoid any repeat of the mistakes made”.\n“The public service will learn from this and improve,” he said.\nJTC said on Monday in a factsheet that the site is not close to any “sensitive nature areas”.\n“Most of the site then comprised of disused scrubland, with a few scattered large trees (mostly Albizia). It is now dominated by non-native Albizia regrowth,” it said.\nSTRENGTHENING THE EIA PROCESS\nThe Ministry of National Development will continue efforts to strengthen the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) framework, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee at Monday’s briefing.\nEIAs are used to assess the potential environmental impacts of any proposed development.\nThe Government enhanced the EIA framework in October last year, said Mr Lee, after “close consultation” with the nature community and partner agencies, and has been working to “operationalise these changes”.\nThe enhancements include increasing the rigour of its environmental studies through the biodiversity impact assessment guidelines, stronger enforcement under the amended Wildlife Act, building up local expertise on ecological matters and making all environmental study reports publicly available except in cases with security considerations.\nIn its engagement with the nature community last year, the Government had also identified and discussed with them other ways to strengthen the EIA process, said Mr Lee.\nThis includes developing a “more comprehensive picture” of the islandwide ecosystem and connectivity, to “better consider” how specific sites connect to nature cores, buffers and corridors. It will also conduct baseline studies for specific sites “to understand their ecological profile and their role in ecological connectivity”.\n“In terms of conducting environmental studies, we’re reviewing whether it is better to centralise the management of EIA consultants, instead of having individual developers manage their own,” Mr Lee said.\n“I would like to reiterate that we take this incident very seriously,” he added. “The situation is concerning and it is regrettable and is deeply concerning that this has happened.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Rail Corridor ']}"

      Jakarta braces for more floods as rainy days expected this week
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: The Indonesian capital of\xa0Jakarta could see more flooding and landslides this week as the meteorology agency predicted rains of moderate to heavy intensity to\xa0sweep through the city over the next few days.\nThe rains will primarily hit Jakarta in the evening and last well into the morning, Mdm Dwikorita Karnawati, chief of the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said in a statement.\n“The intensity will weaken on Feb 22 but could intensify into moderate to heavy on Feb\xa023\xa0and 24,” she said, adding that this could trigger more flooding and landslides in Jakarta and its surrounding suburbs.\nSeveral areas in Jakarta and the neighbouring cities of Tangerang and Bekasi were inundated in water up to 2m deep on Saturday (Feb 20) morning. Mdm Karnawati said that day, Jakarta recorded between 154mm and 226mm of rain over a 24-hour period. Rainfall above 150mm a day is considered extreme.\nAccording to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, the rains caused several rivers to surge and overflow to crowded housing complexes along their banks.\nAt least five people were killed, four of them were children who were swept away by the strong river currents in separate places in South and West Jakarta. The other was a 67-year-old man who was trapped at his home in South Jakarta as water continued to submerge his neighbourhood. \xa0\nThe rains also overwhelmed Jakarta’s drainage system, causing several major streets and toll roads to be submerged in water up to 70cm deep, rendering them inaccessible. The floods also affected areas which are not considered flood prone.\n“My neighbourhood has never flooded before. I have lived here since I was five years old but on Saturday it was submerged,” Mdm Ratih Andriani, 41, told CNA of her neighbourhood in Jagakarsa, South Jakarta.\n“The rain was so heavy I had trouble sleeping. There was\xa0thunder and lightning too. At 3am, water on the small river behind my housing complex began to rise,” she continued. Two hours later, her neighbourhood was submerged in 40cm deep water.\nMdm Andriani said she suffered little property damage and that water in her neighbourhood receded at 10am. “But the floods have caused massive traffic jams and cut off access in some areas. I was supposed to take my daughter to see the doctors that day,” she said.\nMr Ferdinand Simanjuntak said he was stuck in the traffic for four hours for his 10km travel. “I was trying to get to my mother’s house. She was living alone and her house got flooded. But some roads were inaccessible and I had to take multiple detours through small back roads to get to where I needed to go,” he told CNA.\nBy the time he got to his mother’s house in Pejaten, South Jakarta, Mr Simanjuntak said she was taking shelter at a neighbour's house.\n“I braved the flood to retrieve a few precious belongings from my mother’s house. It was flooded in 1m-deep water. Her furniture and electronics were destroyed. I grabbed everything that I could save and I took my mother home with me,” he said. The two then spent hours trying to get out of the flood prone area.\nThe flooding had displaced more than 1,700 people. As of Monday morning, most of the victims\xa0had returned to their homes to clean the mud and silts covering\xa0their belongings.\nJakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said the floods had subsided completely as of Monday morning.\xa0\n“The number of neighbourhoods affected was 200 out of a total of 30,070 neighbourhoods (in Jakarta). So, 0.6 per cent (of Jakarta’s area) are affected. The number of victims was 329 families out of a total of 2.4 million families living in Jakarta,” the governor said in his office on Monday.\n“As of 3am on Monday morning, I can confirm that (water) had 100 per cent receded. All economic and government administrative activities have returned to normal,” he continued.\n“We have made preparations and thank god there are signs that we have done a good job. Despite the extreme rain, in one day, everything was managed well. The government will remain vigilant because the BMKG predicted that there is a chance of more extreme rainfall like what happened on Saturday and Sunday,” he said.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Jakarta ', '     flood ', '     environment ']}"

      India's glacier disaster highlights Himalayan dangers

This flood is God\'s retribution,"" the 43-year-old farmer said.\nScientists may not share his belief in divine punishment, but they agree that the blame for this latest disaster which killed 60 people and left 150 others missing lies largely with human activity.\nThe anthropogenic impact includes the shrinking of glaciers in the Himalayas, one of the regions hardest hit by global warming.\n\n\nThe recent disaster is thought by experts to have been caused by a chunk of glacier 15 football fields long and five across breaking off, bringing with it part of a rock face.\nThis dammed up a small river high in the mountains until the mass of backed-up water broke through with awesome ferocity and speed.\nThe roaring deluge of water, rocks and soil hurtled down a V-shaped valley, sweeping away homes, roads and bridges as well as around 200 people, many of whom have still not been found almost two weeks on.\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT\nThe latest catastrophe ""is clearly a fallout of climate change and in itself a tell-tale of our future"", HC\xa0Nainwal, one of the several glaciologists who visited the site, told AFP.\nIn the Indian Himalayas, about 10,000 glaciers are receding at a rate of 30m to 60m per decade.\nThe runoff can form glacial lakes which can then burst their banks in spectacular and destructive fashion.\nThe other factor can be heard in the regular thuds of dynamite ringing through the valleys of Uttarakhand state, where the recent flood struck.\nSome of this explosive activity is for new roads to beef up the disputed border with China following last year\'s clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.\nAn 800km highway is also being built to connect four religious sites - a pet project of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nBut the biggest problem is the construction of hydroelectric plants across the vast network of Himalayan rivers, part of India\'s drive to boost renewable energy.\nMore than 75 small and large power projects are operational in Uttarakhand and dozens more are planned - many without proper attention to the potential risks, experts say.\nNO TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT\nExperts say that these projects make other devastating flash floods more likely, while also increasing the risk of landslides.\nThe dangers were plain to see in 2013 when a flash flood killed 6,000 people in Uttarakhand and devastated the region.\nIn its wake, India\'s top court appointed a scientific committee that recommended no more hydro plants be built in the area - advice which is being ignored.\nLocals in the area - home to a famous 1970s campaign to protect trees -\xa0say that they have seen none of the promised economic benefits of the development and that their concerns have been ignored.\nThey launched a campaign in 2019 and petitioned a court over illegal sand mining and the dumping of muck in the Rishi Ganga river that they said was contributing to landslides and floods.\nBut deforestation for infrastructure projects, sand mining and quarrying continues.\n""We used to trust the government and believed that it was working for our welfare but that\'s not the case,"" Surinder Singh, 55, told AFP.\n""Any dam or road that threatens our lives and the mountains will be fought tooth and nail.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     India ', '     climate change ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Singapore's push for green infrastructure bonds will spur private sector into action, say experts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore\'s plan to fund infrastructure projects with green bonds is set to ""spur"" the private sector into action, paving the way for a steady supply and demand for green financing, industry experts told CNA.\nDeputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 16) that the Government will issue green bonds on select public infrastructure projects, with up to S$19 billion of public sector green projects already identified.\xa0\n“Sustainability efforts require capital. Green finances will be an important enabler,” said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister.\xa0\n“The issuance of green bonds by the Government will build on these efforts by deepening market liquidity for green bonds, attracting green issuers, capital, and investors, and anchoring Singapore as a green finance hub.”\nA green bond is a type of financial instrument designed to have environmental or climate-related benefits. They allow companies to integrate their sustainability strategies with their capital structure, analysts told CNA.\xa0\nInvestors are also looking for more transparency in sustainable and green practices from companies they invest in\xa0and may avoid investments in non-green projects, which would impact such companies over time, said OCBC’s head of debt capital markets Kenneth Yeoh.\nSPURRING PRIVATE SECTOR INTO ACTION\n“There is no doubt that there is increasing interest amongst Singapore businesses in green bonds; the sector has been evolving rapidly though, with investors increasingly focused in this area,"" said Mr Sean Henderson, co-head of debt capital markets Asia Pacific at HSBC.\n""We believe the Singapore Government’s leadership on green bond issuance will benefit private businesses, spurring them into action,"" he added.\nThis is because sovereign issuers are “generally best in practice”, and will pave the way for both private issuers and investors to become well-acquainted with green financing practices, he said.\nBonds issued by the Government will also encourage the development of the external reviewer market, requiring reviewing agencies to invest in expertise and grow in size. This will in turn drive down the cost and increase access for private companies to review their potential green projects, said Mr Henderson.\xa0\nIn his Budget speech, Mr Heng said the Government\'s issuance of green bonds for selected public sector projects will serve as a reference for the Singapore dollar corporate green bond market, including the standards and framework applied, as well as the yields achieved.\nFollowing his statement, OCBC\'s Mr Yeoh said that the “significant public sector support"" displayed by the Government is also expected to accelerate the adoption of green bond frameworks and standards, and make green bond issuances more mainstream.\n""The increase in sustainability-related language used within bond documentation can help set the new industry standard, and ease companies into issuing more green bonds where possible by increasing market liquidity and consequently driving investor demand,"" he said.\n\nDBS global head of fixed income Clifford Lee added that the issuance of such bonds by the Singapore Government is “well-placed” to meet growing demand from local and international investors.\n“This paves the way for a steady supply of green bonds to be issued out of Singapore, generating more secondary market activity, deepening and broadening our capital markets,” he added.\xa0\nIn terms of pricing, the Government-issued green infrastructure bonds are expected to be priced at a premium over Singapore Government Securities bonds, due to their novelty in the market, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nGREEN PROJECTS ACROSS SECTORS\nDuring his Budget speech, Mr Heng said that one of the green projects to be financed with green bonds is Tuas Nexus. The project will be Singapore’s first integrated waste and water treatment facility and is set to be completed in phases from 2025.\nIn the private sector, City Developments Limited in April 2017 issued a green bond to raise S$100 million, in what it said was the first such issuance by a Singapore company.\nThe proceeds raised were allocated towards various initiatives to enhance energy and water efficiency at Republic Plaza.\xa0\n“CDL issued the green bond amidst increased interest in responsible investment and a growing demand for relevant products,” said a company spokesman in response to CNA queries.\xa0\n“CDL’s inaugural green bond which was also the first by a Singapore company, links our sustainability initiatives with the capital markets and enables us to tap on investors who are supportive of the commitment that CDL has made towards sustainability best practices.”\xa0\nThe National University of Singapore (NUS) issued its inaugural green bond in May last year, raising S$300 million.\xa0\nThe funds were used to build the new SDE4 building, the first net-zero energy building in Singapore to be built from scratch. The building is among the first recipients for the Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) award, and is equipped with a hybrid cooling system and rooftop solar panels.\xa0\n“The green bond helps to open up access to green financing, which is increasingly relevant and critical as lenders become more conscious about sustainability,” said Mr Tan Kian Woo, the university’s senior vice president and chief financial officer.\xa0\n\nCompanies in Singapore have shown increasing interest in issuing green bonds, said the analysts, adding that they are confident in the importance of this market.\xa0\nAccording to the ASEAN Green Finance Report, the issuance of green bonds across ASEAN almost doubled from US$4.1 billion in 2018 to US$7.8 billion in 2019.\xa0\nIn 2019, Singapore contributed to 55 per cent of the ASEAN green debt issuance, up from 29 per cent in 2018, the same report showed.\xa0\nOCBC has seen an increase in the number of enquiries regarding the issuance of green and sustainability-linked bonds since 2019, and expects to see more Singapore companies issuing green bonds, said Mr Yeoh.\nThere were three Singapore dollar green bond issuances in 2020 - two by Ascendas REIT and one by NUS - totalling S$700 million, he added.\xa0\nOCBC supported both of the green bonds issued by Ascendas REIT last year. It was the sole\xa0lead manager, bookrunner and green finance advisor for Ascendas REIT\'s S$100 million 10-year notes and S$300 million subordinated perpetual securities in August and September.\xa0\nDBS\' Mr Lee\xa0said the bank underwrote S$5.3 billion worth of green bonds in 2020, an increase of about 30 per cent from the previous year.\nThe proceeds raised were for projects across the renewable energy, green building development, clean transportation and wastewater treatment sectors across the region.\n\nA RAPIDLY EVOLVING SECTOR\nAccording to analysts, the green bond market here has been dominated by real estate issuers.\nBut following the launch of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, statutory boards, as well as companies from the transport, waste and water management sectors are expected to also become predominant users of green finance, said Mr Henderson.\xa0\nThe Singaporean market for green bonds is “at an exciting stage” and there is demand from investors as well as government and private issuers, said Dr David Broadstock, a senior research fellow and lead energy economist at the NUS Energy Studies Institute.\n“Yet placing the optimism aside, Singapore’s existing market for green bonds is young, with considerable room for growth,” he added.\xa0\nAdding that Singapore is in the middle of a “truly exceptional” period of economic activity, he said that Singapore will ultimately be defined by its resilience towards growing green finance in the face of economic adversity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“The recognition by the DPM within the Budget speech is that Singapore is wanting to pursue a sustainable economic growth recovery as it emerges from the global pandemic which defined 2020, is testament alone that green bonds are a non-ignorable component of the menu of financial instruments available in Singapore, now and moving forward,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2021 ', '     environment ']}"

      Nature advocates call for mitigation measures after error in clearing parts of Kranji woodland area
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0The error in clearing parts of the Kranji woodland area could undermine recent efforts by Singapore authorities to better engage nature groups, said conservation advocates who expressed shock and disappointment at the mistake.\xa0\nThe 70ha Kranji woodland area, about the size of Jurong Lake Gardens, is along a green artery known as the Rail Corridor.\nAbout 18ha had been set aside for the first phase of development for the Agri-Food Innovation Park, but parts of it were mistakenly cleared by a contractor of JTC Corp before an environmental impact assessment could be completed.\nRevealing this on Tuesday (Feb 16), JTC said it engaged an environmental specialist to carry out a study in December and to work out an environmental management plan for specified plots of land in the area.\nThe study was expected to be completed around April, but land was cleared before that.\nJTC did not say when its contractor, Huationg, started clearing the area, but said it discovered the error on Jan 13 and instructed the firm to immediately stop all clearing work.\nCNA has contacted JTC for further information, including details on the area of land that was erroneously cleared.\nA CORRIDOR FOR WILDLIFE\nWhen CNA visited the work site on Wednesday, it was quiet with construction equipment sitting idle.\nAlong the nature walk nearby, a glimpse can be caught of dark green hoarding, but it is not obvious that the trees and shrubs beyond\xa0have been levelled.\nAerial photos posted by\xa0Facebook user Brice Li on Feb 14 showed swathes of land that have been cleared. Trees had been cut down on both sides with only a narrow strip of green remaining.\nFollowing his post, some nature advocates chimed in on social media.\n""This is a shocking development in an important green area of the Rail Corridor,"" said Facebook group We Support The Green Corridor in Singapore.\nThe forested area in Kranji is one of the few patches of woodland on the northern stretch of the Rail Corridor, said Mr Leong Kwok Peng, who chairs the Nature Society Singapore’s conservation committee.\nThe 24km rail corridor stretches from Tanjong Pagar in the south to Woodlands in the north of Singapore. The railway land, which belonged to Malaysia, was returned to Singapore in 2011 and it is seen as a green corridor that will link a number of future developments.\xa0\xa0\nIt is also a corridor for wildlife, said Mr Leong.\n“You can\'t just have a linear tree-lined area and hope that nature will just continue to move north and south. You must have some kind of forest patch in between for the animals to forage,” he added.\nMr Leong said the nature society has discussed mitigation measures with JTC and hopes that the belt of green that remains can be retained and widened. “Of course, it won’t be the same,” he said.\n“ONCE IT’S GONE, IT’S GONE”\nOther conservation champions CNA spoke to also expressed shock and disappointment at the erroneous clearance.\n“We can’t afford to make this kind of mistake,” said biological scientist N Sivasothi.\nHe added that the slip-up appeared to undermine efforts made by the authorities over the past few years to enhance consultations with nature groups.\nMr Sivasothi said once baseline studies are done, plans are usually discussed with nature groups to see how potential impacts can be mitigated or even avoided, which has been a move in the right direction.\nSpeaking of a\xa0detailed process of engagement, he said: “The fact that this all just gets dismissed without proper consideration is quite criminal at this stage.”\nConservation scientist and Nominated Member of Parliament Professor Koh Lian Pin added that baseline environmental studies help to highlight potential ecological impacts if the site is subsequently cleared or disturbed.\n“Since this part of Kranji woodland was cleared before the completion of its baseline study, we may never know the full extent of the ecological impacts of this clearance.”\nHe added that these studies are key in providing policymakers with scientific insights to “help them make more informed decisions and to consider the need for any mitigation actions”.\n“This is especially important in Singapore where we have to balance the many priorities of our society,” Prof Koh added.\nMP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) added that he was shocked by the erroneous clearing, especially amid the recent public focus on the importance of conserving green spaces.\n“As (MND) put it then, any decision to clear land must be based on science, that’s why these studies are important.\n“Now part of it is lost, and we might not know what we have lost,” said Mr Ng, who is also the chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment.\nMr Ng said he has filed a parliamentary question asking the National Development Ministry if it is investigating the error, and whether it will further strengthen the environmental impact assessment (EIA) framework to prevent any repeat of such mistakes.\nThe framework, first introduced in 2008, aims to determine and mitigate the potential impact\xa0of new developments on the environment.\nSpecifically, Mr Ng suggested codifying the framework into law.\nHe also said there is “no use crying over spilt milk”, and that it is more important to find out why it happened to make sure it does not occur again.\xa0\nProf Koh echoed this, adding that reviewing the failure would be “in the interest of maintaining public trust in the integrity of the process” of conducting environmental studies prior to development.\nAs for environmental remedial action, Mr Sivasothi warned that “once (the greenery) is gone, it’s gone”.\nThe next best course of action is to quickly re-examine the site for impact mitigation – and this would include roping in nature groups as soon as possible, said the senior lecturer at the department of biological sciences in the National University of Singapore (NUS).\nThe environmental “baseline” would also have to be reviewed again now that the forest has been impacted, he said.\n“With that terrible scar, we will just have to reassess according to the current situation.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Rail Corridor ', '     JTC Corporation ', '     environment ']}"

      Can Ganga be saved? What must be done to clean up India’s holy river?
  </h1>, 'text': 'DELHI: Fisherman Rambabu Sahani remembers his childhood days when the Ganga River used to be clear and fit for drinking.\n“The Ganga was so clean that the coins offered were visible at the bottom. But now there’s so much mud that visibility is zero,” says the 35-year-old. “We could drink the water … but now it’s not fit for drinking.”\nIn fact, the Ganga, or Ganges, has become so polluted that fishermen like him, in Varanasi city, “aren’t allowed to fish”. Even the fish there constitute a health risk.\n“This contamination isn’t visible with the naked eye, but found when fishes were tested,” says B D Tripathi, chairman of the Mahamana Malaviya Ganga Research Centre.\n“It was imperative that consumption of these fishes had to be stopped. Hence the only solution was to ban fishing.”\nSahani, however, has known no other life than fishing. He still goes out to fish, but the police “harass” the fishermen community all the time. “It has become challenging for us,” he says.\nThe Ganga is not only a holy river to the Hindus but also one of the bedrocks of Indian civilisation.\nAnd it faces a grave threat due to the numerous cremation rituals on its banks over the years, unplanned urban and industrial growth, and sewage and chemical effluents.\nReports since 2017 state that about 4.8 billion litres of sewage from 118 towns and cities flows into the Ganga daily, in addition to garbage and organic waste. But the functioning capacity of sewage treatment plants is only a billion litres.\nThe programme Insight examines whether the Ganga can ever return to a pristine state.\nIN HARM’S WAY\nAccording to India’s Central Pollution Control Board, pollution levels at 80 monitored sites on the Ganga have risen since 2013.\nThe biochemical oxygen demand was more than 3 milligrammes per litre at 36 sites — not even fit for bathing — and 2 to 3 mg per litre at another 30 sites in 2017.\nAs a reference, unpolluted rivers typically have levels below 1 mg per litre, whereas the pollution in Ganga reaches levels that are harmful to the river’s species and people who use the water.\n“Heavy pollution is a leading cause of bio-accumulation of any toxicant,” notes B D Joshi, professor emeritus of zoology and environmental science at Gurukula Kangri University.\n“Through fishes, it reaches human beings and … has been found causing a number of diseases like paralysis, like cancer, like skin diseases and hepatitis or, say, dysentery.”\nA significant factor in the pollution is the tanneries in Kanpur, the city in Uttar Pradesh state famed for processing animal hides into finished leather. “The process generated wastewater with high concentrations of chromium,” notes unemployed tannery worker Amit Kumar.\nThen in 2018, the Uttar Pradesh government shut down around 260 tanneries to keep the river clean. Many of them have since been allowed to reopen if they operate at 50 per cent of installed capacity and meet environmental norms.\nBut Kumar believes that many tannery owners are hoodwinking the government.\n“All the tanneries are being issued notices. Once the notice comes, the owners shut down the operations but start operating in the night and drain the polluted water,” says the 38-year-old.\nAsad Iraqi, general secretary of the Leather Industries Welfare Association, says the fault lies mainly with the sewage treatment plants.\n“Either (the tanneries) are sending their effluent for the final discharge to the common treatment plants … (or) doing all their treatments on their own premises. And the tanneries that are running are all achieving the parameters imposed,” he says.\n“But the common treatment plants have not been upgraded. Most of the civil sewage is going untreated into the holy river.”\nAmid these claims and counter-claims, Kanpur has become a “symbol of pollution”, says Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, the director general of the National Mission for Clean Ganga.\n“Kanpur is the largest city (in the state). Something like 35 lakhs — 3.5 million-plus (people) — are there, water becomes less and … sewage and industrial pollution both have been a major cause of concern.”\nLIVELIHOODS AND LIFE LOST\nAfter the crackdown on tanneries, Kumar lost his job and has had to turn to manual labour and other means, including going without food, to survive and feed his family.\nDownstream in Varanasi, Sahani’s livelihood is also affected. “I used to earn 2,000 rupees (S$36) per day. And these days, I make around 200 to 300 rupees a day. We go fishing, but the fish aren’t there,” he says.\n""After (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi came to power, we had high expectations that our lives would change for the better, but our income\'s been reduced.""\nTo save the river they worship, some holy men have put their lives on the line.\nG D Agarwal, an environmental scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology who became a swami, began a hunger strike in 2018 to check the river’s abuse. He died after fasting for 111 days.\nSwami Shivanand Saraswati, the founder of the Matri Sadan ashram in Haridwar — in the foothills of the Himalayas — says he is also willing to give his life for the cause.\n“We’ve renounced the world, no doubt (about it). But renouncing the world doesn’t mean that we can’t see the plight of the people, of the society, of the environment and we can’t do anything,” says the 73-year-old.\n“Renunciation doesn’t mean that one will become passive. We’re not passive saints.”\nA member of his ashram, Swami Atmabodhanand, a former computer science student, fasted for 194 days. He ended his fast after the Indian government gave a written assurance that it would act to save the river.\nBut the 28-year-old says the government has not kept its promise, so the monks are set to keep fighting until four main demands are met.\nSwami Shivanand says: “Firstly, the (work on) four dams that’s going on … should be (halted). At the same time, (pebble) mining should be stopped in Haridwar.\n“Thirdly, there should be a Ganga parishad (council), which would take care of the Ganga, and (fourthly) a Ganga Act.”\nGOVERNMENT SPENDING BILLIONS\nDespite the criticism and doubts, the government affirms that it is on course for its Clean Ganga mission and is also committed to maintaining the river’s uninterrupted flow — but more time and discussion are needed.\n“We’re trying to work (it) out and convince other stakeholders also,” says Mishra. “We’ve met (the swamis) … and they’ve also been reassured enough to agree with us and then give (us) some more time.\n“It’s good that all stakeholders have the interest of the Ganga in their mind, but there would be some limitations (and) time frame in which these things will happen.”\nModi launched his flagship Namami Gange programme a month after he took office in 2014. The 200-billion-rupee programme aims to set up several sewage treatment plants, develop riverfronts, clean up the river and restore biodiversity along the way.\nAnd over the years, there have been some changes.\nBefore 2014, tour guide Vimal Kumar Pathak often found it “embarrassing” when he showed tourists round the river and Varanasi because of the filth.\n“The boatman and I would have to work together and divert tourists’ attention to the other side, away from scenes of people defecating on the riverbank,” cites the 55-year-old.\nBut in recent years, he has noticed that the riverbanks, long filled with trash and human excrement, appear to be cleaner.\n“People have become aware and stop others defecating on the ghat,” he says. “There’s no question that more tourists, both domestic and foreign, are coming to Benares (Varanasi).”\nHis earnings have increased, he adds, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“(When) the effects of the cleaning began to show, I noticed that the tourists … would change their preconceived notions. Instead of staying only one or two nights, they’d stay for four nights,” he cites.\n“There’s no doubt that the cleanliness of the Ganga and its ghats has been a significant factor in this.”\nThe government is also confident that the clean-up project will not suffer because of the pandemic.\n“COVID-19 … has been a big challenge globally. But I’m very happy to tell you that not even for a day (did) the sewage treatment plants that were constructed and the Namami Gange stop working,” says Mishra.\n“As far as finances are concerned, I can tell you the programme is structured in such a way that we haven’t felt any (financial) crunch … Nowhere in the field has any release (of money) been stopped.”\nIT’LL NEED MORE THAN MODI\nAfter the pandemic began last year, India’s nationwide lockdown also led to a cleaner Ganga.\n“There were certain activities not taking place, and there was less demand for water,” notes Suresh Kumar Rohilla, senior director at the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi.\n“So there was more water flowing into the river, and the pollutants were diluted.”\nAs India’s pre-eminent river system, however, it soon showed why it has borne the brunt of the country’s growing population, rapid industrialisation and urbanisation.\n“The moment the lockdown was lifted and industries started working and cities continued to flow sewage into the river, you can see the difference now. We’re back to square one,” says Rohilla.\nFor some, like Kumar, better days have yet to dawn. “I can only ask the government to find a solution without shutting down the tannery industry or closing businesses,” he says.\nWATCH: Can India save the ‘dying\' Ganga River? (49:13)\nModi has made the Ganga clean-up a primary mission of his government, but Joshi the professor emeritus thinks the river is “dying”.\n“The Ganga will be cleaned only partially,” he says. “We can never attain the … purity of the river Ganga, which we enjoyed 50 or 60 years back.”\nMishra stresses the need for buy-in from everyone. “No one person can save the Ganga … It has to be a collaborative work. And whatever we’ve seen, I can tell you in the last three years I’ve seen change,” he says.\n“We have to believe in it. And ‘we’ is the answer. Only when everyone joins this effort will it be possible, and it’s certainly possible.”\nWatch this episode of Insight here.

      BlackRock warns heavy polluters over emissions data before shareholder meetings
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Polluting companies must disclose the full scope of their greenhouse gas emissions or risk confrontation with investors at their annual shareholders meetings, the world\'s biggest asset manager BlackRock said on Wednesday.\nThe warning is the first time BlackRock has publicly sought the release of so-called Scope 3 emissions data, part of its plans to hold companies more to account over climate change.\nScope 3 refers to emissions generated by a company\'s products or services, rather than just its own operations. For an oil company, for example, this would include the emissions created when its gasoline is used in a car.\nThe news comes weeks after BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink made climate central to his annual letter to company CEOs, and follows a December move to scale up the number of companies it talks to on the issue.\nThat more than doubled the number of heavy-emitting companies facing intensive talks to 1,000, although not all would face a vote against directors in the current season of shareholder meetings, with votes dependent on specific circumstances.\n""Where corporate disclosures are insufficient to make a thorough assessment, or a company has not provided a credible plan ... we may vote against the directors we consider responsible for climate risk oversight,"" BlackRock said.\n""We may also support shareholder proposals that we believe address gaps in a company\'s approach to climate risk and the energy transition,"" it said.\nBlackRock has been criticised by activists for not ensuring change happens more quickly, particularly given it is often a major shareholder or even the biggest in firms it invests in.\nKatrin Ganswindt, a campaigner with environmental group Urgewald, said BlackRock should ditch holdings in companies that did not comply with its demands over emissions.\n""Potentially voting against boards is an important way for the world\'s largest asset manager to take its massive responsibility seriously. However, without the actual threat of exclusion, this policy update remains yet another paper tiger,"" she said.\nBlackRock has previously told companies it wants to see their plans for prospering in a low-carbon economy, but the latest missive provides more detail about what that entails.\nOn target-setting, it wants to see shorter-term goals over the next five years and medium-term targets over 10 years to ensure companies\' longer-term plans are solid.\nIt also wants decision-makers to be well-versed on climate.\n""We expect directors to have sufficient fluency in climate risk and the energy transition to enable the whole board – rather than a single director who is a \'climate expert\' – to provide appropriate oversight of the company’s plan and targets,"" BlackRock said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     pollution ']}"

      Sabah sea gypsies grapple with dwindling fish catch, sinking villages as climate change threatens way of life
  </h1>, 'text': 'KOTA KINABALU: As the sun began to set, fisherman Lan Tumpat docked\xa0his rickety wooden boat.\nThe 30-year-old then hoisted his oar, a fishing rod and an empty pail onto the battered wooden planks in front of his home.\n“No fish today. The winds were blowing strong and I came back,” said Mr Lan, wiping sweat off his brow with a rag.\n“Not worth risking being capsized in the dark,” he added in broken Malay.\nMr Lan lives with his wife and five\xa0children at\xa0the floating village of Kampong Tanjung Aru Lama, around 50m off the coast of Sabah’s\xa0capital, Kota Kinabalu.\nLike his father and grandfather, Mr Lan, a stateless sea gypsy, feeds his family by combing the South China Sea for grouper, red carp and catfish.\nHowever, he said\xa0fishing has become more hazardous by the day in recent years.\n“I’ve been fishing all my life. But over the last few years, the weather changes very quickly and winds are more unpredictable. There is more danger of capsizing,” said Mr Lan.\nLike the dozens of other sea gypsies who fish for food in his village, Mr Lan uses a small sampan he built himself and paddles with an oar. Sailing in\xa0the dark\xa0amid a storm is not an option for him. \xa0\nMr Lan is one of thousands of ethnic Bajau Laut people, or sea gypsies, whose families fled to Sabah in the 1970s to escape\xa0the war between the Philippine government and the independent movement by the Moro National Liberation Front, resettling in many parts of the state\xa0such as Lahad Datu, Semporna, Sandakan and even off the coasts of Kota Kinabalu.\nThey live a nomadic lifestyle, fishing for sustenance and staying on stilt\xa0houses in coastal waters.\nExperts say that rising sea temperatures, brought on by global warming, and extreme changes in weather patterns have diminished their ability to fish for food.\nAdditionally, rising sea levels in Borneo could also sink the Bajau villages, threatening their very existence.\nBAJAU LAUT FIRST TO FEEL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE\xa0\nMr Laili Basir, a social activist\xa0who works closely with Bajau Laut communities along the eastern coast of Sabah, told CNA that the sea gypsies tend to bear the brunt of climate change because of their proximity to the ocean.\n“They are frontliners at\xa0the sea and for issues like (global warming, rising sea levels), they are impacted first,” said Mr Laili, who founded the HUGS project, a non-governmental initiative to educate and give out necessities to the Bajau Laut.\nAlthough Mr Laili is based in Pahang in peninsular Malaysia, he visits Sabah regularly to do humanitarian work.\nHe noted that some Bajau have reported dwindling fish catch recently as the weather has become more unpredictable.\n“The Bajau are very adaptable to changes in the environment. Each fisherman\xa0typically needs to catch 1kg of fish every day to feed the\xa0family, as opposed to commercial fisherman who fish 10\xa0times that amount,” said Mr Laili.\n“But over the last five years or so, the weather changes have been more extreme and this has made it difficult for them to fish in their small sampans,” added the 49-year-old.\nMalaysia’s latest biennial update report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change submitted in 2018 indicates that its temperature, rainfall and sea level\xa0have been rising for the past four decades, a trend that is projected to continue for the next 30 years.\nAverage temperature\xa0in Malaysia is\xa0projected to increase by between 1.2 degrees Celsius and 1.6 degrees Celsius by 2050, the report states, leading to various implications such as extreme weather and unpredictable waters off its coasts.\n\n\nDr Serina Rahman, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute who has studied sustainable coastal development in Southeast Asia, noted that increasingly frequent changes in weather and wind patterns have\xa0impacted coastal communities in Malaysia, including the Bajau Laut.\n“Indigenous and fishing communities depend on safe seas to earn a living and these increasingly strong winds, changes in weather will affect their catch when they are at sea.\xa0So it then affects their food security and livelihoods,” said Dr Serina, who is based in Johor.\xa0\nShe pointed out that artisanal fisherman, including the Bajau Laut in Sabah are reporting more frequent cases of capsizing while trying to fish in uncertain weather conditions.\nMost Baju Laut fishermen are only fishing to feed their families and are unwilling to switch to commercial fishing boats, she also said.\xa0“These are not fishermen who\xa0can travel out further in big boats. They are their own bosses and traditional fishing is cultural heritage, a tradition, a ritual\xa0and a generational pride thing,” said Dr Serina.\nMr Lan\xa0who lives in Kampong Tanjung Aru\xa0Lama, is an\xa0example.\n“Fishing and being a Bajau is my life. I will never change,” he said. “Moving to the city and finding another kind of work is not an option for me and my children.”\nSEA LEVEL RISE THREATENS HOMES\nBesides extreme weather, the Bajau Laut communities in Sabah also have to contend with rising sea levels, which could destroy their homes in\xa0the coming years.\nAccording to a report by Malaysia’s National Hydraulic Research Institute (Nahrim), sea levels have been rising by between 0.2mm and 4.4mm annually in the country\xa0since 2010 due to climate change.\nNahrim added that this could lead to inundated coasts and affect\xa0around 8 million people. The report also said that among the areas with the highest sea level rise are along the east coast of\xa0Sabah, which could see an increase of between 0.4mm and 1.1mm.\nThe towns expected to be worst hit are Tawau, Kudat, Lahad Datu, Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu, all of which have Bajau Laut communities living nearby.\nAssociate Professor Haliza Abdul Rahman, who is with\xa0University Putra Malaysia’s department of environmental and occupation health, told CNA that sea level rise could impact coastal communities like the Bajau Laut by causing more frequent coastal flooding, coastal erosion, impeded drainage and submerging the land they live on.\nMr Laili, the activist said some of the Bajau communities in eastern Sabah have begun to notice these changes.\n“Some of them have realised that their homes are getting closer and closer to the water. There are also some whose homes are already completely submerged,” said Mr Laili.\n“Whatever happens though, the Bajau are able to adapt. They will build their homes on higher stilts or move to an area less prone to flooding,” he said.\nHowever, not all Bajau Laut communities are able to move or act in accordance with rising sea levels.\xa0\nA Bajau Laut fisherman who lives in Kampong Tanjung Aru\xa0Lama, who wanted to be known only as Janau, told CNA that he has noticed that the sea level has been getting higher over the last few years.\nHe said that the higher tide has resulted in more flooding in\xa0the village, and washed trash from the surrounding areas to the homes.\nWhen CNA visited the area, there was\xa0plastic, metal and wooden\xa0trash surrounding the floating village.\nJanau said: “It’s not ideal but we just get on with life. We are not going to move because everything we need is here.”\nPUBLIC EDUCATION KEY TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION\nAssoc Prof Haliza said that there is a need to educate Bajau Laut communities on the causes and impacts of climate change.\n“Local attitudes toward the environment will play a central role in adjustments to climate change,” she said.\n“The capacity of societies to change both belief and behaviour regarding the use of the environment will be key in mitigating these risks,” Assoc Prof Haliza added.\n\n\nDr Serina stated\xa0that the situation with the Bajau Laut is “tricky” because of the fact that they are stateless, meaning that the government does not recognise their existence.\xa0\n“Unfortunately they are undocumented and in Sabah, often treated as unwanted intruders to the state,” said Dr Serina.\n“Given this situation, they won\'t have any voice on any level. I\'m not even sure that climate change issues are really high on their list of needs. What they need is regular schooling and\xa0education for the kids, healthcare and documentation.""\nShe added: ""Things like environmental conservation and climate change barely come across their radar when they are struggling for survival.”\n\n\nAnother issue is language and communication, said Mr Laili, as the Baju Laut\xa0speak in their own language and struggle to grasp basic general knowledge like money.\n\xa0“What we teach them is very basic things, how to read, to write, how to count money,” he said.\n“Once we break this communication barrier, we can talk about issues (like climate change) that could impact their future, and the lives of their next generations,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     environment ', '     climate change ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Green Plan seeks to create new jobs, make use of sustainability as 'competitive advantage' for Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A green economy\xa0which will seek\xa0to create new jobs,\xa0transform local\xa0industries, and harness sustainability as a competitive advantage, will be part of Singapore\'s push for sustainable development.\nNamed as one of the five key pillars in the Singapore Green Plan 2030\xa0which was unveiled on\xa0Wednesday (Feb 10), the green economy will include a number of new targets, such as Jurong Island becoming\xa0a sustainable energy and chemicals park.\nThe other four pillars of the Green Plan are entitled: ""City in Nature"", ""Sustainable Living"",\xa0""Energy Reset"" and\xa0""Resilient Future"".\nDescribed as a “whole-of-nation movement” to advance the national agenda on sustainable development, the Green Plan\xa0is spearheaded by\xa0the Ministries\xa0of Education, National Development, Sustainability and the Environment, Trade and Industry and\xa0 of Transport. It aims\xa0charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years.\xa0\nMore details on the Green Plan will be released at the upcoming Budget\xa0announcement on Feb 16, as well as during the Committee of Supply debate in Parliament expected later this month.\nUnder the green economy, Singapore will\xa0aim to\xa0become a sustainable tourism destination, a\xa0leading centre for green finance and services to facilitate Asia’s transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future, as well as\xa0a leading regional centre for developing new sustainability solutions, said the ministries in a press release.\nSingapore will also develop and trial new technologies for carbon capture, utilisation and storage, as well as study the potential of low-carbon hydrogen and other emerging technology pathways for decarbonisation.\n\n\nWhen it comes to carbon intensive sectors, the plan will also seek to ensure that new carbon-intensive investments brought into Singapore are among the ""best-in-class"" when it comes to\xa0factors such as carbon efficiency\xa0and energy efficiency.\nAs part of the green plan, the Government\xa0also said that it would review the Singapore\'s carbon tax by 2023.\nMinister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu had previously noted that the\xa0carbon tax was “central” to the country’s climate mitigation strategy, adding that it was the one of the “most comprehensive globally” at 80 per cent of total emissions.\n\n\n“Our carbon tax framework has been tailored to our context, putting in place a fair, uniform and transparent price signal to incentivise emissions reductions,” she said.\nAn increase of Singapore\'s carbon tax was suggested\xa0by a number of Members of Parliaments in a parliamentary sitting last week.\xa0\nAN ""ENERGY RESET""\nOne of the key initiatives as part of Singapore\'s ""energy reset"" is the requiring of all new car registrations to be cleaner-energy models from 2030. The Government also hopes to\xa0more than double the targeted number of electric vehicle charging points\xa0from 28,000 to 60,000 charging points by 2030.\xa0\nThis builds on the announcement in last year\'s Budget where a\xa0series of measures, including additional incentives to purchase environmentally friendly vehicles, were\xa0introduced as part of Singapore\'s vision to have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040.\nWhen it comes to sustainable towns and districts, the ministries\xa0reiterated the previously set 2030 target of\xa0reducing\xa0energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15 per cent.\n\n\nThere are also plans to raise\xa0the sustainability standards of our Singapore\'s buildings through the next edition of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan.\nThe masterplan will ""pave the way"" for a low carbon built environment, said the joint-ministry press release. Among other things, it will raise minimum energy performance requirements, as well as review the Green Mark scheme.\nOn the green energy front, Singapore will aim to increase solar energy deployment by five times\xa0to at least 2 gigawatt-peak, which can meet around 3 per cent\xa0of its 2030 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 350,000 households a year. It will also continue to\xa0diversify its\xa0electricity supply with clean electricity imports.\nOther goals include promoting\xa0sustainable fuels for international trade and travel, as well as\xa0increasing\xa0solar deployment in Singapore.\n""The comprehensive plan will strengthen Singapore’s economic, climate and resource resilience, improve the living environment of Singaporeans, and bring new business and job opportunities,"" said the ministries.\n""It will influence all aspects of our lives, from how we live to how we work, and play, as we work together as a nation to make Singapore a greener and more liveable home.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     climate change ', '     jobs ', '     sustainability ']}"

Your children are getting ready to go to school on a cleaner-energy bus. At their carbon-neutral school, they will learn about climate change\xa0and compost their food waste for the school’s community garden.\xa0\nMotion sensor lights in the common areas come alive as you leave the house for work\xa0and you make your way down to the dual bicycle racks where you parked your two-wheeler.\xa0\nNext comes the 40-minute journey to your office.

You try to remember if you closed the windows before you left the house. The urban water harvesting system at your block collects the rainwater to recycle it for non-potable uses.\xa0\nAll this and more could soon be a reality for Singapore by 2030, with the unveiling of the Singapore Green Plan on Wednesday (Feb 10).\xa0\n\n\nThe plan charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years, and is spearheaded by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Ministry of National Development (MND), the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Ministry of Transport (MOT).\xa0\nIt also positions Singapore to achieve its long-term net-zero emissions goal “as soon as viable”, and strengthens the country’s commitments under the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Paris Agreement, said the five ministries in a joint media release on Wednesday.\xa0\nSCHOOLS AND TRANSPORT\nThe plan laid out some new initiatives, building on Singapore’s current green goals.\xa0\nOne objective is to reduce the waste sent to the landfill by 30 per cent, aiming for a 20 per cent reduction by 2026, said the five ministries in the media release.\xa0\nThe Government aims for at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon-neutral by 2030 “for a start”, with the rest of the schools to follow, working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the school sector by 2030.\xa0\nIn schools, the Green Plan will be supported by the Eco Stewardship programme, to “strengthen the inculcation of informed, responsible and sustainability-conscious” mindsets and habits in youth.\xa0\n\n\nAnother initiative requires all new car registrations to be cleaner-energy models from 2030, and that the number of electric vehicle charging points be doubled by 2030.\xa0\nUnder the plan, Singapore will only purchase cleaner-energy public buses and encourage walking and cycling.\xa0\nBy 2030, the country hopes to achieve 75 per cent of mass public transport modal share. It also looks to expand the rail network from about 230km today to 360km, and triple cycling paths from 460km today to 1,320km.\xa0\n\n\nThe Green Plan also laid out some new targets for green spaces, water and solar energy.\xa0\nSingapore hopes to double its annual tree planting rate between 2020 and 2030, to plant 1 million more trees across the island. The ministries hope to increase the land area of nature parks by over 50 per cent from the 2020 baseline.\xa0\nBy 2030, every household will be within\xa010-minute walking distance of a park. By 2035, Singapore hopes to add 1000 ha of green spaces.\xa0\nSingapore also plans to develop new town concepts. For example, Tengah will have the first car-free HDB town centre.\xa0\nWATER AND ENERGY\nWith the plan, the Government aims to reduce household water consumption to 130 litres per capita per day.\xa0\nUnder the climate-friendly household programme, shower fitting replacements will encourage water conservation and water-efficient practices for households, said the authorities in the media release.\xa0\nA mandatory water efficiency labelling scheme will also be implemented.\xa0\n\n\nUnder the 10-year HDB Green Towns programme, Singapore will introduce smart LED lighting that uses 60 per cent less energy than normal LED lighting, and double the total solar capacity on HDB rooftops by 2030.\xa0\nThe Government also aims to reduce energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15 per cent by 2030.\xa0\nThose who stay in HDBs can look forward to urban farms and community gardens on the top decks of multi-story carparks. New HDB towns will also be greener and more sustainable - Tengah town will have a centralised cooling system.\xa0\nThe Jurong Lake district will be developed as a model “sustainable mixed-use district”\xa0with district cooling, solar power deployment and super low-energy buildings.\xa0\nThe Green Plan will be a “living plan”, said the ministries, which evolves as they develop and refine Singapore’s strategies. It will take into account technological developments, and incorporate a “continuous national engagement” process.\xa0\nThe ministries will “actively involve” the public and other partners to further develop ideas and undertake relevant initiatives\xa0as part of this national engagement process.\nThis will begin with a series of Green Plan Conversations\xa0this year to seek the views of Singaporeans and to explore potential partnerships.

      Under siege by climate, man-made problems, a sinking Ho Chi Minh City fights to survive
  </h1>, 'text': 'HO CHI MINH CITY: Nguyen Van Cu is a construction engineer whose speciality is raising homes. That means he has been busy of late.\nHe recently put the finishing touches to a house he had lifted by more than two metres. A few years ago, he raised a 6,000-tonne church.\n“When the pastor said the church would be raised by two metres, nobody in the parish believed him. They just didn’t think it would’ve been possible,” Cu recalls.\n“The pastor said to me … ‘I had faith in you, but hearing what others in the parish said (worried) me.’”\nToday, many people in Ho Chi Minh City want their houses raised — because not only does it flood every year during the May to November rainy season, but also the flooding is getting worse.\nThe city of nearly nine million residents is facing extreme weather conditions more frequently, but the infrastructure to mitigate flooding has not kept pace.\nWhile the authorities have raised the roads, one consequence is everyone is racing to raise their property higher than the road level.\nFor fruit seller Tuan Hoang, who has a fruit juice stall along the roadside, frequent flooding has made it difficult to run his business.\n“The water would rise here. On the road, the water would be higher than half the tyre … Where the street is lower, the water would (cover) a whole tyre,” he says.\n“It’s hard for people to stop by and buy stuff.”\nPopulation growth and rapid urbanisation have caused the city to sink as much as 80 millimetres a year during the past 20 years. But worse is to come with climate change and rising sea levels.\nBy 2050, parts of Vietnam’s biggest metropolis could slip underwater, according to a report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n\nAnd with some of the solutions offered by the authorities — like building a giant dyke — sparking a debate about the suitability and risks, the programme Insight explores whether one of Asia’s fastest-growing economic centres can be saved.\nCHALLENGES ON MULTIPLE FRONTS\nSitting in a flat delta region, 40 to 45 per cent of Ho Chi Minh City is less than a metre above sea level. So that has made it increasingly vulnerable to heavy rainfall, storms and rising sea levels.\nMany parts of the coastal city are already subject to regular tidal floods. But climate change is not the only cause of the city’s flood problems.\n“The second cause is the disappearance of natural canals and green spaces that help with the city’s drainage,” says 24-year-old environmentalist Hai Long Vu Diep.\nThe city has grown relentlessly, adding 1.8 million residents between 2009 and 2019, not including migrants. But the density of its green space for trees is only about two square metres per person.\n“It’s very low,” says Ngo Viet Nam Son, the president of NgoViet Architects and Planners. “In other (advanced) cities, that may be 10 times higher, even more.\n“When the rain comes down … we need adequate green space to hold the water.”\nThe city, which covers more than 2,000 square kilometres, is developing so rapidly that it is also sinking, especially the chunks of built-up areas near the banks of the Saigon River, where the soil is soft.\n“Those are areas that are considered problematic right now,” says Nguyen Viet Ky, who heads the Geotechnics Division at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. “It’s clear that there’s too much development density concentrated in weak foundation areas.”\nThe land subsidence can occur quite quickly when high-rises are built.\n“They put a lot of pressure on the current infrastructure system,” observes Son. “When it rains heavily, you can see that the area that’s most flooded is the area that’s next to some new development.”\nAnother cause of subsidence is the over-extraction of groundwater, which would create underground cavities that may collapse, thereby causing the soil on top to sink.\nThe city’s rapid expansion has left the water supply system to play catch-up. So, while waiting for piped water, many residents and businesses have resorted to extracting groundwater.\n“Thousands of (wells) — small ones, big ones, household or industrial-scale — have been built,” notes Ho Long Phi, vice managing director (operations and research) of urban consultancy enCity.\n“At the highest level, we could observe more than a million cubic meters per day of total groundwater extraction during the past 20 years.”\nWATCH: Why is Ho Chi Minh City sinking? (2:44)\nDELTA-WIDE PROBLEM\nThe authorities have since put in place measures to slow down the extraction of groundwater and help prevent further subsidence.\nOwing to the distribution of piped water “all over the city”, says Ky, the rate of groundwater extraction has been “significantly reduced” to around 300,000 cubic metres.\nPiped water was made available to Nguyen Kim Thanh’s family just over a year ago, for example, after years of them relying on groundwater as their only source of water.\nThe housewife now uses the treated water to cook. But the family still pumps water from their well “to water plants and wash (their)\xa0scooters”.\nThe reduced groundwater extraction has been crucial, but the authorities still have their work cut out for them.\nAnd it is not only Ho Chi Minh City that is sinking, but also the delta region of Southern Vietnam which it sits on, from the Saigon Delta to the Mekong Delta.\n“The whole delta has been sinking faster than the sea-level rise,” says Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent consultant and ecological expert on the Mekong Delta. “At the hotspots, we’re sinking 10 times faster than the sea-level rise.\n""So the water rises and inundates the cities along this stretch of land.""\nLike in Ho Chi Minh City, groundwater extraction has aggravated the subsidence. But there is also another reason.\n“Because we extract sand. To build this building, to build roads, we need sand,” says Marc Goichot, the World Wildlife Fund\'s freshwater lead in the Asia-Pacific. “So the sand isn’t replenishing the delta.\n“Even if we stop the extraction of water … the subsidence will continue. It’ll be slower, but it’ll continue. So the only way to address the subsidence is by ensuring that more sediment … is able to be deposited in the floodplains.”\nDang Nha Cong, a fifth-generation farmer in Southern Vietnam whose family’s farming tradition goes back more than 150 years, is now worried about the future of his agricultural land and its tropical fruits, even after building a barrier around it.\n“Everyone here suffers from floods … Even the street gets flooded,” says the 75-year-old living near Can Tho city. “If it rises another 50 to 70 centimetres or if it rises a whole metre, I wouldn’t know what to do.\n“If the farm’s flooded, all the trees will die.”\nExtreme flooding would also cost Ho Chi Minh City dearly. Global consultancy McKinsey estimates the infrastructure damage a once-in-100-years flood could cause today at US$200 million (S$267 million) to US$300 million.\nThe estimated knock-on effects could be an additional US$100 million to US$400 million. Real estate damage alone may reach US$1.5 billion. In 2050, the economic impact could be five to 10 times higher.\nHOW TO STOP THE SEA?\nThe threat of rising sea levels is more real for Vietnam than most others, notes Tran Ba Hoang, the head of the Southern Institute of Water Resources Research.\nIt is among the five countries most likely to be affected by global warming in future, according to the World Bank, in addition to the report by the UN intergovernmental panel.\n“Since it’s an assessment by an international body, I think it’s a dire warning to the government of Vietnam and local authorities in areas that would be flooded owing to rising sea levels,” says Hoang.\nAs of now, he notes, the average sea level increase — as measured in the port city of Vung Tau for the last 40 years — is 0.45 cm per year, which he described as “relatively high”.\nTo protect Ho Chi Minh City and the surrounding region, authorities have proposed building a sea wall — 23 km or longer — from Vung Tau to the coastal region of Go Cong, which could cost up to US$6.8 billion.\nIt would help to prevent the rising sea waters from entering the delta. Ky, an associate professor, calls it a “far-sighted proposal” and “meaningful” project.\nSome observers, however, believe that dykes are a “short-term” measure that alleviates the problem of rising sea levels but does not address other key issues.\n“If you address the symptoms with the dyke, you don’t solve the problem — you move the problem,” says Goichot.\n“Dykes stop the water from going to the floodplain. And the water going to the floodplain brings the sediment and deposits. That’s the solution.”\nThe high cost involved has led some analysts to question the project’s financial viability, given that dykes are also expensive to maintain as seen in the Netherlands.\n“Our economic status is not like theirs … and, truthfully, the cost would be very high,” says Pham Viet Thuan, the director of the Institute of Natural Resources and Environment Economics.\n""Neither the tidal angle nor the geographical features of the tidal currents in our country are the same with theirs. That’s why we can’t use a dyke to resolve the flooding.""\nThe risk to the ecosystem is another reason to not copy the Dutch approach to building dykes, cites Goichot.\n“You block the movement of nutrients, which is food for living organisms. And you create barriers to … the place where they feed or the place where they go to spawn, then you affect their life cycle,” he says.\n“(The Dutch) have one of the safest deltas on the planet because they can protect themselves from floods. But now they realise that they’ve lost fisheries and lost biodiversity. And that’s a very high cost. So now they’re removing dykes.”\nThe Mekong Delta already has “high dykes everywhere” to protect its agricultural land, points out Thien. But that does not resolve the problem of flooding.\n“When the high tide comes in from the sea, pushing the river water back … the river can’t find enough space because all the other lands are blocked by the high dykes,” he says.\n“Water has to find room somewhere. So it has to find room in the urban area, in the cities, where they’re still pretty open.”\nMULTI-PRONGED SOLUTION NEEDED\nDespite objections to the super-dyke plan on account of its environmental and economic impacts, the project looks set to go ahead.\nIf it is to improve Ho Chi Minh City’s defences, however, the project would not only be costly, but also take a long time to complete.\nIn South Korea, the 33-km Saemangeum sea dyke and land reclamation project has taken 30 years since construction began, cites Ky. The sea wall itself needed almost 20 years to construct.\nHo Chi Minh City has barely 30 years until the results of climate change are seen in 2050. With rising sea levels, land subsidence and infrastructural shortcomings, can anything else be done to save the economic heart of Vietnam?\nHoang the fruit seller, who has often watched in dismay as floodwaters rushed down the streets in his neighbourhood, has only one choice.\n“I assess how high the water is, and I raise my stall. The higher the water, the higher the stall … When it overflows, well, we have to live with the floods,” he says.\n“I try to do my business as usual. It’s not as if I can quit.”\nWATCH: The full episode — Asia\'s sinking cities: Ho Chi Minh City (48:15)\nBut that can only be a small part of a multi-pronged solution overall. “First, the authorities must swiftly and effectively deal with groundwater extraction,” says Diep, who is starting his master’s in resource and environmental engineering.\n“Second, we must develop more green spaces and reservoirs around Ho Chi Minh City. Finally, and very importantly, the city must improve its current drainage system.”\nIt is about living with nature and not “trying to control nature”, adds Goichot. “We need to understand those processes and build with them. It’s not only a good, catchy concept, it’s really what we need to do.\n“It isn’t so easy to implement, but it’s probably the most cost-effective way to adapt to climate change.”\nWatch this episode of Insight here.

      IN FOCUS: The fight against Jakarta’s devastating yearly floods
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: As thunderous clouds roll in from the sea, Jakarta residents brace themselves for a familiar scenario.\nHeavy showers soon drench parts of the city and in just a few hours, rainwater begins to overwhelm the\xa0drainage system.\nWhen that happens, major streets, roads and back alleys are inundated in ankle-deep, sometimes knee-deep water, causing traffic gridlocks so severe that\xa0motorists find themselves stuck on the roads for hours.\xa0\xa0 \xa0\nBut there is more trouble to come. The\xa0clouds begin to move to the mountainous suburbs further south. As massive rainfall hits these upstream areas, creeks and rivers begin to swell and the dozens of flood control dams and sluice gates along their paths start to raise their alert level.\nIt won’t be long before the dams are overwhelmed and officials manning them are left with no choice but to release the water. A flood is imminent and the surging water is on its way to the capital city.\nResidents who live near the rivers are immediately notified. Like clockwork, they\xa0begin to move their precious belongings\xa0to\xa0safer places.\nThere are those who choose to abandon their homes entirely and seek refuge elsewhere. Others\xa0prefer to stay behind and protect their properties by keeping the water at bay.\xa0\nNo one can tell whether the flood will be\xa0severe. And sometimes people underestimate the extent of the incoming flood, resulting in devastating consequences.\nEach year, dozens of people are killed and thousands of houses across Jakarta are flooded in murky brown water up to 3m deep.\nOn Jan 24, hundreds of\xa0people were affected when floods inundated several major streets and housing complexes across Jakarta and neighbouring Bekasi after heavy showers swept across the two cities.\xa0\nBut the floods were nothing compared to the devastation caused by a massive flood in January last year, which killed 66 people and forced 170,000 people to seek shelter in Jakarta and its surrounding suburbs.\xa0\nOn average, a flood results in\xa0around US$532 million\xa0of property and infrastructure damage in the metropolitan area,\xa0according to\xa0estimates by the National Development Planning Agency.\xa0\nFlooding has affected Jakarta for centuries, all the way back to when the city was the capital of the Dutch East Indies and went by the name Batavia.\nAs the population grew exponentially and Jakarta became a\xa0vast metropolis,\xa0the problem became so severe and complex that mitigating the floods requires three provinces, multiple levels of governments and various agencies to work together. Occasionally, there is a lack of consensus on how to proceed.\nThere are multiple root causes, including deforestation, poor drainage, narrowing rivers and\xa0land subsidence. The authorities are exploring various options such as a giant sea wall, more dams and other technical solutions.\n\n\n“Jakarta residents really only have two expectations for their government:\xa0A traffic-free Jakarta and a flood-free Jakarta,” city planning expert Nirwono Joga told CNA.\xa0\nBut these expectations are by no means easy to meet. After decades and billions of dollars later, the goal of a flood-free Jakarta continues to be elusive.\nWith climate change bringing more extreme and unpredictable weather patterns, flooding is expected to\xa0worsen if nothing is done.\xa0\nUPSTREAM: MASSIVE LAND CONVERSION\nThe problem begins 50km south of the city, at\xa0the foothills of Mount Pangrango, a dormant volcano towering 3,000m above sea level.\xa0Natural springs and rainwater falling on its slopes\xa0eventually form major rivers that flow into Jakarta.\nLush green forests at the foot of the mountain have been cut down, replaced by housing complexes, posh villas, tourist resorts, high-rise hotels and chic restaurants.\nThese man-made structures have reduced the soil’s capacity to absorb the torrential rains and thunderstorms which frequently hit the area during the rainy season.\n“The water appears\xa0to be flowing faster and faster,” said Mr Abdul Lutfi, a resident of Megamendung district which straddles the Ciliwung River, the biggest and most flood-prone waterway to flow into Jakarta.\nIn some parts of Megamendung, the river sits on a deep ravine eight meters tall. On a summer day, the water is shallow and clear, moving sluggishly down the stream.\nBut during the rainy season, it is not uncommon to see the river raging with water level surging by 4m, bringing with it mud and debris which turn the water brown, said Mr Lutfi. Sometimes the river current is so strong that there are landslides.\nAccording to government data, the upstream regency of Bogor has lost 1,200sqkm of forests in the last 40 years while the number of dwellings increased 6,400 per cent. Forested areas now represent just 26 per cent of Bogor’s 2,664sqkm area. In 1980, the\xa0figure was\xa074.8 per cent.\nAs a result, water runoff increased from 15 per cent to around 70 per cent. \xa0\n“There is environmental degradation in Bogor. Water catchment capacity has reduced significantly. We can see this through the increase of water flowing to rivers,” said Mr Joga, the city planning expert. \xa0\nMeanwhile, torrential rains are happening more frequently and are\xa0of greater intensity, a consequence of the changing climate.\nAccording to the Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), daily rain intensity\xa0in Jakarta and the surrounding areas have been increasing each year by between 1mm to 2mm. The 377mm rainfall in one day that caused the devastating floods at\xa0the beginning of 2020 was the biggest in Jakarta’s recorded history.\nThere have been efforts to tear down the villas and reforest the upstream areas, Mr Joga noted, particularly after Jakarta began seeing\xa0bigger floods.\n“But the enforcement has not been maximum, because some of the villas belong to important people living in Jakarta. The enforcement has been selective, based on who owns the villas,” he said.\n“Villas, housing complexes and tourist areas continue to be built because that is the main source of income for the local government.”\nDOWNSTREAM: ""DRAINAGE SYSTEM CAN NO LONGER COPE""\nThe land conversion continues as the rivers make their\xa0way north. Along the way, riverfront villas and golf courses are replaced by modest houses and factories before the rivers enter Jakarta where high-rise apartments, office buildings and shopping malls compete for space with low-income neighbourhoods.\nAs Jakarta’s population grew, watersheds, marshlands and low-lying basins were\xa0converted into settlements.\n“Jakarta has areas called Rawa Buaya, Rawa Badak, Rawa Bambu and so on,” noted Mr Firdaus Ali, a water management expert and environmental engineering lecturer at\xa0University of Indonesia. “Rawa” means marshlands in Indonesian.\n“We used to let water inundate these areas because they served as buffers to contain excess water. But because we needed space, we converted them into commercial and residential areas.”\nThese former marshlands are\xa0flood-prone and Ms Yati Saimah, a resident of Rawamangun in East Jakarta knows this first hand.\n“I have lived here for 40 years and the flood was never this bad,” she told CNA of a flood that happened on Feb 25 last year. “Water inundated my neighbourhood up to my waist. Before it only went as deep as my knee.”\nRawamangun is 1km\xa0from the nearest waterway, the Cipinang River. Flooding here is not\xa0caused by river overflow but torrential rain. On Feb 25, heavy rain pelted the area for more than 12 hours.\nThe water did not completely recede until 12 hours later,\xa0the 45-year-old recounted.\nAmong the reasons for the flood water taking a longer time to recede\xa0is drainage issues in the city. During major floods in Jakarta, some areas have been inundated for days.\nAccording to Mr Ali, the water management expert,\xa0only 40 per cent of Jakarta’s 1,553km sewers and drainage pipes are functioning properly.\n“There are sewers which are clogged by trash and sediment, deformed, not connected to bigger drainage pipes, encroached by locals who built houses and shops over it. The city’s drainage system is paralysed and water cannot drain quickly,” he said.\nTo make matters worse, the city’s drainage system was designed to cope with 150mm of rain per day, which is inadequate during the rainy season\xa0when there could be more than 300mm of rain daily.\n“Our drainage system can no longer cope with the amount of rainfall we are seeing, which is expected to increase as a result of climate change,” city planning expert Mr Joga said.\nMr Joga\xa0estimated that only 33 per cent of Jakarta’s drainage system is working properly.\nJakarta’s drainage system is so bad it is not uncommon to see flooding on major streets where multi-national corporations, international agencies and government ministries are headquartered.\n“Ninety per cent of Jakarta is paved in concrete and asphalt, so the ground has\xa0little capacity to absorb water. Most buildings are not equipped with vertical drainage. Every time it rains, water is running off the buildings, overwhelming our already overwhelmed drainage system,” Mr Joga said.\nThere are plans to mandate buildings in Jakarta to have 30 per cent of their\xa0area converted into open green spaces and for the buildings to have zero water runoff\xa0during the rainy season.\n“But enforcement has been weak,” he said.\nNARROWING RIVERS AND\xa0DRAINAGE BASINS\nThere are 13 rivers flowing into Jakarta, from meandering waterways which have existed for centuries to man-made canals meant to divert water away from the Indonesian capital. All\xa0are considered flood-prone.\nBy law, no one is supposed to build houses within 50m from the water’s edge. But due to lack of enforcement, illegal dwellings are\xa0sprawled along the riverbanks.\n“The rivers have narrowed. In the 1970s, they were 50m wide. But now they can be as narrow as 15 to 20m,” Mr Joga said.\nToday, Jakarta’s 13 rivers are capable of containing 950 cubic metres\xa0of water per second. However, during the rainy season, the flow of water running through these rivers can surge to 2,500 cubic metres every second.\nSometimes, the flood got so bad entire neighbourhoods were\xa0submerged in murky brown water 3m deep. It is hard to distinguish where the river ends and land begins, except for the rows upon rows of rooftops jutting out of the water.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\nAnd it is not just rivers that are\xa0narrowing. Along the rivers, there are 208 man-made retention basins, built to contain water runoff and prevent flooding. Many of these flood basins have been completely occupied by illegal settlements and sometimes large property developers.\nIn one retention basin, the capacity has drastically reduced from 8 million cubic metres to just 1\xa0million cubic metres in 40 years because of illegal squatters. The occupiers often treat the basin as their waste dumping ground. Their presence also prevented heavy machinery\xa0from dredging decades of sedimentation.\nThe government is trying to reclaim these retention basins and clear up land needed to widen the rivers, but these efforts are often met with resistance, legal challenges and street protests.\n“We have spent a lot of time in courts, time which could have been spent building infrastructure\xa0or doing something else,” Mr Bambang Heri Mulyono of the Indonesian Ministry for Public Works told CNA.\xa0\nMr Mulyono, who is in charge of infrastructure work along the 119km Ciliwung River, said there are stretches totalling 17km in length which are not protected by dikes and retention walls.\n“When the flood comes, water will inundate these areas and from there, water will spread everywhere,” he said.\nThe plan is to widen the river by 7.5m\xa0on either side\xa0and relocate people who have been occupying the riverbank illegally for generations elsewhere. Some neighbourhoods have been cooperative but others have not. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“This is the main reason why the flood mitigation programme has been slow. We have to deal with these\xa0problems,” he said.\n\n\nSINKING COASTAL AREAS\nBy the time the rivers reach coastal areas in the north, the water flow is low and\xa0unable to discharge into the sea.\nInstead, trash-filled\xa0and\xa0foul-smelling water has\xa0to go through\xa0large pumping stations at\xa0the mouths of the rivers, which can lie between 1m and 4m below sea level.\n“The rivers are already lower than sea level because of land subsidence. That’s why water from these rivers have to be pumped out. During a flood, water can accumulate very quickly and the pumps need a much longer period of time to get the water out,” Mr Peter Letrite of the Dutch water management consultancy Deltares told CNA.\nJakarta, which lies on\xa0loose and unconsolidated soil and sediment, is one of the fastest sinking megacities in the world with land subsiding at a rate of up to 26cm per year in the softer, sandy soils of the north and 1cm per year in the firmer soils of the south.\nLand subsidence can occur naturally through tectonic quakes or following\xa0man-made activities such as construction and\xa0groundwater extraction.\xa0\n“We don’t have reliable freshwater supply. Today, our piped water system serves less than 47 per cent of Jakartans. Meanwhile, the need for freshwater increases as we build office buildings, malls, hotels and apartments. As a result, they (residents)\xa0performed excessive groundwater extraction which prompted land to subside,”\xa0 Mr Ali, the water management expert, explained.\nAccording to findings from the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), 90 per cent of Jakarta’s coastal areas now sits below the surface of the sea.\nThese communities are protected from becoming fully submerged by elevated concrete dikes and breakwaters in upscale seafront housing complexes and apartments.\xa0\nBut water sometimes breaches these defences, turning industrial estates and fishing neighbourhoods into uninhabitable swamps.\nAs land subsidence continues, these walls and embankments are also sinking and have\xa0to be raised by 20cm to 30 cm each year.\nOccasionally, strong winds and high waves would hit Jakarta’s 46km coastline and the sea would surge so much the walls are unable to contain it. Breeches and overtopping occur and seawater would flood communities up to 3km inland.\nAnd when these storm surges happen at the same time as the fluvial floods, the result can be catastrophic.\n\n\nIn February 2007, Jakarta was besieged by coastal flooding from the north and river flooding from the south, causing 60 per cent of the city to be inundated. In some areas, water did not recede for ten days. Seventy thousand homes were flooded and 80 people were killed that year. \xa0\nMr Heri Andreas, a Bandung Institute of Technology expert on geodesy, which studies how the earth’s geometric shape changes over time, told CNA that the 2007 flood would not have been as severe had there been no land subsidence.\nIn early 2020, the scientist created a computer simulation on what would happen to Jakarta if land subsidence had been stopped completely in the last 40\xa0years. In that scenario, floodwater\xa0would wash out to sea unimpeded.\xa0\xa0\n“Land subsidence has increased the number of flood-prone areas by 300 per cent. Had we stopped groundwater extraction in the 1980s, flood-prone areas would be a third (of what they are now), even as rainfall and our retention capacity remains the same,” Mr Andreas said.\nTo make matters worse, land subsidence also occurred in the interior parts of the city,\xa0as far away as 20km from the coastline. Although not as severe as the coastal areas, land subsidence has caused many areas to sit lower than the rivers, increasing the amount of flood prone areas across Jakarta.\nMr Andreas’s research has also shown that\xa040 per cent of Jakarta could be below sea level by 2050, including much of the city’s business districts.\xa0“We need to pay attention to these topographical dynamics. Right now, our flood mitigation policies and plans do not account for land subsidence,” he said.\nGIANT SEAWALL CONTROVERSY \nTo combat the floods and mitigate the irreversible effect of Jakarta’s land subsidence problem, the government in 2013 proposed the building of a giant sea wall stretching more than 30km across the Jakarta bay area.\nIn the\xa0initial plan, the giant dike, which doubles as a toll road, would convert 148sqkm of sea into two freshwater lakes filled with man-made islands. From\xa0the air, it would resemble the mythical bird Garuda, Indonesia’s national symbol.\nIt promised to be a panacea to Jakarta’s problems of land subsidence, rising sea level, annual flood and freshwater shortage.\nBut scientists and activists believed that the plan was only good on paper and would most likely cause an ecological disaster.\n\n\nMr Muslim Muin, a hydrodynamics expert from Bandung Institute of Technology, said the rivers which flow through Jakarta are silky and brown, filled with trash, silt, sediment\xa0and toxic industrial wastes, making the plan to convert the sea into a freshwater reservoir infeasible.\n“We will not be able to use the water as our freshwater source because there is too much pollution. We will end up spending more money each year to treat the water, dredge the sediment\xa0and pump excess water out to sea during the rainy season,” Mr Muin told CNA.\nDuring the dry season, when there is not enough water flowing from the rivers, the whole area will not function as a reservoir, but a trash-clogged evaporation pond, he predicted.\xa0\nJakarta’s rivers are so polluted that today, 80 per cent of the city’s piped water is\xa0sourced from a reservoir 48km east.\nThe giant seawall, known formally as the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD) project, also has a lofty price tag of US$40 billion, nearly seven times the city’s annual budget as a whole.\nTo help finance the dike, the government turned to property developers who\xa0were promised permits to build artificial islands.\n“It was assumed that the NCICD plan would have to be paid by Jakarta, not by the national coffers. Because the Indonesian government said they have (to deal with) so many issues in other cities. The only way to finance this is through land development,” said Mr Letrite. Deltares, his consultancy,\xa0was tasked with studying the plan.\n“The price tag became big because all sorts of things were put into the NCICD project like the improvement of water treatment, improvement of water supply. With new land,\xa0you need more roads, more infrastructure and so on.”\nThe islands would be occupied by upscale waterfront properties where the rich can dock their yachts.\n“This meant that only the rich would have access to the sea and not the tens of thousands of fishermen whose livelihoods depend on it,” said Mr Abdul Halim of the People’s Coalition for Fisheries Justice.\nThe giant seawall, and the freshwater it would have created, would also spell the end of\xa0Jakarta’s last remaining mangrove forests in the north-western part of the city. The mangroves, which need brackish water to survive, are home to a wide variety of wildlife.\nThe Jakarta government issued a permit to two property developers and state-owned port company, Pelindo in 2016 to build four artificial islands, even as the seawall project was hamstrung by controversies and eventually put on the backburner.\n\n\nBuilding the artificial islands creates another ecological problem, Mr Muin said. “They will obstruct the flow of the rivers. Water will slow down and form sedimentation and if the sediment is\xa0not dredged regularly, it will worsen the floods further upstream,” he said.\nCity planning expert Mr Joga said the giant wall does not address the underlying problems.\n“We still need to address the environmental degradation in the upstream areas, widen the rivers, increase the capacity of our retention basins and ponds, fix Jakarta’s drainage system and add more open green spaces where rainwater is absorbed,” he said.\n“Those steps will already reduce the floods significantly.”\nWith much criticism\xa0towards the project, including from the current city governor\xa0Anies Baswedan, the central government has to go back\xa0to the drawing board.\n“The latest plan is to construct an open coastal dike which reduces the impact of the waves, but still leaves the ports open, mangroves will continue to grow, fishermen can still use these fishing grounds and it will not have such drastic social and environmental impact (as before),” Mr Letrite said. “That is now the concept. It will be a much cheaper solution.”\nBut even the new plan, which is still being finalised, does not please all stakeholders.\xa0""Not all (political) parties agree on the design. Not all parties agree on how it should be financed. That is complicating the decision making,” he said.\nPUBLIC WORKS MINISTRY HAS MORE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS\xa0IN THE PIPELINE\nWith\xa0the giant wall project seemingly on the back burner,\xa0the government is working on various infrastructure projects which officials say will alleviate the flooding situation.\nThe public works ministry is currently constructing two dry dams in the upstream areas of Ciliwung River, said Mr Mulyono.\nDuring the wet season, the Ciliwung can send 365 cubic metres of water every second to the lowlands and the dams will reduce this to 253 cubic metres every second.\nThe two dams: the Ciawi and Sukamahi dry dams, will have a combined capacity of 7.6 million cubic metres which means it can cut down water influx in the flood-prone river for up to 19 hours.\n“We can keep cutting down the water flow until the water level recedes and return to normal. Once water level recedes, we can release the water back to the river,” Mr Mulyono said.\nThe ministry hopes the two dams will be ready before the next rainy season begins in late 2021.\nBy the time the Ciliwung enters Jakarta, the river will have had more water coming in from the hundreds of tributaries along its course and the flow of water will have risen to 570 cubic metres per second.\nThe government is planning to build dikes along stretches of the Ciliwung totalling 17km in length. These stretches are now unprotected and illegally occupied by settlers.\nThere is also a plan to build an underground pipe to channel some of the Ciliwung’s excess water to the 23km long East Flood Canal, which is currently used to divert water from the Cipinang, Sunter and Buaran rivers to the sea \xa0\xa0\xa0\n“The length of this tunnel is 1.2km. We have built 600m from the outlet and we need 600m more. But the planned inlet is still occupied by settlers, so we cannot do our work,” he said.\nFor the other 12 rivers, the ministry is focusing on restoring the capacity of 208 retention basins and ponds along their courses. Again, there are issues with land availability and the presence of illegal settlements.\nThe government has been trying to relocate settlers along the Ciliwung River since 2013.\xa0\nIt also took the government years to secure the land needed for the Ciawi and Sukamahi dry dams before construction finally started in 2016. \xa0\nRelocating settlers is a painstaking\xa0process involving rounds of negotiations. It is also politically sensitive, so unpopular in fact that it became a sticking point during\xa0the 2017 Jakarta election which saw the defeat of the incumbent Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a proponent of the relocation programme.\nDuring the election, Mr Baswedan had promised voters he would not pursue\xa0the same policy as his predecessor.\n“Relocation will only cause miseries for the people. Therefore, I am committed not to perform any relocation,” Mr Baswedan told his supporters in March 2017, during a campaign rally in North Jakarta.\xa0\nThe governor reiterated his commitment after he was sworn in during a visit to West Jakarta in\xa0November that year. “I don’t like to relocate people. We will organise (the\xa0neighbourhoods) instead. These are people, not objects,” he told residents.\n""WE HAVE DONE A LOT"", SAYS JAKARTA\'S WATER RESOURCE AGENCY\nMs Baswedan has been working with a shrinking budget for flood mitigation.\nBefore he\xa0was sworn in, Jakarta’s budget for flood mitigation was US$221 million, which included numerous land purchase\xa0and relocation projects. In 2020, the budget fell to US$105 million and land clearing was halted.\n“This is why Jakarta’s flood mitigation programme seems to be going nowhere,” water management expert Mr Ali said. “Whoever the governor is, people need to be relocated so the rivers can be widened, whether he likes it or not.”\nThere are signs that Mr Baswedan might have changed his mind about the relocation issue.\xa0Chief of Jakarta’s Water Resource Agency\xa0Juani Yusuf told CNA that the city has earmarked\xa0US$355 million for this year\'s flood mitigation programme, the majority of which will be used to purchase land\xa0and relocate settlers occupying rivers and retention basins.\nThe pivot came months after a massive flood in January 2020. It was the worst flood to occur during Mr Baswedan’s administration and one which caused several people to sue the city.\nMr Yusuf pointed out that the governor has never said that there will be no relocation during his administration.\xa0\n""We are avoiding relocation whenever we can but he never promised that there would be zero relocation. As long as it is for the good of many, we do (it),"" he said.\xa0\xa0\nMr Yusuf said his agency has been focusing on deepening rivers and basins as well as building vertical drainage that\xa0do not require land acquisition and relocation.\n“We have done a lot actually. So, it is not true that Jakarta’s flood mitigation efforts have stagnated,” he said.\n""This year, the governor has instructed us to increase the capacity of five rivers.\xa0We aim to work with the ministry and finish the widening of the Ciliwung River,"" he said, adding that his office will focus on lands where residents have agreed to be relocated.\n""There are lands which we have negotiated but their acquisitions stalled because of budgeting issues, including the lands needed to make the underground tunnel connecting Ciliwung and Cipinang rivers. We will prioritise those lands first.”\nDespite these efforts, experts\xa0are far from convinced.\xa0\nMr Joga\xa0said Jakarta has the potential to be on par with other great cities of the world. “But Jakarta cannot maximise its potential because of bad management. (Jakarta) has the potential. It has money. And yet here we are, dealing with flood issues year after year,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Jakarta ', '     Indonesia ', '     flood ', '     environment ', '     climate change ', '     In Focus ', '     sustainability ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: What happens when you leave behind your trays,\xa0utensils and food debris\xa0at hawker centres instead of returning them to the designated points?\nMost people think of the mess left behind and the inconvenience to other diners, but leaving trays and dirty plates out could also breed germs and expose others to potentially fatal diseases, public health experts warned.\nA recent episode of Talking Point highlighted the perennial problem of unreturned trays in hawker centres.\nComments under CNA’s Facebook post were mixed - while some suggested it was the cleaners’ jobs to clear the trays, the top two comments called on Singaporeans to return their trays, put their food debris back on the plates and dispose of their used tissues.\nLeaving trays and used utensils out and allowing the next person - whether a cleaner or another diner - to touch them could cause the transmission of\xa0diseases including salmonella, animal-borne viruses and even COVID-19, said public health researcher Matthew Chua.\xa0\nThese diseases could be “potentially fatal” if left untreated or not treated in time, said Dr Chua. Hospitalisation could result in severe cases.\nPublic Hygiene Council chairman Edward D’Silva said: “When diners leave their trays, used utensils and tissues behind on the table, it exposes saliva droplets and germs to the next user and our cleaners. Bacteria from unfinished food by the previous diner have the potential to spread freely.”\nSingapore’s warm climate, in addition to the “dirty and wet areas” at coffee shops could also accelerate the breeding of harmful microbes, he added.\nTRAYS LEFT OUT TOO LONG WILL ATTRACT UNWANTED PESTS\nAt Chinatown Complex Food Centre, it takes about 20 staff members to clean the tables and return trays, said Mr Cornelius Tan, vice-secretary of the Chinatown Complex Hawkers Merchant Association.\nLunch hours are the\xa0busiest, he added.\n“There is a tendency (for unreturned trays and used utensils) to attract unwanted pests and birds if left unattended for a long duration,” said Mr Tan, adding that the association has installed nets on the second level of the food centre to keep birds out.\xa0\nPest droppings are also an “ominous vector” for virus and disease transmission, said Mr D’Silva of the Public Hygiene Council.\n“When we clear our own food trays and return them to the tray return point, we limit the opportunity for pests to congregate near the eating areas and reduce the risk of us contracting these diseases.”\nWhile the Chinatown Complex Hawkers Merchant Association has pasted sticker labels on tables to advise diners to return their trays, dirty plates and trays littered with food and used tissues were still sitting on tables waiting to be cleared when CNA visited at lunchtime on Friday (Feb 5).\nRather than clearing the dirty plates, many diners were seen pushing them to the edge of the table before sitting down with their food.\xa0\nCLEANERS ""ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE""\nWhile not all diners had trays for their food, as CNA observed, those who\xa0sat at tables just a few steps away from the tray return point did not return their trays and bowls.\xa0\nThe task of clearing plates and trays left\xa0on the tables fell on\xa0a\xa0few cleaners\xa0who moved around the food centre.\nCNA observed a similar situation at\xa0Clementi Market and Food Centre on Thursday at dinner time.\xa0\nSome diners were seen\xa0holding their food and walking\xa0past empty tables that were not cleared, opting to look for ones that have already been cleaned.\xa0\nThere were even some who\xa0sat at tables with dirty plates and trays, and waited for the cleaners to clear the table before leaving to buy their food.\xa0\nCleaners are “especially vulnerable” to the germs that come with uncleared tables, said Mr D’Silva.\n“All it takes is one cleaner to come into contact with unknown pathogens on a dirty plate, for them to catch an unwanted disease – especially so in a pandemic climate.”\nSingapore’s army of 59,000 cleaners tend to be the elderly. Many of them will retire in the next 10 to 20 years, with hardly any younger workers to take over from them, he said.\n“With the ongoing pandemic, we see more people wiping table tops with sanitary wipes before they order their food. But after finishing their meals, do people pick up after themselves so the next person will also have a clean table?” asked Mr D\'Silva.\n“We take pride in ensuring that our homes are kept clean, but why do we not spare a thought for the environment and our cleaners when we are out? Cleaning up is everybody’s responsibility and cannot be left to cleaners.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     environment ']}"

      Conserving water needs to become a 'daily way of life' in Singapore: PM Lee
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Conserving water should be a “daily way of life” for people in Singapore with climate change making reliable water supply harder to come by, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday (Feb 4).\nSpeaking at the\xa0official opening of the Keppel East Marina Desalination Plant, Mr Lee said that water was not an “inexhaustible gift of nature”.\n“It is a strategic and scarce resource, and also a precious fruit of our labours, always to be husbanded and used wisely,” he explained.\n“We are always pushing the limits of our water resources. Producing each additional drop of water gets harder and harder ... We require more infrastructure, new technologies, more extensive treatment, all of which inevitably means a higher incremental cost.”\nThis comes in the face of climate change, which was making weather conditions more “volatile” around the world, said Mr Lee.\n“It will become harder\xa0for us to ensure a stable and reliable water supply,” he added.\nMr Lee said that while this January was the second wettest January on record, it was just as easy to imagine more frequent and longer periods of drought.\xa0\n“This happened to us just a few years ago, in 2016. Linggiu Reservoir went down to 20 per cent of its capacity. I was really worried, and tracking the situation daily, because there was a real risk to our water supply,” he said.\xa0\n“It was a vivid reminder of why we have to be obsessed with saving water, and make every drop count.”\nAnd while the Government will continue to plan ahead, and build up infrastructure ahead of time, people in Singapore need to get involved, added Mr Lee.\xa0\n“Singaporeans also need to play our part, to use water only when we truly need to, and to make conserving water our daily way of life,” he said.\nIMPORTANCE OF DESALINATION\nIn his speech, Mr Lee noted that Singapore has come a long way since Singapore’s first desalination plant, the SingSpring Desalination Plant, opened 15 years ago.\xa0\nDesalination remains key to a sustainable water supply, he added.\n“We have expanded our desalination capacity because our water demand continues to grow,” he said.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0\n“Currently Singapore consumes 430 million gallons per day.\xa0 In the next 30 years, we expect water demand to almost double.”\nWith local catchments and water imported from Malaysia being insufficient to meet Singapore’s daily needs, it has supplemented its supply with NEWater and desalination, noted Mr Lee.\xa0\n“Both of these were the fruit of many years of planning, research and innovation by PUB engineers,” he added.\nAnd with each new plant, Singapore has improved its technologies and capabilities to produce desalinated water more efficiently, noted Mr Lee.\xa0\n“Water treatment technology will keep on improving. We will surely never stop building newer waterworks and facilities, each one different and slightly better than the previous ones,” he added.\xa0\nMr Lee noted the new plant was part of Singapore’s long-term planning. It is Singapore’s first desalination plant capable of treating both seawater and rainwater.\xa0\n“In dry weather, the plant will treat seawater, like our other desalination plants but during rainy weather ... like\xa0last month, the plant will draw fresh water from Marina Reservoir,” added Mr Lee.\n“This will consume less energy than treating seawater. Having this option to switch to treating reservoir water will save costs and give us more operational flexibility.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     climate change ', '     water ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Public consultation on Dover Forest to be extended
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Residents will have another month to share their thoughts on the future of Dover Forest as the public consultation period, which ended last month, will be extended for four weeks, said\xa0National Development Minister Desmond Lee on Monday (Feb 1).\xa0\xa0\nDover Forest is part of the Ulu Pandan estate that has been zoned for residential development. The Housing and Development Board\xa0(HDB) plans to offer\xa017,000\xa0Build-to-Order (BTO)\xa0flats\xa0this year in several estates, including Ulu Pandan.\xa0\xa0\nThe area was also the subject of an\xa0environmental baseline study conducted by HDB, which found that\xa0Dover Forest is home to at least 158 species of animals - including critically endangered ones - and 120 plant species.\nResponding to questions raised by Members of Parliament from both sides of the House, Mr Lee said the land - now overgrown with non-native trees since rubber plantations and fruit orchards in the area were abandoned - had been zoned “Residential (Subject to Detailed Planning)"" since the 2003 master plan.\xa0\n""HDB engaged an external consultant to conduct an environmental baseline study (EBS) for Ulu Pandan, to guide HDB’s development plans and identify the native flora and fauna and their habitats,"" he said.\xa0\n""HDB then consulted nature groups to refine their plans for Ulu Pandan, incorporating the findings from the EBS,"" he added, noting that the report was then published online for public feedback.\xa0\nThe Housing Board continues to receive feedback and suggestions from residents living in the area as well as members of the public, Mr Lee said.\nThe ""wide range of views"" include those suggesting that\xa0the site be retained fully for greenery and recreation\xa0and designated as a nature park, while others suggested that other sites in the area - such as older housing blocks\xa0or existing school fields and running tracks - be redeveloped instead.\xa0\n""Several have suggested that new housing and nature should co-exist on the site. For example,\xa0develop\xa0parts that are less vegetated or with more non-native species,"" said Mr Lee.\xa0\n""Many who have written in appreciate the tension between the need for development\xa0and nature conservation,"" he said.\xa0\n""We are studying the feedback in detail and welcome more Singaporeans to give their views and inputs ... as we consider our plans for the Ulu Pandan site,"" he said.\xa0\n""We will carefully consider all the feedback received, and share our plans when ready.""\nMr Lee noted that Singapore had adopted a number of different development options, such as building\xa0higher and more densely as well as co-locating multiple facilities.\xa0\nBrownfield sites\xa0such as golf courses, old school sites and industrial areas are also being redeveloped as their\xa0leases expire, he said, noting that by 2030, about 400ha of golf course land would be claimed for redevelopment.\xa0\nMeanwhile, some ecologically important sites have been retained as green spaces despite being initially being earmarked for other purposes.\xa0\nThese include the\xa0Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat, which was initially designated for industrial\xa0use but was a later retained as\xa0a nature park after\xa0biodiversity surveys and ecological modelling were conducted.\xa0\nThe authorities are committed to ""stewarding and protecting our green spaces"", said Mr Lee, pointing out\xa0that\xa07,800ha of Singapore\'s\xa0land has been safeguarded as nature reserves, nature areas and nature parks, as well as\xa0green spaces such as parks and park connectors.\nHowever, some greenfield sites would have to be developed, given Singapore\'s physical constraints and scarce land area, he said.\nAny decision to proceed is made only after a detailed study of the trade-offs and alternatives, said Mr Lee, adding that the authorities would ""proceed with care"" where development is unavoidable.\nMr Lee said the Government is encouraged by the keen interest in plans for Singapore and nature conservation, noting that ""mainstreaming of nature consciousness"" among people was\xa0a key part of the country\'s\xa0strategy to become a ""City in Nature"".\nHe added that the Urban Redevelopment Authority\xa0would\xa0engage people later this year to\xa0gather ideas as part of efforts to formulate long-term plans for a liveable and sustainable future. \xa0\n""We invite everyone to join these conversations,"" he said, adding the Government will continue to regularly review its plans as ""consensus on the balance between environmental conservation and development evolves"".\nLOOP OF NATURE AROUND ULU PANDAN\nIn an adjournment motion, MP Christopher de Souza (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) described Dover Forest as a “shared and extended green landscape that the residents have for a long time admired and grown used to”.\xa0\nMr de Souza,\xa0who serves the Ulu Pandan ward where the forest is found,\xa0pointed to a now vacant plot of land next to Ulu Pandan Community Club on Ghim Moh Road as an alternative site.\xa0\nHe said the land,\xa0which previously housed now demolished HDB blocks,\xa0could be used for both Build-To-Order (BTO) as well as replacement flats for residents of older blocks, whose homes may go through the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).\xa0\nMr de Souza also suggested two other under-utilised plots of land - an unused field at\xa0the Ministry of Education Language Centre\xa0premises, which was the old and now defunct Ghim Moh Primary School, as well as\xa0the former Raffles Junior College campus on Mount Sinai Road.\xa0\nRetaining Dover Forest would preserve a “loop of nature” around the constituency, he said, pointing to nearby green areas such as the Ulu Pandan park connector and\xa0Clementi Forest.\xa0\nHis suggestions tie in with his “longer-term aspiration to both develop and rejuvenate Ulu Pandan while preserving greenery”, he said.\nThe ecosystem of the Dover Forest has been adopted to become part of the wider shared landscape for Ulu Pandan residents, noted Mr de Souza.\xa0\n“What I am trying to get across today to the planners is the need to think long and hard before making irreversible decisions,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     environment ']}"

      What would make Singaporeans return their trays? How about a siren?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Chen I-Ming may have found a way to motivate diners in hawker centres to return their trays after their meals.\nIt is a device that incorporates sensors under each table — to detect the diner’s arrival — as well as lights on the table top and a voice prompt. It is activated as the diner is leaving.\n“When people finish the meal, this reminder will immediately alert them that they need to return the trays,” said the chief executive officer and co-founder of Transforma Robotics.\n“Most people treat your public announcement as a background noise, (but) this will immediately catch (their) attention.”\nWhen it was tested at Maxwell Food Centre, about 66 per cent of diners returned their trays, compared with five per cent at tables without the device.\nBehavioural expert Loo Deliang, who observed the experiment, thinks the result hinged on the trigger being close by and addressing the diner “personally”, thereby making it unlikely to be missed.\nSo might this be the way to promote tray return, when national campaigns, posters and even tray-return ambassadors have had little success in educating diners? The programme Talking Point explores this and other solutions to a long-standing problem.\nCLUTTERED FOOD PARADISE\nUsed crockery and trays left behind on tables in hawker centres have become a familiar sight in Singapore.\n“We have (tried) advertisements, banners … and the cleaners would advise the customers to return the tray after they’ve finished eating,” said Tang Seng Chiew, the head of the hawker association at Berseh Food Centre in Jalan Besar.\n“Out of 10 customers, there are only two or three who’d return (their trays).”\nThe situation at lunchtime “is even worse”.\nJust last week, the findings of a National Environment Agency (NEA) survey showed that about nine in 10 Singapore residents felt that patrons should be required to clear their tables at public dining places.\nClose to half of the 1,402 respondents, however, felt that clearing one’s own table after eating would deprive cleaners of their jobs.\nSome diners think it is not their responsibility at all.\nWATCH: What’s it like to be a hawker centre cleaner? (3:45)\n“If we meet the not-so-good customers, when we ask them to return the tray, they’d be very rude and scold us,” Chia Siew Kien, who has been cleaning up after diners for six years, told Talking Point.\n“They’d say, ‘Why do we hire you cleaners then? (If) we help you do the job already, then what do you have to do?’”\nThe 45-year-old counters that there is more to the job than that. “After (diners) return the crockery, we still need to help them clear the table and also wipe away the dirty stuff,” she said.\n“(Diners returning their trays) would lessen our burden and let other customers have more tables to sit at.”\nStallholders also need the trays and crockery to be cleaned quickly, or else they would be unable to serve subsequent groups of diners. Moreover, unclean trays and food scraps may put cleaners and other diners at risk.\n“Food trays can carry bacteria like E. coli (and) salmonella from the previous host, and this can be transmitted to the next person touching it without protection,” said public health researcher Matthew Chua.\n“Secondly, we don’t know whether birds or animals have come in and feasted on the leftovers and therefore transmitted … animal-borne viruses and bacteria onto the utensils and the tray.”\n‘TOWER OF SHAME’\nTo help make a change, visual artist Audrey Ng created a tower from 300 food trays — the number of trays, on average, not returned within a one-hour period in five hawker centres as recorded by Talking Point.\nThe art installation at Our Tampines Hub shocked many of those who realised the scale of the problem. “I’m calling it our tower of shame,” said programme host Diana Ser.\nBut will it persuade the public to return their trays? “That’ll be difficult because you have to start from young,” said a passer-by.\nStallholder Bobby Chu agreed that Singaporeans are too entrenched in the view that it is the cleaners’ job to clear the trays. “You need two generations to pass,” he said. “Only then can you make a difference.”\nHe said this following a Talking Point experiment in Berseh Food Centre — to push diners to return their trays, the cleaners were supposed to only sanitise the tables and clear the tray-return stations.\nBanners and notices served to inform the lunchtime crowd that the cleaners would not be clearing trays from the tables.\nCleaning supervisor Tan Chin Heng said 40 per cent of the diners returned their trays, compared with 10 per cent normally. But that improvement came at a cost: Seeing the cluttered tables, many diners went elsewhere to eat.\nThe experiment had to be paused seven times in three hours because of the amount of crockery and trays left at the tables.\n“I have customers, but there’s no place to sit. Then how do I do business?” complained Chu. “You’re asking elderly people to return their own trays — it’s not possible.\n“None of the young people will do it (either) … They’d stare wide-eyed at you.”\nWATCH: The full episode — Why won't you return your food tray? (22:53)\nWhen cleaners tried to persuade diners to return their trays, they met with scoldings and even vulgarities.\nQuality assurance officer James Tan from Chang Seng Services said this kind of abuse can lead his cleaners to resign or refuse to work, thereby worsening the problem.\nTARGETING DINERS’ WALLETS\nThere is one solution, however, that has had success. In 2016, private operator Timbre Group introduced a system whereby diners pay a S$1 deposit for a tray and get the money back after they return the tray.\nThe automated system also incorporates a centralised dishwashing system, which makes retrieval of the crockery and trays faster and more efficient for stallholders.\nAccording to Timbre, the tray-return rate at its hawker centre in one-north is close to 98 per cent.\nBut when automated tray-return systems were introduced to other hawker centres, there were detractors upset about having to pay a deposit.\nSome diners refuse a tray, and some make nasty remarks to hawkers, who feel that the system is affecting their business.\nDespite Timbre’s success, only 10 hawker centres in Singapore have an automated tray-return system. Still, the NEA has said it will roll out this system to up to 25 hawker centres in phases.\nAnd cleaning contractor Ong Siong Jiunn, who helped to implement it at the Block 163 Bukit Merah Central Food Centre, thinks it is for the better.\n“Before this system started over here … the cleaners that I had (were) carrying very heavy tubs of crockery,” said the business owner.\n“After this system started, their only job now is to wipe the tables (and) urge the customers to return their own trays or crockery. So it makes life much easier for elderly cleaners.”\nIs it a better, however, to solve the tray-return problem by targeting diners’ wallets or by changing their behaviour, with or without siren-like devices?\nUltimately, it should be “something less intrusive”, said Loo, associate director (Analytics and Behaviour Change) at the National University of Singapore's Office of Estate Development.\n“People associate sirens with … warnings,” he noted. “That isn’t something we want to promote in hawker centres relating to tray return.”\nBut there should still be “good triggers” as well as “clear and available” tray stations, he said. “With all these in place, and with the cleaners’ role redefined to encourage people to return trays, I think it’ll work then.”\nWatch the first of these two Talking Point episodes here.

      Forests are needed to absorb carbon, but the overheating planet might soon flip a critical switch
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: New research shows that the fast warming of the planet could cause trees and plants to release more carbon than they absorb, a critical function reversal that would further accelerate climate change.\nBy as early as 2040, given the current projections of global temperature rise, land systems will only be able to take in half the amount of carbon compared to what they do today, according to the research, published in Science Advances this month.\nThe research analysed data from about 1,500 sites around the world to try and understand how temperature intersected with the absorption of carbon. What it uncovered was a “powerful tipping point”.\nAs temperatures continue to rise, the ability of trees and plants to perform photosynthesis - a function that utilises carbon dioxide in the air - is compromised. At the same time, in a warmer environment, the respiration of plants also increases due to heat stress, adding more carbon to the atmosphere.\nIf climate change continues unabated, no longer will the world’s rainforests, soil and grasslands be performing their important role as carbon sinks. Instead of slowing down climate change, they will be accelerating it.\n“As a metaphor, you can think of the human body experiencing either hypothermia or heat stroke, it's the same for all living things: our function begins to shut down when we move outside of specific temperature ranges,” said co-author Katharyn Duffy, an earth-systems scientist at Northern Arizona University.\xa0\nLand sinks currently\xa0help by absorbing about 30 per cent of anthropogenic emissions. For the globe’s forests alone, the amount of carbon being absorbed is significant - about 7.6 gigatonnes every year, according to another study\xa0published in Nature this month. That is the equivalent of China’s entire coal industry, or all of the world’s annual carbon emissions from gas.\xa0\nRight now, only about 10 per cent of the biosphere experiences temperatures so hot that photosynthesis is degraded, according to the research published in Science Advances. But by 2100, about half of the biosphere could experience these conditions, including in parts of Southeast Asia.\nBased on the examination of data from the largest continuous carbon monitoring network, FLUXNET, the researchers found that photosynthesis rates degraded significantly above 28 degrees Celsius in tropical forests. In temperate areas, it dropped at above 18 degrees Celsius.\n“We realised how very close we currently are to the temperature maximum for global photosynthesis. Essentially we did not go looking for a tipping point, it emerged from the data,” Duffy said.\nScientists not involved in the research but observing the carbon tipping point phenomenon say it is clear that plants and trees are not able to adapt to the rising temperatures.\xa0\n“I’m not surprised that, as the world is quickly warming up at an unprecedented rate, all physiological processes of plants and soil microbes are responding in ways that these organisms have not seen in their evolutionary history,” said Associate Professor Amos Tai from the Earth System Science Programme at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.\xa0\n“I believe ultimately human activities are modifying climate at such an unprecedented pace that no organisms or any ecosystem as a whole can cope.”\n\n\nREGIONAL\xa0IMPACTS\nAncient rainforests across the island of Borneo\xa0were identified as areas that will be among the first to hit a heat threshold where the maximum temperature for photosynthesis will be exceeded for more than half of the year.\xa0\nAlready, these vast carbon-rich landscapes have grown smaller and are less able to perform their natural ecosystem functions, due to human activities. An island that once had about 75 per cent forest cover a century ago, has seen half of it disappear.\n“Deforestation or removal of rainforests has certainly reduced the landscape capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide,” said Professor Daniel Murdiyarso, principal scientist at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), based in Bogor, Indonesia.\n“Combined with the effect of climate change, it has caused the ecosystem to be more vulnerable to extensive droughts and wildfires. Rainforests are very fragile. Large-scale disturbance like deforestation or fires will not give them the chance to renew themselves” he said.\nAcross the globe in 2020, devastating wildfires raged across Australia, the Amazon, Siberia and the United States. On an annual basis, Indonesia also experiences heavily carbon-polluting peatland fires; last year was no exception as more than 1 million hectares burnt.\n“Those wildfires have not only weakened forest carbon uptake, but also returned much of the stored carbon in the forests to the atmosphere in a short amount of time, essentially annihilating much of their precious carbon uptake,” Tai said, referring to the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon\xa0dioxide.\n\n\nFrom a base in Malaysia’s Sabah state, scientists at the South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP) have been observing forest changes in real time. Land clearing and the major expansion of palm oil plantations have had major impacts on raising local temperatures and influencing weather patterns.\n“When you reduce forest cover through logging or shifts to agriculture, you reduce the capacity to sequester carbon. This also creates negative feedback with climate change, as reductions in forest cover in tropical forests are linked to reduced rainfall and increased temperatures,” said Dr Michael O’Brien, SEARRP’s Assistant Director of Science Coordination.\n“We are seeing more days with no rain, more frequent long periods with no rain and more extreme rainfall events.\n“In addition, severe drought years that are associated with El Niño Southern Oscillations are becoming more common. These years can cause increased tree mortality in many tropical forests,” he said.\nThe study’s findings also likely apply to all plants, meaning that there are potential implications for food production in many parts of the world. It found no evidence of plants adapting to their harsh new conditions.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

Sustainability actually is ... so integrated. It is not just the work of one single ministry or one single agency. It involves so many aspects of our lives that actually we need all parties to come together,"" she said.\nGiving the example of how Singapore plans to make its public transportation more carbon efficient, Ms Fu noted how there are plans to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 by turning to electric vehicles.\xa0\nThis would mean supplying charging points for vehicles across Singapore, and this would\xa0require collaboration and agreement between all agencies and with the community, said Ms Fu.\n""Therein lies also an opportunity ... opportunities for businesses to come in. Because the rules will change as technology disrupts the ways that we do things,"" she said.\n""There are many of such examples that will be very exciting for us as a city, as a country, over the next few years to look at integrating our policies, making sure that as we move collectively towards carbon neutrality, we are integrated, we are moving along with everyone - the community, the financiers, as well as all agencies of the Government.""\nAs such, Singapore would like to start by looking at the total carbon emissions, analyse which are the biggest emitters in the various sectors, before setting targets for the sectors, added Ms Fu.\n""(This is) so that all the agencies that are involved have a clear understanding of where the projections (are), where the trajectory (is), and how to get there in time,"" she explained.\nMs Fu also noted that Singapore faces a number of challenges given the constraints it has in the field of renewable energy.\n""But because of our constraints, because of our challenges, we are forced by circumstances to always think out of the box. And I think many solutions out there in other countries, in other cities, are really good examples for us to consider,"" she said.\n""And if you think about the advantage of Singapore really because of our smallness, because (it is) a lot more integrated.

      Last mangrove ecosystem in Jakarta city under threat from land subsidence and climate change

About 5,000 trees in just one corner of the wetland, he said, were lost to the incoming waves.\nAcross the wetland, there are sections where massive mangrove trees sat lopsided, stacked on top of each other with huge chunks of their\xa0roots jutting out of the water.

He works at the\xa0Jakarta Parks and Forestry Agency as chief of the Pantai Indah Kapuk mangrove ecotourism and protected forest unit.\xa0\nMangrove trees were once abundant across the Indonesian capital’s 30km coastline but the need for large container ports, housing\xa0and fish farms had caused the mangroves to disappear.\nToday, the mangrove trees are confined to several areas, measuring a total of 320ha, in the north-western part of the sprawling megacity. These areas are under the protection of the Jakarta government, while\xa0there are also mangroves growing in private properties or out at sea in small uninhabited islands and islets. The\xa0latter\xa0come under the environment ministry's jurisdiction.\nThe mangrove trees in mainland Jakarta are marked for new destruction, this time from the imminent threat of climate change.\n\n\n“The waves are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more frequently,” Mr Djuhana told CNA of the dire consequences of a changing climate.\nThe waves also bring mountains of trash – mainly plastic bottles, bags and cups – and when they get caught up in the trees’ peg-like breathing roots, the mangroves would suffocate and die.\xa0\nClimate change is also to blame for more extreme rainfall causing nearby rivers to overflow during the rainy season.\nWhen that occurs, such as the massive fluvial flood which took place early last year, the brackish water in which mangroves thrive, loses its salinity. The floods are sometimes so bad, the trees could be submerged for weeks.\nThen there is the rising sea level, high level of pollution in the waters and the fact that some parts of Jakarta, including where the mangroves are located, are sinking at a rate of up to 26cm a year. \xa0\xa0\n“Anywhere else, the mangroves would be pushed further and further inland,” Mr Nyoman Suryadiputra, the director of the non-for-profit organisation Wetlands International-Indonesia told CNA. “In Jakarta, however, the mangroves had nowhere to go, because all around them, land has been converted into residential and commercial areas.”\nMANGROVES HAVE IMPORTANT ROLES\xa0\nMangrove forests that often line the shorelines across the tropics provide a wide array of environmental services.\nThey serve as spawning grounds and nurseries for fish and as habitat for a plethora of organisms. Mangroves also protect coastal areas from storm surges and hurricanes as well as erosions.\nIn Jakarta, mangrove forests act as sanctuaries for the long-tailed macaques and various local and migratory birds, some of which are endangered.\nMr Nyoto Santoso, a lecturer from the Bogor Institute of Agriculture who has been studying mangroves in Jakarta, said mangroves are also great carbon sequesters.\n“Mangroves are three to five times more effective in absorbing carbon emission than ordinary trees in the upland areas. That’s why we need to preserve the mangroves in Jakarta,” he told CNA.\n\n\nStudies from various institutions have shown that mangrove trees and the soil\xa0beneath them can store anywhere from 20 to 89 tonnes of carbon per hectare.\n“Losing mangrove, however small, has a very significant environmental impact. We will lose the ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere and all the carbon which had accumulated in trees and soils would escape back into the atmosphere,” Mr Santoso said.\n“Losing the mangroves means Jakarta will lose its last remaining sanctuary for biodiversity,” he said.\nLAND SUBSIDENCE A MAJOR THREAT\nMangroves used to dominate Jakarta’s coastal landscape with trees growing more than 3km from the coastline.\nToday, mangrove trees can only be found in some sections of Jakarta’s Pantai Indah Kapuk, Kamal Muara and Muara Angke areas – all within minutes' drive from each other – surrounded by busy streets, toll roads, upscale housing areas and tall apartments and office buildings.\nIn the mid-1990s, the Indonesian\xa0government decided to designate these patches of mangrove forests as protected forests and wildlife sanctuaries.\xa0\nThe government also decided to reforest eroding fish and shrimp farms.\nMr Santoso said in terms of quantity, there are more mangrove trees in Jakarta today than in 1997, when he first began studying the city’s mangrove ecosystem.\n“There have been many universities, organisations and businesses donating money and planting mangrove propagules. The mangrove population is increasing but ecologically speaking they are not healthy and getting sicker and sicker,” he said.\n\n\nMr Santoso said the rivers which supply freshwater into these ecosystems are polluted by domestic, commercial and industrial waste, with unsafe levels of mercury and lead found in the water and sediments.\nThe poor water quality makes the mangrove more susceptible to diseases and more sensitive towards environmental changes.\n“Climate change will cause sea levels to rise. It will cause many areas to be flooded and we could see changes in the type of mangrove species dominating the landscape,” he said.\xa0\nBut the damage caused by sea level rise is nothing compared to the threat posed by land subsidence, which is mainly caused by over-extraction of groundwater.\n“Because of land subsidence, the soil now sit 2.5m to 4m\xa0(below the water surface) in some locations,” Mr Arie Fajar Septa, the head of the conservation unit at the Jakarta Parks and Forestry Agency told CNA.\nThis causes some species of mangroves to drown and die and makes the process of replacing them with new plants extremely difficult.\n“It is hard to directly plant the mangroves into the soil because propagules can only survive in water between 0.5m and 1m deep,” he said.\nA CONSTANT BATTLE\xa0\nMr Djuhana, the caretaker of the mangrove forests,\xa0said his team is fighting a never-ending battle against sinking land and changing climate.\nWorkers have erected breakwaters to protect the mangroves from strong waves and built bamboo fences to stop trash from the sea and rivers from encroaching the delicate ecosystems.\nThey have also backfilled some sections where land is subsiding to stop mangrove propagules from drowning and give them a chance to grow into full-sized mangrove trees.\xa0\n“But sometimes the waves are so big that the entire forest would drown. Water would swell by another meter and thousands of trees are destroyed,” he said, adding that storm surges would also decimate mangrove propagules before they have a chance of developing.\nHowever, Mr Djuhana is not giving up. As soon as one section is destroyed, his team get to work to replant\xa0it with new mangroves.\n“It could take months to replant the mangroves before they take\xa0root, and they could be destroyed in a blink of an eye when the storm comes,” he said.\n“But we have to do it. This is the last place in Jakarta where wild animals roam free. The last place in Jakarta where people can explore the forests and enjoy some fresh air. The last place where children and their parents can learn about the mangrove ecosystem. We have to protect the mangrove trees.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Jakarta ', '     climate change ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      The Dover Forest debate: Can nature and development co-exist in urbanised Singapore?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The balance between Singapore\'s urban development and preservation of its natural environment is again catching the public\'s attention\xa0with question marks hanging over the fate of two forested areas.\nDover Forest, a 33ha site within Ulu Pandan that has been zoned for residential development, is the subject of a\xa02017 environmental baseline study conducted by the Housing and Development Board (HDB).\nUlu Pandan is one of several areas where HDB plans to offer 17,000\xa0Build-to-Order (BTO)\xa0flats in 2021.\nThe HDB environmental study found that Dover Forest is home to at least 158 species of animals - including critically endangered ones - and 120 plant species.\xa0The HDB has sought public feedback on the forested area on its website.\xa0\nThis comes after a video of Clementi Forest - an 85ha site just north of Dover Forest - went viral in October last year.\xa0The Urban Redevelopment Authority noted then that while Clementi Forest had\xa0been zoned as a residential area since 1998, there were ""no immediate plans"" for residential development at the site.\xa0\n""AMAZING BIODIVERSITY""\nHolland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Christopher de Souza said in a Facebook post on Monday (Jan 18) that he planned\xa0to deliver an adjournment motion on the preservation of Dover Forest in Parliament.\xa0\n""I support housing and redevelopment. But, I also cherish greenery and the serenity it offers people and wildlife,"" said Mr de Souza, who serves the Ulu Pandan ward where the forest is located.\xa0\nHe added that\xa0in his speech,\xa0he would raise the possibility of alternative vacant sites, as well as the promotion and preservation of ""green, natural and sustainable spaces across Ulu Pandan"".\xa0\nGovernment Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment chairman Louis Ng told CNA he also intended\xa0to raise the issue in Parliament.\xa0\n""It\'s precious\xa0what we have left,"" said Mr Ng, the founder and former chief executive of animal welfare group Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (ACRES).\xa0\nThe number of species identified during studies should be a factor when considering whether to develop such spaces, he said.\xa0\xa0\n""We\'ve developed so much, so it\'s important that we protect what we have left now.""\nPeople he has brought to such green spaces are ""amazed"" that they exist in urbanised Singapore, said the Nee Soon GRC MP.\xa0\n""We really got people excited that we have this amazing biodiversity here,"" he said.\xa0\nWHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES?\nThe Nature Society Singapore (NSS) has proposed that the entirety of Dover Forest be conserved as a ""public-cum-nature-park"", citing its importance as a ""stepping stone for wildlife connectivity"", linking forests in the Southern Ridges to areas such as Bukit Batok Nature Park and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.\nPreserving the forest would benefit critically endangered species such as the straw-headed bulbul and the buffy fish owl, the NSS said, adding that 10ha of the site could be set aside as a public park.\xa0\nThe group also suggested three alternative sites for HDB development,\xa0including a 14.5ha open field at the junction of Dover Road and North Buona Vista Road.\xa0\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity for greater emphasis on sustainable property development, said property analyst Ong Kah Seng.\xa0\nEven so, the scarcity of land in Singapore means green spaces may eventually have to make way for new property development, he said.\xa0\n""As push comes to shove, with land scarce Singapore continually grappling with perennial issues of competing and conflicting uses ...\xa0it could be fairly utopian and overreaching to gazette or indefinitely preserve nature areas,"" said Mr Ong, suggesting purpose-built parks could take the place of natural forested areas.\xa0\nIn its feedback to the HDB\xa0study on Dover Forest, the NSS called for ""more serious exploration""\xa0of alternative sites for redevelopment, suggesting that more golf courses be redeveloped and old industrial sites be revamped.\xa0\nBut Institute of Policy Studies senior research fellow Woo Jun Jie said such an approach may not be feasible when it comes to urban planning.\xa0\n""I can see the logic of trying to find other smaller spots to build residential areas, but from a planning perspective, that may not make as much sense,""\xa0he said on CNA’s Heart of the Matter podcast.\xa0\n""Because when you plan a town ... you need certain kinds of amenities. And (if you) look at the way that we have developed estates like Bidadari, Tengah, there is a certain size that you need to develop a whole town,""\xa0said Dr Woo.\xa0\nSpeaking on the same instalment of the podcast, Ngo Kang Min from the Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment called for more transparency in the urban planning process, asking if the considerations behind why certain areas are zoned for housing could be revealed.\xa0\nConservation and development are not two opposing viewpoints, NSS president Shawn Lum told CNA.\xa0He cited the example of Bidadari estate, where efforts were made to preserve as much of the area\'s natural woodland as possible when housing was being built.\xa0\nDr Lum said he was\xa0hopeful that any development in the Dover area would be able to preserve a ""significant amount of greenery"".\nMr Ng, the MP,\xa0recalled\xa0that in previous instances, efforts were made to save the animals by moving them from redeveloped areas to the nature reserves.\xa0\nBut he cautioned: ""You can only do that so many times, pushing all the animals into one area. And in this case, it would be quite a far push to the next forest.""\nDEVELOPMENT VS SUSTAINABILITY\nThe balancing act between Singapore’s urban development and the preservation of the country’s natural environment has surfaced numerous times over the years.\nThe construction of the 10km Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) in the 1980s led to the contiguous forested area in central Singapore being split into the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment nature reserves.\nThe two were only reunited with the 2013 completion of the S$16 million Eco-Link@BKE - a 62m-long wildlife link over the expressway which allows animals to cross between the two nature reserves.\xa0\nBetween 1994 and 2014, an average of two\xa0Sunda pangolins - a critically endangered animal according to the\xa0International Union for Conservation of Nature - were found dead every year on major roads around the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment nature reserves, according to the National Parks Board.\xa0\nMore recently, there were several years of debate over whether the future 50km Cross Island MRT Line should go under or around the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the largest of Singapore\'s four nature reserves.\xa0\nThis ended with the Government deciding two years ago that the MRT line would take a 2km route running 70m under the nature reserve.\xa0\nNSS president Dr Lum said there is now more concern over the environmental repercussions of such projects, noting initial plans for the Cross Island Line were ""quite significantly modified""\xa0to mitigate impact on the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.\xa0\nIn October, Minister for National Development Desmond Lee announced a set of changes to the environmental impact assessment framework.\xa0These included greater transparency for environmental studies, as well as the inclusion of green groups earlier on in the planning process, ahead of development works.\xa0\nThe findings from such studies are important, said Mr Ng, stating that the decision on whether or not to develop green spaces has to be based on science.\xa0He understands the need for balance between development and the environment in land-scarce Singapore.\xa0\n""People have a desire for these areas to be protected and of course people have a desire for housing as well … the Government’s role is to find the balance, it\'s not a matter of whether we want to or not,""\xa0he said.\nHe hopes the decision is made to retain Dover Forest as it is.\n""Once you develop it, it\'s gone forever.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     environment ']}"

      Unseasonally wet weather between June and September in 2020: MSS annual review
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: A hot and dry start to 2020 gave way to unseasonally wet weather during the southwest monsoon season, with record rainfall in\xa0June and September,\xa0said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) in its annual weather review released on Tuesday (Jan 19).\nThe southwest monsoon season in the\xa0third quarter is typically drier than the rest of the year, but the total rainfall for\xa0June to September 2020 was 30 per cent\xa0above\xa0the long-term average, said MSS.\nThe two highest islandwide average monthly rainfall totals were in June and September. The June rainfall of\xa0310.1mm was\xa099 per cent higher than the month's long-term monthly average, while September's 302.4mm was\xa063 per cent\xa0above the norm.\nMeanwhile, from January to March, the monthly rainfall was more than 30 per cent\xa0below average.\nThere were also more frequent intense heavy rainfall events in 2020, with\xa0six days of heavy downpours.\xa0This was the most number of days since 2013.\nA WET JUNE, SQUALLS IN OCTOBER\nJune 2020 was the wettest June in 10 years, with total rainfall of\xa0233.8mm just at\xa0the Changi climate station.\xa0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIt rained 21 days that month,\xa0the highest in the last 30 years.\nThe chart below shows the\xa0rainfall recorded at the Changi climate station,\xa0not islandwide.\nThe heavy thundery showers on several days, particularly on Jun 23,\xa0brought intense rainfall and contributed to flash floods across Singapore.\nThis was\xa0mostly due to strong solar heating of land areas, combined at times with the passage\xa0of\xa0Sumatra squalls.\nIn October, 14 Sumatra squalls passed over Singapore, the highest number for October since 2010, partly due to\xa0several tropical cyclones over the South China Sea and western Pacific Ocean.\nOn average, Singapore experiences 45 Sumatra squalls a year, with most passing between April and November. In 2020, about 50 Sumatra squalls crossed over Singapore.\n8TH\xa0HOTTEST YEAR\nWhile cooler than prior years, 2020 was still the eighth hottest year on record. The\xa0annual mean temperature was 28 degrees Celsius, 0.5 degrees\xa0above the long-term average of 27.5 degrees Celsius.\nThis comes after a sweltering 2019, when the mercury hit 28.4 degrees Celsius on average, equaling record temperatures for 2016.\nThe mean temperature for the last 10 years from 2011 to 2020 was 27.94 degrees Celsius, just marginally lower\xa0than the previous warmest decade from 2010 to 2019 (27.95 degrees Celsius).\nNo long-term monthly temperature records were broken in 2020, but in most months, the temperature stayed above the 30-year mean monthly average.\nBesides being unseasonally rainy, June and September were also cooler than normal. June 2020 was the second coolest for the month in 20 years (28.1 degrees Celsius), while September was the coolest in 10 years (27.5 degrees Celsius), tying with September 2013.\nLA NINA\nThe wetter second half of the year can be\xa0attributed in part to La Nina conditions that developed in the third quarter of 2020 and continued to strengthen during the rest of the year.\nLa Nina occurs when the\xa0sea surface temperature\xa0in the eastern tropical Pacific is unusually cold and strong winds blow warm seawater away from South America and towards Indonesia.\nIt's the opposite phase of the El Nino effect;\xa0and while El Nino brings hot and dry weather to\xa0Southeast Asia, its sister carries rain.\nBoth are caused by changes in ocean temperatures\xa0and atmospheric pressure.\nLa Nina events tend to have a stronger effect on Singapore’s rainfall during the southwest monsoon season, where they bring more rain, said MSS.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     weather ', '     environment ', '     climate ']}"

      The retiree who transformed a sparse plot of land into three award-winning gardens
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Nine years ago, Mdm Lee May La, 64, nearly lost her life.\nShe had gone to Australia to attend her son’s graduation\xa0when she had a sudden onset of meningitis - an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord - which left her unconscious in an Australian hospital.\nFor two months, she could not walk. And with the medication she had been taking, she started suffering\xa0from reduced bone density.\n“The doctor (told) me, you need vitamin D,” she said, which is why she joined her fledgling neighbourhood community garden as a\xa0full-time volunteer in 2012.\n\n\nWhen asked if she found the work taxing at first, as she had been\xa0recovering from her infection, Mdm Lee, who is now retired, said: “Once you enjoy, you don’t feel anything.”\nNow, almost a decade later, she manages the three award-winning community gardens in her Bukit Batok neighbourhood, runs workshops for gardeners and has been enlisted to work on several other gardening projects, including a garden for patients with dementia\xa0at the Institute of Mental Health. Her bone density has also returned to normal.\nA FEW CROPS AND MANY QUARRELS\nAnyone visiting the three community gardens at Bukit Batok Central will be struck by the size of the plots. Where most community gardens tend to be smaller, Mdm Lee’s gardens span the length of the adjacent Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat, covering about 20,000 sq ft.\nThe first is a sprawling vegetable garden, and at 10,000 sq ft, it is brimming with salad greens, fruit trees and koi ponds. In the corner, there is a small hydroponics set-up, built by the volunteers themselves. It even has a long-tailed myna that says phrases in\xa0Teochew and Mandarin.\nThe second garden, at 3,000 sq ft, takes its inspiration from art. Donated\xa0sculptures are the centrepieces here, and a small path guides the visitor through the garden.\nThe last garden, a\xa07,000 sq ft plot, is dedicated solely to fruit trees - there are papaya trees, banana trees and even a temperate Brazilian Grape Tree that has somehow managed to flourish in Singapore’s humid, tropical environment.\xa0\nBut this community garden did not always look like this. When she started in 2012, said Mdm Lee, the garden was only a third of its current size, with only a few fruit trees and few individual lots.\nThe community gardeners were also individualistic and fought often, she said, recalling that they often quarrelled over soil and gardening implements.\n“I (didn't) like seeing everyone fight,” she said. So when she took over as garden leader in 2014, she started to put the garden in order.\xa0\n“I found (the individual plots) very messy. The aunties simply plant anything inside, like rojak,” she said. “And then after that I influenced the uncles and aunties. I don’t divide. Once I take over (as) garden leader, I don’t let them become (individualistic). All plant together, all share together.”\nOver the course of a year, she bonded the quarrelling gardeners together by organising monthly birthday parties, volunteer\xa0potlucks and sharing her own produce with everyone else.\nNow, they all work together as a team to maintain the garden. According to Mdm Lee, there are about 20 to 30 volunteers and 10 active gardeners working on the plots, with the oldest aged 80 and the youngest aged 17.\n“I LIKE TO SEE THE GREENERY”\nAlthough the residents volunteer their time, there are still new plants and fertilisers to buy. In all, Mdm Lee forks out a few hundred dollars\xa0a month to maintain the community garden.\nShe said with a laugh: “My husband said, you take my salary and you spend in the garden.”\nFor her latest project, the hydroponics garden, Mdm Lee spent a further S$3,000, topping up the money already subsidised by the Residents’ Committee.\nBut her dedication does not stop there. Every time before she plants something new, she will do her research on Google to make sure she understands how to care for the crop. She, along with five other gardeners, also used their SkillsFuture credits to attend a one-day course on hydroponics.\nShe even went to Chiang Mai, Thailand, with two other volunteers to learn how to make enzymes, which they use to enrich the soil.\nTo spread her love and knowledge of gardening, Mdm Lee started to work with childcare centres in the vicinity to educate preschool children about the plants and crops in the community gardens as well.\n\n\nFor her future plans for the gardens, Mdm Lee just wants to “plant something special”, something different for the children who visit her garden.\nShe also wants to add an arch to the entrance of her second garden and plant more flowers and plants over the sculptures, so that when people look over the community gardens, they can see a “small botanic gardens”.\n“I like to see the greenery,” said Mdm Lee, on why she likes gardening. “I saw the children, so happy, looking at the crops. I feel so satisfied. And now you see our volunteers, so (harmonious), like kampong spirit, I feel so good.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Valen Ng is having the time of his life in his own backyard.\nIt’s more of a 2m by 1m balcony, but it’s where the 12-year-old can spend hours every day, cutting up dried leaves and leftover broccoli, gingerly laying seeds inside dimpled layers of soil, pruning his chilli, bittergourd, kangkong and tomato plants.\xa0\n“I try to grow plants that I can eat because don’t need to go outside and buy,” the shy but excitable boy said. It is one of the ways he tries to help his family save money and reduce packaging waste.\xa0\nHe is also the first to grab the toilet roll tube and put it in the recycling bag. He reminds\xa0his parents to bring their own containers when they go out to buy food, and even saves\xa0his parents’ receipts in a box so he can use them as bookmarks.\xa0\xa0\n“He’s like a karang guni man,” Valen’s mum, Madam Kuan Suan Shi, joked.\xa0\xa0\nValen’s interest in nature started five years ago when Mdm Kuan, a teacher, transferred to Lianhua Primary School. The school’s citizenship and character education department often organised environment-centric activities like food compost, gardening and marine conservation workshops. She would bring Valen along, getting their hands dirty by sticking them in soil or picking litter at the beach.\nThey would bring the ideas they learnt from these sessions back home. Valen started a recycling corner in the kitchen and turned used Yakult bottles and cardboard boxes into race tracks for his marbles.\nWhen he was Primary 4, a teacher gave him and his classmates each a green bean plant to grow, as a science experiment. Valen nurtured it carefully, and his family had a mini harvest. He was hooked.\xa0\xa0\n“I want to be a gardener,” he declared buoyantly when asked what he wants to be when he grows up. His mum is heartened, even if the frequent appearances of lizards and cockroaches get under her skin sometimes. She knows urban farming is an up-and-coming field. Gardening has also helped the boy, who has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,\xa0calm down.\xa0\n“(With) more uncertainties and changes in our environment … they are our future and hope in creating a clean and green environment,” Mdm Kuan said, explaining why she encourages her son’s newfound passion.\nAlthough young people are thought to be more concerned about environmental issues, it\xa0seems\xa0it is the adults who are leading the push towards adopting a greener lifestyle - at least at home.\nA\xa0YouGov Omnibus survey found that 56 per cent of respondents said they were the main person\xa0encouraging an eco-friendly lifestyle at home. Another 22 per cent said it was their partner.\xa0\nOnly 8\xa0per cent said it was their child who was taking charge of things, according to the results, which were\xa0based on 254 Singaporeans in a household with children aged between five and\xa017 years old.\nBut the numbers do not diminish the influence children have on adults, environmentalist Dr Shawn Lum said.\xa0\n""Children can be very direct (and) they don\'t cover up stuff,"" said the senior lecturer at the\xa0Nanyang Technological University\'s\xa0Asian School of the Environment.\n""It\'s not just in terms of sheer numbers. But it just takes one or two to be converted by their kids.""\xa0\nAs president of the Nature Society Singapore, Dr Lum has seen members who got into bird watching and nature hiking because their children needed someone to accompany them on their newfound hobby.\n""And some of them have eventually gone on to become leaders, experts\xa0within our birdwatching or nature community,"" he said.\xa0\nYouGov\'s results also showed that most young people care about the environment.\xa0When asked to think about the oldest child in the household that is below 18 years old, and how important an eco-friendly lifestyle was to him or her, 89 per cent said it was either extremely or somewhat important.\xa0\nValen’s schoolmate Thae Su Shyonlei Nway, or Eda as she is known to her family and friends, said that she grew up in an environmentally-conscious family. They plant fruits and vegetables, make rags out of old clothes, and have saved animals caught in traps and litter while on holiday.\xa0\nBut these days, the 12-year-old is the one reminding her parents to switch the lights off, turn up the air-conditioner temperature, recycle their magazines and plastic bottles, as well as\xa0to take along a reusable bag before they go out.\xa0\n“If we don’t play our part to save the earth, then we will die. And also because of climate change, many animals won’t be able to survive. I love animals. I don’t want that to happen,” she said.\nNot that they mind a bit of nagging.\n“Actually, we also encourage Eda to understand in this area (of sustainability) also,” said her father\xa0Mr Aung Myo Htun. He is glad the school has incorporated lessons about sustainability in its curriculum and taught them habits like composting. The family has started to use vegetable\xa0peels and used tea leaves as fertiliser.\nAnother parent, Dr Mythili Pandi, said she had always been aware of recycling or using sustainable products, but it was her children who\xa0pushed her to take it up a notch.\xa0\n“Every time we go out, it’s like - ‘Have you got a recycling bag?’, ‘Did you bring the Tupperware?’” the mother of three said. “And then it\'s bubble tea cups and straws. They refuse to buy bubble tea unless you bring the bag.”\xa0\nWhen her youngest son, five-year-old Shyam, came home from school one day saying he wanted to bury food scraps in their garden - as he had just attended a class in kindergarten that taught him about food waste - Dr\xa0Mythili decided to buy two composting bins to support his idea. Its juices produced “very, very sweet” bananas and papayas a few months ago.\nHer children\xa0also enjoy going to nurseries, so they can pick out seeds to plant.\xa0\n“I would have just stuck to buying my vegetables, but now they decided they want to grow their own,” said Dr Mythili, who is a family physician.\nMs\xa0Tatiana Siufi and her family pick up litter in their neighbourhood in their spare time. Once, her younger child,\xa0four-year-old Natalie, went up to a man who had thrown his cigarette on the ground.\n“Can you please stop throwing butts\xa0on the ground and start throwing them into the bin?,” Ms Siufi recalled her daughter saying. “It was very brave.”\nIt was a proud moment for Ms Siufi, an events executive at City Sprouts. She is still the eco-czar at home, but it was having children\xa0that led her to overhaul her routines.\xa0\nHer seven-year-old, Raphael, went to a pre-school that emphasised nature-loving and planet-saving. The school got them to garden, compost and\xa0understand the concept of the three Rs - reduce, reuse and recycle -\xa0and Ms Siufi felt she had to follow suit.\xa0\n“I would be contradicting what the school taught if I didn’t change,” she said, adding that examples of her family going green\xa0include\xa0shopping at zero-waste stores, hosting birthday parties and playdates using only reusable items and using\xa0rechargeable batteries.\nMdm Kuan agreed. “As adults, we’re easily lured into convenience,"" she said.\n“When we teach the kids one way but as adults we act another way, not putting our knowledge into action, that’s not right,” she added. “I don’t want to kill their excitement about the environment. We need to walk the talk.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     children ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Singapore is testing a possible new addition to its arsenal to keep people dry when flash floods threaten during the monsoon season.\nWhile the new flood protection device looks like an ordinary blue plastic mattress, it is actually a high-tech equipment that was tried and tested in wet, rainy Britain.\nMeet\xa0Floodgate - the national water agency PUB\'s\xa0latest weapon in the battle against flash floods in Singapore.\nThe device is made from high strength steel frames wrapped in a waterproof rubber sleeve. Its side panels can be extended with a wrench to achieve a watertight seal against the doorway, said PUB in a media release on Wednesday (Dec 30).\nA total of 20 devices were purchased from the United Kingdom for “performance testing and validation” in September this year, said the national water agency.\xa0\nFifteen of them are currently on loan to residents at Upper Paya Lebar Road for the prevailing monsoon season.\nUpper Paya Lebar Road was selected as the area is a low-lying one, said Mr Lee Cai Jie, who is a senior principal engineer at PUB’s catchment and waterways department, at a demonstration event on Wednesday.\nThe agency\xa0had reached out to residents in the area to loan out the barrier for use during the monsoon season, said Mr Lee, adding that the unit price of each device can cost between S$800 to S$2,200.\n“We hope to use this particular monsoon season to test it out and to get some feedback on the effectiveness of Floodgate. If the effectiveness of Floodgate is deemed feasible, we do have plans to purchase more in the coming years,” said Mr Lee.\n“We believe the current devices we have are adequate but with this addition of Floodgate, it will give us some flexibility in terms of the light weight as well as the modular nature (of the device).”\nFloodgate is designed to hold back waters as high as 680mm, said PUB. It is available in different sizes to suit openings with widths ranging from 770mm to 1520mm wide and weighs between 13kg and\xa021kg.\nEach device can be deployed by one person within minutes and packed away easily.\xa0 At wider openings such as the entrances of shopfronts, pieces can be linked together to create longer sections.\xa0\nSOLUTIONS FOR\xa0FLASH FLOODS\nMr Yeo Keng Soon, who is PUB’s director of catchment and waterways department, noted in the press release that the agency is also seeing more intense storms and increased rainwater.\n“PUB has made significant progress in improving the drainage system over the past 50 years, which greatly reduced the size of flood-prone areas in Singapore, from 3,200 ha\xa0in the 1970s to 28 ha today,” added Mr Yeo.\n“Flash floods these days are more localised and typically subsides within 30 minutes. However, we are also seeing more frequent rainfall events that are not just bringing increased rainwater but also more intense storms.\xa0\n""With climate change, we must be prepared to deal with and enhance community resilience to flash flood occurrences as it is not always possible to widen or deepen our drains to eliminate floods.”\nTo date, there have been seven separate days\xa0this year where flash floods occurred at various locations in Singapore, said PUB. This was due to very intense rainfall within a short period of time.\nThe current monsoon season\xa0is expected to last for another month.\nLast year, two portable flood protection devices - the Dam Easy Flood Panels (DFPs) and Portable Flood Barriers (PFBs) were introduced by\xa0PUB.\nTo date, 65\xa0DFPs and 155 PFBs have been loaned out to residents in homes and shophouses in flood-prone and low-lying areas.\nIn addition to temporary flood barriers, PUB also uses a range of digital technologies to carry out round-the-clock weather monitoring through a network of closed-circuit television\xa0cameras as well as online water level sensors in drains and radar system to enable quicker response to flood-risk areas, it said.\n“PUB is constantly looking out for new solutions and devices to better enable residents and businesses to respond to flash floods and minimise potential damage to their premises,” added Mr Yeo.\n“In the past, we used heavy and bulky one-time use sandbags against floodwaters. Now, modern flood protection barriers such as Floodgates and Dam Easy Flood Panels can be quickly deployed by residents and shop owners themselves, when there is possibility of flooding.”\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     PUB ', '     environment ']}"

      Not just for the birds: How citizen scientists flock together for conservation
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The birds were chirping all around us as we gathered at the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve visitor centre early on a Sunday morning.\nThe teams of birdwatchers there were armed with binoculars, sporting scopes and cameras with lenses as long as bazookas – waiting for 7.30am when the Bird Race Sprint officially starts.\nHeld annually, the race involves spotting as many species of birds in the allotted time as possible.\nThe team CNA was trailing were taking note of the birds that could be heard even before the official start time, and were off at the stroke of the clock, ticking off types of doves, parrots, sunbirds and a pair of white-bellied sea eagles gliding in to their nest.\n“You usually hear them first, seeing them is just the final confirmation,” said Dr Yeo Seng Beng, a professorial bird lover with mussed-up white hair, who could seemingly identify every bird by its call.\nThe medical doctor was with a team of avid birdwatchers led by Mr Alfred Chia, along with Ms Sandra Chia and Minister for National Development Desmond Lee, who was taking part in his third Bird Race.\nThe four trekked and drove around the Lim Chu Kang area with their ears pricked and eyes scanning the trees, marshes and skies. There were times when a flash of feathers was quickly spotted by one or more of the team – sometimes way up in the clear blue.\n“It’s a brahminy kite, you can tell by the shape of the wings,” said Mr Lee, looking up as the group\xa0traipsed through Kranji Marshes. The others quickly assented, eager to zip to more ""ulu"" (remote) areas seemingly known only to birdwatchers.\xa0\nAlong the way, Mr Lee patiently pointed out and identified the specks in the distance to CNA – from a red-wattled lapwing which had been tagged by researchers in Singapore, to sandpipers in a longkang in the middle of Lim Chu Kang.\nAt the end of five hours, they had walked about 12,000 steps each, Mr Chia estimated, spotting 73 bird species, about eight of which were threatened species. They came\xa0second in the Sprint category of the Bird Race (the full Bird Race lasts 24 hours).\nAlthough the team spotted the most species of birds, they lost on points as the race this year came with a twist: More points were allotted to endangered native species, and the team had not spotted the rarest birds, which were worth five points each.\nFor a newcomer, the speed and urgency at which the bird species were called out were baffling. Mr Chia, 60, who planned the route the team took for the Bird Race, said that there was no secret to it – you just learned the calls, the way the birds flew, and where they lived from experience.\n“EARS AND EYES ON THE GROUND”\nMr Chia, a longtime member of the Nature Society of Singapore’s Bird Group has been at it for more than 30 years. He lends his experience to numerous censuses and surveys of the bird population conducted in Singapore by the Nature Society and the National Parks Board (NParks).\nCitizen scientists such as Mr Chia have been helping to monitor insects, birds and animals in Singapore for decades, and the\xa0number of such volunteers has\xa0increased with more awareness of nature and conservation here.\nHe was happy to see that this year’s Bird Race, the 36th edition, attracted about 250 people, twice the number of participants as the last few years’ races.\n“This is a starting point; hopefully they will sustain the interest ... Those who started as a newbie today will be experienced five years down the road, especially if they cultivate an interest as a child,” he said.\nThe data collected on Dec 5 and 6, when the race was held, will also contribute to conservation eventually, he added.\nHow exactly does birdwatching here contribute to research that could happen overseas or even years down the road?\nMr Lim Kim Chuah, lead organiser of the Bird Race and chair of the Nature Society Bird Group, said that this year, race participants need to key in their sightings to eBird, an app by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. About 180 species of birds were recorded and this information will be archived in the Cornell lab’s database.\xa0\n“Say you\'re doing research on the Arctic warbler - you can go in there, and then you can see … where all the Arctic warblers were seen in Singapore … this is just one example of how people can use the information collected during the Bird Race,” he said.\nThe Arctic warbler is a migratory bird that can be found as far north as Siberia but spends its winters in Southeast Asia.\nWhile the Bird Race is likely the most adrenalin-inducing birding\xa0event of the year, the Nature Society also conducts quarterly censuses of birds in Singapore, and has been doing so for decades. From these studies, they can see trends over the years such as whether the populations of certain birds are in decline.\n“That raises the question - Why is the population falling? Why are we not seeing this (bird) anymore? We hope some researcher can pick this up and then try to find out the root cause,” said Mr Lim, 57.\n“There are only so many researchers, but there are a lot more citizen scientists. So these citizen scientists are the ears and the eyes on the ground.”\nGROWING MOVEMENT\nBirdwatching was one of the earliest ways the man on the street got involved in citizen science and nature conservation.\xa0\nThe National Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count in the United States, has been going on since 1900, and claims to be the longest-running citizen science project in the world. In Singapore, the Nature Society has conducted the annual bird census every year since 1986.\nWith more interest and awareness of local natural heritage, as well as a push by non-governmental organisations and government agencies, the number of volunteers for citizen science programmes\xa0have swelled in recent years.\nBy NParks’ count, the number of citizen scientists involved in its Community in Nature Biodiversity Watch series grew from 400 in 2015 to more than 9,000 in 2020. The series involves members of the public in large scale biodiversity surveys in gardens, parks, and nature reserves across Singapore.\nIts earliest and most popular programme, Garden Bird Watch, has about 1,400 participants who NParks said have contributed “a wealth of citizen science data”.\nThis year, that data resulted in the first book in Singapore to show the distribution of specific birds across Singapore’s green spaces, titled A Review of Garden Bird Watch.\n“Monitoring our biodiversity is important to help us understand the quality of the habitats, track the number and richness of species over time, and develop management strategies to sustain or enhance these populations,” said Mr Lim Liang Jim, group director of NParks’ National Biodiversity Centre.\nAn upcoming project that the Nature Society’s Bird Group will be involved in is the conservation of the straw-headed bulbul - a melodious songbird that is critically endangered. A recent study has found that there could be as many as\xa0600 bulbuls in Singapore, constituting\xa0up to half of the species’ global population - and it may be the one place on Earth where the bird is thriving, due to a dearth of poachers.\nNParks is working with the Bird Group to conduct a two-year baseline survey of the population of the species in Singapore and there are discussions to form a work group for its conservation next year.\nBesides birds, there are also community programmes for monitoring butterfly and dragonfly species, and to report sightings of sea turtles and horseshoe crabs along the coasts.\xa0\nComprehensive surveys of areas such as Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Pulau Ubin, and the Southern Islands have also been done with the support of the community, said NParks’ Mr Lim.\nBesides yielding data for research, such programmes have hooked rookie nature lovers who have grown into full-fledged birdwatching aficionados.\nMs Liu Xinlu’s interest in birds began when she joined the Comprehensive Ubin Biodiversity Survey in 2018, a project to learn more about Pulau Ubin’s wildlife. The ongoing two-year project involves 200 NParks staff, researchers and citizen scientists from nature groups.\nAn environmental science graduate, Ms Liu has always loved nature, but the training given for the survey and going on expeditions with experienced birdwatchers, such as Bird Group chair Mr Lim and Mr Chia, gave her the impetus and knowledge to pursue birding as a passion.\nShe recounted how during the “circuit breaker” earlier this year, she couldn’t go anywhere but the birds “came to her” - and by seeing the migratory birds from far-off places, she could almost imagine travelling again.\n“I like to travel. I think the meaning of travel is to experience ... different places, understand different cultures and in birding, you get a different lens to look at the world,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     wildlife ', '     environment ', '     Desmond Lee ', '     National Parks Board ']}"

      Smart gifting and sensible feasting: Tips for an eco-friendly Christmas and New Year
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As the year draws to a close and the traditional season of gifting and feasting approaches, it can be easy to overindulge, buying too much food which may go to waste and extravagant presents that people might not really need or want.\nHowever,\xa0experts say it is possible to adopt eco-friendly ways to celebrate.\nWhen it comes to Christmas gifts, a common problem occurs when the receiver does not like or need what is given.\nOne way to avoid this is to find out what the recipient wants, and to consider gifting experiences like a trip to the zoo instead, said Zero Waste SG executive director Pek Hai Lin.\nSome examples of experiences to gift are a day at a museum, a meal out, annual passes to a theme park or attraction or an art-jamming session, said environmental advocate Melissa Lam, who runs local lifestyle store Bamboo Straw Girl.\nAnother option is to give a gift voucher or store credit to a shop that you enjoy supporting - such as a small local store - so that your friend will have a choice.\nIf you choose to go with traditional physical gifts, consider repurposing items you have around the house for wrapping, or minimise wrapping material and buy items with less packaging, said Ms Pek.\nAlternatively, you could wrap the gifts in scarves - a Japanese practice known as Furoshiki.\nWhen buying physical gifts, avoid over-consumption or buying excessively, said Ms Stefanie Beitien, head of market transformation at World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore.\n""When we do make a purchase, we can ensure that we are supporting businesses and brands that put in the effort to source and produce sustainably,"" said Ms Beitien.\nOne can consider supporting brands that champion sustainability in their businesses, such as responsibly sourced seafood in hotels and restaurants.\nLook out for products with sustainability labels, to pick products made with sustainable palm oil, pulp and paper, which can extend to toiletries, make-up, or even wrapping paper.\nNot all gifts have to be bought from a store. Ms Pek suggested holding a swap activity where participants can choose like-new items from a pool, or do an exchange.\n""One man\'s trash is another man\'s treasure. There might be brand new items at home which we do not use and another would appreciate to have!"" she said.\nIf holding a Secret Santa event, it is helpful to get participants to state items they prefer to receive, added Ms Lam.\n""Something I\'ve been surprised to see happen more often nowadays is the practice of adding in the receipt in the gift box so that the recipient has the option to swap it for something they prefer or to change the size (for shoes or clothes),"" she said.\xa0\n""While revealing the price of the gift is generally sensitive, this means that the original item won\'t be languishing in storage unused or occupying space at the back of the recipient\'s mind because they have to re-gift it!""\nFEASTING OR FOOD WASTING?\nThe end of the year often comes with feasting - whether it\'s Christmas turkey and legs of lamb or countdown spreads.\nFood production is one of the biggest human-caused threats to biodiversity and our planet, said Ms Beitien from WWF Singapore.\n""In spite of how much resources go into producing food, a third of food goes wasted every day,"" Ms Beitien said.\nA little planning can help prevent excess food preparation, and a little creativity can repurpose leftovers from parties, said Ms Pek.\nGoing green when it comes to food can begin from grocery shopping - bring your own reusable bags to wet markets or supermarkets, and avoid buying snacks or drinks in individual packaging.\xa0\nIf you\'re buying takeaway, consider self-collection to reduce packaging or bring your own containers, said Ms Pek.\nDuring the party, even if you cannot avoid using any disposable utensils at all, simple steps like not using disposable cutlery or cups can go a long way in reducing waste, she added.\nIf coordinating an office or home potluck, coordinate the types of food and amounts to avoid food waste, and have containers on hand for leftovers, said Ms Lam.\nShould you cater food for celebrations, choose edibles that can be kept for a few days, such as roasted meats and potatoes, said Ms Beitien.\nCONSIDER VEGETARIAN FESTIVE DISHES\nIf you are game, introduce your friends to some popular vegetarian restaurants, as food systems account for 29 per cent of global carbon emissions, said Ms Beitien.\nSubstituting red meat with plant-based meats can reduce the environmental impact of the food on our plates.\nOrder or buy food in moderation, and collaborate with vendors to manage food waste. If it ends up in leftovers anyway, you could redistribute it by working with food rescue partners like Treedots, Treatsure and SG Food Rescue.\nAfter your parties, remember to recycle right. Materials like paper, plastic and aluminium are valuable in end-use markets, said Ms Beitien.\nShe\xa0said the COVID-19 pandemic has ""placed a spotlight on the connection between the destruction of nature and the spread of zoonotic diseases"".\n""While this holiday season will be very different for most people, it is a chance to rethink our relationship with nature and the choices we need to make to ensure a resilient future,"" he said.\xa0\nMs Lam quipped that perhaps the most eco-friendly thing we are doing this year is not flying to another country for the year end.\n""Changing what we eat or buy during the festive season is a starting point but in the longer term we cannot miss the opportunity to create systemic changes in terms of the business or brands we support, the diets we choose or our overall lifestyle choices.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Christmas ', '     new year ']}"

      IN FOCUS: Thailand poised to be regional leader in electric vehicle revolution, and all it needs is a spark
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: It was\xa0a postcard picture day off the coast of Phuket as a sleek, modern ferry embarked\xa0on its maiden voyage. The battery-powered vessel slipped\xa0from the dock in near silence and jetted\xa0towards the limestone karsts on the horizon.\nThis was\xa0the launch of a vessel\xa0that its backers hope will revolutionise sea travel and tourism around Thailand’s picturesque islands and beaches, normally a magnet for millions of visitors every year.\nThe e-Ferry is powered by 625 kWh lithium-ion batteries sourced from Singaporean battery maker Durapower. It allows the vessel to cruise at 17 knots, taking tourists to some of the most awe-inspiring sights in the kingdom’s south, without producing any emissions to damage the environment.\nUsing just this single e-ferry for one year will reduce emissions\xa0equivalent to\xa0planting 8,700 trees, according to project collaborator Banpu Next, the innovation-focused subsidiary of powerful parent energy company, Banpu, whose core business has long been coal and gas.\n“When the world is calling for lower carbon emissions, we are foreseeing this same challenge and are now transitioning to cleaner and smarter assets in our strategy,” said the group’s CEO Somruedee Chaimongkol.\nThe environmental impacts of vessels like this could be enormous; around the Andaman Sea area there are approximately 2,000 marine tourism boats.\nIt is also symbolic of the start of a greater movement that is pressing to transform the future of Thailand’s transportation sector and make an impact on its damaging environmental footprint.\nVehicles powered by electricity instead of conventional fuels are slowly starting to emerge on Thailand’s roads, rails and waterways. The world is looking to enact solutions to tackle the climate crisis and the mobilisation of electric vehicle (EV) fleets is becoming an increasingly viable way to reduce carbon footprints.\xa0\nThailand is at a critical juncture. It has work to do to meet its climate targets under the Paris Agreement, while Bangkok continues to endure prolonged periods of elevated air pollution, much of which is caused by vehicles.\nThe country’s central role in global auto production though has it strategically placed to take advantage of new innovation\xa0and companies are already positioning\xa0themselves.\nPIVOT\xa0TOWARDS\xa0ELECTRIC VEHICLES\nA place long known as the Land of Smiles has for decades also been the land of automobiles. Away from the country’s iconic shimmering seas and ancient temples, in the grey industrial estates that sprawl outside Bangkok, the cars of the world have been assembled for decades.\nThe automotive sector is one of Thailand’s most important. The country is the eleventh biggest car manufacturer in the world and the fourth in Asia, only behind the powerhouse nations of China, Japan and South Korea.\xa0\nThailand’s legacy assets and skills, all set up to produce conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, face being wiped out by the electric wave. Already the industry has taken a major hit during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut within five years, the Thai government wants the country to become a hub for something new.\xa0\nA national roadmap will aim to promote EV manufacturing to the extent that it makes up 30 per cent of total annual car production, or about 750,000 units, by the end of the decade. Tax incentives are being rolled out to encourage big players to build their EV fleets in Thailand.\nIt is mobilising state agencies to power a fast transition, starting with public transportation and infrastructure, like charging stations and battery swapping facilities.\xa0\nThe police force is leasing a fleet of electric Tesla Model 3s for patrols, Bangkok City Hall is replacing diesel ferries with electric models to link the Chao Phraya river and train services, and battery-powered public buses are in a testing phase in anticipation of a widespread rollout.\xa0\n“The government set a goal that by 2037, there should be around 2.5 million EV cars. And in order to get to that point, the government must support the building of infrastructure, the change of mindsets and making people trust that if they use EVs, it will be safe,” said Somchai Chokmaviroj, the director of the Research and Innovation Division of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT).\nThe big questions are whether Thailand will be able to compete in a globally charged industry where technology is changing rapidly on a massive scale and if consumers will make the jump, when EVs remain exclusive, expensive and limited.\nGRIT AND STEEL\nAware of the opportunities, local companies have begun to position themselves in terms of innovation and investments.\nSakun C’s new assembly plant is an expansive space, its size exaggerated by its emptiness. Soft afternoon light filters through high windows onto a working floor, where aluminum chassis of various vehicle prototypes are being inspected by workers.\xa0\nSoon, it is anticipated that advanced robots will be assembling thousands of buses every year here, as well as electric trains and boats of various designs, including the e-Ferry, which the company designed, assembled and put on the water in Phuket, alongside Banpu Next.\nIt is an ambitious push by the Thai company to revive domestic innovation and ensure locally-made technology is viable, in the face of a surge of EV development overseas.\nSakun C is a subsidiary of Choknomchai Group, the largest car producer in Southeast Asia with an extensive domestic network of parts suppliers. It has been making cars for the likes of Honda, Toyota and Nissan for two decades.\nBut according to Sakun C’s CEO Weeraphon Techaphasuksanti, continuing to simply manufacture vehicles for others will not be enough in the looming age of the electric vehicle.\nHe wants to stimulate a tenuous industry and create new jobs by creating a strong local brand. It does not mean picking a fight with the Japanese companies that have sent their business to Thailand for years, rather finding lower volume gaps in the sector and the types of vehicles that the country really needs.\n“It’s really good timing for us now to have our own brand. Everyone is on the same level. Everyone has to restart. It’s a good opportunity for Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines; everyone is very excited about this opportunity. They all want to produce,” Weeraphon said.\nBut Thailand’s advantage over its ASEAN neighbours is its long-built expertise and technology.\n“Definitely in my opinion Thailand is in a good position. Because before electric cars, normally we’re building cars for the world under many brands. We have these skills already. So when the new technology comes, it’s not that complicated and we have our knowledge base,” he told CNA.\n“Body and engine technology means we haven’t been able to have Thai brands. But we’re very lucky because now the engine’s gone. We have dye making, eco-design engineering, part producing. We’ve built our assembly plant to build the body. With the engine gone, it means the parts we need are just on the shelf.”\nSakun C is focused on light, resilient aluminum bodies that will suit an EV platform, rather than steel, traditionally used in Japanese carmaking. Aluminum is three times lighter than steel and can be assembled much more quickly.\nIts minibuses and city buses are road ready, accelerated by research assistance from the National Science and Technology Development Agency, a government agency that has invested in the company.\nWeeraphon is hopeful the partnership means Thai-made buses could soon replace their pollution-spewing diesel predecessors on the streets of Bangkok, and in tourism-centric regions of the country.\xa0\n“The world is calling for this kind of vehicle. I think it’s going to come much earlier than we expected. If we have our own brand a form of innovation is going to happen,” he said.\n“If we don’t do these projects, it means we’re ignoring the needs of the country. If we have this technology, that means we wait for Chinese or other people to take Thai industry away. We would have no choice if the big players come and acquire everything in Thailand. We’re going to lose everything if we do nothing.”\nHis company is not alone. There is a raft of private newcomers to the automaking scene who are ready to ascend Elon Musk-style to the pinnacle of a fast growing industry and others looking to carve out niche pathways to decongest Bangkok.\nBORN IN THE GARAGE: EMISSION FREE TUK\xa0TUKS\nIt is a common theme that some of the world’s most successful start-ups began in a garage. For many of Thailand’s budding auto start-ups, the same is true.\nWith little government support and few incentives within reach, most small players in the electric vehicle industry in Thailand are on a long and solitary road. And while cooperation exists between\xa0the startups, there is also competition.\nOn the outskirts of the capital, Chayoot Sripian proudly steps through the warehouse-cum-showroom of his fledgling company, Power Up TukTuk. His fleet right now comprises just a handful of the iconic Thai vehicles, but his ambitions are overflowing.\xa0\nThe concept is to build a platform for emission-free tuk tuks that can be accessed by all. The idea was inspired by his elderly grandmother who before her death found it difficult to get around Bangkok.\n“My grandma went to Lumpini Park every day for her whole life. One day when it became difficult for her to walk at the age of 93, we decided she needed to use a wheelchair,” Chayoot recounted.\n“After that, when I asked my grandma if she wanted to go to Lumpini Park, she would say ‘no, I don’t want to go’. But I know that actually she does want to go but she doesn't want to be a burden. So she stayed home. I think a lot of elderly think like that and stay like that.\xa0\n“When I’m thinking about my grandma, I’m thinking of all the other people who couldn’t afford a car that can take a wheelchair. There are so many elderly left at home because it’s too difficult to travel. Taxi drivers have to carry them, have to trust them, and the roadside taxis won’t pick them up,” he said.\nPower Up has re-engineered a conventional tuk tuk, removing the drivetrain and installing a centrally positioned battery. The result is a lower, more accessible vehicle that can accommodate a wheelchair or less mobile passenger.\nChayoot is still trying to scale up his concept and bring it to market.\xa0“I’m not Elon Musk. I don’t have that much money. I’m not a public company,” he conceded.\n“For these companies, it’s very challenging. You need to have very good resources, enough capital and human resources. You have to compete with the giant corporate companies who have the technology and the human resources,” said Dr Yossapong Laoonual, a leading academic, founding head of the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand (EVAT) and member of the National Electric Vehicle Policy Committee.\n“This is very difficult for a country like Thailand,” he said.\n\n\nTHE SCENT OF MUSK\nWhile they may not have the money, what inspires many budding EV entrepreneurs is clear - one man - Elon Musk of Tesla.\nThe imprint on this industry of a pioneer of the global electric vehicle industry is profound. It has small companies dreaming of loftier heights.\xa0\nFor self-professed “nerd and gear head”, Nataphat Lertviriyasawat, Tesla was the perfect business case study to model his electric motorcycle start-up on.\xa0\n“Tesla is the first company that can say to the market that we don’t need to rely on gasoline alone anymore. You have a choice and it can work,” he said.\nHe even - coincidentally he claims - named his company after Thomas Edison, a bitter rival of engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla. The two men fought a war over whose electric currents would power the world in the 1880s. Far from competing now though, Nataphat simply wants a fragment of the success of the American EV and technology behemoth.\xa0\nAfter already being dubbed the “Tesla on two wheels” during participation in an innovation competition in China, he believes his company is primed to make an impact.\nIt is a sector where EV innovation has been painfully slow to reach consumers: the exception being China where bans on ICE vehicles in big cities has seen hundreds of millions of two and three wheelers hit its roads.\xa0\nDespite the lack of EV adoption so far, the size of the potential market in the ASEAN region cannot be ignored. Motorcycles far outweigh cars on Southeast Asian roads. In Thailand alone, there are about 21 million registered motorcycles, double the number of sedans, yet there are less than 10,000 electric or hybrid motorcycles in operation.\n“We never saw e-bikes on the road. That’s why we started to try and figure out what the problem was. Why can’t the e-bike enter the market? We narrowed it down to four main problems at that time - low performance compared to a gasoline bike, the range is too short, the charging time is too long and the serviceability is crap,” Nataphat said.\nWith a nod to the Tesla business model, Edison embarked on designing a “platform” with aesthetics, speed and reliability, regardless of price.\xa0\n“It’s a similar strategy to Tesla, who launched a sports car first for the top end to adopt. That’s the way we’re going right now, into a niche market or early adopters,” he said.\nEnvironmental benefits are a non-factor in Edison’s approach to encouraging riders to switch to electric, even though motorcycles typically produce more damaging greenhouse gases than cars.\xa0\n“We have to look at the whole ecosystem of electric vehicles. We need to attract people to the industry. Otherwise, it is meaningless. You can build it and say it is\xa0environmentally friendly but people still need to adopt it,” Nataphat said.\n“Never once have I said that electric vehicles will save the planet. We want to focus on the fact that this is an EV that actually works. And then the process of changing the world, changing the carbon footprint, comes later.”\nYet, the environmental impacts of removing combustion engines from the roads are clear. The benefits of doing so just have not been fully realised in Thailand yet.\nGREEN ATTITUDES\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, seeing commuters wearing a face mask in Bangkok was already a fairly regular sight. Like many growing cities, air pollution can periodically stifle the Thai capital, forcing people to try and protect their lungs.\nWith zero tailpipe emissions and better efficiency than conventional vehicles, electric vehicles are a logical solution to easing some of Bangkok’s PM2.5 issues.\xa0\n“The problem of the rising pollution will be a driving force for any government. Electric vehicles are a solution. That solution can be used straight away. It’s not only an emissions issue, it’s a climate change issue - a global issue,” said Yossapong of EVAT.\n“The source of the PM2.5 is the exhaust from automobiles. If we’re not solving it by using a better technology, the problem will stay with us for another ten years.”\nAnalysis backs up his claims. The International Energy Agency stated this year that EVs, “are a key technology to reduce air pollution in densely populated areas and a promising option to contribute to energy diversification and greenhouse gas emissions reduction objectives”.\nAnd transport needs to be cleaned up in Asia. More than 30 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases from transport and buildings is produced on the continent, based on analysis by international consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute.\xa0\nHowever, the true climate gains will only be realised once deeper changes are made to Thailand’s energy mix.\nPresently, the majority of Thailand’s power generation is from dirty sources - coal and natural gas. The wind and solar energy industries are in early development stages, hampered by the country’s significant national power surplus. State energy agency EGAT has shown reluctance to disrupt its fossil fuel-driven strategy.\nIt means the electricity powering Thailand’s growing EV fleet is not as clean as it could be. That might not matter much to the government, according to energy economics expert Puree Sirasoothorn from Thammasat University.\n“They don’t have a green attitude. Whatever policy they put in place, they will look at the numbers. It’s got to push the economy, help employment and it will be calculated in terms of money. It’s hard for them to see the benefits that EVs can have,” she said.\n“We have very low targets for everything. Low targets for EVs and low targets for renewable energy. It’s going to be a very, very slow transition. It’s because of the state enterprises.\n“Definitely they’re going to phase out oil and gas, sooner or later, but later would be the answer for the government, that’s for sure.”\nThe government gains about one-third of its excise tax from petrol, a large amount of revenue that electricity cannot provide. It is one of the reasons, Puree said, that the mass rollout of consumer EVs may be slow.\nPrices for private electric vehicles remain restrictively high, mainly due to import taxes. The government has proposed a trade-in incentive, where buyers could receive a THB100,000 (US$3350) payment when switching their older car for a new EV. But it has yet to be clarified and approved, and is a rare purchase subsidy, the likes of which are common in many other countries.\n“In Thailand we rely very much on what kind of support from the government will accelerate the use of the electric vehicles,” said Banpu’s Somruedee.\nEV prices are forecast to drop, however, as economies of scale are reached. Already battery prices, a major cost component, have decreased globally by more than 85 per cent since 2010. In that time, the number of electric cars on the road has rocketed from 17,000 to 7.2 million, mostly in China.\nEV car registrations in Thailand increased by 380 per cent from 2018 to 2019, and despite the economic downturn experienced in 2020, the number of new registrations this year have surpassed last year, according to EVAT’s president Krisda Utamote. That number is only about 2,000 units, however.\n“We see some movement in terms of buyer behaviour. The young generation is more interested in clean energy and what type of fuel the vehicle will emit,” he said.\n“People are more active in considering buying an electric vehicle as their first purchase and we’re seeing more models coming into the market as well.”\xa0\nInevitably, it means electric infrastructure is popping up around the country. More demand will breed more solutions and support. But the first EV people might experience, may not be one that they own.\n\n\nA BETTER FUTURE\nIt was when Supapong Kitiwattanasak and his friends had children that they decided on a business idea fiercely focused on the environment and society.\n“Why do we live in a city where we can’t commute easily? We thought that we needed to do something to fix this problem,” he said.\nFriends became co-founders and today, Urban Mobility Tech - the start-up they began - has more than 100 electric tuk-tuks in its fleet and a small army of drivers on the payroll.\nThe concept of their platform - MuvMi - is to give commuters a sustainable transport option for the first and last mile of their journey. Without options, reaching public transport can be difficult, encouraging people to use their own private vehicles instead.\nOn a mobile application that works similarly to other ride sharing software, MuvMi is transporting passengers emission-free on a daily basis. Even though charging stations, batteries and vehicle conversions have added significant challenges to the business, it was important from the company’s perspective not to add any burden to Bangkok’s issues.\n“If we want to solve the traffic problem by bringing more vehicles into the load, we should not make another impact in terms of pollution, or solving one problem by causing another, so we have to go to EV,” Supapong said.\n“Our plan is to have a thousand cars on the street. It would be unacceptable for the business in the long run. Every component we use, we think about how it affects the environment.”\xa0\nKrit Vichaiwatanapanich is also adding vehicles to Bangkok’s congested roads. Yet, climate change is one of his primary concerns.\xa0\nThe CEO of Haupcar, Thailand’s first car sharing service, wants to change the notions of mobility in Bangkok by making EVs accessible to more people at a low cost.\nThe company has the support of Banpu, which assisted with the purchase of 100 Thai-made Fomm vehicles, the world’s smallest class four-seater EV. They are parked in specific locations and can be hired to self-drive for as short time as an hour.\xa0\n“To have an electric fleet on the platform is my intention from the very beginning. Back then we weren't as ready due to the charging infrastructure but for now it’s become a key for us to expand,” Krit said.\n“As we expand electric charging stations, it helps other players as well to be able to sell more electric vehicles in the market. We’re not only helping people who use our service but other car manufacturers to introduce other vehicles on the platform as well.”\xa0\nWhile he admits that driving an EV in Thailand is still “very inconvenient”, that may not be the case for much longer. Cooperation and coordination means more pieces are in place to seize a cleaner future.\xa0\nThe country is just waiting to flick the switch.\nAdditional reporting by Ryn Jirenuwat.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     electric vehicles ', '     environment ', '     Tesla ', '     technology ', '     In Focus ']}"

      Engineer, innovator, aerial dancer: NUS scientist flies through the air on silk as a hobby
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When physicist Isaac Newton discovered gravity, his eureka moment came as he was sitting in a garden, observing an apple fall.\nIn the case of National University of Singapore scientist Duong Hai Minh, it came after he was suspended in mid-air, doing swirls.\nDuong led the research team who found a solution to the world’s plastic pollution problem — by turning plastic waste into aerogel, the lightest solid known to man and a material that insulates people against fire and cleans oil spills.\nAnd he had this stroke of inspiration after flying through the air on aerial silks, a form of acrobatic dance performed while one is hanging from silk fabric.\n“At the aerial silk (studio), I see people drink a lot of water after the exercise. And when I threw away my plastic bottle, I saw a lot of plastic bottles in the bin,” recalls the 46-year-old innovator.\n“So I just wondered, can we recycle them into high-value material?\nThe result: The reinvention of aerogel, which had mostly been produced commercially from silica and commonly used for heat and sound insulation in buildings. Now it can be made into jackets that are more fire-resistant than conventional fire-fighting suits.\nBut what was this associate professor from the department of mechanical engineering doing on aerial silks in the first place?\n“I tried different kinds of sports. I went to the gym, running, dancing, yoga, but I got bored … I like aerial silks because it’s a combination of various sports,” he tells the series Wizards Of Tech.\n“It helps me to improve upper body strength, also (my) flexibility and my abs … Sometimes in the middle of the air, a eureka moment pops up in my mind.”\nHe started practising in 2013 and has been inspired by his weekend hobby ever since.\nWATCH: Why aerial silk dance inspires this engineering innovator (3:44)\nPHYSICS AND DANCE COMBINED\nIf you ask Duong, aerial silks are “in between an art and a science”. He says: “As long as you know about the science in the aerial silk tricks, you can master (them) more easily.”\nAnd the first thing science helped him to understand was how to “defeat” gravity.\n“When you (invert yourself) … you need to apply a force with your hand higher than the force of gravity to lift up your body. Then you can do the inversion,” he cites.\nThe second thing that is needed is momentum.\n“When you rotate your body in the air, when you pull in your legs and your arms … rotational kinetic energy will be increased,” he says. “The spin of your body will be faster.\n“When you extend your legs and arms back to the original (position), you can reduce the speed.”\nLast but not least is friction, especially between the hands and the silk. In fact, it is “very important”, which is why some aerial dancers apply a drying lotion to “get a better grip on the fabric”.\n“You can hang your body better in the air,” Duong adds.\nHowever, he loves his art form not only because of the physics of it but also because he must “adapt to the music”.\n“That means you can be a dancer,” he says. “This is the artiste; you need … some creativity as well. So that also helped me to become a (better) scientist.\n“When you’re a scientist, (you) need to get creative in your technology or … research method to do it (your) own way. You don’t follow other people’s ways.”\nAerial silks have also helped to train his focus as an engineer because up in the air, he has to focus on what he is doing and the technique. “Otherwise, (you) will injure yourself,” he adds.\n“That also helps me when I go to work, because I need to focus on what I’m good at.”\nON A ROLL\nThe kind of innovation Duong is good at, which he gets ideas about during or usually after his aerial silk exercise, has to do with recycling waste into new material “to enhance human life”.\nConverting plastic bottles into aerogel is but one of these breakthroughs. Since his team published their research on this in 2018, they have figured out how to make the world’s first aerogels from rubber tyres.\nThey filed a patent last year for their rubber aerogels, which could solve another environmental problem: Globally, about a billion car tyres are discarded every year — only 40 per cent are recycled, and the bulk are burnt, releasing toxic gases.\nNext up is agricultural waste such as pineapple leaves. “Every kilogramme of pineapple ... will generate about three kilogrammes of pineapple leaf waste,” says Duong. “We can use it for baby diapers ... and food preservation.”\nPineapple aerogel treated with active carbon powder, for example, can keep fruits and vegetables from rotting for at least two weeks. “This can be used for preserving vegetables and fruits during transportation,” he points out.\nThere seems to be no stopping him on his aerogel roll. His team have also used soya bean residue, known as okara, to create another eco-aerogel that is in the process of commercialisation.\nWhat has “surprised” his colleagues, however, is his aerial silk hobby, which they found out recently.\n“They feel that I’m a little bit weird because I’m a professor working at the university,” he says with a laugh. “And they said, ‘We couldn’t believe that you can do this well.’”\nHis students found out about it too. “They gossiped about it,” he grins. “They came up to me and said, ‘Prof, I saw your aerial silk (video) on YouTube. And we like it.’ I said, ‘Oh, thank you.’”\nWatch this episode of Wizards Of Tech here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     technology ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Closing the loop: Ditching 'take, make, dispose' for a circular economy
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Take, make, use and throw. For a long time, the world\'s economies have operated on a linear model where raw materials are taken and made into products before being used and thrown away.\nWith the growing focus on sustainability and environment concerns, attention is being turned to a circular economy - where resources are maximised and kept in use for as long as possible. It’s a new way of thinking – and one that could also pay off for investors.\nOne example of this closed-loop system can be found at Singapore company TRIA, which developed Bio24, a system to turn food waste and the container the food came in into fertiliser.\nTRIA’s push towards circularity is becoming increasingly important. That’s because the traditional “take-make-dispose” consumption model adopted by the linear economy is putting a strain on finite resources.\nCurrently, the linear economy consumes resources at 1.75 times the planet’s annual regenerative capacity.\nDuring the two-month ""circuit breaker"", for example, Singapore households generated an extra 1,334 tonnes of plastic waste from takeaways and food deliveries. That’s the weight of about 90 double-decker buses.\nAnd this, says Eco-Business founder Jessica Cheam, highlight the dangerous relationship we have with the natural world.\n“We’re not respecting it, we’re not responsible stewards of the resources that are given to us and we are deforesting our forests and exploiting our environment. The use of resources is something that is super critical because our earth is not a never-ending supply of resources and we really need to be responsible stewards,” said Ms Cheam.\xa0\nCircularity\xa0could be the much needed alternative. The circular economy is driven by sharing, recycling, re-using and waste management - and it is restorative or regenerative by intention and design.\nMr Holger Frey, a senior portfolio manager at RobecoSAM, an investment specialist focused exclusively on sustainable investing, said the global economy today is only 9 per cent circular.\n“Up to 80 per cent of the environmental impact is determined at the design phase. And historically, \xa0environmental impact has not been considered as a key priority in product design, which is the reason why so many products still cling on to linear design principles,"" said Mr Frey.\n""But now looking at the younger generation, there’s a general change in mindset and there’s more awareness of environmental impact and this also translates into new thinking in product and industrial design,” he added.\n\nAccording to Accenture, the circular economy could generate US$4.5 trillion of additional economic output by 2030.\xa0This could lead to a myriad of opportunities for investors, including investing in the stocks of companies with a sustainability agenda, or in start-ups in the circular economy, said industry watchers.\nHealthcare, industrials, consumer staples and discretionary staples are some of the sectors investment firms have highlighted. Other themes emerging include those around the built environment and mobility.\n\xa0""We are interested in innovators, so like companies producing biodegradable consumer packaging or a sensor technology for sorting automation. On the consumption side, this is complemented by companies that excel really when it comes to sustainable sourcing of materials,"" said Mr Frey.Ms Rebecca Somers, partner at McKinsey & Company, observed opportunities in the built environment and food-related industries.\n“One is around building design, what we call the built environment and this is about the modular design and the use of building infrastructure where they are made of recycled materials. There’s a theme around mobility. And this is around making sure that the use of vehicles are net emission zero vehicles, making sure that the vehicles are made of refurbished or recycled parts and also shared mobility platforms,"" she said.\n""There’s also a big theme around nutrition and food waste, so digital apps and platforms that track food, from farm to table, ensuring minimisation of food waste,” she added.\nExperts say that these changes can drive value and thus ultimately be a winning proposition - not just for investor returns, but also for the long-term future of the planet. \xa0\xa0\n""You should really think about where your money goes and what products and materials you’re buying because if we can help to support companies that support the circular economy transition, then we should be doing that,"" said Ms Cheam.\n""We should not be buying products and services from companies who are still in that linear model where anything that you use gets disposed off in a very irresponsible manner. And if we can create that kind of movement among consumers, then we’re going to see the acceleration of that economy,"" she said.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Money Mind ', '     environment ']}"

      Lornie Nature Corridor opens as rewilding plan launched to introduce more naturalistic landscapes
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore’s newest park connector, forming part of the Lornie Nature Corridor, opened on Saturday (Nov 21) as a “Rewilding Plan” to introduce more naturalistic landscapes was announced.\nThe 1.76km nature corridor is part of a 10km “rewilding stretch” linking Kheam Hock Road to Upper Thomson Road, the National Parks Board (NParks) said in a media release.\nIt creates a “rustic environment” for recreation, while also strengthening the ecological resilience of the adjacent Central Catchment Nature Reserve and protecting it from the effects of climate change, the agency said.\nSpeaking at the opening of the nature corridor, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said it would improve the experience along the Coast-to-Coast trail, which stretches from Jurong Lake Gardens to Coney Island Park.\n“Residents around the area, as well as users of the trail can look forward to using the corridor as a green route between MacRitchie Reservoir Park and Adam Road,” he said.\nIt will also link up with Kheam Hock Nature Way to form an ecological corridor connecting the Central Catchment Nature Reserve to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, he said.\n“It will allow our native biodiversity to move easily between these key habitats and help to strengthen their populations,” Mr Lee added.\nThe rewilding efforts involve a “curated planting palette” of native trees, shrubs and wildflowers, as well as some common and naturalised wildflowers, NParks said.\nSome native tree species planted at Lornie Nature Corridor include the Jelutong, Singapore Durian and Red Dhup, it said.\n“The planting verges on both sides of the road and other pockets of greenery are planted up with more than 100 species of trees and shrubs in a multi-tiered manner that mimics a rainforest,” said the agency.\n“In time, this will result in a forested corridor when the planting matures, restoring nature into the highly urbanised area.”\nREWILDING PLAN TO BE ROLLED OUT AT 32 NATURE WAYS\nSingapore’s “Rewilding Plan” will be rolled out progressively at 32 stretches of “nature ways” and along roads, as well as various habitats in parks and green spaces over the next three years, NParks said.\nA key part of the country’s “City in Nature” vision is introducing more naturalistic landscapes, which attract biodiversity, encourage ecological connectivity and enhance stability, the agency said.\nThe “rewilding process” is one way to achieve this, it said.\nNParks added that the recent COVID-19 “circuit breaker” period provided a unique opportunity for its horticulturalists to observe how such naturalistic landscapes fared.\n“Coupled with the encouragement and support from members of the public who expressed appreciation for such landscapes and its accompanying fauna such as butterflies, this affirmed NParks’ direction to introduce more naturalistic landscapes in selected areas across the island through a Rewilding Plan,” the agency said.\nUpcoming rewilding sites include those along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, Kheam Hock Road, Old Choa Chu Kang Road, and Upper Thomson Road, and in parks such as Bedok Reservoir Park and Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, NParks said.\n“We will allow vegetation to grow naturally at these sites to support ecological connectivity. The native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers will provide lush and beautiful greenery for the public to enjoy,” Mr Lee said.\n“We will also selectively prune and remove undesirable plant species that are more prone to fire and storm risks. This approach allows us to manage our landscapes in a more sustainable manner that better supports biodiversity, while continuing to ensure public safety.”\nTENSIONS BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION\nMr Lee noted that the nature corridor was the result of reclaiming part of the old Lornie Road, made possible by the completion of Lornie Highway.\nHowever, the construction of Lornie Highway also affected part of the Bukit Brown Cemetery, he said.\n“As many of you might remember, this brought to the fore tensions between development and conservation. We had to grapple with trade-offs between improving our transportation networks, providing amenities for Singaporeans\xa0and conserving our heritage and biodiversity,” he said.\nThese difficult issues opened up conversations and allowed stakeholders to “deepen the partnership” between the Government and civil society groups, Mr Lee said.\nIt resulted in government agencies working with heritage groups and volunteers to document and commemorate Bukit Brown Cemetery, he added.\n“We will continue this spirit of collaboration through our greening efforts at the Lornie Nature Corridor,” Mr Lee said, with community members partnering NParks to plant trees at the corridor as part of the One Million Trees movement.\n', 'related_topics': ['     NParks ', '     environment ']}"

      ‘Reclamation is everywhere, we are stranded’: Ancol expansion a divisive issue in Jakarta
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: “It is so hard to earn a living as a fisherman today. Years ago, my wife and children never had to ask me to make more money because it was enough. This area used to be wide open. We could fish and get paid. But not anymore. Reclamation is everywhere, we are stranded.”\nAlthough Jakarta is a coastal city, this does not necessarily translate into ample opportunities for those in the fishery industry. Zabeni, 55, who goes by one name, has been fishing for over 40 years, but he has only now realised that the glory days for small fishermen like him might already be over.\nThe reclamation that Zabeni refers to are islets of sand in Jakarta Bay that were built as part of a 17-island deal worth US$40 billion. The plan was abandoned in 2018, following Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan’s campaign promise to cancel the project.\nBut by then, four islets had already been built. Although further reclamation has been halted for now, the project is still a big problem for fishermen like Zabeni and other local residents.\nNow, the expansion of the Ancol recreation area, which involves reclamation, has sparked further concern on the ground.\nWhile the city government said that the project will help prevent flooding and result in the development of a premier tourist attraction, fishermen and activists fret about their livelihoods.\nRECLAMATION A POLITICISED ISSUE\nThe plan to reclaim land in Jakarta Bay can be traced back to the late 1990s. Small reclamation projects had been happening for years before, but in 1995 then-president Soeharto agreed to a proposal to build large scale residential and commercial facilities.\nAlthough the mega project was eventually stalled for decades, smaller reclamation has been happening around the shoreline. Resulting in newly developed areas such as Pantai Indah Kapuk and Pantai Mutiara.\nPublic opinion has fluctuated over the years. It turned against the project during the Jakarta gubernatorial election in 2017, when\xa0Baswedan pledged to cancel the 17-island project.\nMany middle-to-low income residents in the area see the land reclamation project as just another megadevelopment that they won’t benefit from. Besides the fishermen who have lost their access route to their fishing grounds, many fear that development in the area will push them out of their homes.\nIn February 2020, Baswedan, now the city governor, appears to have reneged on his promise, by issuing a new permit for ‘land expansion’ near the lucrative and privately owned entertainment complex in Ancol, which the government is a majority shareholder.\nThe reclaimed land, near the four islets that have already been constructed, will house attractions such as a theme park and a museum dedicated to Prophet Mohammed. The latter is touted as the biggest museum dedicated to the prophet outside Saudi Arabia.\nThe Ancol expansion will make it the biggest and the best tourism attraction in Asia, Baswedan reportedly said.\nHe also said that the 155 ha reclamation project would use excavated soil and mud from 13 rivers and 30 dams as infill. In other words, the excavated soil is being put to good use.\nDespite these assurances, the project has led to disquiet on the ground.\nMartin Hadiwinata, a member of the Save Jakarta Bay Coalition, voiced his concerns about the reclamation. “Our only information about this new plan is from the media. Although the decree was issued in February, the public was only informed in May. There has been no communication with us regarding this project. Months have been wasted,” he said when interviewed by CNA.\nAccording to Hadiwinata, many feel cheated, especially those who campaigned against the original reclamation plan in 2017.\nHe perceives the Ancol expansion as a ""discount""\xa0from two of the previously cancelled islands.\n“This is K and L,” Hadiwinata said, referring to islands from the original 17-island plan.\n“The one on the West is exactly like the K Island while the one on the East is the L Island, only smaller. It used to be bigger, but now the plan is only for 120 hectares.”\nHadiwinata insists that this is a reversal of policy from the government and a broken promise from the governor.\nPLAN WILL HELP REDUCE FLOODS IN THE CITY: GOVERNOR’S OFFICE\nFrom the perspective of the Jakarta City government, however, the Ancol plan is unrelated to the original development of 17 islands.\nIrvan Pulungan, an advisor for the governor’s office of shoreline management, said that the land expansion\xa0is part of a plan to reduce flooding in Jakarta and remove\xa0sedimentation from rivers.\n“We already have around 20 ha\xa0of land in the area, from the Jakarta Emergency Drainage Initiative program,” said Pulungan. According to him, this land is intended for public use, hence the ‘land expansion’ project in Ancol.\nThe Governor’s office has acknowledged the backlash from the public but insists that the plan is a requirement for the city’s flood prevention program. It claims that the public misinterpreted the decree issued in February.\n“We cannot just stop moving the sediment to Ancol. It has started to rain here in Jakarta. It is going to flood soon, and we need to handle that. There is no other place to dump the sediment.”\n“We are still in the process of studying and researching what to do with the sediment that we have from the rivers in Jakarta. We can build museums or mosques there, but we are still researching. We have a plan to open a dialogue with impacted locals and concerned citizens,” Pulungan told CNA.\nAccording to him, if the research shows that the impact on the environment and the economy of the people in the area is too great, they can cancel the land reclamation. But in the meantime, the flood prevention programme in the city already produces sediment that they need to manage.\nThe developer\xa0for the Ancol project did not respond to requests for comments.\nPOTENTIAL HARM TO MARINE LIFE, FISHERMEN MARGINALISED\nFor the sediment to be utilised as land, however, it needs to be mixed with other materials, and some might be harmful to marine life in the area.\nTarsoen Waryono, an environmental expert working in Jakarta, has his reservations too. “A lot of extra material needs to be added to the existing mud from the rivers, especially if you want to build something on it. Even if you only plan to plant vegetation on the land, you still need to add materials,"" he said.\n""This is a reclamation project. The purpose of reclamation is to convert a previously unusable area, to usable land, and that is the Governor’s plan.”\nAccording to Waryono, the reclamation will further harm sea life in the area, which is already under a high amount of stress from the waste that is dumped into the sea.\n“When you put foreign materials in the sea, sea life must adapt to them. The worst scenario is they will die or flee.”\nThis situation is not only harmful to the local sea life, but to those whose livelihoods depend on it, like the fishermen.\nIn recent years, fishermen have already found it increasingly difficult to fish in Jakarta Bay. Their small boats can only operate near land, due to the risk of capsizing.\nThe government has tried to persuade them to fish further from the shore, but the fishermen lack the capital to afford the fuel costs to operate bigger boats, forcing them to stay near the shore.\nTo make ends meet, Zabeni and his fellow fishermen have resorted to other activities, including diving to find clamshells, and making salted fish from smaller catches.\nHadiwinata, who works closely with the fishermen, claimed that the fishermen have been vilified by the developer, even though they are dependent on the sea.\nThe fishermen said that even though their only demand is a route to their usual fishing grounds, some developers have refused to grant them access.\n“The fishermen are marginalised, and they should get fair treatment from this, more than those who are already privileged. The developers need to consult with them, and find a way out that benefits all parties involved if the plan needs to happen,” he said.\nHe added that in a developing city, change must happen. But how it happens must also be discussed.\xa0\nWaryono said:\xa0“It is perfectly fine to continue the development, but there are some conservation rules we need to obey. Not just any material will work on the shore. It needs to be similar to the materials you usually find there.”\nHe also said it would also be safer to plant mangroves rather than focus on seawalls.\n“Twenty-five per cent of the area should be dedicated to mangroves. Sometimes, developers plant whatever they want on the reclaimed land. It is harmful to the ecosystem. They should plant vegetation that can thrive on the coast, like cypress, casuarina, and mangroves,"" said Waryono.\nThe environmental expert\xa0also believes that the project lacks a proper legal footing. A provincial-level decree from Baswedan, the city governor does not mean that the project can ignore national environmental laws, he said.\n“The government should have followed the national law on shoreline management in approving the permit needed for the land expansion in Ancol. This way, the developer is obliged to highlight conservation of the ecosystem,” he said.\n“The shore needs to be protected, because it holds our land together. But right now, the sole purpose of reclamation is business.”\nFor the fishermen, all they can do now is to bear with the situation.\nSuryanto, who moved from Surabaya to Jakarta to become a fisherman in 1991 said: “The sea is where we live. When you fill it with land, our space shrinks more and more.”\n“And there is no way to negotiate with them. Even when all we ask for is just a clear route to go to our fishing grounds. Small fishermen like me need that route. At least let us through before a dock is built,” he added.\nSuryanto, who goes by one name, added: “I don\'t know what to do anymore. That\'s the government for you. We have asked again and again. They even moved our leaders around, so the movement died down.”\n“We are powerless. No matter who we talk to, it is all the same for us.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     environment ']}"

      Dua pengusaha wanita Indonesia ini mengubah plastik yang sulit didaur ulang menjadi batu bata
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Sekilas, pabrik batu bata seluas 1,000\xa0meter persegi yang terletak di pinggir jalan yang sibuk di Jakarta Selatan ini terlihat seperti pabrik-pabrik kebanyakan.\nDi pelatarannya terdapat tumpukan konblok\xa0dalam berbagai warna, ukuran dan bentuk – mulai dari segi enam dan\xa0segi delapan sampai persegi panjang – yang siap untuk dipasarkan.\nKonblok-konblok juga terpampang di parkiran pabrik itu, diatur sedemikian rupa untuk\xa0menunjukkan kepada pelanggan beragam pola pemasangan bata yang tersedia.\xa0\nDi dalam pabrik yang dinaungi oleh atap baja yang menjulang setinggi 10m\xa0itu terdapat beberapa mesin pengaduk semen dan mesin pencetak bata.\nNamun, ada sesuatu yang membuat pabrik Rebricks berbeda dari pabrik kebanyakan. Di satu bagian pabrik itu terdapat limbah\xa0rumah tangga yang menggunung dan puluhan karung berisikan plastik\xa0yang tercacah halus.\nDalam setahun terakhir, Rebricks telah memproduksi bata beton\xa0dari plastik\xa0multi-lapis yang kerap digunakan sebagai kemasan bermacam-macam makanan dan kebutuhan sehari-hari, mulai dari kopi instan, kudapan dan\xa0kue, sampai deterjen, sampo dan sabun cair sekali pakai.\nKemasan-kemasan ini dikenal sulit untuk didaur ulang karena terbuat dari pelbagai\xa0jenis plastik\xa0dan kertas aluminium. Biasanya, kemasan-kemasan plastik ini langsung dibakar, dibuang ke tempat pembuangan akhir atau mencemari sungai dan lautan.\n“Enggak\xa0ada yang mendaur ulang \'multi-layered\'\xa0plastik semacam ini. Soalnya susah untuk memisahkan plastik dan kertas aluminium supaya bisa didaur ulang dan prosesnya mahal. Makanya pendaur ulang enggak\xa0mau berurusan dengan (plastik) semacam ini,” kata salah satu pendiri Rebricks,\xa0Ovy Sabrina, kepada CNA.\xa0\xa0\n“Sebenarnya seram sih. Artinya kan dari semua makanan yang kita konsumsi, kita menciptakan sampah-sampah yang akan langsung ke tempat pembuangan akhir dan mereka enggak akan terurai walau sampai puluhan tahun. Bahkan, setiap ada program pembersihan pantai 50 persen sampah yang terkumpul ya sampah-sampah kemasan kayak begini.” \xa0\nOvy dan mitra bisnisnya,\xa0Tan Novita, pun bercita-cita untuk mencari cara mendaur ulang plastik-plastik kemasan seperti ini.\n“Kita memilih bahan bangunan karena keluarganya Ovy punya pabrik bata \'paving\'. Jadi kurang lebih kita sudah punya pengalaman dan sumber daya untuk membuat bata daur ulang. Jadi nggak benar-benar dari nol,” kata\xa0Novita\xa0yang juga teman lama\xa0Ovy\xa0kepada CNA.\nPROSES EKSPERIMEN YANG PANJANG\nMeskipun keluarga Ovy sudah mempunyai pengalaman dan peralatan yang dibutuhkan untuk menghasilkan bata konvensional, memproduksi bahan bangunan dari plastik multi-lapis ternyata tak segampang yang diduga\xa0mereka.\n“Kayaknya kita sudah coba 100 metode\xa0dan formula yang berbeda. Proses \'trial\' dan \'error\'-nya\xa0satu tahun setengah. Ada saat-saat kita sudah kayak mau menyerah,” tambah Novita.\nPada awalnya, Rebricks bereksperimen dengan melelehkan plastik multi-lapis dan mencetaknya menjadi batu bata.\n“Tetapi prosesnya itu ngehasilin asap yang berbahaya. Prosesnya juga rumit sampai-sampai kita cuma bisa memproduksi 2 meter persegi bata per hari,” kata wanita berusia 35 tahun yang dulunya pernah bekerja di sebuah lembaga swadaya masyarakat ini.\nNovita dan Ovy lalu mencoba memproduksi bata dengan mencampurkan plastik yang sudah dicacah dengan semen, tetapi produk yang dihasilkan mudah\xa0hancur dan menghasilkan ceceran plastik yang dapat mencemari tanah.\nAkhirnya, mereka mencoba membuat konblok\xa0berlapis\xa0dua. Lapisan atas yang\xa0kerap berhubungan dengan kendaraan, pejalan kaki dan unsur-unsur cuaca dibuat sepenuhnya dari beton, sedangkan lapisan bawah dibuat dari campuran semen dan sampah plastik.\nNamun, mereka masih harus menemukan komposisi sampah plastik dan semen yang tepat agar bata-bata yang dihasilkan kuat, tahan lama, tahan api dan ramah lingkungan. Bata-bata mereka juga harus mampu menahan beban 250kg per sentimeter persegi, sesuai dengan standar Indonesia untuk konblok yang dapat digunakan di parkiran, trotoar, taman serta jalur \'jogging\'.\nUntuk memenuhi kriteria-kriteria ini, keduanya pun membuat puluhan prototipe yang kemudian diuji\xa0di laboratorium.\n“Kita sering banget ke lab sampai\xa0teknisinya kayak sudah bosan ketemu kita,” kata Novita. Rebricks, tambahnya lagi, telah menghabiskan puluhan juta rupiah untuk menguji coba pelbagai purwarupa yang dihasilkan mereka.\nPada bulan November 2019, setelah satu setengah tahun bereksperimen, Rebricks akhirnya meluncurkan rangkaian produk konblok mereka.\nRebricks akhirnya\xa0harus berkompromi dengan\xa0mengurangi jumlah sampah yang bisa diserap dalam produksi bata-bata mereka agar mutu dan daya tahan produk itu\xa0dapat terjaga serta dengan\xa0harga yang bersaing.\n“Sekarang, \'paving block\' kita isinya 20 persen sampah. Penginnya sih bisa lebih banyak (sampah), tetapi kita harus mikirin kualitas dan ongkos produksi. Tetapi kita akan tetap berinovasi dan meningkatkan persentase\xa0(sampah yang terserap),” kata Ovy.\nNovita menambahkan meskipun dengan persentase\xa0yang masih terbilang kecil itu,\xa0Rebricks telah mampu mendaur ulang 88,000 potong sampah kemasan setiap harinya.\nSAMBUTAN ""LUAR BIASA"" MASYARAKAT \nSetelah Rebricks resmi meluncurkan produk mereka, kedua pendiri perusahaan ini langsung mencari-cari orang yang mau mengirimkan sampah-sampah mereka sebagai bahan baku produksi.\nMereka pun mendirikan tiga titik pengumpulan sampah, dua di antaranya di Jakarta dan satunya lagi\xa0di Serpong, Banten.\n“Responnya luar biasa. Banyak banget yang mengirim sampahnya ke kita. Kita sebenarnya \'amazed\' sih orang mau repot-repot memilah sampah dan mengirim sampahnya ke kita. Ongkos kirimnya kan enggak murah lho,” kata Novita.\n“Kita jadi sadar kalau orang sebetulnya \'care\' soal ini. Mereka cuma enggak tahu saja mereka harus mengirim sampahnya ke mana.”\nNovita mengatakan bahkan sebelum keduanya sampai di pabrik saat pagi hari, sudah banyak kiriman sampah yang sudah menunggu.\n“Kalau sudah sore ini kantor bisa penuh sampah,” katanya.\n“Tetapi kita enggak bisa terima banyak-banyak. Kita kan baru, jadi \'demand\'-nya juga masih sedikit. Karena pandemi ini konstruksi juga lagi lesu, sedangkan konsumsi orang meningkat dan otomatis sampahnya juga meningkat karena orang lebih banyak di rumah.”\nOvy menambahkan bahwa pandemi COVID-19 ini juga membuat Rebricks kesulitan memasarkan produk mereka.\n“Bahkan selama \'lockdown\', pabrik kita tutup. Kita juga enggak bisa keliling dan ketemu calon klien, tetapi syukurnya demand kita semakin meningkat\xa0meskipun kondisinya kayak begini sekarang,” katanya.\nOvy mengatakan di bulan-bulan awal berdirinya Rebricks, mereka hanya mampu menjual batu bata sebanyak 12 meter persegi kepada pembeli perorangan yang ingin menata ulang taman dan pekarangan mereka, tetapi lambat laun penjualan mereka meningkat melalui percakapan mulut ke mulut dan media sosial.\n“Sekarang kita bisa menjual 100 sampai 200 meter persegi sebulan. Itu masih jauh dari kapasitas produksi kita yang 100 meter persegi setiap hari, tetapi kita bersyukur setiap bulan permintaan kita lebih besar dari bulan sebelumnya,” katanya.\nRebricks juga sudah mulai mendapat perhatian dari perusahaan dan pengembang besar.\n“Kita sudah kerja sama dengan perusahaan produsen makanan. Mereka mengirimkan sampahnya ke kita, kita daur ulang jadi \'paving block\' dan hasilnya mereka beli lagi buat dipakai program CSR (\'corporate social responsibility\' atau tanggung jawab sosial perusahaan) mereka,” tambah Ovy.\n“Kita lagi \'explore\' kolaborasi-kolaborasi kayak begini, supaya kita bisa menjual dan mendaur ulang sampah lebih banyak lagi.”\nTERUS BERINOVASI \nOvy mengatakan Rebricks sedang mengembangkan lebih banyak pilihan produk bahan bangunan. Salah satunya adalah batako yang biasa dipakai sebagai dinding luar maupun interior bangunan.\n“Untuk batako kita bisa mendaur ulang lebih banyak sampah karena standar kekuatannya lebih rendah dari \'paving block\'. Kita juga enggak perlu takut batakonya hancur dan sampahnya jadi tercecer\xa0karena batako itu biasanya diplester lagi dengan semen,” katanya.\n“Kita sudah tes sampel (batako) dan hasilnya bagus. Sekarang kita tinggal tes produk akhirnya, tetapi sekarang labnya tutup semua karena COVID-19. Mudah-mudahan tahun depan kita sudah bisa \'launching\' produk batako kita.”\nOvy mengatakan Rebricks juga sedang mencari cara meningkatkan mutu konblok\xa0mereka agar dapat menyerap lebih banyak sampah.\n“Kita pengin Rebricks bisa menjadi solusi bagi permasalahan sampah kita sekaligus solusi bagi orang-orang yang mencari cara membangun bangunan mereka secara \'green\' dan \'sustainable\',” katanya.\nArtikel ini diterjemahkan dari Bahasa Inggris.\nBaca juga artikel\xa0Bahasa Indonesia yang satu ini.\nIkuti akun CNA di\xa0Facebook\xa0dan Twitter\xa0untuk membaca artikel-artikel terkini.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Two women entrepreneurs turn hard-to-recycle food packaging into paving bricks in Indonesia
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: At first glance, the 1,000 sq m property situated on a bustling Jakarta street looked like a regular brick making factory.\nThere were stacks of paving bricks of varying colours, sizes and shapes – hexagonal, octagonal and rectangular – sitting on its front yard, ready to be shipped.\nIts car park showcased\xa0the factory’s best products, intricately placed to demonstrate the many possible interlocking patterns and arrangements.\nInside the open-air factory, shaded by a metal sheet roof suspended 10 m\xa0up in the air, were large concrete mixers and brick-making hydraulic presses.\nBut what makes Rebricks factory different is the mountain of domestic waste at one section of the property and the sacks of finely shredded plastics in\xa0another corner.\nFor the last one year, Rebricks has been making paving bricks out of multi-layered plastic, which is used to package everything from instant coffee, snacks, cookies to single-use shampoo, detergent\xa0and liquid soap.\nThese empty packets, which comprises layers of different plastics and aluminium foil, are known for being difficult to recycle. They are\xa0usually sent straight to landfills and incinerators, or end\xa0up polluting rivers and beaches.\n“No one is recycling these multi-layered plastics. It is too difficult to separate the different kinds of plastics and aluminium foil so each can be recycled and the process can be so expensive that recyclers don’t want to deal with them,” Rebricks co-founder Ovy Sabrina told CNA.\n“It is quite scary actually. This means that with every food we consume, we are creating waste which will go straight to landfills and will not degrade for decades. In fact, 50 per cent of the trash found in beach clean ups are this packaging.”\nSabrina and her long-time friend Tan Novita were determined to find ways to recycle these discarded packets.\n“We chose to make building materials because Ovy’s family owns a paving brick making factory. So, to some extent, we have the knowledge and resources to start producing recycled bricks and not start our business completely from nothing,” the other co-founder Novita told CNA.\nTRIAL AND ERROR\nBut despite having the experience and machinery\xa0necessary to make conventional concrete bricks, producing the construction material out of multi-layered plastics proved to be a challenge.\n“We must have tried 100 different methods and formulas. It took us one and a half year of trial and error.\xa0There were moments when we felt like giving up,” Novita recounted.\nThe 35-year-old former NGO worker said that Rebricks first experimented by melting multi-layered plastics to create paving bricks. “But the process produces toxic fumes. It was also so complicated that we could only produce two square meters of bricks a day,” she said.\nThe pair then tried producing bricks completely out of cement mixed with shredded plastics. But the end product was in a paving brick which could easily crumble and left finely shredded plastics polluting the soil underneath.\nThey finally settled on creating bricks with\xa0two layers. The top layer – the one which comes into frequent contact with automobiles, pedestrians and the elements – is completely made out of concrete, while the bottom layer is produced out of a plastic and cement mixture.\nHowever, they still needed to come up with the perfect plastic and cement mixture which is durable, fire retardant and\xa0environmentally safe. The bricks must also\xa0withstand weight of 250kg per square centimetre,\xa0the Indonesian standard for paving bricks used in parking lots, pavements, parks and jogging tracks.\nThis meant building dozens of prototypes and sending samples to be tested in laboratories. “We went to the labs so many times, I think the technicians got tired of seeing us,” Novita said, adding that Rebricks spent thousands of dollars to test the many samples they produced.\xa0\nIn November 2019, after one-and-a-half year of experimenting, Rebricks finally launched its first line of paving brick products.\nRebricks had\xa0to make compromises, sacrificing the amount of trash they can compress\xa0into a single brick to gain structural integrity and keep prices competitive.\n“Today, our bricks contain 20 per cent waste. We wish we could put in more (plastic), but we have to consider our products’ quality and production cost. But we will continue to innovate and improve (the bricks’ waste) percentage,” Sabrina said.\nNovita added that although the percentage might seem small, Rebricks can already recycle up to 88,000 discarded food packets every day.\nOVERWHELMING RESPONSE\nAfter Rebricks’ launch, the two co-founders immediately got to work to find a steady supply of waste for recycling.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nThey set up three collection points, two in Jakarta and another in the city’s western suburbs Serpong, where people can send their discarded plastic packets to.\xa0\n“The response has been overwhelming. We got so many people sending us their waste. We are actually amazed that people would go to the trouble of sorting out their trash and have them sent. It’s not cheap sending them here,” Novita said.\xa0\n“It makes us realise that people actually care about this issue. They just don’t know where to send their waste.”\nNovita said in the morning there will be trash waiting for them before they even open up the factory. “By the afternoon, our office will be full of waste,” she said.\xa0\n“But we can only take so much. We’re just starting and demand (for our bricks) is not that much yet. Because of the pandemic, construction has slowed and people’s consumption and thus waste\xa0produced increases because everyone is spending more time at home.”\nSabrina said the COVID-19 pandemic has also made it hard for the budding business to market its products.\n“We even had to shut down our factory because of the lockdown. We couldn’t go around and meet potential clients. But thankfully, demand is growing, despite the situation right now,” she said.\nSabrina said, in the beginning, they could only sell 12 sq m worth of bricks each month to individuals looking to refurbish their yards and gardens, but through word of mouth and social media, interest has been growing.\n“Right now, we can sell 100 sq m to 200 sq m a month. That is still far from our production capacity of 100 sq m a day. But we are grateful, every month demand is higher than the month before,” she said.\nRebricks has also attracted interest\xa0from corporate clients and big developers.\xa0\xa0\n“We have worked with one food manufacturing company. They send\xa0their waste\xa0to us, we convert the waste\xa0into bricks and they bought the bricks so they can use it for their CSR (corporate social responsibility) programme,” she said.\n“We are exploring this kind of collaborations so we can sell more bricks and recycle more waste.”\xa0\nFUTURE INNOVATION\nSabrina said Rebricks is exploring the possibility of recycling waste\xa0into hollow bricks which are used as building claddings and interior walls.\n“We can use more waste for our hollow bricks because the strength requirement is actually lower than paving bricks. We don’t need to worry about the bricks crumbling and causing waste\xa0to spill because these bricks are usually plastered in cement,” she said.\n“We have tested (hollow brick) samples and the results are promising. We just need to test the finished product.\xa0Because of COVID-19, the labs are closed. Hopefully, we can launch our hollow brick products next year.”\xa0\nSabrina said Rebricks is also trying to find ways to improve its paving brick products so they can incorporate more waste.\n“We want Rebricks to provide a solution for our waste problem and for\xa0people looking for a more sustainable and green way to constructing their buildings,” she said.\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Southeast Asia faces a number of energy-related challenges, but remains a ‘critical’ region: IEA
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Southeast Asia faces a number of energy-related challenges, but remains a ""critical""\xa0region, said International Energy Agency (IEA)’s executive director Fatih Birol on Tuesday (Oct 27).\n""Southeast Asia is very important in terms of energy, in terms of economy and ... from a geopolitical point of view, a very important part of the world,"" said Dr Birol in his opening address at the Global Ministerial Conference on System Integration of Renewables.\xa0\n“Sometimes, some of the observers do not understand the importance of Southeast Asia, that the\xa0region in fact deserves,"" he said.\xa0\nDr Birol also noted that when it comes to the growth\xa0of global energy demand, the region also has a “lion’s share”.\n“When you look at trends in terms of its share in the global energy demand growth, it has a lion’s share - very strong growth,” said the IEA chief, who attended the event virtually.\xa0\n“It is the very reason many companies around the world ... are very keen to work with the Southeast Asian countries, because (of) economic growth that comes from that very region.”\nAt the same time Mr Birol highlighted that Southeast Asia faces a number of energy-related challenges.\n“The region has - in terms of energy - many challenges. Air quality (is)\xa0a critical challenge. Emissions, CO2 emissions, (are) a critical challenge. Not being able to mobilise the investments in a timely manner for the energy sector (is)\xa0another important challenge,” he said.\xa0\n“But again, I want to highlight that this region is critical and IEA is doing everything we can, in order to highlight the importance of this region for energy and beyond.”\nSpeaking at one of the conference’s panel sessions, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said Singapore hopes to halve emissions to 33 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050\xa0and to achieve net zero emissions “as soon as viable” in the second half of this century.\nThis is part of Singapore’s long-term low emissions development strategy, he added.\xa0\n“To achieve this, the Singapore Government aims to transform all of our energy industries. We will actively and aggressively invest in research and development to harness renewable energy,” said Dr Tan.\xa0\n“We will increase decarbonisation, and we will pursue and leverage\xa0international collaboration such as yourselves, with the IEA, to develop our renewable energy potential.”\nIMPACT OF COVID-19\nIEA\'s\xa0Dr Birol also noted in his address that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, global energy demand this year will fall about 5 per cent.\n“We all still have the bitter memories of the financial crisis in 2008, 2009. At the\xa0time, global energy demands declined as well. But this year\'s decline is seven times larger than the decline we had during the financial crisis,” he said.\nDr Birol also noted\xa0the IEA expects global energy investments to decline about 20 per cent across the energy sector.\xa0\n“The only part (where) we don\'t see a decline in investment is renewable energies, mainly because they are getting strong support from governments, the government guarantees are in place,” he added.\xa0\nPanelists also touched on measures undertaken by governments and the private sector to enhance renewable electricity uptake and integration amid the COVID-19 economy.\nSecretary of Energy from the Republic of the Philippines Alfonso Cusi said one of the country’s energy industry’s main takeaways from the COVID-19 crisis is the importance of “energy security”.\xa0\n“One of the energy industry\'s main learning (points) from the COVID-19 crisis is the importance of energy security. The pandemic underscores the need for the energy sector to be resilient and flexible. The pandemic has also revealed the vulnerability of energy systems, that they could be interrupted,” said Mr Cusi.\xa0\n""This is why the Philippine government is looking at developing all possible energy sources, not just RE (renewable energy) to help the country become energy secure.”\nNoting that the pandemic is an opportunity for a developing country like the Philippines to review energy policies, he added: “I cannot overemphasise the need for integrating all sources of energy into our power mix. Our country is hungry for power\xa0and we must act immediately to bridge the gap in our supply shortage.\xa0\n“While we have initially embraced a technology-neutral policy, our periodic assessment of our country\'s energy requirements is paving the way for innovative adaptations in our policy directions. Among these is\xa0the opening of our geothermal and hydro sectors to greater foreign investment to further brighten the prospects of our early landscape.”\xa0\nPortuguese Minister for Environment and Climate Action João Pedro Matos Fernandes said the COVID-19 pandemic brought “additional reasons to pursue with renewed ambition” renewable energy and the country’s climate goals.\xa0\n“Energy systems are at the core of any recovery strategy. Nationally, regionally and globally huge stimulus packages are being designed and deployed, focusing on the creation of jobs and promoting economic development, hand in hand with environmental sustainability,” said Mr Fernandes.\xa0\n“There is no magic formula to achieve this, but we know that we need to innovate and facilitate investments in new and low carbon technologies, as well as energy storage and infrastructure. We are aware of the magnitude of the challenge but our best performance on renewables and greenhouse gas emission reduction gives us the confidence that we will succeed.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     energy ', '     Southeast Asia ', '     environment ']}"

      S$23 million in grants awarded to 3 power generation companies for energy efficiency projects
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A total of S$23 million in grants has been awarded by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to three power generation companies for energy efficiency projects that will reduce their carbon emissions, said the authority on Tuesday (Oct 27).\nThe three companies are Senoko Energy, Tuas Power Generation as well as YTL PowerSeraya.\nMaking the announcement at Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW), Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said the move is “just one aspect” Singapore is working on to achieve a cleaner and more efficient energy future.\nBut even as Singapore shifts towards other cleaner energy sources, liquefied natural gas (LNG) will continue to be a substantial part of Singapore\'s energy mix in the near future, he added.\n\n\n\nDr Tan noted that natural gas made up 26 per cent of Singapore’s energy mix in 2001, and has risen to 95 per cent today.\xa0\n“Yet it is only more recently, with the liberalisation of Singapore’s energy market and the commencement of operations of the LNG terminal in 2013, that we have been able to tap on LNG on such a large scale,” he added.\xa0\n“And since then, LNG has played a progressively bigger role in electricity generation and other industry needs. This is exemplified by how many power generation companies that have started using more efficient gas turbines, and how refineries and petrochemical companies have switched to LNG for their operations.”\n\n\nThese grants are part of the Genco Energy Efficiency Grant Call - under the enhanced Industry Energy Efficiency Package - that will co-fund up to 50 per cent of energy efficiency projects by power generation companies.\nThe grants awarded correspond to the carbon abatement achieved through the projects, subject to a cap of up to 50 per cent of the project’s qualifying costs.\nThe projects will be implemented between now and 2024, said EMA in a press release.\nWhen completed, the projects are expected to achieve an annual carbon abatement of over 30 kilo tonnes per annum. This is equivalent to taking about 9,200 cars off the roads annually.\n""Lowering our carbon emissions by promoting greater energy efficiency within our power generation sector is critical in our fight against climate change,"" said EMA chief executive Ngiam Shih Chun.\n""We are heartened by the power generation companies’ efforts to be more energy efficient and will continue working with them towards a more sustainable energy future.""\nEMA will launch the second run of Genco Energy Efficiency Grant Call in January 2021, in order to continue their support of power generation companies in ""improving their energy efficiency and lowering their carbon emissions"", it said.\xa0\nEnergy and the fuel sources used to generate it “forms the bedrocks” of an economy and powers it forward, said Dr Tan in closing.\xa0\n“LNG has proven to be such a bedrock. For the present and the foreseeable future, it will not only continue to play a substantial role in Singapore’s energy mix, it will also help the world address the challenges of climate change,” he said, adding that advancements in technology could also see hydrogen becoming a key energy resource.\xa0\n“However, to harness these resources, industries, organisations, and governments have to work together to plan and implement new strategies to ensure that today’s needs are met whilst addressing tomorrow’s challenges.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     energy ', '     EMA ', '     Energy Market Authority ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The National Parks Board (NParks) will plant 170,000 more trees in industrial estates over the next 10 years, nearly tripling the current tree population of 90,000, announced National Development Minister Desmond Lee on Monday (Oct 26).\xa0\nThese will come up to 260,000 trees by 2030, said NParks and JTC in a media release, adding that the trees will be planted in a “multi-tiered manner”.\nThe agencies said the aim is to cool these industrial areas, which are some of the hotter\xa0areas in Singapore, and improve air quality.\n""At the same time, this will create a more attractive and conducive work environment by bringing the therapeutic effects of greenery closer to people\'s workplaces,"" they said.\xa0\nAccording to Mr Lee, the trees will be planted along roads and will be made to resemble the ""look and feel of natural forests"".\n“(It will be a)\xa0planting regime that’s more intensive, that greens up the place more, beautifies it but also seeks to replicate some of the forest structures that we see.\n“They will also provide pedestrians with shade and respite from the heat,” said Mr Lee, who was speaking at a tree planting event on Jurong Island where he and other community partners planted a total of 100 trees.\nThis is part of the One Million Trees movement announced earlier this year, where NParks said it aims to plant one million trees in Singapore by 2030.\xa0\nNParks had also announced that it planned to plant 100,000 trees in industrial estates - now upped to 170,000 trees.\nMORE GREEN SPACES, ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS\nBy 2030, there will be 100ha of new green spaces, like parks and roadside greenery, in Seletar Aerospace Park, Punggol Digital District, Sungei Kadut Eco-District and Jurong Innovation District.\nThis, along with “intensive tree planting” under the One Million Trees movement, will mitigate the Urban Heat Island effect, said NParks and JTC.\nOne example of a newly added green space is the 3.2ha Hampstead Wetlands Park at Seletar Aerospace Park, opened in April this year.\n“Complemented by at least 10 hectares of roadside greenery, visitors are able to get closer to nature. The Wetlands Park has proven to be popular with visitors including residents from other parts of Singapore,” said NParks and JTC.\nNParks and JTC will continue to add green spaces, including at least 56ha of parks, park connectors, roadside greenery and Nature Ways - routes with specific plants to facilitate the movement of birds and butterflies -\xa0in Sungei Kadut Eco-District by 2030.\xa0\nThey will link the Sungei Kadut Eco-District to nearby green spaces, like those within the Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network and the Rail Corridor.\nMeanwhile, NParks will deploy a network of environmental sensors in the Jurong area, including Jurong Industrial Estate and Jurong Island, to collect data on ambient temperature, relative humidity and\xa0wind speed.\n“The data that will be collected through these sensors will support ongoing research projects, and help us to develop better greening strategies to cool our city,” said Mr Lee.\nThe tender for the environmental sensors will be called by the end of 2020.\nGREENING JURONG ISLAND\nSome of the 170,000 trees will be planted on Jurong Island by 2022.\xa0\nOut of the targeted\xa034,000 new trees on Jurong Island, nearly 13,000 have already been planted during the period between\xa0March 2019 and\xa0October 2020. When the remaining 21,000 trees have been added, the total number of trees on the island by 2022 will be 44,000.\n“Trees planted on Jurong Island are selected for their hardiness and drought tolerance, and ability to add shade, colour and vibrancy to the island,” said NParks and JTC.\nMore than 70 companies and organisations from the Jurong Island community have contributed to its greening, by donating around S$740,000 to support more than 2,400 trees on the island.\n“The close partnership we have here is a good example of how we can all become stewards of greenery and nature, for our homes, our neighbourhoods\xa0and our workplaces,” said Mr Lee.\n', 'related_topics': ['     NParks ', '     environment ']}"

      Native species, community engagement: Why there's more to planting trees than digging and watering
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Ms Nutan Shah sent soil flying as her\xa0cangkul came down in swift, sure strokes on the forest floor. In\xa0the hole she\xa0dug, she carefully placed\xa0a sapling, then\xa0re-filled the gaps with earth.\xa0\nThe final steps were\xa0to water the plant and leave a ring of dried leaves around it to act as fertiliser. It\'s hard work, but she\xa0has already planted about a dozen trees around Singapore and still\xa0can\'t get enough of this.\nMs Shah, who is in her 50s, said\xa0she felt ""rejuvenated"" as she worked up a sweat surrounded by trees. She\'s hoping that the trees will help reduce her carbon footprint and, in the long run, help lower\xa0the temperatures\xa0in Singapore.\n""I call them community babies - because it\'s obviously a community effort ... but secretly within my household, I say I planted them,"" she laughed.\nOn Saturday (Oct 24) afternoon, Ms Shah, two other volunteers and this reporter planted\xa020 saplings\xa0in Thomson Nature Park - with some support\xa0from National Parks Board (NParks) staff and two landscaping\xa0workers.\nWe were not the only group planting trees there this weekend. Park visitors on their Sunday morning walk around the park may not notice, but there are 100 new young trees taking root in the park.\nThat\'s just 0.01 per cent of the 1 million trees Singapore aims to plant over the next 10 years - an initiative announced in March this year by Mr Desmond Lee, then Second Minister for National Development.\xa0More than\xa060,000 trees have been planted thus far.\nThese trees will not only be in nature parks but will be found on streets and roadsides, along\xa0park connectors and in\xa0nature reserves.\xa0This will bring the number of trees in Singapore to more than 8 million.\nFOOD FOR\xa0LANGURS, AND OTHER ANIMALS\nAmong the 10 species of trees\xa0planted on Saturday was\xa0the critically endangered nephelium maingayi, a hairless relative of the rambutan, which has\xa0fruit that are delicious to the rare Raffles\' banded langur and other native wildlife.\nThe Raffles\' banded langurs are\xa0one of the endangered native animals which call\xa0the nature park, as well as the Central Catchment Nature Reserve it borders, home.\nThe seeds of the nephelium maingayi were first\xa0collected from the Nee Soon swamp forest and like the other native species that were planted on Saturday, it was grown at the Pasir Panjang Nursery before being transported to Thomson Nature Park on Saturday for transplanting.\n""They\xa0are all food plants for the Raffles\'\xa0banded langur,"" said\xa0Dr Adrian Loo, NParks group director, as he rattled off the scientific names of all the trees and their various characteristics.\nIt\'s part of NParks\' plan that the animals who eat the plants\xa0will\xa0then\xa0help spread the seeds of the trees throughout the forest, he added.\nAt other sites, volunteers have planted trees from the legume family - which can convert nitrogen in the air to a form that can be absorbed by plants - thereby naturally fertilising the soil.\xa0\nThe One Million Trees movement is not just a numbers game, he explained using these examples, there are multiple considerations when it comes\xa0to\xa0which trees to plant and\xa0where to plant them.\xa0\nThomson Nature Park, for example, used to be a village where the land was used for agriculture and there are many non-native plants, but volunteers and NParks staff members have been clearing invasive species from the area and planting more native species.\n""What we want to do is to let it\xa0approach a primary rainforest ...\xa0to\xa0plant native plants so that they can support native species, and also support the conservation of native\xa0plants ... for example the hairless rambutan,"" said Dr Loo.\nThere will be other considerations for planting trees in urban areas or park connectors.\nLIVING LEGACY\nJust a few steps away from where I helped plant the 20 trees, is a plot of forest that has been adopted by the Jane Goodall Institute Singapore and where 10 volunteers were planting another 30 trees.\nLast year, students and volunteers had already planted 80 trees at this plot of land.\nThe institute had plans to organise tree-planting trips for students and for them to collect data about the trees to track the trees\' growth and involve the children\xa0in research work. But the projects have been ""completely derailed"" by the COVID-19 pandemic, said Ms Tan Beng Chiak, a teacher and member of the institute.\n""There\'re so many species, you don\'t know what will actually do well\xa0and survive better here ... so I think it\'s a good learning process for everyone ... I hope that our children, and the students that we work with, will continue this legacy,"" she said.\nWhile student groups cannot return yet, a group of teachers and volunteers from the institute came on\xa0Saturday not just to plant new trees, but also to check on the health of the trees planted earlier.\xa0\nAfter planting the fresh saplings, the volunteers busied themselves clearing creepers and removing rubbish from the site which may interfere with the trees\' development.\xa0NParks staff members said that after the plantings, they will also monitor the rainfall and may return to water the saplings if the weather has been dry.\nMs Shah, budding tree enthusiast, said that she has been tracking her trees through NParks\' website, and all the volunteers\xa0said they will return to check on their trees.\xa0\nThe slots to plant trees have been\xa0snapped up quickly and the agency is trying to add more slots, said Dr Loo.\n""I have not met someone who said \'I hate this, this sucks\',\xa0they\'ll be like: \'Wow, I want to do more of this\',"" he said. ""They feel very proud because they planted a\xa0tree and they want to go back to that place and see how their tree grew ... Everybody has a stake in our greenery, in that sense.""\nMembers of the public can sign up to plant trees at the TreesSG portal.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     National Parks Board ', '     NParks ']}"

      Single-use plastic bags have ‘lower environmental footprint’ compared to paper and cotton bags in cities like Singapore: NTU study
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Scientists from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have found that\xa0single-use plastic bags have “a lower environmental footprint” compared to single-use paper bags and multi-use cotton bags.\xa0\nBut the study came with the caveat that the findings applied only to\xa0Singapore, and possibly similar cities, where incineration was part of the\xa0city's waste management structure.\nIn the study, the scientists conducted a life cycle analysis of five types of bags to evaluate the environmental impact\xa0associated with their production, distribution, transportation, waste collection, treatment and end-of-life disposal.\xa0\nThe study found that reusable plastic bags made from polypropylene non-woven plastic were “the most eco-friendly option”, followed by single-use plastic bags, said NTU in a media release.\xa0\nUsing plastic bags “may be the best option that is currently available” in cities like Singapore, said Assistant Professor Grzegorz Lisak, director of the Residues & Resource Reclamation Centre at the Nanyang Environment and Water Institute (NEWRI), who led the research.\n“Our main message is that reusable plastic bags are the best option, provided that they are re-used many times - over 50 times to be precise,” he added.\xa0\n“However, one surprising conclusion is that, in our model, in a single-use case, plastic bags, if treated properly afterwards, are less environmentally detrimental than the other types of bags in this study.”\nThe scientists found that the global warming potential of a single-use kraft paper bag was more than 80 times that of reusable plastic bags. Single-use plastic and reusable cotton bags that have been reused 50 times were found to have more than 10 times the global warming potential of reusable plastic bags that were reused 50 times. \xa0\nAccording to the study, a reusable plastic bag would need to be reused four times to offset the emissions equivalent to that of the creation of one single-use plastic bag.\xa0\nCotton and kraft paper bags have relatively bigger environmental footprints because of their “greater contribution to global warming” and “eco-toxicity potential in their production”, the study showed.\xa0\nThe production processes of cotton and kraft paper bags that consume “immense amounts of water and natural resources” are to blame for the relative negative environmental impacts, the study found.\xa0\n“Hence, improving the production methods, optimising resource usage, and following sustainable practices could in future favour the usage of bags made from cotton and paper.”\xa0\nAdding that it is essential to evaluate the implications “case by case” for dealing with plastic waste, Asst Prof Lisak said: “In a well-structured closed metropolitan waste management system with incineration treatment, using plastic bags may be the best option that is currently available, provided that there is no significant leakage of waste into the environment.”\nMODEL'S APPLICABILITY\nThe NTU team stressed that its model applied\xa0specifically to Singapore and may be applicable in cities like Tokyo, Hong Kong and Dubai. This is due to the model's focus on densely populated metropolitan areas that have waste management structures with similar end-of-life incineration facilities.\nFor Singapore, the scientists recommended that reusable plastic bags be used “to the greatest extent possible” to reduce the consumption of single-use plastic bags. Reprocessing single-use plastic bags would be “a good policy goal” to cut down on their environmental impact, they said in the release.\xa0\nBased on 2018 Singapore statistics, reducing the single-use plastic grocery bag consumption by half could prevent more than\xa010 million kg-CO2 equivalent emissions in one year, said Asst Prof Lisak.\xa0\nMoving forward, the team will be conducting further studies on plastic waste management, waste plastic upgrading and the development of new products, said NTU\xa0in the media release.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     NTU ']}"

      Jobs, mental health and the environment: What MPs said in the debate on Singapore's post-pandemic strategy 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A total of 22\xa0Members of Parliament (MPs) spoke\xa0on Wednesday (Oct 14) in response to Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat’s ministerial statement last week when he laid out a roadmap for Singapore’s post-COVID-19 economy.\nThey touched on a range of issues, from improving job security to supporting vulnerable groups and the challenges faced by residents working from home.\nHere is what some\xa0members of the House\xa0said about how the country can better respond to the COVID-19 crisis:\xa0\nHow to improve job security:\xa0\n“It is heartening that amidst depressing news of mass retrenchments and job losses, there are still many job openings to be filled … but perhaps MOM (Ministry of Manpower) could share more about … what are the targets set for successful job matches and how will the various agencies measure the effectiveness of outreach efforts.”\xa0\n- Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Saktiandi Supaat, who talked about how a resident told him that a career consultant said some employers are putting up job listings as a way to “test waters” but not actually hiring. This practice distorts job vacancy numbers, Mr Saktiandi said.\n“Why are Singaporeans losing out in the job market in our own country? Employers repeatedly cite the lack of creativity and risk-taking, not to mention poor communication skills as reasons for this. Our grade-centric education system was also cited as a contributory factor. In addition to facing competition for jobs from foreigners, we are increasingly facing competition from machines as well … with digitalisation accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is even greater urgency to hasten the pace of education reform as old methods of teaching and learning become obsolete.”\xa0\n- Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa\nMake mental health a priority:\xa0\n“An effort to improve mental health is not only good for the self but good for our country. Psychological defence is an underlying key pillar of our total defence and it will serve Singapore well when any Singaporean - even at their most mentally vulnerable - can trust that society at large will also have their back.”\xa0\n- Sengkang GRC MP Raeesah Khan on how Singapore can build on the new mental wellness task force created to address mental health needs amid COVID-19\xa0\n“In recent parliamentary sittings, I have repeatedly highlighted the challenges faced by our workers who telecommute. They must juggle multiple responsibilities, such as looking after children, taking care of elderly parents, and trying to remain productive at work. To make matters worse, because they work from home, their bosses think that it is easier for them to answer work-related calls and emails, at any time of the day, even after office hours. Workplace burnout has become an issue, as many employees are not well-rested.”\xa0\n- Radin Mas SMC MP Melvin Yong on why the authorities should look into a law on the ""right to disconnect""\nDon’t leave the vulnerable behind:\xa0\n“The S$500 to S$1000 top-up in SkillsFuture credit is useful to enable Singaporeans to take up new courses and for them to pick up new skills. However, there always remains groups of individuals like the low-wage workers and special needs communities who, even before COVID-19, have been unable to take up courses for personal upgrade. Their reasons for not doing so are varied. Some because they have to balance multiple jobs,\xa0others - caregiving duties, lack of funds, or lack of suitable courses catered to them in language or academic qualifications. They are left out from being able to upgrade not due to lack of will, but more a lack of time and the need to first survive.”\xa0\n- East Coast GRC MP Cheryl Chan on the people who lack the opportunity to upgrade their skills\xa0\n“I appeal to the Government and its agencies to make an additional effort to provide a better living and learning environment for the underprivileged children. In a knowledge-intensive future, these children will not stand a chance if they live in overcrowded flats with access to borrowed equipment, limited or slow connectivity, and minimal adult supervision and guidance. We may need to tighten our collaboration with the volunteer groups and private companies which are willing to sponsor and mentor these children as well.”\xa0\n- Chua Chu Kang GRC MP Don Wee on the need to help children from disadvantaged households during COVID-19\xa0\nHelp those who fall through the cracks:\n“They are often left on their own to deal with their unemployment and its many associated adverse effects. This is unlike those in lower-paying jobs who have benefited from the many government schemes. Specifically, many in this age group have high mortgages to pay, schooling children and elderly to look after. The challenge for them is not just to get any job, but one that gives them a minimal sustenance income.\n""It is well and good to say: \'Go for training, upgrade your skills.\' But realistically when you are in your 50s, 60s, with mounting bills and financial commitments, you don’t have the luxury of time and resources to pursue a new career. To them, such exhortations are meaningless slogans.”\xa0\n- Yio Chu Kang SMC MP Yip Hon Weng on how the pandemic has created new vulnerable groups, such as middle-income retrenched workers\xa0with heavy financial commitments\xa0\n“We want to make sure that Singaporeans and businesses who need help would not need to jump through hoops or wade through red tape to qualify for funding. For example, many staying in property with an annual value of more than S$21,000 but do not own the property and yet need some help, could not qualify for many of the COVID-19 support grants. Could MOF consider relaxing the criteria?”\xa0\n- West Coast GRC MP Ang Wei Neng also suggested that the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) could be extended for another six months - the last S$3,000 quarterly payout is in October - but be calibrated so that those who are currently ineligible for the scheme could get a smaller amount of money.\xa0\nKeep living cost affordable:\xa0\n“Here\xa0I\xa0would like to be very clear that I am not for their own during of resources built up by the blood, sweat and tears of the generations who came before us. In fact just as DPM has mentioned, I believe in the need to exercise prudence when planning for the future. However, we need to acknowledge that the current weak economic environment requires sufficiently accommodative fiscal policy instead of contractionary fiscal policies such as raising taxes on consumption, which might in turn lower consumer spending. We should be focusing on policies that aim to stimulate and boost domestic demand and keep our economy growing.”\xa0\n- Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua on why Singapore should hold off on a planned Goods and Services Tax hike\xa0\nLet’s not forget about the environment:\xa0\n“Sustainability at the forefront of economic recovery should not be underestimated. The World Economic Forum has in fact called on all countries to pursue, and I quote, \'a great reset. A great commitment to build a fairer, more sustainable and more resilient future following the COVID crisis.\'\xa0I can’t agree more - may I take the opportunity to ask the Government for an update on our efforts in the past seven to eight months since unity budget and for an assurance that Singapore is on track to meet our goals and timelines for the Paris Agreement (to cut emissions intensity by 36 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels).”\xa0\n- Hougang SMC MP Dennis Tan\n', 'related_topics': ['     parliament ', '     jobs ', '     environment ', '     mental health ']}"

      'We still have some way to go': MPs emphasise individual responsibility in maintaining public hygiene standards
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Baseline environmental sanitation standards will be mandated in premises such as pre-schools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres from mid-2021, following the passing of the Environmental Public Health Amendment Bill on Monday (Oct 5).\xa0\nSpeaking during the second reading of the Bill, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said: “We are overly reliant on efficient cleaning services. Public toilets in coffee shops and hawker centres are an area of concern and the cleanliness of bin centres and waste disposal areas need to be improved.”\nCiting a survey by the Singapore Management University, Ms Fu noted that one in five respondents thought it was acceptable to leave rubbish around if there was already litter in the area, and one in three\xa0believed that it is the cleaners’ responsibility to return trays.\xa0\n“Clearly, we still have some way to go to inculcate a strong sense of social responsibility in Singaporeans to do their part to keep public spaces clean,” she added.\xa0\nThe mandatory cleaning standards were first introduced in Parliament in March, during the Committee of Supply debates.\xa0\nThe implementation of the mandatory cleaning standards will start with\xa0premises with high footfall, immuno-vulnerable occupants or places with a history of outbreaks such as pre-schools, schools, youth and eldercare facilities, as well as hawker centres and coffee shops, said Ms Fu.\xa0\nThe\xa0standards will cover daily cleaning frequencies for high-touch surfaces such as toilets and lift buttons, and areas that are often neglected like bin centres, she noted.\xa0\nAreas that are not easily accessible and not covered by routine cleaning with have a pest management plan, and a cleaning and disinfection protocol, Ms Fu said. The standards\xa0will also specify desired\xa0cleanliness indicators to be achieved, and the tools and training needed for workers to carry out the cleaning effectively.\xa0\nManagers of high-risk premises will also have greater responsibility in ensuring that the environmental sanitation standards are met, she noted. With the support of trained environmental control coordinators (ECC) and environmental control officers (ECO), the managers will need to implement the relevant programmes developed for these premises.\xa0\nThe Government expects to train 3,800 ECCs from the first quarter of 2021, said Ms Fu, and a two-tiered\xa0framework will be introduced to produce “competent” ECCs and ECOs.\xa0\n“In general, premises such as a pre-school or coffeeshop will require an ECC while more complex or multi-tenanted premises will require an ECO, with a higher level of competency to coordinate efforts amongst different tenants within the premises,” she said.\xa0\n“This will provide a career progression pathway for ECCs to become ECOs, as they gain experience and upgrade their skills to take on more responsibilities.”\xa0\nThe National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a separate press release on Monday that it is “providing sufficient lead-time” for the various sectors to get ready for the new requirements before mid-2021, as the environmental sanitation regime impacts various sectors and a large number of premises.\xa0\n“An Environmental Sanitation Technical Committee was formed in August last year, comprising experts from the academia, industry, medical field and government agencies to develop a set of baseline cleaning guidelines for routine cleaning and disinfection of non-healthcare premises,” said the agency.\xa0\n“As different premises have different needs and requirements, since March this year, NEA has been working with various sectoral leads to translate the baseline cleaning guidelines into sectoral-level standards which are calibrated to each sector’s operational needs and constraints.”\nThe environment agency will guide the\xa0managers and the ECCs and ECOs in the initial phase of implementation as they develop and implement the programmes for their respective premises, it said.\xa0\n“NEA will highlight to the key personnel the improvements that need to be made, to ensure that the premises adhere to the baseline environmental sanitation standards and cleaning frequencies,” said the agency in the press release.\xa0\nThe ministry will also proactively regulate higher-risk aquatic facilities and aerosol generating systems, to manage risks from potential waterborne diseases outbreaks, added Ms Fu in Parliament.\xa0\nAquatic facilities include spa pools and water playgrounds, and aerosol-generating systems include cooling towers and decorative water fountains.\xa0\nAll swimming pools that are accessible by the public are already licensed by the NEA. Under the new amendments to the Act, aquatic facilities will also need to be licensed to similarly meet the chemical and bacteriological regulatory limits for water quality, said the\xa0agency in the press release.\nGRADING SYSTEM FOR TOILETS\nIn response to the Bill, Members of Parliament (MPs) Louis Ng and Cheryl Chan suggested a grading system for toilets, similar to the Singapore Food Agency’s (SFA) Food Hygiene Recognition Scheme.\nUnder the Food Hygiene Recognition Scheme, food establishments are given a grade based on the hygiene, which they have to prominently display.\n“While public toilets are already required to be cleaned at regular intervals, having an industry standard metric of assessment on the desired level of cleanliness could better align everyone and better achieve the aim of improving public health and hygiene,” said Ms Chan, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Sustainability and the Environment.\nThe East Coast GRC MP added that pegging the grading of public toilets to the premise manager’s ability in running the entire premise would “put some responsibility” on the operators in keeping up hygiene standards in public toilets.\nGoing a step further, the Government could consider linking the grading system to licensing durations and fees for coffee shops and hawker centres, said Nee Soon GRC’s Mr Ng, who is chairperson of the GPC for Sustainability and the Environment\nHe suggested that coffee shops and hawker centres that attain and maintain a minimum cleanliness grade could have “slightly longer” licence terms, or lower licence fees.\n“This provides incentives for premises that have done well, to keep up the good work, and for premises that have not done so well, to raise their standards,” he said.\nMs Fu said that while the ministry’s primary focus is to support premises in “achieving a set of baseline environmental sanitation standards”, SFA will introduce a new licensing and recognition framework for food establishments.\nThis framework will require them to have good track records for food safety and cleanliness. “Major lapses” in toilet cleanliness could affect their licence duration, meaning they could have to go through licence audits more frequently, she said.\nMORE TRAINING FOR THE CLEANING INDUSTRY\nSeveral MPs urged for better training and career support for cleaners.\nWith limited manpower, Chua Chu Kang MP Don Wee noted the need to help cleaners become “more efficient and productive”.\nHe pointed to the “useful” half-day cleaners’ training programme by NEA\xa0and the Restroom Association, seeking the ministry’s assurance that it will become a permanent training programme with refresher and upgrading courses.\nThe establishment of the ECCs and ECOs can be “a step towards” elevating essential workers and creating pathways for career development in environmental health, said Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin, adding that she hoped businesses would look inwards for talent to be nurtured.\xa0\n“I am unsure whether these roles, if fulfilled by part-time external workers, will have an actual effect on improving cleanliness standards,” she said.\xa0\nThe ministry could consider reducing training fees for businesses which send existing Singaporean employees to be upgraded and certified, she added.\xa0\nTampines MP Desmond Choo, who is also assistant secretary-general of NTUC, said that workers must be “paid fairly” to attract more to join the industry.\nBusinesses should adopt outcome-based procurement practices, with the Government giving recognition to companies which improve productivity by adopting technology.\xa0\nBusinesses and government agencies should award cleaning contracts to progressive employers who upskill and reward their workers, and ECC and ECO jobs should be seen as the pinnacle of the Progressive Wage Model for cleaners, he added.\nSengkang GRC MP He Ting Ru, who is from the Workers' Party (WP),\xa0said that the stigma associated with cleaning jobs as “unskilled” and “unimportant” could “lead to under-investment in the industry”.\n“This prevents the implementation of new technologies and digitalisation initiatives that would otherwise raise productivity and make such jobs less physically demanding on our older workers, but also removing some of the stigma associated with being a cleaner,” she said.\nIn response, Ms Fu said that the Government is upskilling workers in the cleaning industry.\nThis includes a new Place-and-Train Programme for cleaning specialists for disinfection services in August, and Continuing Education and Training courses on environmental infection control - with up to 90 per cent subsidy - for local cleaners and jobseekers.\nAll cleaning businesses have to offer wages under the Progressive Wage Model, and enhancements to the model have helped improve real median monthly gross wages of full-time residents cleaners, she added.\nPERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CIVIC MINDEDNESS\nMost MPs who spoke on the Bill stressed that public hygiene and health is still a matter of personal responsibility, and urged the Government to also introduce ways to cultivate civic mindedness.\xa0\nWP’s Ms He said: “Are we truly a nation where individuals take responsibility to ensure that our environment is clean and hygienic, or do we instead see it as someone else's problem? Do we make messes in our living environments and expect cleaners to do their jobs, and clean up after us?”\xa0\nSingapore must start developing “the type of social consciousness” for citizens to adopt a clean lifestyle, she added.\xa0\n“We could do so by having another look at our clean and green campaigns over the years to figure out what has been effective in the past. Have these campaigns overly emphasised fines, penalties and shaming for specific behaviours, with less regard to the reasons behind our actions, rather than address wider issues relating to shifts in awareness that everyone has a role to play in keeping our shared spaces clean?”\xa0\nYouth voices would be “extremely important”, and the young should be fully involved from the start, to drive home the message that Singapore’s reliance on cheap and elderly labour to clean up after the public “has to go”, said Ms He.\xa0\nNoting that the COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated Singapore’s dependency on foreign labour to keep the country clean, WP’s Raeesah Khan, also a Sengkang GRC MP,\xa0said: “Is this model sustainable? What happens if there's another situation that arises, where we don't have access to them.\xa0\n“We need to ensure that Singaporeans are empowered with a sense of ownership and civic mindedness towards our country. I worry that with more guidelines and thus potentially the hiring of more cleaners, we start relinquishing our responsibility and caring for the environment and the people we share our surroundings with.”\nMr Ng said the committee believes public hygiene is “everyone’s personal responsibility”.\n“While this Bill will help, we urge all Singaporeans to move away from the mindset that cleaners will be there to clean up after us. We should be a ‘clean’ Singapore”, not a ‘cleaned’ Singapore,” the Nee Soon GRC MP\xa0added.\xa0\nResponding to the concerns, Ms Fu noted that a slew of issues that were raised by the MPs in relation to the Bill, including pest control, tray returning, smoking and littering are all related to environmental public health.\xa0\n“These interrelated issues show that public health is multifaceted and the solution must also be multifactorial. This is why all users must play their part if we are to truly move the needle on public hygiene,” she added.\xa0\n“While the manager can keep his place clean and safe, individuals must take responsibility to maintain good personal hygiene. This is not just about safeguarding public health, but also about building a more gracious society.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment ', '     NEA ', '     National Environment Agency ', '     environment ']}"

      'When is the next flood?': Bangkok's canal communities fear they are living on borrowed time
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Bang Prathun is like a miniature water world. A spiderweb of canals splays out through a rare green landscape\xa0of coconut and fruit trees, alongside paths that connect an enduring community.\xa0\nThis place dates back to the late Ayutthaya period, or more than 200 years. Its people have lived around the water for generations and their fortunes have ebbed on the tides of the meandering Chao Phraya.\nWisdom has been inherited from the generations past; how water moves, how it drains and how it sustains.\nNow, as modernity creeps closer all around this patch of green, an outlier amid\xa0the grey of Bangkok’s sprawl, its residents wonder if their old knowledge can still keep them safe.\nIt is a challenge being posed to many of the Thai capital’s poorest communities, those living on the fringes - and often, around water. They are the most vulnerable. Bangkok has long faced the threat of flooding, but climate change is threatening to amplify the risks.\nNawin Meebunjong grew up here, exploring the intricate canals. “I’ve been here since I was little. I grew up with the water, swimming in the canal. I went to school by boat. I go to the market by boat. Everything involves water,” he said.\nIt was a moment of turmoil in his life that turned him from someone who took his home for granted, to one of its most passionate protectors.\xa0\nThe great floods of 2011 brought disruption and damage right across Bangkok, and Bang Prathun, with its close proximity to the major river artery of the city, was hard hit. At the same time, his mother was fighting a losing battle with cancer and had to be evacuated from her home due to the confusion and fear at the time.\n\n\nFor Nawin, it was a painful collision of momentous events. “The 2011 flood reversed the lives of many people, including me. It made me become interested in the canals and the things surrounding us,” the 44-year-old said.\n“After that, I changed my thinking from being a city office man to a community-concerned person. Why did I never take care of the things I had? If these things were gone one day, what would I do?\n“Like my mother. I did not have time to take care of her. I only made money and worked. Finally, when she passed away, it was too late to look after her. Like the canal. This is why I became interested in the canal. It’s also a mother, the mother of the water. The mother that we should look after,” he said.\nNawin became the founder of the Rak Bang Prathun group, which works within the community to educate local people and help preserve the environment.\xa0\nResidents have focused their efforts on\xa0maintaining traditional houses designed to withstand flooding, shaping drainage ditches to control the movement of water and retaining it through greenery and gardens.\xa0\nSimple ingenuity is built into the fabric of the community. It is a deliberate relationship synchronised with the water, rather than in conflict with a powerful element.\n“We don’t create brand-new wisdom. We only advance the ancient one to survive the flood. Living with it and bending to it,” Nawin said.\n“To live with it is to be harmonised. So we can live with nature. This is the approach to living with water. Nothing can conquer nature. Regardless of the approach we have, it’s merely an act of deferring, delay or control. But eventually, you can’t win.”\nWhether Bang Prathun can withstand future challenges is a question Nawin and his neighbours cannot answer. In many ways, their fate will be in the hands of others.\n""IT HAS LIFE""\nCanals are critical infrastructure for Bangkok. There are 1,161 in the city, including nine major ones. They act to drain extraordinary masses of water flowing from the north of the country into the Gulf of Thailand.\nThey form part of Bangkok’s polder flood defence system, which also includes tunnels, pump stations and retention ponds, known as “monkey cheeks”. Dykes around the city help redirect water away from the city, which is itself a natural floodplain, towards the sea.\nBangkok is located on low ground, land where floodwaters should naturally flow but in modern times has been built up to hold more than ten million inhabitants and major industries.\xa0\n“I used to see how the city grew\xa0over 50 years and you can see this big patch of concrete creeping out over the wetlands that used to be a channel for the river and how we drain our water from the north to the ocean,” said landscape architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom.\n“From the beginning, we built the city in the wrong place but we cannot return. So now it’s about finding the right solution and changing the attitudes of the people and changing natural disasters to be part of their living,” she said.\nThe city’s drainage system is ageing and underdeveloped. And climate change is already adding more stress to its capacity, at the same time as citywide subsidence raises the prospects of seawater intrusion.\n“Variations in the weather patterns lead to changes in rain. Rain becomes more severe and sometimes it rains outside its season. As a result, the existing drainage system is unable to bear the situation,” said Vishnu Charoen, the director of the Technical and Planning Division, at the Department of Drainage and Sewerage, part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA).\nIn innercity areas, localised flooding causes regular disruptions to people’s daily lives. It is a symptom of growing density in the urban environment. More people are living in the city, turning empty spaces into crowded ones.\xa0\nRapid development has pushed the city’s poor towards congested and increasingly undesirable retreats. Over time, those informal settlements came to be along the canals.\xa0\n\n\nWith a rise of pollution and neglect, many of the waterways meant to facilitate the flow of water have actually done the opposite.\n“People built houses encroaching on the canals, narrowing the canals and consequently reducing the effectiveness of the canals to drain water. When there is a flood, this group of people will be the first who face the flooding problem,” Vishnu told CNA.\nThe Lat Phrao canal is one of the main strategic channels in central Bangkok. It has been an area riddled with issues of land encroachment and rubbish accumulation and characterised by the thick black and fetid water lapping at the stilts of wooden houses creeping over the canal.\n“There are 7,000 houses along the Lat Phrao canal and 3,800 of them encroach on the canal. These houses, instead of helping water drainage, are obstacles,” said Thanat Narupornpong, assistant director of the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI), a government agency.\nTo defend the city from future flooding, the government has a variety of policies aimed to make the canals more effective. Key to that is widening them by an average of 10 metres and building flood defences, forcing many houses to be removed and their occupants relocated.\nThat has caused a natural and inevitable conflict with many of those who call the canals home.\xa0\n“All houses along and in the canals are all illegal because they are on land possessed by the Treasury Department. They did not get permission for construction,” Thanat said.\nCODI is making headway in a major resettlement and rehousing project at Lat Paro, which aims to consolidate all houses into safer, more modern dwellings further from the water, but generally in close proximity to the canal.\n“The challenge for the project is that some of them said they didn’t want to change their lifestyle. Not everyone agrees to move out,” Thanat said.\nTitapol Noijad was born in Wang Hin, one of dozens of communities that exist along Lat Phrao canal. He reminisces about the closeness of ties between neighbours, when growing rice and fishing in the flowing waters were still a daily reality in the area.\n“In the past, the canal was the centre of people’s lives,” he said. “The community used to be nice for people to stay. It had a\xa0sense of community and a hidden loveliness.\n“When I was child, I had a beautiful view here. But today I have to leave the community and go to a rural area to enjoy such beauty.”\n\n\nLife has changed forever here, as social connections fade and the worries about flooding - from the perspective of authorities and residents alike - become more prescient year on year.\xa0\nGovernment agencies are working quickly to unclog the waterway, and many residents are happy with being relocated to new houses. Work is ongoing to install flood defences but the results remain piecemeal.\xa0\nTitapol still holds onto hope that life on the canal will one day be as vibrant as it once was.\xa0\nPeople care about each other, he said, and they are ready to adapt in order to stay. As a community leader, he has invested in empowering locals to manage waste, share education campaigns and perform Buddhist rituals as a spiritual reminder of the water’s influence.\n“If there was only the canal, but no life, I think I would feel dejected. What we are trying to do is to make the canal alive,” he said.\n“It has life. The canal does not speak, but the people living there do.”\xa0\nCOMMUNITY AWARENESS\xa0\nInvolving canal communities in developing greater strategies for controlling the flood is crucial, according to urban architecture and planning expert, Asst Prof Wijitbusaba Marome from the Urban Futures and\xa0Policy Lab at Thammasat University,\nThere are complex forces at play, she says, from housing affordability and access, to communal understanding about what lies ahead. Their old knowledge and ability to adapt is important too - it should not be ignored, she says.\n“In the end, down at the local level, it’s about social acceptance and whether the community has awareness. Social acceptance requires time to communicate and portray how climate change will link to their everyday lives. So it’s an emergency,” she said.\n“We don’t really have holistic knowledge yet about how people can adapt and whether how they adapt can be enough to cope with future changes.\n“These low-income communities have faced flooding before so the question would be how future floods will be. We are also dealing with communities that have never faced flooding before. The question for them is, when is the next flood? There are no mechanisms to help them or talk to them about this,” she added.\nWijitbusaba also believes the government needs to produce a better “middle level” masterplan to link broad flood policies with local-level interventions.\xa0\n“I don’t think Bangkok is resilient yet. We are very good at mitigating floods. We have big policies to drain water from the lower Chao Phraya basin. We have a lot of construction policies. But resiliency is local,” she said.\n“The government\'s plans are not 100 per cent taking seriously\xa0the impacts of future climate change.”\xa0\nThe BMA admits there are budget restraints and plans must be prioritised. But Vishnu cites success in managing flood risks over the past half decade.\n“The problem we currently focus on is the water awaiting for drainage in Bangkok: how to drain the water to Chao Phraya River at the fastest pace,” he said.\n“Our goal is more rapid drainage every year. The evident figure is the number of flood risk areas. We decreased the number of flood risk areas from 22 areas in 2014 to 14 areas in 2020.”\nThe current Bangkok master plan is being used until 2023, from when a new strategy that better accounts for climate change is expected to be adopted. Mitigation remains the goal for the city, and if that fails, “we have to adapt to live with flood conditions”, Vishnu says.\xa0\nIt is a plan that faintly echoes the long-held beliefs of the people of Bang Prathun.\xa0\n“If we live in the way we used to, I will not be worried because I believe we have wisdom for living with water,” Nawin said.\n“If it changes, I will be worried because it’s beyond the wisdom that we have. We might need to invent another wisdom or advance it in order to fight with water.\n“If one day the situation goes beyond our capacity, we just escape. If we can\'t coexist, we have to escape.”\nAdditional reporting by Thanit Nilayodhin.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     Thailand ', '     Bangkok ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      NEA calls for bids to study turning landfill materials to 'treasure' to prolong Semakau's lifespan
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) has issued a call for proposals to study the feasibility of recovering mixed landfill materials, in a bid to prolong the lifespan of Semakau landfill.\nIf nothing is done, the 350ha\xa0landfill is projected to run out of space by 2035, said NEA in a media release on Friday (Sep 25).\n“The findings would enable us to better understand how we could extend the lifespan of Semakau landfill and avoid future costs of constructing another offshore landfill,” the agency said.\nThe feasibility study will look into how mixed landfill materials - incineration bottom ash and incineration fly ash from waste-to-energy plants, as well as non-incinerable waste from industries – can be recovered for other uses.\nThe study aims to understand the “physical and chemical properties” of the materials in the landfill that have “aged over time”.\n“The objectives are to assess the technical and economic feasibility of refreshing the landfill space through extracting the landfilled materials and finding suitable applications for the recovered materials, which could potentially be used as sand or aggregate replacement in various applications,” said NEA.\nUnder Singapore’s first Zero Waste Master Plan, the country plans to reduce waste sent to its only landfill by 30 per cent each day by 2030. About 2,100 tonnes of waste is transported to the Semakau landfill daily.\n“Reducing waste generation is crucial to extending Semakau landfill’s lifespan beyond 2035,” said NEA.\nStudies are also underway to turn incineration ash into construction material called NEWSand, which can be\xa0used\xa0in non-structural construction, such as road base and sub-base materials or aggregates in non-structural concrete.\nCEO of NEA Tan Meng Dui said: “We have seen the possibilities of using slag produced from (municipal solid waste), through a high-temperature gasification process, as a form of NEWSand that has been used to make concrete benches, a footpath in Tampines town and the new concrete plaza in front of the Environment Building.\n“NEA is spearheading R&D efforts to go even further, so as to truly close the waste loop for the range of end-of-life waste and residues ending up at Semakau landfill.\n“This R&D initiative seeks to develop safe and sustainable solutions to turn the trash dumped into a landfill, into treasure that will have new future uses.”\nSemakau landfill was formed by joining two smaller islands – Pulau Semakau and Pulau Sakeng – with a 7km perimeter bund enclosing part of the sea in between.\nThe world’s first offshore landfill was created entirely out of\xa0sea space and was opened in 1999.\n', 'related_topics': ['     National Environment Agency ', '     environment ']}"

      New Indonesian capital one year on: Land demand cools amid COVID-19, but speculators still hover
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: “Do you have land to sell?”\xa0\xa0\nThat was the million-dollar question in Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara last year following President Joko Widodo\'s announcement\xa0that the country’s capital would move from megacity\xa0Jakarta to the underdeveloped districts in East Kalimantan province.\nThe plan to move the capital was deemed necessary as Jakarta, a crowded and\xa0polluted city\xa0of 10 million people, has for years been battling traffic congestion which costs US$7 billion in economic losses each year.\nIt is also one of the fastest-sinking cities on Earth with experts predicting that it could be submerged by 2050 if current rates continue.\nPenajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kertanegara districts, on the other hand, are at minimal risk of natural disasters, the president said in his announcement\xa0and is geographically in the centre of the country where the government already owns about\xa0180,000 hectares\xa0of land.\nThe government\'s announcement last August led to a spike in demand for land parcels\xa0in the new capital site. But with the COVID-19 pandemic and delays in development, the\xa0demand appears to have\xa0cooled for now.\xa0\nThis being said, those interviewed by CNA noted that land around the capital site remains sought after and are seen as a sound investment for the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the government shifting its priorities, delaying the\xa0development of the 466 trillion rupiah (US$32 billion) project.\xa0\nNow, one year on, the new capital remains a plan on hold with the government asserting several times that it will still be developed when the time is right.\nIn this regard, land selling is not the talk of the town anymore.\xa0\n“Nobody is talking about land anymore, unlike last year when many people from out of town dined in my restaurant talking about it,” said Mr Eko, a restaurant owner in Penajam Paser Utara who like many Indonesians goes by one name.\nWhen CNA met Mr Eko at his diner last year, he said that all his customers talked about every day was land prices.\nMr Debi, a resident of oil city Balikapan about 80km east\xa0of Penajam Paser Utara, concurred.\nHe too\xa0witnessed a\xa0surge in the demand for land in his city last year, but said that the enthusiasm has abated for now.\nINVESTORS REMAIN SANGUINE: MINISTER\nAlthough there is currently no construction work in progress, Mr Suharso Monoarfa, the minister overseeing the new capital explained that the master plan is still being worked on.\n“The detailed plan will follow, then we will include basic infrastructure works in cities that will support the future capital of the country, for example, Balikpapan, Samarinda,” the national development\xa0planning minister told CNA in a recent exclusive interview.\nA highway has been constructed to connect Balikpapan with East Kalimantan provincial capital Samarinda. \xa0\nThe\xa0National Development Planning Minister\xa0also revealed that investors are still keen in\xa0the new capital.\n""There are still some investors, including domestic ones, who are still interested. And indeed they keep asking when it can\xa0start.\xa0\n""I think this is also important because, after COVID-19, the economic recovery will (focus on) investment\xa0destinations that promise high and fast capitalisation, one of them in Indonesia is the capital city project.""\xa0\nMr Monoarfa welcomed other countries to invest, especially fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian\xa0Nations (ASEAN).\n""In my opinion, because later it (the new capital) will also be a symbol of friendship in ASEAN, why should there be no legacy from ASEAN countries contributing to this capital city?""\nMr Monoarfa is hopeful that the new capital project can resume next year, once COVID-19 has been contained.\nSTRATEGIC ISLANDS NEAR EAST KALIMANTAN SOUGHT AFTER\nA\xa0recent case of alleged illegal land sale involving the Malamber islands near the\xa0East Kalimantan province, which was reported by local media, suggests that there are still people who are eyeing land in the region despite the uncertainties in the relocation timeline.\nThe Malamber islands case caught the attention of the authorities after it was reported in June that a man allegedly sold the 6.4 ha island for 2 million rupiah to the regent of Penajam Paser Utara, who is also a businessman.\nInhabited by about five families, Malamber is part of the Balabalakang island chain which technically is in West Sulawesi province, but closer to Balikpapan Bay and the coast of East Kalimantan.\nAccording to the Constitution, island sales and purchases are illegal in Indonesia as they belong\xa0to the state.\xa0\nWhile the alleged seller has since clarified that he had sold the land on the island and not the island itself, the local police in West Sulawesi are still investigating the case.\nThe lawyer of Penajam Paser Utara’s regent dismissed claims about his client\'s\xa0involvement and told CNA the regent does not know the alleged seller.\nMeanwhile, East Kalimantan coordinator of Mining Advocacy Network JATAM Pradarma Rupang, who has studied land ownership in large parts of East Kalimantan believed the Balabalakang island chain would be strategic if the new capital is\xa0developed.\n“Its location which is near to the new capital makes it an important route, especially for logistics in central and eastern Indonesia, and it would make it also a transit place,""\xa0Mr Rupang said.\nThe environmentalist claimed that the practice of buying and selling land, in general, is still prevalent in the area.\n“It (the pandemic) did not stop a number of businessmen from outside East Kalimantan to conduct land surveys in a number of villages in the district of Penajam Paser Utara and Balikpapan city,” Mr Rupang said.\xa0\nLAND OWNERS CONTINUE TO BE APPROACHED\nMr Sikbukdin, head of local tribe Paser Balik in Penajam Pasar Utara concurred.\nHe said that he still receives calls from people who are interested in buying his land.\n“Yes, there are still a lot of people but it is unclear who they are. They (claim to be) speaking\xa0on behalf of the National Development Planning Agency,” Mr Sibukdin said.\n“I replied saying the new capital is still unclear, it is impossible the National Development Planning Agency is looking for land on its own,” said the 57-year-old who does not want to sell\xa0his land.\xa0\nThe exact location of the new capital has yet to be revealed but many are betting on the sub-districts of Sepaku and Samboja, which are at the border of Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara.\nThe 57-year-old tribe head owns land\xa0in Sepaku, Penajam Paser Utara.\nSimilarly, another Penajam Paser Utara resident also revealed that he still receives many requests from interested land buyers.\nFarmer Hamzah, who regularly acts as a middleman between land seller and buyer noted\xa0that land price has not decreased despite the pandemic especially in sub-district Sepaku as land availability is scarce.\n“People just positively think that the new capital project will start next year,” he\xa0added.\nOriginally, the government planned to begin the construction of the new capital this year on an initial 40,000 ha plot of\xa0land and transfer the central administration functions to the new capital site\xa0by 2024.\nPROPERTY STILL A SOUND INVESTMENT\nOver in oil city Balikpapan, Mr Yoga Gunawan, the general manager of superblock Borneo Bay City, which comprises\xa0malls, offices, a hotel and apartments, said\xa0sales are\xa0relatively stable.\nWhen the president announced the relocation of the capital at the end of August last year, Borneo Bay City acted quickly and immediately published a full-page advertisement of its property in a national newspaper the following day.\nEven though there has reportedly been a\xa0decrease of 15 per cent in property sales in Balikpapan for\xa0the second quarter of 2020, Mr Gunawan is optimistic that the property remains a sound investment.\n“According to the latest information, the new capital will still be developed …\xa0The people of Balikpapan are still optimistic about the relocation of the new capital,” he\xa0told CNA.\nMr Ali Tranghanda, CEO of property consultant and advisor Indonesia Property Watch, added that demand for land and property in the area where the new capital is thought to be has slowed down, but the potential is still there.\n“The price of land is still stable with an overall correction of about 1 per cent to 3 per cent,” he told CNA.\nHe also asserted that in the long term, the potential of the market is still very high.\n“The plan (to relocate the capital) still exists, and there are parties which are sceptical about the big budget needed for the relocation.\n“However, the situation is not a result of technical things but due to the pandemic.”\nDespite the uncertainty, Mr Debi, the Balikpapan resident, is still hopeful the new capital will be realised soon.\n“If the new capital is in East Kalimantan it will boost the economy.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     East Kalimantan ', '     Jakarta ', '     environment ']}"

      More than 50,000 ‘new and upgraded’ jobs to be created over next 10 years amid sustainable development push: Grace Fu
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) expects to create 4,000 “new and upgraded jobs” in the next year and\xa055,000 over the next ten years as Singapore pursues sustainable development, said its minister Grace Fu on Thursday (Aug 27).\nIn an addendum to President\xa0Halimah Yacob\'s presidential address, Ms Fu noted that sustainability must be at the\xa0heart of Singapore\'s ""plans, policies and processes"".\n""Since independence, Singapore has pursued economic growth in tandem with social inclusion and environmental protection. This is the foundation for the green and liveable city that we enjoy today,” said Ms Fu.\n“However, we cannot take our success for granted. In a global landscape characterised by pandemics, climate change, and resource constraints, sustainability has become increasingly important.”\nSustainability is the principle that in meeting the needs of current generations, we should not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs, said the minister.\n“It has always been part of Singapore’s DNA. But we will push for it to be at the heart of our plans, policies\xa0and processes.""\nIn her address on Monday\xa0after 93 Members of Parliament (MPs) and two Non-Constituency MPs were sworn in at the opening of the 14th Parliament,\xa0Madam Halimah said that Singapore would make a ""major push for sustainable growth"".\n“We will reimagine how we plan our city, redesign urban mobility and grow using less resources in a low-carbon future,” she said.\xa0\nSingapore will also push for green financing and sustainable infrastructure development across the region, to ride on Asia’s growth while protecting the environment, she added.\nAs\xa0Singapore pursues sustainable development, a\xa0variety of jobs in the sector will be created, said Ms Fu in her addendum.\nThis includes\xa0skilled jobs in the high-tech agriculture and aquaculture industry, as well as the training of food hygiene officers who will serve as “food safety guardians” at food establishments, she said.\nRaising environmental sanitation and waste management standards will result in ""new good jobs"" for Singaporeans, said the minister.\nThe ministry also plans to review the Environmental Control Officer scheme to broaden the work areas for such officers beyond construction sites to more premises. This will create new opportunities for individuals like operations or facilities managers, said Ms Fu.\nShe noted that the ministry has also helped to support those affected during the current economic downturn, giving the example of how about 1,900 staff members from the aviation and hospitality industries were hired to work as safe distancing and SG Clean ambassadors.\xa0\nMore staff will also be hired for ""enhanced"" dengue management efforts, she added.\xa0\nThere are also plans to develop ""a pipeline of talent"" to support sustainability in Singapore, said Ms Fu.\nFor example, MSE will offer scholarships for people who are passionate about the ministry\'s mission in areas such as climate adaptation and climate science.\nPUSH FOR “GREEN RECOVERY”\nThe ministry’s name change - from the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources to the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment – likewise reflects a “renewed commitment"" to sustainability, said Ms Fu.\n""We will continue to work with all segments of society and the economy to realise our vision for a sustainable Singapore as we ride out COVID-19 and beyond,"" she said.\nAnd as Singapore tackles the public health threats of COVID-19 and dengue, the ministry\'s immediate priority will be shoring up the country\'s environmental public health resilience.\n""We will strengthen our environmental sanitation controls, upgrade public health infrastructure in hawker centres and coffee shops and rally Singaporeans to uplift and sustain cleanliness and public hygiene norms,"" said Ms Fu.\nThe pandemic has also disrupted global supply chains, showing Singapore\'s food security must be taken seriously, she added.\n""While our food supply has remained stable, we have launched the ‘30x30 Express’ grant to support agri-food players to accelerate local food production over the next six to 24 months,” she said.\nThe ministry will also push for a ""green recovery"" from COVID-19, said Ms Fu, and\xa0support a ""competitive transition"" to a low-carbon and climate-resilient future.\n""MSE will drive and coordinate public sector efforts to take the lead in sustainable development, and ensure that sustainability is at the heart of the MSE family of agencies’ core functions,"" she said.\nThis includes promoting “green growth”, riding on opportunities from decarbonisation and growing green industries such as carbon services and climate science, said the minister.\n""We will encourage and support companies to reduce their carbon footprint\xa0and explore new private-public collaborations to make Singapore a leading example of how economic prosperity and environmental sustainability can go hand-in-hand,” she added.\nAt the same time, there is also a need to be mindful of the longer-term existential threats from climate change, said Ms Fu, adding that Singapore will invest heavily in research and development for climate action.\nInitiatives set up to address this include the launch of a S$10 million national sea level research programme.\n""Dedicated resources"" are also being set aside in the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund to protect Singapore against rising sea levels, added the minister.\nSaid Ms Fu: ""MSE will do its part to keep Singapore at the forefront of public health, climate action, and resource security, with sustainability at the core.\xa0\n""We ask all Singaporeans to work with us to make Singapore a green and liveable home and a global champion for sustainability.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     sustainability ', '     Grace Fu ', '     jobs ']}"

      Australia's state of New South Wales to make landowners clear fire hazards
  </h1>, 'text': 'SYDNEY: Australia\'s most populous state said on Tuesday (Aug 25) it will compel owners to clear their land of flammable material as it endorsed 76 recommendations from an enquiry into deadly bushfires.\nFires razed more than 11 million ha\xa0of bushland across Australia\'s southeast early this year, killing at least 33 people and billions of native animals, a disaster that Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Australia\'s ""black summer"".\nAmid public anger, the federal and state governments commissioned independent enquiries.\nNew South Wales (NSW), which recorded the highest death toll from the fires at 25, on Tuesday became the first to release findings. Its Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott said the state government had accepted all recommendations.\nAmong recommendations, the state will require landowners to clear or burn flammable material - usually dried brush and dead leaves - for firefighters to be trained in treating wild animals and the creation of a fund to develop technology to detect fires.\n""These 76 recommendations are wide-ranging but what they also show is that there is no silver bullet. The last summer was caused by a crippling drought,"" Elliott told reporters in Canberra.\nThe issue of hazard reduction, however, is the most contentious as questions arise about the cause of the fires.\nMorrison, a supporter of the fossil fuel industry, this year said removing flammable material was as ""important as emissions reduction and I think many would argue even more so"", a stance rejected by several former firefighting chiefs.\nEnvironmental groups said Australia - one of the world\'s biggest carbon emitters on a per capital basis - must reduce its greenhouse emissions, amid forecasts for more frequent and severe droughts as the climate changes.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Scott Morrison ', '     news and politics ', '     Australia ', '     environment ']}"

      ‘It started from a hobby’: Meet the ant collector who left his job to open an ant shop
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Tucked away in a\xa0corner of a Housing Board estate in Yishun, bordering a traditional Chinese medicine store,\xa0Mr John Ye’s shop seems fairly nondescript from afar.\nBut take a closer look and you\'ll see a large tank of ants outside. Mr Ye stands ready to share his wealth of knowledge about the insects with any curious passers-by.\nJust Ants is the first\xa0physical ant shop in Singapore as far as he knows, said the 41-year-old, adding that the number of ant enthusiasts here is growing.\n“We have about 30 to 35 species of ants,” said Mr Ye, as\xa0he showed CNA around.\nAt least 10\xa0tanks of varying sizes line the outside of his shop, each filled with a different colony of ants. They range\xa0from the most common Carpenter Ants to the invasive Anoplolepis gracilipes - colloquially known as Yellow Crazy Ants.\nA range of formicariums - small vivariums used to raise ants - stock the shelves at the back of his store.\nThey include small test-tubes holding the smallest colonies. The larger set-ups provide creature comforts like tunnels and an ""outworld""\xa0where ants go to forage and hunt for food.\nA starter test-tube kit for a beginner ant hobbyist could go for about S$12, while an established colony of 20 to 30 ants would sell for S$20. Rare ants, on the other hand, can go for up to S$50 to S$60, Mr Ye said.\nWhile some might bug out at the idea of keeping ants, Mr Ye’s love for the insects prompted him to leave his previous job of distributing wholesale electronics to set up shop early last year.\n“It started from a hobby, a small hobby,” he told CNA. “And then when I actually learned more about ants, I was mind-blown. I ventured deeper and deeper. So I thought to myself, why not start an ant shop in Singapore?”\nMr Ye’s passion for ant-keeping is palpable.\nFramed up in his shop is a poem he wrote about ants. “Why keep ants they say. They are not entirely pests I say,” it read. “Ant keeping can be a joy. A lot more fun than that boring toy.”\nAnt-related religious verses decorate the walls, while a giant ant plush toy sits on top of a glass cabinet.\nThen there is the display tank holding a one-and-a-half-year-old mature colony\xa0which Mr Ye uses for show-and-tell. Inside, tens of thousands of ants crawl over the soil base, like scattered lines of marching troops.\n“They are a very ferocious species,” he said. “Although they are very small, there are up to seven sizes. The queen is about 2cm. This is what a nest would look like in the wild, very simple in soil.”\nThe ants in this tank can grow to a population of about 10,000 to 20,000 in about a year, he added.\n“Whatever’s in their path they will take down. It doesn’t matter how big you are - even if it’s a big lizard, they got a strategy to take down the enemy,” he said.\nHOW IT ALL STARTED\nMr Ye said his interest in ants started “randomly” in 2017.\n“I was watching some videos online. In Singapore it’s fairly new, but in Canada, the United States, it’s quite a hobby. So there’s a very popular ant channel in Canada - he’s also a comedian - Mikey Bustos.\n“He started the trend back then, and he did a storyline for each ant colony. So every time you will (be like) - wah, what’s the second episode like?”\nA few months later, Mr Ye found himself hunting for ants to start his own colony. But it was only early last year when he decided to up the\xa0ante to open his shop.\nJust Ants was previously at Woodlands before moving to Jurong East. Mr Ye thinks the current shop at Yishun Central could be their “forever home”.\n\n\nThe reception among customers is “getting better”, he said. “We have more curious people - not ant-keepers - but (they’re) curious as to what we are doing.”\nWhile some have the misconception that he is selling ants as feed or that he is selling ant eggs, Mr Ye is unfazed.\n“I will tune my frequency to them (to explain),” he said, speaking\xa0in English, Mandarin or dialect depending on the customer.\nBefore COVID-19, they were “very well-received”, he said, with schools as well as the Singapore Science Centre approaching him to talk about ants.\nThere are repeat customers who will come back to look for new formicarium or stock up on feed, said Mr Ye. He also runs an ""ant hotel""\xa0where he will care for the colonies when their owners are away.\n“We even have an uncle (who started with us). He’s 79-years-old. He bought a few colonies and he said he will spend hours observing them, taking pictures … He’s very cute because he will keep asking me, ‘you have any new ants?’ I say, ‘no more, all you have already’,” he said.\nBut things have not always been smooth-sailing. Friends and relatives doubted him at first, many of them wondering if he was “nuts”. When he first started his hobby, he said his\xa0wife threatened to spray his ants with ""Baygon"" if they escape their enclosures.\nMr Ye was also initially worried about turning a profit.\n“I know it will not be very profitable like a full-time job as in the workforce, but as time goes by, we thought of, well, passion would be ultimately over profit,” he said. “Of course we are not earning as much (as) back then in the workforce, but slowly we found really little happiness in what we’re doing.”\n‘IT’S LIKE LOOKING AFTER A PET FISH OR HAMSTER’\nA lot goes into running an ant shop. Not only does Mr Ye open every day from 12pm to 8pm, except for public holidays, he also has to ensure a steady supply of ants for potential customers.\nHe sometimes finds his ants from the wild, where hundreds of them will be flying around lamp-posts after the rain. He will then harvest as many ants as he can to ensure that he captures queens which have mated successfully.\nOther times, he will exchange ants with fellow hobbyists.\nOne queen ant is enough to start a colony as they only need to mate once to produce eggs for the rest of its lifespan, Mr Ye explained.\nIf you are putting out feelers about starting a new hobby, Mr Ye said it is\xa0relatively “low-maintenance” for those starting out with one colony, although it comes with responsibilities. These include feeding them and maintaining the humidity of the\xa0formicarium.\n“It’s like looking after a pet fish or hamster. They have requirements,” he said.\nEach ant has its own characteristic - some are friendly, some are aggressive - and so he provides a care sheet for each species of ants that he sells.\xa0\nMr Ye hopes to own more 100 species one day, including the Dinomyrmex gigas, the biggest ant in Southeast Asia which is native to Singapore.\xa0\n“It’s very therapeutic. My favourite part about keeping ants will be just looking at them, gazing at them … It calms my mind after a hard day at work. They really soothe my stress,” said Mr Ye.\n“They are so adorable crawling around, grooming themselves, it just tickles me. Doing their daily stuff, their strategies, the characteristics, how they organise themselves so uniquely,” he added.\n“It’s different every time I look at them. Every scene, every chapter of their daily routine is totally different.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     animals ', '     pets ']}"

And I would like to work on that.""\nAs such, new legislation in this area will be introduced within three to six months, noted Ms Fu, who took over from Mr Masagos Zulkifli, now Minister for Social and Family Affairs.\nThis includes the amendment of\xa0the Environmental Public Health Act, which was announced earlier this year.\n""This will allow us to look at the standards of hygiene that we have,"" said Ms Fu. ""We intend to raise (these) standards, particularly in areas where\xa0we have more vulnerable users. So we\'re looking at possibly childcare centres, eldercare facilities …\xa0we hope to get something done quite soon.""\nA result of this amendment could see managers required to carry out thorough periodic cleaning of their premises at prescribed minimum frequencies, the National Environment Agency (NEA) had said in March.\n""The next three months or six months, it\'s really about getting Singapore cleaner,"" said Ms Fu, but added the longer term goal was about ""sustainability, about environmental protection"".\n""RETHINKING""\xa0THE ROLE OF A CLEANER\nMs Fu also stressed that there was a need for ""collective responsibility"", as opposed to\xa0a reliance on cleaners.\n""It\'s about raising the level of understanding in (the) childcare sector, in the eldercare sector, in the hawker centre\xa0sector, so that it\'s a more collective responsibility - rather than (just) the cleaners - to keep us clean,"" she said.\nMs Fu noted that this is not just\xa0about cleaning\xa0frequency or the number of cleaners available.\xa0\nInstead, keeping Singapore clean should also be about building ""competencies"" in\xa0the kinds of technology, equipment\xa0and resources that can be\xa0used.\xa0\nSingapore had in February launched the SG Clean campaign, which the NEA said was aimed at instilling ""a national keep clean culture”.\nAnd while there have been similar campaigns in the past, Ms Fu said there were a ""multitude of factors"" behind this particular effort.\n""There are (a) multitude of factors as to why we need to mount\xa0another campaign, because I think we have tried in the past, but there\'s no reason why we shouldn\'t try -\xa0particularly now we expect, you know,\xa0higher\xa0standards of cleanliness.""\nHygiene standards have been raised as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Ms Fu, giving the example of how\xa0people now look for washbasins with soap in hawker centres and coffee shops.\n""Sometimes operators,\xa0if they\'re too busy, they may overlook simple things like that, or having toilet paper in their toilets,"" she\xa0said.\xa0\n""So we need to again re-emphasise the importance, and we\'re looking at how to make that ... legislation change, that can make that a more effective requirement\xa0on the facility or the venue owner.""\nMs Fu added that Singaporeans should also look after the interests and health of cleaners, as they are\xa0on the frontlines\xa0of the pandemic.\n""We should look after their interests and their health, because for them to come across soiled tissues and used masks at the hawker centre\xa0-\xa0it\'s really not fair to them, that\'s not a job hazard that they have bargained for,"" said Ms Fu.\xa0\n""So I think we would like our users to be more considerate, to be kinder to the cleaners and to\xa0exercise\xa0individual responsibility to keep the place clean.""\nSingaporeans should also not have the mentality that if they clean up after themselves, cleaners will have no jobs to do, added Ms Fu.\n""We shouldn\'t go with the idea that\xa0if we clean up ourselves the cleaner is going to go out of a job, that\'s not the case,"" she said.

      IN FOCUS: How urbanised Singapore is learning to live with its wildlife
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: On the way to dinner one Sunday evening, this journalist spotted five hornbills flitting across a road junction to rest in some trees - as much a part of the city landscape as the Velocity@Novena Square mall behind them and the lanes of traffic below.\nIn the housing estate just across from the mall, oriental pied hornbills preening their black-and-white plumage and chomping on fruit with their curved bills are a regular sight. The large bird with a distinctive casque on its beak is hard to miss but for nearly a century, they were a rare sight in Singapore.\nThey vanished from Singapore in the late 19th century and the first recorded return of wild oriental pied hornbills was on Pulau Ubin in 1994.\xa0Dr Ho Hua Chew, a long-time conservationist, was among the Nature Society Singapore (NSS) members who spotted the birds back then.\n""The bird is a spectacular species and being regarded as extinct in Singapore up to that date, it was a thrilling experience to see a comeback for such large forest species –\xa0especially two birds at that,"" he said.\nDr Ho said the hornbill sighting instilled hope in him for nature conservation in Singapore, which for decades was ""all gloom and doom"" with the country\'s nonstop construction and development.\nBut following a conservation project to bring back the birds,\xa0hornbill sightings\xa0have become far more common.\nBy installing nest boxes in trees for the birds to breed in, the Singapore Hornbill Project’s collaborators, who include the National Parks Board (NParks), Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) and researchers, got visiting birds from neighbouring countries to settle here and raise their babies.\nThe hornbills are an eye-catching example of the many projects in Singapore aiming to preserve what is left of its biodiversity in an urbanised landscape - a movement that has grown gradually over the last couple of decades.\xa0\nThese include not just species recovery initiatives, but also efforts to restore habitats and connect them through nature ways - routes planted with specific trees and shrubs to facilitate the movement of animals. Many of these projects are part of Singapore\'s continually updated green master plans.\nDr Yong Ding Li, ornithologist and scientific adviser for the Nature Society\'s\xa0bird group, estimates that the population\xa0of oriental pied hornbills here has been expanding steadily in the last two decades and now number in the “low hundreds”.\nThe birds, which live on the forest fringes,\xa0have\xa0established themselves\xa0sufficiently and there is now no need to intervene, according to Mr Lim Liang Jim, group director of NParks\' National Biodiversity Centre. NParks’ greening efforts have contributed to this, as there are now enough mature trees for birds which nest in tree holes - like the hornbills and parrots - to breed in.\nDr Yong added: “I think there\'s a role that greening has played in allowing hornbills to recolonise the main island. Now the interesting thing is that on mainland Singapore, the hornbills are largely not in our central nature reserves.”\nOTTERS RETURN\nThe return of such wildlife is a side effect\xa0of policies that can be traced back to founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision to green Singapore and clean up its waterways - efforts which were meant to improve the welfare of the island’s human inhabitants\xa0and to enhance Singapore\'s reputation abroad.\nEnvironmental activist and National University of Singapore biology lecturer N\xa0Sivasothi said that the city’s smooth-coated otters found that Singapore’s clean waterways, some of which have been naturalised, also suited them.\n“So the river cleanup was not about supporting wildlife, it was about providing clean water for people,” he said. “Although otters were missing in Singapore for a few decades, as we cleaned up for people … suddenly they were seen.”\nBut not every species can thrive in an environment built for people, and as Singapore continues to develop, will there be room for wildlife?\nFor instance, the urbanised smooth-coated otters’\xa0prominence is in contrast to the fate of its rural cousin, the small-clawed otter.\n“(The small-clawed otter is) a small mangrove stream-dwelling kind of animal. The modified environment it can deal with is maybe padi fields, but it can’t deal with modified urban environments, so its fate is hanging in balance in (Pulau) Ubin and Tekong,” said Mr Sivasothi.\nMuch of Singapore’s wildlife are hidden in the pockets of forest that remain in the heart of Singapore, and some, like small-clawed otters, persist on the\xa0north-east islands.\n“What happens is the urban adapted species are prominent but the ones that cannot hack it, you don\'t see,” said Mr Sivasothi.\xa0\n“If you talk about wildlife conservation, ultimately what must you do is conserve habitat. We should invest a lot of effort into restoring, recovery and then connecting (them).”\n\n\nThat effort to conserve, restore and connect natural habitats is a major part of the City in Nature\xa0vision, announced by National Development Minister Desmond Lee in March.\nOn Wednesday, NParks announced new plans to create a 400ha nature park network that will envelop the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, the Kranji Marshes and other nature areas - in another step to protect Singapore’s four nature reserves.\nA network of buffer parks has\xa0already been added to Singapore’s Central Catchment and Bukit Timah Nature Reserves. These buffers protect the central nature reserves from developments that abut them and give the public alternative green spaces to visit so as to ease pressure on the reserves.\nThe development plans for Sungei Buloh take\xa0into account its role as a key node for migratory waterbirds along a flyway that stretches from the arctic to New Zealand - a science-based and ecologically friendly approach that is increasingly evident as Singapore tries to protect what is left of its natural heritage.\n“IF YOU LOSE THEM HERE, YOU LOSE THE WHOLE WORLD\'S POPULATION”\nAs the sky lightened and the forest awakened, bird calls and macaques’ chatter punctuated the keening of cicadas at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. In ever-changing Singapore, this patch of primary rainforest is a\xa0reminder of what much of the island looked and sounded like\xa0200 years ago.\nOn any given day, the nature reserve is filled with hikers and panting joggers labouring up and down its slopes, but few see most of the flora and fauna that call it home.\nOne of them - the Johora Singaporensis, freshwater crabs found only in Singapore - infamously made it onto a list of the 100 most endangered species in the world. Its tiny population of a few hundred is found in fast-flowing streams on hills, of which there are only a handful here.\nThe Singapore freshwater crab has already vanished from a hill stream in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve where it was first discovered in the 1980s, a turn of events that sounded the alarm for researchers years back.\n“They\'re unique to Singapore.\xa0That means, if you lose them here, you lose the whole world\'s population,” said Associate Professor Darren Yeo, a freshwater ecology expert at the National University of Singapore\'s (NUS) department of biological sciences.\n\n\nA concerted effort to save the pebble-sized invertebrate was mounted in 2015 by NParks, WRS and NUS, leading to more than 100 crabs being released in the wild. The crab population has likely increased in recent years due to successful breeding programmes and translocations, said NParks.\nBut the fate of the species remains precarious because its habitats are so limited. Research on its ecology is now ongoing to investigate possible threats to the species in the wild, such as stream acidification and drought, possibly due to climate change, said Assoc Prof Yeo.\nThe crab, described by Assoc Prof Yeo as a “little brown thing” more comfortable scuttling under rocks than being the centre of the media spotlight, is one of the lucky ones.\n“A HERCULEAN EFFORT”\nA 2003 study found that Singapore had already lost about 28 per cent, or 881 of 3,196 recorded species, in 200 years without much fanfare. The main reason was habitat loss, after more than 95 per cent of the island’s forest cover was lost to agriculture and later, urban development.\nAs many species here could have been lost before ever being documented, by referencing species found in Malaysia, the study’s authors inferred that the true extinction rate could have been as high as 73 per cent.\nThe study also estimated that forest reserves covering only 0.25 per cent of Singapore’s area hold more than 50 per cent of the native biodiversity left.\n\n\nBut efforts to conserve Singapore’s biodiversity has come some way since, and hundreds of plants and animals have been discovered or rediscovered here since 2013, as surveys of wildlife proliferated.\n“It\'s really a Herculean effort\xa0to bring all this back ... Before we know what to bring back, we realised that we had to first find out what\'s there,"" said NParks\' Mr Lim,\xa0Over the last seven years, surveys have discovered or rediscovered more than 500 new species, he said.\nNumerous projects to conserve key species, including the Singapore freshwater crab, sea turtles and indigenous plants like the Singapore ginger, were also started over the years.\nThen, the 2003 study’s authors called some surviving species the “living dead” - including the white-bellied woodpecker, the cream-coloured giant squirrel and the banded leaf monkey - as their numbers were deemed too small to be viable in the long term.\n\n\nThe cream-coloured giant squirrel has not been sighted here since 1995, and Dr Yong told CNA that he last saw the white-bellied woodpecker - Singapore’s largest woodpecker - in 2001. The presence of the white-bellied woodpecker\xa0and a diverse woodpecker community\xa0are\xa0indications of forest health, as they\xa0need\xa0good forests with tall trees to survive, he added.\n“The majority of forest animals will be in decline just because the forests are too small, but we can help by trying to create corridors to connect the different forest fragments.”\nHe calls the Eco-Link - a highway for animals built in 2013 - one of the most important conservation actions that Singapore has ever taken, as it connects the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, which were\xa0bifurcated by the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) in 1986.\nWHEN WILL THEY REACH THE “TIPPING POINT”?\nDespite the challenges, primatologist Andie Ang is trying to bring the banded leaf monkey, also known as the Raffles\' banded langur, back from the brink of extinction.\nUp until\xa0the 1920s, the langur was found in many parts of Singapore, including Tuas, Bukit Timah and Changi, before development claimed most of its habitats. Unlike the more common long-tailed macaque, the shy creatures have found it hard to adapt to a Singapore with little forest cover.\nThe last banded leaf monkey in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve was believed to have been mauled to death by a pack of dogs in 1987, leaving the Central Catchment Nature Reserve as the last stronghold for the primates. Studies on them were few and far between but in 2008, a survey found about 40 langurs left here.\nTwelve years on, Dr Ang, who leads research and conservation efforts for the banded leaf monkeys, estimates that their numbers have\xa0increased to more than 60 in Singapore.\nWith the slight increase in population, a group of bachelor monkeys tried to make their way back to Bukit Timah a few years back but one died in a road accident on BKE. While other animals have used the Eco-Link that now connects the two forested areas, the monkeys have yet to figure this out, said Dr Ang, a research scientist at the WRS Conservation Fund.\xa0\n“They\'re always facing pressure in terms of where they can go and where they can remain,” she added.\nGiven their small numbers, just one catastrophic incident, such as a heavy storm or a fire, can eliminate all the langurs. A disease or inbreeding may also wipe out the population, which DNA analysis has shown to have low genetic variability.\n""With an inbred population, it takes time for signs to show and it also takes time before the population would crash suddenly, so I\'m just afraid when they are reaching that tipping point,” said Dr Ang.\nThe bachelor group of monkeys has\xa0settled in Windsor Nature Park, one of the buffer parks created on the edges of the nature reserves to protect the core areas from further disturbance.\n\n\nBut Dr Ang fears that they will be affected by works for the upcoming Cross Island Line, which would lead to the clearing of a part of their habitat which is not protected as it is outside the nature reserve.\nDiscussions with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) are ongoing to safeguard the flora and fauna in the area when construction of the line begins, the authority said.\nSMALL FORESTS, HIGH STAKES\nThat discussion is a continuation of an engagement process that has been going on since 2013 when plans for the MRT line - which could have gone under or around the Central Catchment Nature Reserve - were first announced.\nSaid Mr Sivasothi, who has been actively involved in the engagement: “Our local species are all locked up in the nature reserves, which is why we are so energetic when it comes to engagement because you make one slip-up - the damage, the impact is extremely high.”\nHighlighting the fragility of the nature reserve, Mr Sivasothi said that when environmental impact studies were being conducted, the companies employed were not used to the small size of Singapore’s forests and the minor disturbances that could tip the balance.\n“The scale at which we are telling them they have to take into account - they\'ve never really faced before - it\'s like a macro-scale to a nano-scale,” he said.\nAfter years of debate and consultation, it was announced in December 2019 that the line will tunnel under the nature reserve but go 70m deep, instead of the usual 20 to 30m. There will be no surface work sites in the nature reserve to ensure that flora and fauna will not be affected.\n\n\nWhile not everyone was satisfied with the final decision, there was a definite desire for a constructive outcome and a “willingness to listen”, said Mr Sivasothi.\nNature Society president Shawn Lum credits the LTA for committing to a long engagement with nature groups early on and being open to trying new technology to get the MRT line built while reducing the impact on the nature reserve.\n“They, of course, had certain constraints on how that line could be built, but the fact is that, really, through the engagement LTA … changed the\xa0way they did much of their work and so the nature reserve was able to escape from the worst kind of impact,” he said.\nIt is a stark example of how Singapore’s conservation plans have to face the concrete reality of its limited space, the need to accommodate more than 5\xa0million people and the relentless race for economic growth. The process also highlights the tussle between conservation and urban development that has played out over the years in the give-and-take between authorities and environmental activists.\nFROM CONSERVATION TUSSLES TO ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT\nThe kernel of the Sungei Buloh Nature Park Network started in 1989, when a group of birdwatchers and nature lovers successfully lobbied the Government to set it aside as a nature park. It was the first time Singapore had set aside land for nature conservation since its independence - but it was the exception rather than the norm for many years to come.\nDr Ho, who has been involved in conservation work since the mid-80s, was among those who helped save Sungei Buloh.\xa0He recalls how a petition with 25,000 signatures a few years later in the early 1990s could not budge the authorities’ resolve to build Housing Board flats in Sembawang over the Senoko Wetlands -\xa0then home to endangered resident and migratory birds.\nBut despite such setbacks, continued pressure from nature activists convinced the authorities to take them seriously, even as popular support for nature and cultural heritage conservation grew over the years, Dr Ho said.\n\n\nThere were two big conservation tussles which he believes helped to turn the course of the engagement process with the authorities - the Chek Jawa wetlands on Pulau Ubin and the Bukit Brown cemetery.\n“What followed from these two fierce/heated tussles was that the authorities became more friendly and willing more to listen and understand our positions,” he said in an email.\nDr Lum said that there has been a more systematic effort to include feedback from various communities, including the nature groups, on major infrastructural projects in the last decade or so. While there was always a pipeline for feedback, it used to be more informal.\nBesides the Cross Island Line, he cites the development of the Rail Corridor as an example of how the Urban Redevelopment Authority took on the community as a partner in developing plans for railway land that was returned to Singapore in 2011.\nDr Lum believes that with more people with different backgrounds and expertise involved in the planning and urban development process, better outcomes can be reached.\n“I think if you took all these great ideas, and these technically skilled people who have know-how in whatever - engineering and building, modelling and nature -\xa0we might be able to do something that no one agency or no one institution or individual could have thought possible,” he said.\xa0\n“But in order to tap into that expertise, the discussions have to start really early and not necessarily unveiled as this plan that just needs a fine touch at the end.”\nEVOLUTION, NOT REVOLUTION\nMr Lim of NParks’ National Biodiversity Centre said that the change in approach over the years has been organic.\n“It was very evolutionary, it wasn\'t revolutionary. But essentially, there was a recognition,\xa0I think for quite some time already ... that the community has to be involved,” he said.\nIt is not just the approach to engagement, the evolution in Singapore’s relationship with the natural environment can be summed up in its slogans over the years - from “Garden City” to “City in a Garden” to now, a “City in Nature”.\nExplaining the significance of this, Mr Lim said: “We are now looking at nature as really being part of a very critical relationship with people ... simply because we recognise now that nature - flora, fauna, habitats and ecosystems - play an important role (in) imparting resilience to the community, to human individuals, to society, to nations.”\nThere is now an understanding that having more natural ecosystems, rather than controlled green spaces is important for ecological and climate resilience, said Mr Lim. There is even scientific evidence that being in a more biodiverse environment improves mental well-being, he added.\nOf the seven strategic thrusts of the City in Nature vision, conserving and restoring natural ecosystems is the first. Other key thrusts include restoring nature into the built environment and establishing connectivity between green spaces islandwide - for humans and for wildlife.\xa0\nIt has come a long way from 1967 when then-PM Lee Kuan Yew announced that Singapore was to become a “garden city beautiful with flowers and trees, and as tidy and litterless as can be”, as reported in the Straits Times.\nGetting the community engaged,\xa0in particular young people, is another key thrust. Mr Lim said he is seeing more interest in nature conservation, and many people, young and old, committing their time and expertise to\xa0NParks’ community programmes.\n“IT ALL BEGINS WITH UNDERSTANDING THE NATURAL WORLD”\nAt Commonwealth Secondary School, students have been learning in an environment which is a microcosm of Singapore’s natural habitats - from a rainforest to a wetland, and a freshwater stream. It is one of 42 schools in NParks’ Greening Schools for Biodiversity Programme, which helps schools plant native flora and create habitats for more wildlife.\nThe animals that stop by the school became learning opportunities,\xa0such as when a reticulated python was found in a school corridor\xa0or when a pair of olive-backed sunbirds built a nest there this year.\nMr Jacob Tan, biology teacher and key driver of the school’s environmental education programme, said that the school’s geography teachers have also been using the eco-habitats to get students to link what they observe to their lessons.\n“This is the generation of students who will inherit a world where these issues are really going to be a problem. As our students live in an urban environment, the opportunity that they have to get in contact with nature and biodiversity in general is very little,” he said.\xa0\nOne young person whose love for nature has turned into both a job and a sideline is 26-year-old Kong Man Jing, a science teacher at a tuition centre who also runs Facebook page Just Keep Thinking, dedicated to educating people about science and the environment and has more than 63,000 followers.\nMs Kong’s alter-ego “BioGirlMJ” is the bubbly host of science and nature videos that feel like a blend of Discovery Channel and SGAG. During the “circuit breaker” period, she went on a “grassland treasure hunt”, identifying for viewers the flowers, weeds and insects that proliferated when the grass went untrimmed for months.\nMs Kong told CNA that she\xa0wants her\xa0videos to fill a gap\xa0for light-hearted content on such matters that are accessible to the masses - particularly the unconverted, who may not be that interested in green issues.\n“It’d be great if everyone cares about the environment a bit more because climate change is real, but to reach there, I think it has to come from innate desire,” she said. “When you love something, you want to protect it more.”\nSINGAPORE A “CRUCIBLE” FOR THE WORLD?\nMost people CNA spoke to said that the issue is larger than Singapore and saving its native wildlife.\xa0\nOrnithologist Dr Yong pointed out that Singapore’s ecosystem merges into Malaysia’s and Indonesia’s, and international ecological connectivity is often overlooked.\n“If you look at the Johor Straits ... we cannot see the Singapore side as a ‘Singaporean ecosystem’, there\'s no such thing as a Singaporean ecosystem. To animals, to plants, the border is an artificial thing,” he said, urging for more transboundary cooperation on nature conservation.\nNParks\' Mr Lim said that Singapore can be a “test case” for other cities in the world.\n""Singapore is very interesting because it is a crucible … a test case of how basically a small nation with very small hinterland -\xa0in fact zero hinterland, let’s be honest -\xa0will be able to build a matrix of greenery, of nature so that it benefits people as much as possible,” he said.\nDr Lum of the Nature Society said that he feels it is time the world draws a line on urban sprawl if it wants to enjoy the services that nature provides, like climate regulation, clean water and air.\xa0\n“I think all countries in the future would have to kind of draw a boundary: Beyond this, we just cannot develop, we have to put everything in this ... And so in this sense, Singapore really becomes a test case for how creative can we be in our allocation of land.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     wildlife ', '     climate change ', '     National Parks Board ', '     NParks ', '     In Focus ', '     sustainability ']}"

I came into this ministry\xa0not knowing how exciting this area is,"" said Ms Fu, who recently took over this appointment.\nPreviously\xa0Minister for Culture, Community and Youth,\xa0Ms Fu now helms the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, formerly known as the\xa0Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources.\n""There\'s actually areas\xa0of gaps. And when you notice there\'s\xa0gaps, you know\xa0that\xa0you need to fill the gaps, and I think that\'s exactly where we think that this is a new sector where jobs\xa0are going to grow - and\xa0good jobs as well,"" said Ms Fu,\xa0responding to a question from moderator Ms Jessica Cheam on careers within the sustainability sector.\nMs Cheam is the founder and managing director of\xa0Eco-Business, an environmental news website which organised the session.\xa0\nThe minister elaborated on specific areas of environment and sustainability-related sectors\xa0which could see growth in opportunities.\n""Just start at the very level about climate change - we need climate scientists, we need people who understand engineering, who understand drainage, who understand how to protect our shoreline,"" said Ms Fu.\n""Look at waste -\xa0we need people to tell us how to extract valuable waste as much as possible out of our waste streams, whether it\'s\xa0food, whether it\'s metal, whether it\'s paper, whether it\'s plastic,"" she said.\xa0\n""The more we are able to extract value out of it, the more recycling makes sense,"" she said, adding that there is then\xa0less of a ""trade-off"" between environmental and economic objectives.\nFood science could be another area of growth, said the minister.\n""The area of food science also is\xa0tremendous -\xa0we are looking at increasing the food production capacity of Singapore, in many folds, many, many folds over the next 10 years,"" she said.\xa0\n""It is where intensive urban\xa0farming is called to action. And I\'m sure the sector is looking for many, many technicians, many scientists in this area.""\nGiving the example of cleaners, Ms Fu also noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted\xa0how much Singapore relies on labour in some sectors.\n""It has shown us that we need to be more resilient. We need to let each one of them do more with less physical strength, but more equipment, more mechanisation. So again, that\'s a whole new area of improving productivity using digital (means) to help us do our work better,"" she said.\n""MAXIMISING VALUE""\xa0FROM WASTE\nIn the wide-ranging dialogue, Ms Fu also tackled other questions including one on the\xa0possible increased\xa0usage of single-use plastics as a result of\xa0the pandemic.\nNoting that there are many types of single-use disposables - which range from masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) to takeaway containers - and a corresponding increase in demand, Ms Fu said that there is\xa0sometimes\xa0a ""trade-off"" between public health and\xa0hygiene versus the use of plastic.\n""I think for us, the main thing is about waste streams, how do we treat the waste stream? We like to have a way so that the waste\xa0is treated with minimal impact on the environment,"" she said.\n""Secondly, how do we extract most resources out of the waste stream so that we can recycle as much as possible?\xa0In Singapore, I think we all know that because we incinerate hundred per cent of our waste, we harness the energy content from our plastics. But is that the best that we can do? I think not.""\nSingapore will need to ""maximise the value"" from its waste stream, said Ms Fu.\nBut first\xa0of all we should ""use as little as we can"", said the minister, although she acknowledged that given the current pandemic some disposable items are needed.\n""In the case of a pandemic, we need the kind of PPE,\xa0we need the\xa0kind of gloves -\xa0we can\'t help it. That\'s, you know, something that we need to think about it,"" she said.\xa0\n""But I\'m sure our healthcare institutions are also thinking about how to have supply resilience also - on the mask and on on the PPE\xa0and all the other disposables. So that has to come into the consideration - how can we use as little as possible.""\nThe second aspect is how Singapore can treat waste ""as best as we can"" to get as much out of it as possible.\n""Secondly, then how do we treat the waste as best as we can, get as much out (of it)\xa0as we can,"" she said.\xa0\n""Use as little, getting as much out as we can and minimise the impact on the environment. I think that will guide us going forward.""\nIn addition to\xa0Ms Fu, the\xa0other speakers involved in the dialogue were Sembcorp Industries\' group president and CEO Wong Kim Yin as well as Mr Bradley Busetto, who is the director of the UNDP Global Centre on Technology, Innovation and Sustainable Development.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate ', '     sustainability ', '     environment ', '     Grace Fu ']}"

More than 90 per cent of the Earth\'s agricultural soils are at risk of degradation within the next 30 years.\nIn Bhutan, Mountain Hazelnuts works primarily with women and poor farmers in the country\'s underdeveloped east, providing free saplings and technical assistance, including a traceability system that assesses land quality and monitors soil health.\n""We only plant on land that is fallow and degraded, and therefore not suitable for other crops,"" said Teresa Law, co-founder of the company, which aims to cultivate hazelnuts in up to 10 per cent of Bhutan\'s fallow and degraded land.\n""Hazelnut trees can be planted on mountain slopes where other crops are unable to thrive – this stabilises the slopes and improves watersheds,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nCATALYST FOR CHANGE\nBillions of people live on land that is deteriorating and producing less food, and that could force hundreds of millions of people to migrate over the next three decades, according to a 2018 study backed by the United Nations.\nLand can be restored by planting trees, growing salt-tolerant crops, and by reflooding drained wetlands. Reviving damaged lands is possible by 2030, a UN review has concluded.\nThe Land Degradation Neutrality Fund, promoted by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and ethical investment firm Mirova, supports sustainable land use and land restoration projects that deliver social and economic benefits.\nIt backs smallholder coffee farmers in Peru, community forestry in Indonesia, as well as Mountain Hazelnuts, and has identified more than 150 potential projects in Africa, Asia and South America.\nThese are particularly critical in Asia, as it has the largest degraded land area in the world, and the biggest population relying on the land for food and livelihoods, said Yuji Niino, a land management officer at the FAO.\n""Faster economic development and a growing population are putting greater pressure on land, with unsustainable land use increasing the risk,"" he said, adding that the Asia-Pacific region is also the most vulnerable to climate-related risks.\n""To address the issue, a community-based approach is necessary, with the engagement of the private and non-profit sectors, and with the use of appropriate technology and adequate policy support,"" he said.\nThis is the goal in Mongolia, where nearly 70 per cent of grasslands have been damaged due to warmer temperatures and overgrazing by cashmere goats whose highly-prized wool is a top export.\nA project by the Wildlife Conservation Society for sustainable cashmere uses satellite maps to help herders find places where the vegetation is healthy enough for grazing.\nIn a pilot, the UN Development Programme\xa0is working with the Mongolian government, the Sustainable Fibre Alliance and herders, using blockchain technology to track the cashmere herds and limit production from overgrazed areas.\nHerders use a mobile phone app created by Toronto-based Convergence.Tech to register their cashmere with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag that is regularly scanned from the goats to the processing facilities.\nThe pilot last year in three north-eastern provinces tagged and registered about five tonnes of cashmere.\n""Technology doesn\'t create sustainability by itself, but it can be a great catalyst for change,"" said Chami Akmeemana, Convergence.Tech\'s chief executive.\nFOOD SECURITY\nIn the south Indian state of Kerala, it is community effort – aided by social media – that is putting fallow land to use.\nAs the coronavirus pandemic closed state borders, supplies of fresh produce were hit, and state authorities urged residents to grow their own fruits and vegetables.\nThanal, a social enterprise, introduced a programme to get urban residents to fund the cultivation of fallow land by smallholder farmers by investing 5,000 rupees (US$67) per acre to help buy seeds, manure and hire machinery.\nThe farmers will pay back their investment in kind with the food they produce, said Jayakumar Chelaton, a trustee at Thanal.\n""We proposed the plan on social media and mobile chat groups, and it was so well received, we are covering 150 acres of fallow land, which is three times the original target, and urban residents want to do this on a continuous basis,"" he said.\n""Use of fallow land boosts food output, and also minimises soil erosion and flooding, which has become more common.""\nIn Bhutan, Mountain Hazelnuts aims to cultivate 10 million trees, engaging 15,000 farmers.\nWith a planned sustainability certification, and growing demand from overseas markets including Malaysia and Australia, the outlook is promising.\n""By providing employment and a sustainable cash crop, we have reinvigorated a set of communities that were in decline, and seen a decrease in rural-to-urban migration,"" Law said.\n""In the long run, the rural communities become more resilient as the quality of life improves, especially for women,"" she added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      IN FOCUS: 'It is not easy, but it can be done' - The challenges of raising Singapore's recycling rate
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Before bringing her recyclables down to the blue bins below her block, Cheryl Lee always takes the time to clean or wash the items that accumulate in her recycling corner at home.\nShe and her mother make sure to remove all the non-recyclable parts like stickers and loose plastic packaging. For cardboard boxes, they even try to cut out the parts with plastic or tape that cannot be removed before recycling the rest.\nOn top of recycling in the correct way, the 28-year-old digital communications assistant manager tries to live as sustainably as possible - she uses reusable containers and packaging, and only buys second-hand clothes, among other things.\xa0\nHowever, she is well aware that people who go to the same lengths or even further are rare in Singapore, and she only knows of one or two others like her.\xa0\nWhenever she and her ex-colleagues\xa0bought\xa0lunch back to the office, Ms Lee always brought along\xa0used plastic bags to carry the food - not just for herself, but for every colleague who was with her.\xa0\n“I would carry it for them because they don\'t want to do it because they think it’s troublesome. So I would do it for them. I would go to each stall that they are at and then I’d\xa0ask the aunty to put the plastic containers in the plastic bag I brought for them,” she told CNA.\xa0\n“I did change my approach halfway through because I realised that if you keep nagging people, people will be annoyed at you eventually,” she added with a laugh.\nAcknowledging that leading an eco-friendly life in every aspect is “a very difficult commitment”, Ms Lee\xa0said: “As you live your life, there are certain things that you have to see whether you can adapt (to), like being green. And honestly even up to now, I am not zero waste.""\nAnd when it comes to recycling, many Singaporeans are still “not very educated” about how to recycle properly, Ms Lee\xa0observed.\xa0\nFor example, not everyone will remember or take the effort to remove the non-recyclable parts. “Do you really think that Singaporeans in general will take the time out to do that when they don’t even take the time out to do simple things?”\xa0\nSINGAPORE’S “LOW” DOMESTIC RECYCLING RATE\nOver the past decade, Singapore’s overall recycling rate has hovered around 60 per cent.\xa0\nAlthough that rate is one of the highest in the world, its domestic recycling rate “remains low”, said deputy director of Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Chemical and Life Sciences Richard Khaw.\nSingapore’s domestic recycling rate declined from 22 per cent in 2018 to 17 per cent in 2019, below\xa0the European Union, which reported a domestic recycling rate of 46.4 per cent in 2017, he added.\xa0\nAlthough the then-Ministry of Environment and Water Resources – now the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment – conducted nearly 2,000 ground-up activities and reached out to more than 670,000 people, this is only 12 per cent of Singapore’s 5.8 million population, Mr Khaw noted, and a portion of the 670,000 people could be from the same households.\n\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for improving recycling rates in Singapore is still the mindset and behaviour of the public, said Ms Jen Teo, executive director of the Singapore Environment Council (SEC).\n“More needs to be done to increase personal acceptance and responsibility for recycling in Singapore. Public education, raising consciousness and awareness that eventually lead to mindset changes and actions are key,” she said.\xa0\n“It is not easy, but it can be done.”\nWith blue bins located around estates, recycling can be tedious for the public who find it a hassle to change clothes to bring their recyclables downstairs, said Dr Adrian Ang, who manages the Diploma in Green Building and Sustainability at Temasek Polytechnic’s School of Engineering.\n""Worse still, some of the bins are located a distance away from the lift lobby,"" he added.\xa0\nThe blue recycling bins are the “most common channel” for recycling, with 56 per cent of those who recycle regularly using the blue bins at least once a week, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) in response to queries.\nOther than convenience, the lack of recycling knowledge also contributes to the low domestic recycling rate, said Ms Teo, citing SEC’s 2018 study, which found that 70 per cent of respondents did not fully know what was recyclable.\n“This suggests the need for closer attention to increasing consumer information, education and awareness to close the knowledge gap,” she added.\xa0\nSeventy per cent of participants at the SEC Conference Day 2018 panel discussion agreed that public education and campaigns would help to increase the recycling rate, and this is “further validation and reinforcement” that more public education is required, she said.\nThe lack of recycling knowledge also contributes to contamination, which is one of the “main challenges” cited by NEA.\n“Currently, about 40 per cent of what is placed in our blue recycling bins/recycling chutes cannot be recycled and/or are contaminated by food waste,” said the agency.\nTo raise awareness among the public on materials that can be recycled and how to prevent contamination, NEA has placed new labels on all blue recycling bins, stating clearly objects that can or cannot be recycled.\xa0All recycling trucks operated by the four public waste collectors have been standardised to make them easily identifiable.\nAs a Housing and Development Board (HDB)\xa0resident regularly exposed to recycling campaigns, Ms Lee\xa0thinks NEA is doing its part to educate the public.\xa0\n“But maybe there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach,” she said. It is difficult to compare Singapore’s recycling situation to countries like Japan, where citizens have a different attitude towards nature and being environmentally friendly, she added.\xa0\n\n\nRECYCLING CHUTES – YES OR NO?\nThe convenience of having waste chutes in high-rise HDB and apartment blocks is another factor in the low recycling rate, said Ms Teo.\xa0\nHowever, studies have found that households living in apartments with dual chute systems recycle up to three times more than those living in apartments without them, noted Dr Ang.\nSince 2014, all new public housing developments have dual chutes, where residents can throw refuse and recyclables separately. This was later extended from April\xa02018 to all new non-landed private residential developments with buildings taller than four storeys.\nThe first launch of the separate recycling chute – or the Centralised Chute for Recyclables \xa0– was a trial. The chutes were placed at the common area of every floor at a Choa Chu Kang block in 2006. Later, the chutes were installed in two other projects, Fernvale Vista in Sengkang and Treelodge@Punggol, HDB’s first eco-precinct.\nFrom May 2011 to Apr 2012, a HDB survey found that three times more recyclable waste was collected, compared to other housing estates of similar size that used conventional recyclable collection methods, including door-to-door collection and a centralised recyclables depository.\nThe survey also found that the average weight of recyclables collected from a block at Treelodge@Punggol in one month was 400kg, four times the amount collected from a typical HDB block without a recycling chute.\nIn view of the “encouraging results”, HDB has since extended the separate recycling chute programme to all new public housing developments launched from January 2014, it said in its response to CNA\'s queries.\xa0\n""BEHAVIOURAL NUDGES""\xa0AND STARTING YOUNG\nWith the twin barriers of contamination and convenience firmly in the way of improving local recycling rates, how can people here learn to be better at recycling?\xa0Experts CNA spoke to pointed to education from an early age and incentives complemented by stricter restrictions as possible ways to accelerate an improvement in recycling rates.\xa0\nNoting that people can be driven to action with “behavioural nudges”, Ms Samantha Chan, a lecturer at Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Business Management, said the strategies would vary for different target groups.\xa0\nChildren can be educated on recycling through gamification, using mechanics to inspire learning and positive behaviour, she added.\xa0\n“More needs to be done in shaping the young minds”\xa0to play a more “active and effective role” in climate change matters, said founder of Plastic Lite SG Aarti Giri.\xa0\n“Educational institutions need to play a much more impactful role and impress upon their students that a whole lot of mindset shift, legwork and environmental legislations are needed if we are to have even a fighting chance in mitigating the disastrous effects of the looming climate crisis,” she told CNA.\xa0\n\n\nCiting examples at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels, Dr Laura Yap, who is the programme chair for the Diploma in Environmental Science at Republic Polytechnic, said recycling education in schools has had “a positive impact” on students. “So we are doing something right at the school level but this recycling mentality seems to fade as adults transit into the workplace.”\nMore organisations and offices need to take on recycling efforts at their own facilities “so that this recycling mentality can continue and be reinforced further” at the workplace, where people spend a significant amount of time, she said.\xa0\n“And just like how our school children take home their recycling habits from school, hopefully adults can do the same and bring home their workplace recycling habits.”\nNanyang Polytechnic’s Ms Chan said individuals can be encouraged to recycle at recycling machines placed near their homes\xa0in exchange for incentives, noting similar successes in Denmark and Australia. Retailers can also help by making recycling bins readily available at their stores, and offering similar incentives.\nIn Taiwan, recyclers can add value to their MRT access cards for every bottle or can they deposit in a smart recycling booth, said Temasek Polytechnic’s Dr Ang.\xa0\nAt the Community of Supply debate in March, then-Senior Minister of State for Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor announced that NEA will implement a\xa0Deposit Refund Scheme for beverage containers\xa0by 2022.\nFor such schemes, producers usually pay for the system to take back used beverage containers and consumers get a refund when returning empty containers at designated return points. In countries such as Norway and Germany, similar schemes have achieved a high recycling rate of beverage containers of more than 80 per cent, Dr Khor said.\xa0\nIn October 2019, drinks manufacturer Fraser and Neave (F&N) and NEA installed 50 smart vending machines that gave out S$0.20 FairPrice coupons for every four empty plastic drink bottles and aluminium drink cans deposited.\xa0\nSnaking queues of shoppers hoping to redeem coupons quickly formed. Months later in January this year,\xa0it was revised\xa0to a S$0.20 coupon\xa0for every 20 empty bottles and cans,\xa0and the queues soon disappeared.\nProviding incentives to recycle could become costly and may not be sustainable in the long run, said Ms Chan. To “ensure sustainability”, Singapore should also consider stricter measures.\xa0\nFor example, in South Korea, food waste has to be recycled as compost, and those who fail to do so risk getting fined. About 95 per cent of the country’s food waste is now recycled, she added.\xa0\nSingapore can also learn from the European Union in implementing mandatory recycling measures, said Nanyang Polytechnic’s Mr Khaw. “However, we need to have sufficient infrastructure and logistical support to implement such mandatory measures.”\xa0\n“As long as recycling is done on a voluntary basis, we are unlikely to see any significant improvement in the recycling rate,” he added.\xa0\nAnd there is no shortage of measures from other countries that Singapore can reference, adapt and adopt.\xa0\nIn Japan, there are “literally no garbage cans” on the street because individuals are responsible for processing their waste at home, Dr Ang said. In Switzerland, official garbage bags are available for purchase at a higher price, while recycling is free.\xa0\nThe UK uses a three-pronged strategy - streamlined recycling infrastructure, a comprehensive awareness campaign and policies that include both incentive and taxation measures, he added, describing this as “the key to expediting public adopting”.\xa0\n\n\n“Recycling is a behaviour, much like exercising to keep fit or eating healthily, people often engage in these behaviours less than they should,” said Dr Ang.\xa0\nWhile he believes that Singapore is still lagging behind in terms of legislation for individual recycling efforts, he is “more inclined” to education than legislation, as the former will be “more sustainable in the long run”.\xa0\nEchoing Mr Khaw’s thoughts on the necessary infrastructure, he added: “All of us want convenience and it is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not somebody will participate in the recycling programmes that we currently have in place.\n“So obviously, if the infrastructure\xa0is not fully mature\xa0or made convenient for one to use, we cannot expect people to participate fully.”\n""COUCH EFFECT""\xa0AND INDIFFERENCE\nEven with education and legislation, consumers still need to be convinced to play a more active role in protecting the environment, said Ms Giri.\xa0\n“I see the ‘couch effect’ is very ingrained in our society and the call to get off and be more proactive - whether in the area of recycling, BYO (bring your own) or supporting low carbon activities - has to be convincing enough to break this indifference,” she added.\xa0\n“The current approach of requesting and appealing to people’s empathy may just not ‘do it’.”\xa0\nAlthough many people in Singapore understand the impact of recycling on climate change, the environment and the long-term sustainability of food and energy supplies, they still do not see the impact of a low recycling rate on their daily lives, said Nanyang Polytechnic’s Mr Khaw.\xa0\nRecounting her conversations with friends who cannot understand why she lives as she does, Ms Lee\xa0confirmed that most of them had views similar to those suggested by the experts CNA spoke to.\xa0\n“I have friends who tell me that it\'s okay, I\'m going to die anyway. By the time the Earth is (in a) really bad (state), I\'m not going to be alive,” she said, adding that this makes her “very, very sad”.\xa0\nNoting that this mentality is “normalised”, Ms Lee\xa0disagreed that younger Singaporeans are very eco-friendly, and emphasised again that she is still part of the minority.\xa0\n“It’s growing, and there are people, but it just so happens that the minorities have a louder voice now, so it seems as though millennials are more eco-friendly.”\nMany youths today are indeed sensitive about the waste that is being generated, said Republic Polytechnic’s Dr Yap.\nResponding to queries, the National Youth Council confirmed that it has seen a steady interest in ground-up environmental projects through funding applications from 2017 to 2019, including ones for recycling initiatives.\xa0\nThe council administers the Young ChangeMakers grant to provide seed funding for ground-up initiatives by youths. The National Youth Fund also supports similar initiatives.\xa0\nEchoing Ms Giri, Ms Lee\xa0said people “don’t like to be told what to do”, and they “don’t see the direct effect” of not being environmentally friendly.\xa0\n“It’s only when you see it happening, like (when) it’s causing harm to you, then you start to (think) like ‘Oh my God, what?""\n\n\nEven climate change scientists struggle to convince people to take action, she added. “I think it\'s because it\'s not yet causing inconvenience to people\'s daily life, therefore, it\'s out of sight out of mind. So they’re not motivated to make a change.”\xa0\nHowever, she is not completely pessimistic about her ability to influence the people around her. After leaving her previous job, a few of her former colleagues told her that they now carry around a reusable bag because of her.\n“And then they said: ‘You know, now if I go to the hawker centre, if I don’t bring a plastic bag I’ll feel really bad.’\n“It could just be one or two people, but can you imagine like it\'s a butterfly effect ... All you just need is to impact one or two people. And then from there, if they impact one or two people on their end, then eventually it spreads.”\nINDUSTRY WASTE\nAnother common refrain Ms Lee\xa0has heard is that the waste produced by a single person makes up a very small and insignificant percentage of the total waste produced.\xa0\nThe absolute amount of non-domestic waste produced far outweighs the amount of waste produced by households. According to NEA statistics, 5.37 million tonnes of non-domestic waste was produced in 2019, compared to 1.87 million tonnes of domestic waste.\xa0\nSimilarly, in 2018, 5.7\xa0million tonnes of waste produced was non-domestic, while 2\xa0million tonnes of waste was produced by households.\xa0\nBoth of these figures saw a drop the next year. Among households, the recycling rate fell from 22 per cent in 2018 to 17 per cent in 2019, while the non-domestic recycling rate decreased from 75 per cent in 2018 to 73 per cent.\nAccording to NEA’s website, the Environmental Public Health Act was amended on Apr 1, 2014 to compel industrial, trade, commercial or manufacturing premises to report waste data and submit waste reduction plans. Owners and managers of large hotels and malls have reported their general waste data and waste reduction plans to NEA since 2014.\nAnd it appears that recycling efforts have improved since the implementation of the Mandatory Waste Reporting Exercise.\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the proportion of premises that recycle increased from 91 to 93 per cent for large hotels and from 80 to 94 per cent for large malls, according to NEA statistics.\xa0\nThe respective industry recycling rates also improved between 2014 and 2018, from 6 per cent to 7.7 per cent for large hotels and 6.7 per cent to 10.7 per cent for large malls.\xa0\nIn Mar 2019, Dr Khor announced that the mandatory waste reporting scheme will be extended\xa0to large industrial developments and convention centres.\nThis will apply to factories, warehouses and convention centres with gross floor areas of more than 20,000 sq\xa0m, 50,000 sq\xa0m\xa0and 8,000 sq\xa0m, respectively. They will need to track the amount of waste they generate from 2020 and submit their first reports to NEA in 2021.\nIn response to queries about how they manage waste and how much is recycled, companies CNA spoke to shared measures they take\xa0to improve recycling and reduce waste.\nIKEA Singapore’s employees collect cardboard and plastic packaging after unpacking goods. They then segregate the packaging materials into recycling bins and sell the cardboard and paper to a recycling provider while providing the plastic free-of-charge.\nThe recycling provider then sells to local traders who ship it to recycling plants in Indonesia, Malaysia or other countries in the region.\xa0\nIKEA’s two stores here collected 1,946 tonnes of carton boxes and 48 tonnes of plastic wrappings in 2019, said the furniture giant, adding that it recycles 73 per cent of its total waste. By 2030, IKEA plans to produce all the home furnishing in its stores from recycled, recyclable or renewable materials.\n\n\nOn the hotel front, Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium recycles 100 per cent of its paper and plastic bottles. Its average paper waste is 100kg a month, while its average plastic bottle waste is about 35kg a month, said a spokesperson.\xa0\nMeanwhile, Marriott International aims to reduce the amount of waste it sends to landfills by 45 per cent, said a spokesperson. All the plastic and paper waste produced at its hotels is recycled, and it has contracted third-party companies to collect the waste on a weekly or monthly basis.\nThe international hotel chain has also placed recycling bins in each guest room and labelled bins for proper waste segregation at back of house areas.\n\n\nSupermarkets also deal with large amounts of packaging waste, and have begun to implement similar initiatives.\nAccording to its 2019 sustainability report, Sheng Siong recycled 7,160 tonnes of carton materials last year, compared to 6,531 tonnes in 2018. It also recycled 7,622 units of wooden pallets in 2019, a sharp increase from 2,914 units in 2018.\xa0\nOther than carton materials, wooden pallets and food waste, Sheng Siong also recycles plastic, stretched film, Styrofoam boxes, cans and metals.\xa0\nNTUC FairPrice said it is currently working to collect data across all FairPrice stores and warehouses to prepare for its first Mandatory Packaging Report, and “it is too soon to be able to share meaningful data”.\xa0\nThe supermarket chain said it is “committed to environmental sustainability in (its) operations where possible” and stands in “full support” of the Government’s measures to reduce packaging waste. It has implemented “green operating procedures” at all FairPrice stores and warehouses, where recyclable waste such as carton boxes are collected for recycling.\nIF IT CAN’T BE RECYCLED, IT BURNS\nSingapore’s recycling rate is also affected by how much of the waste sent to recycling centres - local and overseas - can actually be recycled. With more countries closing their borders to imported waste and low local recycling capacities, more of Singapore’s recyclables may burn in incinerators.\xa0\nAnd this will drive recycling rates back down. With overall recycling rates sticking at about 60 per cent in recent years, Singapore is currently falling short of its 65 per cent Sustainable Development Blueprint target for 2020.\xa0\nThis is part of Singapore\'s journey to meet the United Nations\'\xa0High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development\'s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which in 2015 set goals for countries around the world to take action in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet.\nSingapore\'s 2030 goal has been set at 70 per cent.\xa0\nChina announced in July 2017 that it would no longer import “foreign garbage”. In 2019, 30 per cent of recyclable materials was exported to countries including Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand for processing and recycling, said NEA.\nA CNA report in 2018 found that where public waste collectors used to collect household recyclables, sort out the plastics and sell them to China, they were incinerating them instead.\n\n\nThe “persistently weak global market demand” for plastic recyclables was a key reason\xa0for the drop in the plastic recycling rate in 2019, said NEA, adding that it was “developing our local recycling capabilities” to treat post-consumer plastic waste, including PET beverage bottles.\nExports of recyclables are highly dependent\xa0on demand and supply in the international market, and has been “increasingly constrained by the import policies of other countries” in recent years, the agency said.\nSingapore lacks the large-scale facilities needed to recycle a substantial amount of materials, which is why paper and plastic waste has to be exported, said Ms Melissa Tan, chairman of the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore.\xa0\n“However, when countries like China, Malaysia and Indonesia close their doors to the import of such recyclable wastes, then like food waste, we may have no choice but to incinerate them,” said Ms Tan.\nThe shrinking of regional and global markets for recyclable imports has affected recycling rates “to an extent”, said the manager of non-governmental organisation Zero Waste SG, Ms Pek Hai Lin, adding that Singapore should own its recycling processes “as much as possible"".\xa0\nIn the typical recycling process, a dedicated recycling truck collects the waste from each blue bin, and takes it to a materials recovery facility. The recyclables are then sorted into different waste streams, baled and sent to local and overseas recycling plants.\nSingapore’s largest materials recovery facility, which belongs to Sembcorp, can be found in Tuas. It receives up to 60 tonnes of materials from household collections per day, of which only 50 to 60 per cent is suitable for recycling, as the remaining is contaminated or not recyclable.\n“In general, over the past few years, we have also not seen significant improvement to the contamination level of household recyclables that come through our facility,” said Mr Neo Hong Keat, senior vice-president of waste management at Sembcorp Industries.\n\n\nAs a sorting facility, Sembcorp collects mixed recyclables and relies on a team of 20 workers to sort them into different waste streams, bale them and send them to authorised dealers in Singapore, including recyclers like Plaspulp Union.\nThe plastic recycling facility in Tuas South, which has been around for more than 20 years, receives about 20 to 30 tonnes of plastic a day. The facility can process 30 to 40 tonnes of plastic per day.\xa0\nAbout 5 to 8 per cent of the waste received cannot be recycled, depending on the type of plastic they receive and the contamination rate, said operation manager Jade Loh.\nThe waste is segregated and then put through the recycling machine to be crushed, re-processed and recycled into plastic pellets. The plastic pellets are then sold to bag manufacturers, agricultural firms and moulding companies to make objects like toys and chairs.\nWhen asked why Plaspulp focuses on recycling industrial waste, Ms Loh explained that consumer waste is more difficult to recycle as it is often contaminated.\n“There could be waste residue left over from consumer waste, such as (for) example, a plastic bag could be used to store rubbish, (or it) could have a lot of dirty materials inside,” she said.\n“Therefore, (this) makes it a bit more difficult to recycle in comparison to post-industrial waste where we can just do a little bit of sorting and they’re generally cleaner than consumables.”\nBut the contamination rate from industry players has also improved over the years as they have become more conscious about the cleanliness of the waste they send for recycling, she said, adding that Plaspulp educates their customers on how to handle recyclables as well.\nWhile plastic recycling is its main business, Plaspulp also sorts paper waste and re-processes styrofoam and polyethylene into pellets. In this process, about 2 to 3 per cent of the base material is wasted.\xa0\nRunning a recycling facility is not easy and can be expensive, said Ms Loh, citing high rental and manpower costs. It is also difficult to hire Singaporean workers who have experience sorting the different materials, she added.\xa0\nTemasek Polytechnic’s Dr Ang also noted that Singapore’s practice of discarding recyclable waste in a common blue bin before sorting it at a central facility costs more than sorting it in multiple bins from the start.\n“Therefore, it may appear more cost effective to treat the waste using the usual incineration process,” he said.\nWith such constraints, Plaspulp is one of a “handful” of recyclers left. Several have closed over the past two years, said Ms Loh.\xa0\nWASTE-TO-ENERGY PLANTS TO COMPLEMENT RECYCLING\nTo deal with the waste it cannot export and cannot recycle, Singapore is moving towards more efficient and innovative processes in solid waste management, said Assistant Professor Grzegorz Lisak from the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).\xa0\nHe told CNA that waste-to-energy solutions are already “quite established” in Singapore, with four plants that incinerate non-recyclable combustible waste.\n“This allows for waste volume reduction, which helps to reduce the use of scarce land for waste disposal. Ash from the incineration plants and non-incinerable waste are transported and disposed at Semakau Landfill,” said Asst\xa0Prof Lisak.\xa0\nWaste-to-energy incineration is feasible in Singapore, as it helps to reduce the volume of waste by up to 90 per cent, he added.\xa0\n“Not everything can burn though. There are non-combustible components in waste. It is challenging to recover these materials after (the) incineration process.\xa0\n“If everyone does their part and throws recyclable waste such as glass bottles, metal cans, electronic waste into separate recycling bins, the zero waste initiative would be more effective.”\nNTU operates the only waste-to-energy gasification plant in Singapore - it processes municipal waste to produce synthesis gas that can be used to generate electricity more efficiently than incineration plants, or as feedstock for chemical synthesis from waste.\xa0\n“The technology treats waste, recovering energy just like in the incineration plant while simultaneously recovering materials such as metal and slag, both of which have direct industrial applications,” said Asst\xa0Prof Lisak.\xa0\nThe plant, funded by NEA, NTU, the Economic Development Board and the National Research Foundation, also serves as a testbed for new waste-to-energy solutions.\nAsst\xa0Prof Lisak also noted that there is “an ongoing effort” to further the sustainability of waste management practices, evident from the Government’s plans to construct an integrated waste management facility by 2024 for resource and energy recovery from incinerable waste, recyclables, food waste and sewage sludge.\xa0\n“Going forward, I would presume the Government’s approach will be multi-pronged, with the waste-to-energy efforts being complemented by efforts to boost recycling rates.”\nResponding to questions about whether waste-to-energy plants could be a more worthwhile investment compared to recycling plants, Asst\xa0Prof Lisak stressed that there is “no single waste treatment solution” that works for all types of waste.\xa0\n“Investing in just waste-to-energy plants and not doing the same in recycling plants would be an unsustainable approach. Not only would such an approach involve significant monetary costs, it would also be accompanied by a huge cost to the environment,” he said.\xa0\n“If materials that can be recycled end up in incineration plants, there would be a significant stress on Earth’s natural resources. An ever-increasing amount of our limited natural resources will be consumed in producing fresh goods.”\n“WE ALL DESERVE IT”\nFor Ms Lee, these efforts cannot come any sooner.\n“I am sorry to say we’re ignorant individuals, to be very honest. And that’s not really everybody’s fault - no, it’s just the way society is … when it comes to the Earth,” she said.\n“But it is something that we can change.”\xa0\nIt is ""very important to keep reiterating that it’s not about recycling but reducing"" even though people know ""in theory"" that consumption is what drives production.\xa0With demand and supply comes manufacturing and production, which creates carbon footprints, she added.\xa0\n“It’s simply because human beings create a lot of social norms and behaviours and habits, therefore, there\'s so much demand for certain things which create all these problems … We are trying our best to save the Earth, but then unfortunately most of the human beings are not with us, so I’ve come to the acceptance that we all deserve it.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     In Focus ', '     environment ', '     climate change ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Commentary: This new Ministry of Sustainability and Environment looks pretty promising
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: On Saturday (Jul 25), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced\xa0a new Cabinet which included a reshuffle of portfolios for fourth-generation (4G) leaders, six promotions and three retirements.\nFormer Minister of Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu will move to the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, which has now been renamed the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE).\nExplaining the rationale behind the ministry’s new name, PM Lee noted “sustainability has become an increasingly important part of our national agenda”, which now includes climate change defence and managing the island’s carbon footprint.\nCOVID-19 has also shown Singaporeans how fraught food security and safety is, highlighting the importance of the work of sustainability and climate adaptation.\n\n\nTHE EVOLUTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY’S FOCUS\nThe rebranding of the environment ministry is timely because it acknowledges the new challenges of this generation.\nThe focus of the Ministry has similarly shifted over the decades in keeping up with Singapore’s evolving environmental priorities, with changes in its designation reflective of such changes.\nMSE began in 1972 as the Ministry of Environment, which took on pollution control, sewage management and environmental health protection.\nWith the establishment of NEWater as a key strategic water source, the ministry was aptly renamed in September 2004 the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR).\nSingapore now faces greater pressure on water and energy resources as global population and demand increases. Climate change is a long-term and high-priority issue that has not diminished, COVID-19 or otherwise.\nMSE will be committed to providing Singaporeans with a clean and sustainable environment, and resilient supplies of safe food and water. It will continue to work through its three statutory boards – the\xa0National Environment Agency (NEA),\xa0national water agency Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the\xa0Singapore Food Agency (SFA).\nMinister Grace Fu is the 12th minister to take over this portfolio, and is the first female minister in Singapore to be in charge of the sustainability and environment portfolio.\nShe joins Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor, who has been with MEWR since 2006, first as Senior Parliamentary Secretary, then as a Minister of State before her current role as Senior Minister of State.\n\n\nBut Minister Fu is not new to the environment portfolio. \xa0In 2011, she was appointed Senior Minister of State in the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and in August 2012, assumed the role of Second Minister. She was put in charge of the Municipal Services Office in 2014.\xa0\nIn a Facebook post following the Cabinet reshuffle, Minister Fu noted that the renaming of the Ministry is “meaningful and significant, as sustainability has always been a part of Singapore’s DNA”.\nShe cited the vision of Singapore’s pioneer generation of leaders who laid the “solid foundation for the green and liveable city that we enjoy today”.\n\n\nGROWING COMPLEXITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nThe Ministry’s renaming suggests environmental issues have become more complex, requiring greater interdependency with other ministry portfolios.\nFor example, MSE would have to work with other agencies and research institutions to generate new green jobs and business opportunities for Singapore.\nSustainability already is an important part of Singapore’s national agenda, but even more so as the Government tries to support the diverse needs and growing aspirations of Singaporeans. This will necessitate an evolution of the rules of engagement.\nEnvironment and sustainability are key areas of empowerment and action for individuals, communities and businesses. In recent times, Singapore youth have shown to want to take greater ownership of sharing their perspectives on climate action.\nThe National Youth Survey 2016 revealed that one in four youth have participated in environmental conservation efforts. This number is likely to have increased in the last few years.\nUnder Minister Fu’s leadership as Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, the SG Youth Action Plan announced in 2019 laid the foundations as a platform for youth to co-deliberate and co-deliver policies together, particularly in areas concerning the environment, the future of work and social issues.\nA series of Youth Conversations held throughout 2018 highlighted that these specific topics were among the top concerns of Singaporean youths.\nIn her Facebook post, Minister Fu also thanked outgoing Minister Masagos Zulkifli, who will be heading the Ministry of Social and Family Development, as well as previous Environment Ministers for their contributions.\n\n\nUnder Minister Masagos, 2018 was declared Singapore’s Year of Climate Action, generating over 800 climate action events and more than 340,000 pledges of climate action from individuals and organisations.\nIn 2019, the Ministry pushed for a Year Towards Zero Waste and launched the country’s inaugural Zero Waste Masterplan which maps out Singapore’s key strategies to build a sustainable, resource-efficient and climate-resilient nation.\nThe landmark Resource Sustainability Act was also passed in Parliament, to encourage resource sustainability and the adoption of the circular economy.\n\n\nMSE will also continue to play a key role in efforts to protect Singapore against rising sea levels, as announced by PM Lee at the National Day Rally 2019.\xa0\nLast year, MEWR announced a\xa0S$10 million National Sea Level Research Programme to boost the understanding of sea levels around Singapore and develop more robust projections of this threat to Singapore.\nThe new Climate Science Research Programme Office set up under the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) and new Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions at the National University of Singapore are also part of plans to boost climate science capabilities to allow Singapore to better address climate change and sustainability in the future.\n\n\nWORKING WITH OTHER AGENCIES\nMSE will also play a key role in ensuring food security. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) was established last April to put all food issues under one agency, and to ensure a safe and secure supply of food for Singapore.\nIn late 2019, a multi-agency workgroup was setup to tackle the twin issues of food waste and food insecurity in Singapore. This was co-led by then Minister for Social and Family Development\xa0Desmond Lee, whose portfolio will be taken over by Minister Masagos Zulkifli.\nThe new MSE will benefit from placing more emphasis on collaborative action and partnership. MEWR has already led the way in 2019 by engaging multiple stakeholders on measures to address Singapore’s key waste streams.\nOver 250 companies were engaged, and 1,300 respondents had taken part in an online public consultation, followed closely by two focus group discussions co-organised in partnership with two local civil society groups – Zero Waste SG and LepakInSG.\n\n\nIn tackling waste management in Singapore, MEWR was intentional about co-creating and implementing zero-waste initiatives with stakeholders.\nIn the coming months, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will be convening a new Citizens’ Workgroup to address the excessive consumption of disposables in Singapore.\nThis will be held from September 2020 to March 2021, and is in line with the SGTogether movement, where the Government aims to partner Singaporeans in new ways to design and implement ideas, programmes and policies together.\nALL HANDS ON DECK\nWith the progressively\xa0more intricate and demanding challenges from climate change and growing resource constraints, Singapore needs all hands on deck to rally partners and other countries in mitigation efforts while adapting to climate change.\n\n\nSingapore is also seeing a more active citizenry when it comes to environmental policy. Partnership has started to go beyond co-organising events and support for one another and toward building greater trust and transparency.\nOne example is the MEWR-NYC Youth Circle, where youth leaders are working with MEWR on policy recommendations, such as on reducing food waste.\nBut improvements can be made to share more information and demonstrate how feedback and engagement have been incorporated into policy and programmes.\nAfter all, Singapore must harness the energy and knowledge of our people, so as to find new ways to solve increasingly complex environmental challenges.\nMelissa Low is a Research Fellow at the Energy Studies Institute, National University of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     cabinet ', '     Grace Fu ', '     environment ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Head of Indonesian peatland agency says he is 'very optimistic' there will be no forest fires this year 
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: The head of Indonesia’s Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) Nazir Foead\xa0said\xa0that he is ""very optimistic""\xa0there will be no fires this year in the peatlands under his supervision.\xa0\nSpeaking to CNA in an exclusive interview on Monday (Jul 20), he said that\xa0the agency has improved the\xa0methods for preventing\xa0fires from happening this time round.\nHe said that BRG has\xa0set up about 150 sensors in non-concession peatlands that can\xa0measure the water and moisture level\xa0every hour.\nThese readings would indicate how susceptible the peatlands are to\xa0fires.\xa0 They will also give an indication if someone has purposely drained the peatland with the aim of setting fires to clear the land.\nThe BRG would send this information to relevant authorities, including law enforcers.\nWhen asked\xa0how optimistic he is that no fires will happen this year, Mr Foead replied: ""Very optimistic because we are working very hard.”\nThe meteorological, climatological, and geophysical agency (BMKG) has predicted a wetter dry season this year, which would also lower the chances of forest and land fires happening.\nDespite this, the other government agencies have warned the BRG to remain vigilant, especially amid COVID-19, said Mr Foead.\nThe pandemic has brought economic hardship as a result of social restrictions put in place to curb the disease and now millions in Indonesia are out of jobs.\n“They warned us. They said that those capitalists (brokers) who want to use this opportunity to clear land using fires will find it cheaper to pay people to burn land,” he said.\n“(Because) people need more money.”\nAuthorities have long said that forest and land fires are man-made to clear land, worsened by dry weather.\n“So they (authorities) warned us: ‘Be prudent, be prepared, you need to have a stronger intelligence, stronger patrols … The bad capitalists out there are\xa0trying to gain an advantage in the situation.\n""There’s always those kinds of people and this year they can find easier and cheaper troops to do that,” Mr Foead said.\n“So the danger is still high.”\nAfter Indonesia\xa0experienced huge forest and land fires in 2015, which resulted in deaths, economic loss\xa0and transboundary haze, President Joko Widodo set up the BRG in Jan 2016 to prevent similar incidents.\xa0\n89% OF NON-CONCESSION PEATLAND HAS BEEN RESTORED\nWhen the agency was first set up, Mr Foead said his team spent the first year planning how to restore peatlands which includes rewetting, revegetating, and revitalising economic livelihood in seven provinces\xa0where peatlands are mainly found.\nPeatland is an accumulation of multiple layers of organic material such as mosses and plants.\nThus, when it gets burned, the fires would be\xa0harder to extinguish\xa0than fires on mineral soil as the flames\xa0would continue to smoulder beneath the surface.\xa0\xa0\nIn the provinces of Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan and Papua, the BRG is\xa0continuously educating\xa0people about the importance of peatland restoration, he said.\nThere are about 2.6 million ha\xa0of peatland in the seven provinces, about 1.7 million ha of them are on concession lands which are the responsibility\xa0of companies.\nThe companies are mainly dealing with\xa0palm oil, pulp and paper as well as timber.\nThe environment and forestry ministry is\xa0responsible for overseeing peatland on concession lands, while the BRG is responsible for about 900,000\xa0ha of peatland on non-concession lands which are community lands.\nMr Foead said that\xa089 per cent of the peatland on non-concession land\xa0has\xa0been restored\xa0as of the end of 2019. The target set by the government is to achieve 100 per cent by the end of this year.\nMr Foead noted how local farmers have taken ownership of the peatlands and have even planted pineapples, vegetables and coffee on the lands.\nCommenting on the remaining target, he said: “We are confident when it comes to the non-concession lands.”\nHowever, he noted that forest and land fires are not only dependent on the moisture level of peatland. Tough law enforcement is also crucial to ensure people would not deliberately set\xa0fires anymore.\nPEATLAND RESTORATION ""CANNOT BE DONE QUICKLY""\nMr Foead told CNA that peatland restoration should be a long term effort, as the land cannot be rehabilitated in a short period of time.\nHe explained that if peatland has been drained since 1999, for example, it would need 10 or even 20 years to be restored.\n“Based on cases abroad, there are even instances which take up to 30 years.\xa0Even those have not restored completely,” Mr Foead said.\n\xa0“So ecosystem restoration takes time. It cannot be done quickly.”\nThe BRG chief, who used to work for the World Wildlife\xa0Fund\xa0also said that his\xa0agency is trying new methods of peatland mapping, which combines coring with three-dimensional satellite images.\nWith an improved methodology, the agency will have access to\xa0land categorisation data. It can then take samples according to every category, which is a quicker and cheaper way of\xa0mapping.\nConsidering the new technologies and methods the BRG now has, backed up by civil society, communities, and governments as well as policies, Mr Foead\xa0is hopeful that\xa0Indonesia can be a champion in peatland restoration.\n“I would really like to see that we will prove this is the most effective way in protecting, maintaining and restoring peatlands.\n“We have a lot to share with\xa0the world, mostly tropical countries that\xa0have huge peatlands. Or maybe any rehabilitation programme\xa0in any biome, not only peatlands but also wetland habitats, we can share a lot.”\xa0 \xa0\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Indonesia on high alert for forest fires until November as dry season is delayed: Environment minister
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: Indonesia needs to be on extra alert for possible forest fires until at least November as there is a delay in this year’s dry season, said Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar on Friday (Jul 17).\nCiting data from the meteorological, climatological, and geophysical agency (BMKG), Mdm Bakar said\xa0the peak of the dry season in several areas of the country is expected to begin\xa0in August and September.\nIn previous years, the peak of the dry season began\xa0around\xa0July and August. By October, the rainy season will arrive. \xa0\n“This means, we need to work hard until October and November. This makes (me) uneasy.\xa0We will continue to monitor this,” the minister said.\nThe BMKG has\xa0forecasted a wetter dry season this year.\nBetween Jan 1 to Jul 15 this year, the ministry noted 919 hotspots in Indonesia compared to 1,655 hotspots during the same period last year.\nBut it does not mean the ministry is taking the forest fires lightly, Mdm Bakar said, especially since the country is combatting COVID-19.\n“COVID-19 and land and forest fires must not occur simultaneously, I’m very afraid of that,” Mdm Bakar said.\nTo prevent the fires from recurring this year, the ministry is focusing on improving the technical weather modification system. This means\xa0coordinating closely with various agencies and having solid weather and climate analysis.\xa0\nIt is also increasing communities’ law awareness by working together with village heads, local authorities and local disaster agencies to educate people about forest and land fires.\xa0\nThe ministry also aims to find alternatives ways of land clearing which does not involve slashing and burning such as using bush cutters, said Mdm Bakar.\nIndonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil and each year, fires are linked to slash-and-burn practices used to clear areas for palm oil cultivation. This has in the past resulted in transboundary haze.\nLast year's fires were particularly damaging, with 1.6 million hectares of forest and peatland burned.\nAs of Friday, six provinces have declared a state of emergency,\xa0namely: Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Hong Kong: Sustaining nature in an urban jungle
  </h1>, 'text': ""Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities on earth – but it is also home to a vast number of plant and animal species that are spread out over 1,106 sq km of land area, including over 200 offshore islands.\nIts sheer wealth of biodiversity is impressive. According to\xa0the Environment Bureau of Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department\xa0(AFCD), the number of birds recorded in Hong Kong constitutes over a third of all birds in China. The waters around Hong Kong also hold more hard coral species than the entire Caribbean Sea.\nHong Kong’s rich biodiversity includes over 3,300 species of vascular plants – including 2,100 native species – and over 1,000 species of marine fishes. It is home to the critically endangered Chinese white dolphin,\xa0of which there are only an estimated 47 remaining in Hong Kong waters.\nThe Hong Kong government has made a substantial effort to balance the needs of its natural environment with those of its city inhabitants. Over 40 per cent (or 44,300 ha) of Hong Kong’s territory has been designated as country parks or special areas, and in 2016, the AFCD announced a five-year Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to drive biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.\nADDRESSING THREATS TO CONSERVATION\nDespite this, there are still numerous threats that stem from ongoing development. As one of the most densely populated areas on earth, Hong Kong faces the constant need for housing, facilities and infrastructure to accommodate its 7.5 million inhabitants.\nPolicymakers face the difficult task of balancing the population’s needs with maintaining the pristine nature of Hong Kong’s lush natural environment. One of its largest and most ecologically valuable wetlands, the Mai Po Nature Reserve and Inner Deep Bay, is where 50,000 to 80,000 migratory water birds arrive annually to rest, feed and spend the winter. Among these birds are an estimated 35 globally-threatened species, like the spoon-billed sandpiper, greater spotted eagle and black-faced spoonbill.\nIn addition to providing a safe wintering spot for birds, the wetlands\xa0filter water-borne pollutants and take in excess water\xa0during the monsoon floods, protecting coastal communities. However, that same ability to absorb large amounts of water makes the wetlands ideal for conversion to an agricultural site. Other wetlands have also been filled in to provide roads and apartment housing.\nIn response, the AFCD has divided the Mai Po area into zones. Access to the core zones is restricted, to leave the ecological cycles that take place there undisturbed. Less critical zones have more flexible usage, such as being designated for sustainable aquaculture facilities. These zones also serve as buffers to protect the core, leaving it untouched by human hands.\nIn the last 15 years, urban construction that takes place near or within ecologically sensitive areas in Hong Kong has become subject to environmental and sustainability requirements. The government has also worked with private enterprises to integrate natural elements such as water bodies and vegetation into developments and to promote sustainable initiatives like urban forestry.\nSuch compromises are part and parcel of Hong Kong’s delicate balancing act between its precious biodiversity and modern economy. For this to succeed, though, policymakers must join forces with individuals and companies that are equally committed to sustaining the wealth of Hong Kong’s natural environment.\nBRINGING NATURE AND CITY TOGETHER\nMultinational companies like MSIG are playing their part to protect biodiversity for long-term environmental sustainability in Hong Kong.\nLast April, MSIG Hong Kong encouraged staff to go paperless. Departments competed to see who could use less paper, spurred on by monthly internal emails that track the approximate number of trees saved by each department. By end 2019, the company achieved almost 20 per cent less paper used, compared to 2018, equivalent to saving approximately 130 trees – 59 per cent of the total number of trees in Hong Kong’s Chater Garden.\nThe company also launched a reusable business card initiative that saved over 200 boxes of paper name cards. Each MSIG staff member was issued a reusable plastic card with a QR code imprinted, enabling the employee’s name and contact details to be easily scanned and saved to a user’s phone. This contactless approach eliminates the need to pass around and manage paper name cards. Clients and business partners also do not need to input contact information into their phones manually.\nIn addition, MSIG rolled out a public green diet campaign, which saw local farmers teaming up with two well-known Hong Kong food bloggers to show how eating organically can help to reduce our carbon footprint on the environment. The campaign’s Facebook posts shared healthy and sustainable recipes and demonstrated the value of organic farming to the environment to an audience of over 814,000 users. From kitchens to offices, people in Hong Kong are seeking a renewed relationship with the lush natural landscape and rich biodiversity surrounding them.\nThese initiatives in Hong Kong are part of MSIG’s ongoing advocacy of protecting biodiversity and building a sustainable future for everyone. From\xa0replanting mangroves in Thailand\xa0to sharing the importance of biodiversity\xa0with schoolchildren in Indonesia, the company aims to do its part in protecting biodiversity, not just for the future of the planet, but for ourselves and the generations to come.\nFor more stories on MSIG's efforts on protecting biodiversity across the region, visit\xa0msig.com.hk/biodiversity.

      Small traders, manufacturers feel the pinch as Jakarta’s single-use plastic bag ban kicks in
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA:\xa0Wet market vendor Miasih, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, lamented that life is hard these days.\nSince COVID-19 broke out in Indonesian capital Jakarta four months ago, she has been commuting using\xa0bajajs (auto rickshaws) instead of e-hailing bikes to minimise the risk of getting infected\xa0even though it is more costly.\nNow, she has to comply with a new regulation which bans single-use plastic bags at traditional markets, supermarkets and retailers in Jakarta, which came into effect on\xa0Wednesday (Jul 1).\xa0\nWhile plastic bags with handles are prohibited,\xa0disposable plastic bags for meat and fish are still allowed.\xa0Despite so, the 60-year-old chicken vendor in South Jakarta said the ban has affected her sales.\n“Some buyers were confused about the ban, and decided not to buy my chicken as they did not have recyclable bags with them,” she told CNA, adding that she could not offer an alternative.\nFish seller Nawawi, who has a stall at a South Jakarta wet market, has similar concerns.\nWhile he understands that the regulation is meant to save the environment, he said small traders like him are left to bear the brunt of the ban.\nThe 45-year-old said it would mean extra costs for him if he were to provide alternatives\xa0for his customers.\nJakarta’s Governor Anies Baswedan said on Wednesday that the ban is part of the administration’s commitment to transform the city into an environmentally friendly capital.\nInstead of using single-use plastic bags, citizens are encouraged to use eco-friendly bags made of materials such as leaf, paper, cloth, polyester and its derivatives, as well as recycled materials.\n""So this is part of our efforts in Jakarta to ensure that our city is becoming increasingly friendly to the environment. And activities in the community are activities that leave no residue that cannot be recycled.\n“When residue cannot be recycled, it causes problems not only for our generation but also for future generations. We need to change our behaviour so that everyone and every activity in Jakarta takes sustainable development into account,” he said on the first day of the ban.\nThe government pointed out that a landfill in Bantargebang, which is located in\xa0neighbouring city Bekasi, is almost full and dominated by plastic.\xa0Majority of waste in this landfill is produced by Jakarta residents.\xa0\nTo ensure compliance to the plastic bag ban, violators will first be issued a written warning, and then\xa0fined between 5 million rupiah (US$350) and 25 million rupiah.\xa0\nErrant traders\' business permits\xa0could also be revoked.\nA GREAT FIRST STEP: ENVIRONMENTALISTS\nWith the ban, the Jakarta government aimed to reduce the city’s plastic waste by 50 per cent.\nWhile applauding the move, head of Greenpeace Indonesia Leonard Simanjuntak said he remained cautious about its success.\n“While it will reduce the amount of plastic waste in Jakarta, which stands at around 14 per cent of the total 7,500 tonnes per day, it may be a bit too optimistic to think that it will automatically reduce the plastic waste by 50 per cent as the Jakarta government has stated.\n“Plastic bags constitute only less than 10 per cent of plastic waste, according to some research. Styrofoam may constitute more than 50 per cent of plastic waste, and yet there\'s no ban on Styrofoam,” he said.\nMs Tiza Mafira, executive director of Indonesia Plastic Bag Diet Movement, said a 2018 study estimated that 300 million plastic bags were used annually in modern retail stores in Jakarta.\xa0\n""That is the estimated number of bags we hope to save,"" she said, adding that the ban was a great significant step for Jakarta.\xa0\nReusables are safe to use with proper care, Ms Mafira said.\xa0\n“In fact in other cities with a similar ban, the demand for reusables has created a new economy for local crafts,” she said, referring to woven bags and baskets.\nBAN MAY LEAD TO JOB LOSS: PLASTIC MANUFACTURERS\nPlastic manufacturers, who are opponents of the plastic bag ban, said the city\'s problem lies in its\xa0waste management system and not the plastic product.\nIndonesian Association of Olefin, Aromatic and Plastic Industry secretary-general Fajar Budiyono said if Jakarta wants to become an environmentally friendly city,\xa0it should improve its waste management system.\nAn outright ban of single-use plastic bags would only lead to economic problems, he said.\n“Plastic bag producers\xa0employ around 200,000 people nationwide, and about 30 per cent of them work\xa0in Jakarta.\xa0\n“The ban could eventually lead to the retrenchment of workers,” Mr Budiyono said.\nThose who would also be affected by the ban included scavengers and the recycling industry, he added.\nMr Budiyono said as long as there is no better solution, especially one that is more economically viable, people would continue to use plastic bags.\nEnvironmentalists also acknowledged that the new regulation may simply lead to new behaviour and habits that are not necessarily environmentally friendly.\nHousewife Dora Mandera, 44, admitted that since her local supermarket stopped giving out single-use plastic bags, she has been using plastic trash bags when she goes shopping.\n“Because we still need plastic to throw our garbage, to line our garbage bin so the bin won’t get dirty,” she said, adding that many garbage collectors refuse to collect trash if it is not in a plastic bag.\nDespite the pushback, Mr Baswedan, the governor, is determined to carry on with the ban.\n“We will enforce this … (and)\xa0proactively supervise the society.\n“We hope that with this regulation we can make Jakarta environmentally friendlier,” he said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     environment ']}"

      Greens up pressure on Macron after election wins
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS:\xa0France\'s Greens on Monday (Jun 29) urged President Emmanuel Macron to prioritise the environment as they savoured big wins in municipal elections, seen by many as a rebuke of the centrist leader\'s top-down governing style during his first three years in office.\nYannick Jadot, head of the Europe Ecology - Green Party (EELV), said the results proved that Macron had been ""in denial"" over growing public demand for ambitious measures to fight climate change.\nJadot told Europe 1 radio the EELV would not join Macron\'s government as part of a widely expected cabinet shake-up.\xa0\nHe said\xa0instead the president should enact ""as he promised"" 149 measures proposed this month by his Citizen\'s Convention on Climate.\nMacron will meet the council\'s members on Monday when he plans a ""first response"" to their proposals, which included reducing motorway speed limits and making ""ecocide"" a crime.\nVoters handed the Greens control of key cities including Lyon, Bordeaux and Strasbourg, while Socialist Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was re-elected after forming an alliance with the EELV.\nTraditional rightwing and Socialist parties managed respectable showings, with the rightwing Republicans winning in more than half of cities with more than 9,000 residents.\nMacron\'s Republic on the Move, however, was roundly rejected, with only five of 10 ministers in his government securing wins in the cities they contested.\nThey included his Prime Minister Edouard Philippe - even though he isn\'t a card-carrying LREM member -\xa0who was elected mayor of the Atlantic port city of Le Havre, heightening speculation he could leave the government and give Macron the possibility of naming a more left-leaning premier.\n""INTERNAL DIVISIONS""\nThe delayed second round of local polls took place more than three months after the March 15 first round held two days before France\'s coronavirus lockdown.\nGovernment spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye expressed ""disappointment"" late Sunday over the LREM\'s poor showing, which analysts attributed to Macron\'s failure to build the party into a viable force at the local level.\n""There are places... where our own internal divisions brought us to results that were extremely disappointing,"" Ndiaye told French television.\nIn Paris in particular, LREM candidate Agnes Buzyn, the former health minister, was hobbled by a dissident LREM candidate, star mathematician Cedric Villani.\nHidalgo, who has vowed to limit the use of cars in the French capital, thanked voters in her victory speech for choosing ""a Paris that breathes, a Paris that is more agreeable to live in"".\n""EMERGING VICTORIOUS""\nMarine Le Pen\'s far-right National Rally, meanwhile, claimed a big victory in Perpignan in the south, giving it control of a city with more than 100,000 inhabitants for the first time since 1995.\nYet overall, only 40 percent of the country\'s 16.5 million eligible voters cast ballots, a record-low turnout that reflected both disapproval of Macron and coronavirus contagion fears.\nLe Pen called the nationwide no-show ""astonishing"" and far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said it amounted to ""a civic strike"".\nMacron expressed his concern over the low turnout and acknowledged the elections were marked by a ""green wave"", the presidency said.\nPolls suggest he is likely to face Le Pen in a presidential vote now just 22 months away, a likelihood that will loom large in any government reshuffle.\n', 'related_topics': ['     France ', '     environment ', '     politics ']}"

      COVID-19 cuts force Indonesia to scale back forest protection
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Indonesia has scaled back protection for some of the world\'s most important tropical forests ahead of the worst season for fires because of budget cuts due to the coronavirus, the environment ministry said.At risk are forests bigger than any outside the Amazon and Congo.\nThey are also\xa0home to more than a tenth of the world\'s mammal species - including the rare orangutan - and nearly a fifth of its birds.Fires, often set to clear land for palm oil plantations in the world\'s top producer of the commodity, were the most damaging in years in 2019. It is still early in the June-October dry season, when most land is cleared, to get a clear picture of what\'s happening this year.\nBut according to an analysis of satellite data, the forest land thought to have been cleared in the first 24 weeks of 2020 was about 400,000 ha, an increase from 300,000 ha in the same period last year.\nThe economic impact of the coronavirus in the Southeast Asian country meant there had been a 50 per cent\xa0budget cut for the team that finds fires and helps put them out, an environment ministry official said.""Integrated patrol areas had to be cut by 34 per cent,"" Basar Manullang, director of forest fire control at the Indonesian environment ministry told Reuters, referring to joint patrols by the forest fire brigade, army, police and civilian volunteers.Meanwhile, layoffs resulting from the impact of COVID-19\xa0were encouraging more people to clear land for crops using fire, said Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, director general of climate change control in environment and forestry ministry.And social distancing rules imposed in some areas were making it harder to tackle fires.""It hampers our access to the flames,"" he told reporters.\n\nIndonesia\'s economy is forecast to shrink for the first time since 1999 as a result of the coronavirus, which has killed over 2,600 people, by far Southeast Asia\'s highest toll. Nearly US$50 billion is being channelled into emergency programmes, meaning cuts elsewhere.The environment and forest minister told parliament this week that an extra US$35 million was needed to fight forest fires this year, while President Joko Widodo called for the tough enforcement of laws to stop illegal fires.""99 per cent\xa0of forest fires occur because of humans,"" Widodo said.WARNINGEnvironmentalists said the impact of the budget cuts on efforts to stop fires could be dire.According to Global Forest Watch\'s ""deforestation alerts"", satellite imagery shows an even greater rise in the loss of primary forest areas this year compared to previous years - areas where trees have never been felled and have the greatest diversity of species.""There is a real risk of another ecological and health disaster in 2020,"" said Kiki Taufik, head of Greenpeace Southeast Asia Forest campaign.Last year\'s fires were the worst since 2015.According to official figures, at least 1.6 million ha\xa0of forest and other land were burned - more than 20 times the area of Singapore. Losses were estimated at US$5.2 billion while choking haze from the fires spread through the region.Because of the budget cuts, a firefighter from the Indonesian Forest Fire Control Brigade in the fire prone Kalimantan island, said the force was looking at new ways to work.""We are relying more on reports from the public because patrolling has reduced,"" Agus Maksum told Reuters.

      Bring your own containers take a backseat at some eateries amid COVID-19 pandemic
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When\xa0Julia Anna Deufel went to her regular coffee haunt in Bukit Timah recently with her reusable mug, she was not allowed to use it.\xa0\nThe 27-year-old was surprised as the store encourages such Bring Your Own (BYO) practices and sells its own mugs for this purpose. The store offers a discount for using such reusables as well.\n""I was informed that they were not accepting BYO for hygiene reasons,"" Ms Deufel said.\xa0\nHer experience during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been unique. While some shops have eased\xa0their restrictions on\xa0reusables since Singapore exited a two-month “circuit breaker” period, others have kept to them.\nIn turn, the circuit breaker period, designed to limit the spread of COVID-19, led to an increase in disposable containers and cutlery usage, according to a survey released recently. An additional 1,334 tonnes of plastic waste, equivalent to the weight of 92 double-decker buses, was generated from takeaway and delivery meals during the period, the study found.\nThe study involved six alumni students from the National University of Singapore’s Master of Science (Environmental Management) programme, who surveyed\xa01,110 households. The respondents were asked a\xa0set of multiple-choice and open ended questions, including the frequency of buying takeaway meals and ordering meals via delivery platforms before and during the circuit breaker. Respondents were also asked whether they opted for disposable containers and cutlery when ordering.\nThe increase comes despite the Government urging people to use their own clean containers to adopt more sustainable practices, when the only way to order food and drinks is to takeaway.\xa0\nWHY REUSABLES ARE DISALLOWED AT SOME PLACES\xa0\nCNA\'s checks with coffee shops like Dutch Colony Co and Starbucks showed that these outlets were not accepting reusable items as of Monday this week. At the stores, employees pointed to hygiene reasons for not allowing the use of these items.\xa0\nIn explaining the move, firms that responded to CNA also said that it was for hygiene reasons.\nA spokesperson for bubble tea chain Koi said that the firm stopped accepting reusable bottles and cups around the second week of March.\xa0\n""Bottles and cups come into direct contact with a person’s mouth and it is common for traces of body fluids, like saliva, to remain and be in the bottles and cups after usage or even a quick rinse,"" he said.\xa0\nHe added that because employees cannot ascertain how each reusable item is washed, ""every reusable bottle and cup introduced into our beverage preparation space is a potential for cross contamination"".\xa0\nBeverages are crafted close\xa0to one another in our operation space with the same set of craft wares, and cross-contamination would affect subsequent beverages, he said.\xa0\nHe added that it was “not operationally feasible” to do a full clean up on\xa0beverage preparation space after every reusable bottle or cup is used.\xa0\xa0\n“This is the same principle as the required Food Safety & Hygiene measure, where (an) employee\'s\xa0personal bottle or cup must be stored in a designated space, away from the beverage preparation station for our customers,"" he said.\n“Our objective is to protect all our customers and frontline employees. We will continue to review this temporary measure of not accepting reusable bottles and cups, while monitoring the Covid-19 situation.""\nSimilarly, Sharetea said the decision to stop accepting reusable containers at its outlets was announced on Mar 22.\xa0\nIt was one way to protect employees at outlets, a spokesperson said.\xa0\n“Whilst we welcome our customers to bring their own cups, we have no way of confirming if the container has been washed thoroughly prior to their visit. As our staff would have to handle the containers during preparation of drinks, we wanted to minimize the risk of any potential contamination instore,” she said.\xa0\xa0\nWhile an increasing number of customers had been taking their own containers to the outlets, ""we are at a point whereby hygiene and safety is of paramount importance, thus we can understand why BYO is now taking a step back during this pandemic.\xa0“We would like to be conservative in our approach and try our best to minimize any potential risks as best as we can.”\nWoobbee brand manager Benjamin Lim said that his stores also stopped allowing BYO in March to “protect both customers and staff” because staff cannot guarantee that the coronavirus is not on the reusable container.\xa0\nBut with dining-in being allowed again, he said that such reusables are likely to be allowed in July.\nSome eateries have opted for a\xa0solution by offering the rental of reusable items through firms like barePack And Muuse.\xa0\nThrough these firms, consumers can use an app, place an order at the eatery, and scan a QR code to retrieve a reusable item. barePack has signed on 60 cafes and restaurants, while Muuse has signed on more than 40 food and beverage outlets.\xa0\nFounder of barePack Roxane Uzureau-Zhu said that people may be leaning towards such greener solutions as they are being confronted by the plastic waste they generate in a “new way”.\nShe added that the convenience of not having to remember to leave home with a reusable item may be making more of them lean towards solutions such as her firm’s.\xa0\nIS THERE REALLY A RISK?\nIn response to queries from CNA, the Singapore Food Agency said it encourages everyone to bring their own clean containers at eateries. This would reduce the amount of waste generated and ease the demand for disposable containers. In turn, retailers should allow their customers to use their own reusable containers.\nSFA said that contact with personal or reusable food containers is “no different from contact with other common touch surfaces” like lift buttons and door knobs. “There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is spread through food,” a spokesperson added.\xa0\nHowever, she cautioned that if consumers bring their own reusable containers for takeaway, they should ensure that the container, including its exterior, is washed thoroughly with detergent and water and is clean before use and that they should wash hands thoroughly before touching takeaway container and before eating.\nIt is “more important” that individuals exercise good social responsibility and personal hygiene by doing things like not sharing food or drinks with others, and washing hands with soap and water before eating and going to the toilet, she added.\xa0\nInfectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam, who also practises BYO and has faced some rejection from eateries, said that they could be responding with fear instead of logic.\xa0\n“The risk is extremely remote of COVID-19 spreading through reusable containers,” he said. He also stressed that washing hands regularly will help to contain any risk.\nHe added that users of reusable items should make sure their itemis clean, and that putting containers in a sealed reusable bag would make BYO even safer.\n“A rinse of the container will wash out any virus,” he said.\xa0\nDr Serena Caucci, senior research associate at United Nations University (UNU-FLORES) based in Germany said that contact with a reusable container from an infected person could theoretically allow for the transmission of droplets from the reusable to the next person that handles the container.\nHer research interests include contaminants of emerging concern and sustainable development.\nHowever, she said: “The use of reusable items is unlikely to spread the coronavirus, if both vendors and customers take proper hygiene measures like washing the containers thoroughly, for example, in the dishwasher or disinfecting, in between the use of these items.”\nIf hygiene measures are not respected, the reusable container could become contaminated, she added.\n“As with many other items handled by infected individuals, the droplets on the surfaces of the reusable boxes or cups could enter the eateries’ process and lead to the transfer of the droplets in the food delivery chain, posing a risk to the next customers or the workers themselves.”\nWhether eateries should allow the use of reusables is not straightforward, she said, “especially when we must consider personal habits and hygiene awareness at the individual level”.\n“Epidemiologists and infectious diseases experts have stressed enough that washing hands is the biggest priority when speaking of precautionary measures. If we think about the risk of contracting COVID-19 or transmitting it to others, there is a higher chance that this occurs due to poor hand hygiene practices compared to the use of reusable containers,” she added.\nHowever, she said that the risk could be linked to the diversity of individual standards of hygiene among the population.\xa0\n“The impossibility of knowing the sanitation standards applied to reusables generates thus difficulties in the acceptance of the “bring your own” approach,” she said.\xa0\nEateries therefore\xa0 have the right to be concerned, she said.\xa0 However, she said that under the current circumstances, increased hygiene requirements and measures should already be enforced in eateries, covering also the washing technology of utensils and standards put in place for dishwashing personnel as recommended by the World Health Organisation.\n“The odds of contracting the virus in this way are low but it is sensible to take precautions. We must not forget that beyond the use of reusables, other actions like handling cash or handling the packaging of single-use boxes could anyway have the same role in helping spread the virus,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     environment ']}"

      Driven by passion, young vet travels across Indonesia to rescue large marine animals
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: It was midnight when Ida Ayu Dian Kusuma Dewi and her husband, both veterinarians, rushed to an animal lab in southern Bali.\xa0\nThey were informed that a turtle conservation group had just sent an injured sea turtle over from\xa0northern Bali, which was a four-hour drive away. It was bleeding excessively after being hit by a propeller.\xa0\nThe couple ended up\xa0performing\xa0surgery on the turtle until 3am in the late 2018 incident.\xa0\n“It was something nice to remember because I have never performed a surgery on a sea turtle before.\n“The turtle\xa0was really strong, it was fidgeting\xa0as if to say\xa0‘Ah, don’t do anything to me, leave me alone,’” the 28-year-old told CNA.\nDewi and her husband were ecstatic when they managed to save the turtle. It recuperated at a\xa0conservation centre for several months before it was released back to the ocean.\nAs members of IAM (Indonesia Aquatic Megafauna) Flying Vet, an association of Indonesian veterinarians focusing on marine animals, it is their duty to handle sick or stranded aquatic animals\xa0whether alive or dead throughout Indonesia.\nThe organisation was founded in May 2018 and has so far handled over 250 animals, mostly sea turtles, whales, dugongs and dolphins.\nThe 30 volunteer vets spread all over Indonesia are expected to jump into action anytime their expertise is needed.\nDewi, the coordinator of the group, said\xa0the male turtle they rescued was actually found together with a female by the locals.\n“I think they were mating when they both got hit by the propeller. The male one injured\xa0its left flipper, but the female died because of\xa0excessive bleeding,” she recalled.\nLOVE FOR MARINE LIFE DEVELOPED DURING UNIVERSITY DAYS\nThere are not many aquatic megafauna vets in the archipelagic nation, an irony since it is a maritime country, Dewi said.\xa0\nFew universities\xa0in the country have programmes\xa0on marine animals, she added, as most veterinary science in Indonesia focuses on livestock and pets.\nDewi’s love for marine animals, and sea turtles in particular, grew when she was studying at the University of Udayana in Denpasar, Bali.\nAlthough she is a native Balinese, Dewi was born and raised in Mataram city on neighbouring Lombok island.\nIt was during her university days when her uncle, who was also her lecturer, introduced her to sea turtles and marine life.\nShe later pursued\xa0a master’s degree at the University of Queensland in Australia to widen her horizon.\xa0\nIn 2018, her seniors from\xa0University of Udayana invited her to join IAM Flying Vet, which operates\xa0under the Indonesian Veterinary Medical Association.\n“There are many cases of stranded (marine) animals which do not receive medical help,” Dewi said of the idea behind establishing the group.\nWorking closely with the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fishery as well as other authorities and green groups, IAM Flying Vet is reliant on first responders who tip them off about stranded animals.\nSometimes they also discover cases being discussed\xa0on social media, and\xa0it is Dewi’s job as a coordinator to decide which vet to be deployed.\nBeing self-funded, financial constraint can be a challenge. The group accepts donations in the form of accommodation or travel tickets, but prefers not to accept money.\nDewi remained as a member of IAM Flying Vet while she\xa0took up a job as a research assistant\xa0at the University of Tennessee in the United States about eight months ago.\xa0\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, she is now back in Denpasar and working from home.\xa0\nPERFORMING A NECROPSY ON BABY DUGONG\nNot every mission of IAM Flying Vet is about rescuing animals. Sometimes Dewi is required to perform necropsies on\xa0dead marine animals to determine the cause of death.\nOne of her memorable experiences was when she had to fly from\xa0Bali last year to tourism hotspot Raja Ampat in West Papua province to perform a necropsy on a dead baby dugong.\nThe flight took four hours and from Sorong city, she had to wait for another day to take a boat to reach the island.\xa0\nThe baby dugong was stranded on a resort beach and was then being taken care of by locals and a Papua-based volunteer of IAM Flying Vet.\xa0\nThe locals bought a lot of supplies such as milk and vitamins\xa0from the city for the baby dugong, but\xa0despite their good intention, it died a few weeks later.\n“The people who had been feeding the baby dugong\xa0were really emotional\xa0when they knew the baby dugong could not make it.\xa0\n""Everyone was really sad, and they cried.\xa0They couldn’t bear to witness the necropsy.""\nBaby dugongs usually get separated from their mothers when there is presence of boats, excessive noise or other disturbance where they swim, Dewi said.\xa0\n“It’s really hard to take care of a baby dugong. Its\xa0survival rate is very low because it is really prone to stress, and people need to feed it every three hours. It is just like nurturing a baby.”\nThe necropsy did not provide a clear clue besides mild inflammation in the stomach, thus stress was assumed\xa0to have played a part.\nDewi said that many necropsies are inconclusive, but for stranded baby or infant animals, they usually die because they do not have a good immune system or are far\xa0from their habitat.\xa0\nMANY STRANDED ANIMALS FOUND TO HAVE SWALLOWED PLASTIC\nWith Indonesia being the\xa0world’s second-biggest ocean polluter after China, there have been many cases of the volunteers having to deal with animals that have consumed plastic.\n“The latest case we got here in Bali was a huge adult turtle found floating in the southern Bali waters.\n“It was brought to the turtle center in Serangan.\xa0The vet treated it and eventually the sea turtle defecated plastic. It was really terrible,” Dewi said.\nIt took two months for the plastic to reach the very end of the turtle\'s intestine, she added.\xa0\nIAM Flying Vet\xa0has also come across stranded whales that were later found to have swallowed kilograms of plastic.\nLESS STRANDED ANIMALS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC\xa0\nAs marine animals typically contain lots of bacteria, IAM Flying Vet is trying to educate people not to touch them\xa0as it could lead to zoonosis, an infectious disease transmitted\xa0from animals to humans.\nDewi\xa0revealed that it can also be tricky when the volunteers encounter huge dead animals as they do not have the equipment to perform a necropsy, and the animals are too big to be buried.\nThey have\xa0to\xa0cut the animals into pieces before they bury them.\xa0\nBesides rescuing aquatic megafauna, Dewi is also passionate about spreading awareness on conserving\xa0marine animals.\xa0\nShe said\xa0sea turtle\xa0smuggling, for instance, is\xa0common across Indonesia.\xa0\nIn Bali, locals are known to practise many unique traditional rituals, one\xa0of them involves sea turtles, she added. These have threatened the existence of the species.\xa0\nHuman activities such as\xa0overfishing, fish bombing and overcrowded beaches are known to be\xa0the main causes of aquatic megafauna getting stranded, Dewi said.\xa0\n“Everything related to humans basically (is the cause of animals being stranded), not much about naturally occurring disease, this\xa0is very clear.""\xa0\nUsually, IAM Flying Vets receives up to\xa0five reports a month about stranded marine animals across Indonesia.\xa0\nIn the past few months, fewer reports were lodged. The group believed this is due to the fact that there is less human activity in the ocean and beaches, as people stay home to avoid COVID-19 infection, Dewi said.\xa0\n“Someone has to unveil the mystery as to why these animals get stranded on beaches.\n“The cases bring a message to us, telling us that something is not right.\xa0For example, if they are stranded because they have consumed plastic, it could be an indication that there is too much plastic in the ocean,\xa0and people need to do something about it,” Dewi said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Bali ', '     pollution ', '     environment ']}"

You may have also heard of the king cobra slithering towards Marsiling MRT and the herd of boars scavenging for food in Pasir Ris.\nAround the world, there have been stories about sheep cavorting in children’s playgrounds in Wales, sika deer taking to the streets near Japan’s Nara Park and kangaroos bounding down the streets of Adelaide.\nCould an outcome of this pandemic be the inadvertent rewilding of our world?\nA WELCOME DISTRACTION\nThis scenario should be welcome news for a conservationist like me, whose work aims to restore natural environments and biodiversity.\nThe truth, however, is probably simpler. While some wildlife could be emboldened by our absence, in most cases, these animals are searching for food.\nWith disruption in public activity, usual sources of food for urbanised wildlife may suddenly become less available. Naturally, they start roaming a larger territory in search of food, probably helped by reduced human traffic and city noise.\nSuch stories are a welcome distraction at this time, but they are not unique to a world in pandemic. The wildlife we notice now is less of a resurgence, than the realisation that we live in a shared space.\nIn Singapore, we share our urban environment with local macaques, reptiles, birds and other wildlife. As with every shared living environment, conflict may sometimes seem inevitable – just ask the people who we’ve been cooped up with at home.\nA typical reaction to the presence of wildlife in our living environment is “Not in my backyard!” Wildlife encounters have been met with hostility.\nIn Singapore, snakes have been beaten to death simply for being in a garden. Elsewhere, elephants have been poisoned for venturing into plantations, raiding and trampling crops.\nBut while we discuss the phenomena of returning wildlife, we risk ignoring a larger irony. Wildlife in urban environments may be a passing curiosity, but human encroachment on wildlife habitat is the very reason we are in lockdown battling the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere is considerable speculation about the origins of COVID-19 but scientists are certain it is a zoonotic disease, caused by a human being coming into contact with an animal, whether a bat or another animal that carried the coronavirus.\nLINK TO ZOONOTIC DISEASES\nCloser and more frequent contact with wildlife increases the spillover of pathogens from wildlife to humans.\nPrevious pandemics have started in similar ways: Whether due to wild meat consumption (ebola); direct interaction with live wildlife; intermediate hosts such as civets (SARS), or domestic animals such as poultry (avian influenza).\nWith its suspected origins in a wildlife market, COVID-19 is no exception.\nTropical forests are home to millions of species including microbes and host animals. When intact, they act as a buffer protecting us from zoonotic\xa0diseases.\nWhen these forests are destroyed, this natural buffer disappears. It is no surprise then that a\xa0third of emerging infectious diseases are linked to deforestation.\nIn spite of the knowledge we have about the impacts of deforestation, 16 million hectares of forest are cut down annually with no sign of a slowdown.\nFrom Southeast Asia to Brazil, we are clearing land to feed our demand for timber, soy, palm oil, beef and rubber. Likewise in Singapore and many growing cities, we clear land to make way for roads and buildings.\nPut bluntly, our staggering assault on nature may have created an infectious disease breeding ground over which we have no control.\nROLE OF WILDLIFE TRADE\nPandemic risk is linked not just to habitat loss, but also to the exploitation of wildlife for trade and consumption.\nHow exactly COVID-19 was transmitted remains uncertain. What’s certain though, is that wildlife trade brings together animals (dead or alive) of varying species and sources into close proximity, especially in wildlife markets.\nWeak to no enforcement of laws in these markets, coupled with the absence of any veterinary controls, increase the risk of pathogens being transmitted to humans.\nThe illegal wildlife trade affects more than 7,000 animal and plant species worldwide. As a global transhipment hub, Singapore has inadvertently facilitated the illegal trade of wildlife.\nOver 2019, Singapore authorities seized an unprecedented amount of pangolin scales and elephant ivory, worth more than S$170 million in total. A few of the seizures that year were among the largest the world has seen.\nAllowing illegal wildlife trade to continue sets up a lose-lose situation for us: The loss of biodiversity, and increased transmission risk of new viruses anywhere along illegal trade routes.\nA CHANCE TO BUILD SOMETHING BETTER\nMany are asking how life will look like after the pandemic. Our relationship with nature has shaped the situation we currently find ourselves in. We cannot return to normal, when normal led us to this.\nThere are three things that we must do differently to ensure this does not happen again.\nFirst, we must take steps to protect intact ecosystems and restore degraded forests globally. Only with strong legislation and effective enforcement can we protect our remaining natural spaces.\nStriking a balance between development needs and protecting nature has never been an easy choice in Singapore.\nBut our experience with this pandemic must teach us that nature is intrinsic to our survival and economic welfare and must be a cornerstone for any development planning.\nIn Singapore and beyond, we need to demand for the sustainable production of commodities like palm oil, rubber, soy, pulp and paper. This ensures the products we use are deforestation-free and not made at the expense of the natural environment.\nSecond, where poaching and consumption of wildlife still thrive, we must crack down on illegal trade and close unregulated markets.\nRecognising the origin of COVID-19, China declared\xa0on Feb 24 a comprehensive ban on wildlife trade and the consumption of wild animals.\nIn Singapore, we applaud the recent changes to the now renamed Wildlife Act, which strengthens protection of local wildlife by addressing threats such as the poaching and feeding of wildlife.\nThis must come together with a move to shut down transnational illegal trade via Singapore’s ports and airport.\nThird, we need to acknowledge that preserving nature is key to economic recovery post-pandemic.\nAccording to the WEF’s New Nature Economy Report released in January, more than half of the world’s GDP is moderately or highly dependent on nature. For instance, the global US$2.5 trillion agriculture sector is dependent on pollination, water quality and a stable climate.\nCOVID-19 has brought carbon-intensive industries to a grinding halt – we can make use of this momentum by shifting investments to and creating new jobs in sustainable businesses.\nHere in Southeast Asia, the shift has already begun. Clean energy industries in this region could create up to 2.2 million jobs by 2030.\nOur health is intricately linked to the health of all life on Earth. As we rebuild our economy after COVID-19, we need to acknowledge the damage we have done and work on repairing our relationship with nature.\nThis is the only way we can better protect ourselves and loved ones from future health and climate crises.\nElizabeth Clarke is Conservation Director of the World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     wildlife ', '     environment ']}"

      From Macau's casinos to a Kallang farm: The gaming industry professional who now grows baby spinach
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For five years, Mr Ray Poh mingled with high rollers in Macau, which has been dubbed the gambling capital of the world.\xa0\nIt was a lucrative career filled with opportunities to travel frequently. But in 2015, Mr Poh gave all of that up.\n“I did think about making it a career,” said Mr Poh, who had studied in Australia since the age of 12. “But I think at the end of the five years, I realised that I’d been away for most of my life from my mum, who was back in Singapore. That was one of the main factors (that led me to leave).”\nIt took him a year to completely leave the industry, but by 2016, Mr Poh had decided on a very different career path: Urban farming.\nHis indoor hydroponics farm, Artisan Green, specialises in growing baby spinach. The 3,200 sq ft farm is located in Kallang\xa0in central Singapore, with its entire set-up costing Mr Poh slightly under a million dollars.\nAlthough Artisan Green was founded in 2018, a year before Singapore announced its ’30 by 30’ goal to produce 30 per cent of Singapore’s nutritional needs locally by 2030, it is part of an increasing wave of indoor farms looking to use sustainable methods to grow produce locally.\nIn April, the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources announced a S$30 million 30x30 Express grant for the agri-food industry to speed up the production of commonly consumed food items like eggs, vegetables and fish.\nA FAMILY BUSINESS\nWhile casino gaming was never something he had been interested in, a chat with his mother post-graduation was enough to convince Mr Poh to enter the family business.\n“I was thinking of entering the banking industry, but the thought of being behind a desk didn’t appeal to me much. So we were having a discussion and she said, why don’t you give this a try. Your father needs some help in the company, perhaps you can go out and see what you can do,” he said.\nInitially, he did business development with his father’s manufacturing company, developing products such as slot machines. As he became more involved in product design, so his interest in the industry grew, he said.\nAfter a year, his boss convinced him that he ought to head to Macau to advance his understanding of the industry, which turned out to be a fruitful experience.\n“I think at the very start when I first went there, I didn’t know anything or anyone in Macau, so the main thing I did was to network around. I met a lot of good people, and at the same time, obviously, you meet people that are not so good.\n“What I did was learn what to do and what not to do. It was a very good experience,” he said.\nBeing new to the industry also meant that people did not take him seriously. Mr Poh had to work hard to brush up his knowledge on the casino gaming industry by doing research, reading industry magazines and making friends who could teach him – skills which would later put him in good stead to enter a completely different industry.\nCONTRIBUTING TO SUSTAINABILITY\nWhen he told his family that he wanted to move out of casino gaming, they were supportive of his decision, said Mr Poh.\n“I think from the business aspect of things, it was more of a diversification. I’ve always thought that agriculture is something that’s evergreen. People will always need to eat. Whereas casino gaming is something like the entertainment sector,” he said, adding that he wanted to “do something more to contribute to the sustainability segment”.\n“At first I thought about doing landscaping, but I didn’t really want to go back to study more. So I thought farming might be an easy way in.\xa0\n“But I was very wrong about how easy it was. After doing the research, I quite naively thought that I would do this for about a year and network around, meet more people and then move into landscaping. But it just took me down towards farming all the way,” he said.\nJust like when he started\xa0out in Macau, Mr Poh had “zero knowledge” of the agriculture sector, and people also did not take him seriously when he started.\n“I knew I had to build up my knowledge from ground-up again,” he said.\nHe attended courses and conferences, forged relationships with people in the industry, watched Youtube videos and built prototypes.\nBuilding the prototypes gave him the confidence to decide that he wanted to build his entire farm from scratch. After leasing a space from Mapletree and procuring all his supplies and tools, Mr Poh set himself to work as the main contractor of his own farm.\nSave for the electrical wiring and the plumbing, Mr Poh put the entire 3,200 sq ft farm together with his own hands over the course of three months.\n“When I was building the farm, I was there from 9am to 10pm. I’d\xa0only eat one meal a day during the building, because I didn’t want to waste time. So I would only eat one really huge brunch and then just work the entire day in the farm,” he said.\nIt was challenging work, as he did all the sawing, drilling and lifting, and even suffered a back injury from hunching over and moving around too much. While he admitted that he should have gotten a partner to build the farm with him in hindsight, Mr Poh said that the process was necessary.\n“Now that I’ve gone through this, I can safely say that I know pretty much everything in the farm. I’ve sourced for every single piece of equipment by myself which makes it even easier for me to understand other people’s systems.\n“I can look at other people’s systems, I can derive how it’s built, how it’s done, and that experience isn’t something you can get from reading books or watching tutorials online,” he said.\nWHAT KEEPS HIM GOING\nEven with his extensive research, his lack of science and engineering knowledge posed challenges for him.\n“I didn’t really do chemistry, so that was kind of hard to pick up, and I knew that I needed to get the foundational knowledge of farming in terms of the science aspect to be able to do well in it,” he said, as science was an integral part of farming.\nHe also had to engage professional engineers to help him ensure the farm was built well.\nThis was in addition to the time he had to sacrifice in those early months, when he was just starting out, with many weekends spent at the farm just to make sure that everything was running well.\nAnd even with the farm up and running, the team also ran into other problems, such as nutrient deficiency issues for their spinach.\nBut what kept Mr Poh going was his desire to “see the final product”.\n“And we’re quite proud of what we’ve done with this current farm. We’ve had people from the industry – from the US, Europe – coming to visit us and they were quite impressed with the farm we’ve built. They told that it was comparable to some of the more advanced overseas farms as well.\n“Hearing that gives us the motivation and a stronger belief in what we do.”\nFUTURE PLANS\nIn the short-term, Artisan Green hopes to scale up its production from its current 30kg to 250kg of vegetables per week.\nAlthough Malaysia’s Movement Control Order has temporarily disrupted the farm’s supply of equipment\xa0which they require to scale up, Mr Poh is hoping to at least double the farm’s output by the end of the “circuit breaker” period and to hit 100kg per week by the end of the quarter.\nIn the longer-term, Mr Poh is also looking to build his second farm – this time bigger, and with a wider variety of crops. But rather than growing specialty crops, Mr Poh said he now wants to start growing crops such as chinese cabbage, which he says there is a bigger demand for in Singapore.\n“The next farm will have to be more automated, from end-to-end. That’s what our future goal is: to build the second farm and also to grow different crops, not just baby spinach, and work towards something where we can fulfil the whole ’30 by 30’ vision by the Government,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      Blue skies during lockdown, but can India’s respite from its pollution woes last?
  </h1>, 'text': 'DELHI: In the past few weeks, Delhi has experienced what it has not breathed and seen in years: Cleaner air and blue skies.\nIt is something that had “seemed impossible to achieve”, according to Tamseel Hussain, co-founder of Let Me Breathe, India’s largest online platform dedicated to pollution-related stories.\nHe has the COVID-19 lockdown on the city to thank for his lungs feeling “lighter”. The reduced noise pollution from traffic also allows him to hear the chirping of birds.\n“Apart from this, many parts of India have reported witnessing mountain ranges that weren’t visible previously,” he told CNA Insider over WhatsApp.\nBefore this lockdown began on March 23, he had spoken to CNA about his city’s toxic air instead, on the programme Undercover Asia. (Watch the episode here.)\nJust in November, the air in the world’s most polluted major city had turned deadly again: Air quality was in the hazardous range for nine days straight. But now, Delhi is having its longest spell of clean air on record.\nThe lockdown has been extended to May 17, with some easing of restrictions, and could even continue beyond that. Once it ends, however, can India’s movement for clean air ride the momentum of the lockdown effects?\n“Realistically speaking, it’s difficult. Prioritising the economy would require opening up and the functioning of all sectors, so there’s a chance that after the lockdown is lifted, we might lose these blue skies,” said Tamseel.\n“Still, this is a strong opportunity to focus on long-term solutions and ensure cities prioritise sustainable living and development. A lovable and livable city is a plus to the economy too.”\nWatch: India Air-pocalypse: Delhi\'s youth fight to breathe clean air (2:50)\nWhether the respite is short-lived or not may well depend on the government and even the courts, among others.\n‘I COULDN’T TAKE MY KID OUTSIDE’\nDuring the first 25 days of the lockdown, Delhi’s concentration of PM2.5 already indicated a ""good"" rating, which is the safest level.\nThe Central Pollution Control Board reported a 46 per cent reduction in PM2.5 levels and a 50 per cent reduction in PM10 concentrations in the capital compared with the week before lockdown.\nPM2.5 and PM10 refer to particulate matter not more than 2.5 and 10 micrometres in diameter. Particles within this range make up a large proportion of dust that can enter the lungs or be trapped in the nose, mouth or throat.\nThey are among the air pollutants in Delhi that, a few months ago, sent families seeking greener pastures — like Vaibhav Wardhan’s family, one of various stakeholders affected by the fight for cleaner air who spoke to Undercover Asia.\nVaibhav grew up in Delhi, so it is where he believes he belongs.\nAfter landing a role in supply chain consulting with an American multinational, he and his wife, Nishu, moved from Hyderabad to their new home in Delhi in April 2018, excited to begin a fresh chapter of their lives.\nEight months later, their first child was born. But everything changed after that, with the deadly November air. “I couldn’t take my kid outside my home. It was as if he was under house arrest,” said Vaibhav.\n“It was very difficult to see him not being able to sleep properly,” added Nishu. “We used to wake 10 or 20 times at night ... Since I couldn’t take him outside, he used to be very cranky.”\nVaibhav refused to let his child grow up in a city enveloped by dust and smog, so he began looking for opportunities outside Delhi. The family eventually moved back to Hyderabad.\nILLEGAL CROP BURNING CONTINUES\nThe air pollution that drove them out of Delhi is nothing new, but its escalation in November has been linked to the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.\nEvery winter, more than two million farmers in these states burn about 23 million tonnes of paddy straw on more than 80,000 square kilometres of land, even though stubble burning has been banned since 2015 by an Indian court dedicated to environmental matters.\nFarmers can be fined up to 15,000 rupees (S$280) for flouting the law. But farmers like Sukhvinder Singh have little choice, as they must “feed (their) children”.\nDharmendra Singh, another farmer in Punjab, said they used to plant rice in May so they had enough time to harvest the crop.\nBut to save groundwater, the government passed a law in 2009 that forbade rice planting before June 15. This pushed back the rice harvest season from September to October, which means less time to clear the fields.\n“The gap between harvesting and sowing ... became shorter,” said Dharmendra. “The stubble had to be burned immediately … (so) the wheat crop can be grown.”\nNo matter when the farmers plant their rice, they risk getting fined for breaking either law.\nOne proposed solution is the Happy Seeder, developed by the Punjab Agricultural University. Mounted on a tractor, it helps farmers to plant wheat without having to clear the leftover paddy straw.\nBut the farmers’ enthusiasm has been dismal for three main reasons: Tradition, cost and time.\nFarming is an old profession, and farmers are not confident that new methods like the Happy Seeder will deliver the same yield, which would affect their income, said research fellow Karthik Ganesan from the Council on Energy, Environment and Water.\nMoreover, each Happy Seeder costs about 150,000 rupees, and government subsidies are not enough to win over farmers.\nEven when the government of Punjab wants to pay farmers not to burn their stubble and to use more Happy Seeders, these payments have been slow.\n“Our village has farmable land of 800 acres, and we have two Happy Seeder machines,” said Dharmendra.\n“To use them, a farmer has to wait for about 30 to 40 days, (but) we have only 15 to 20 days ... between harvesting rice and sowing wheat.”\nOn top of all this, climate and geography exacerbate the impact of crop burning. Delhi is landlocked and flanked by mountains, so the slow wind movement during winter traps the smoke in a deadly shroud over the city.\nNEVER-ENDING TRAFFIC POLLUTION\nWhat is more pertinent than agricultural burning, which happens for 20 to 30 days, is that Delhi is blighted by the worst vehicle emissions in India, according to a 2018 study by Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment.\nIn January 2016, the Delhi government introduced the odd-even policy: Odd-numbered licence plates are allowed on the road one day, and even numbers the next day. It was again implemented last November after the city declared a public health emergency.\nOn a daily basis, however, the government uses a Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate to regulate vehicle emissions, with the idea of keeping older, dirtier vehicles off the streets. Without the certificate, drivers could be fined up to 10,000 rupees.\nBut this measure has loopholes. In Tamseel’s experiment as a citizen journalist, he managed to get an authentic certificate for a car that failed its emissions test at another facility.\nAll he did was use a photo of the licence plate and an expired PUC certificate.\nTo implement more effective solutions, the government established a policy to subsidise electric vehicles.\nThe downside is these schemes affect only vehicles registered in Delhi. A large percentage of air pollution spews from diesel trucks and buses that come from outside the city’s borders — and beyond the reach of its laws.\n“We plan to nearly double the entire bus fleet in the next couple of years,” Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah said on what else is being done to tackle the emissions problem.\n“We’re also working on affordability ... Bus travel (is) free for women, and we’re also planning to make it free for students ... This will ensure that more and more people shift from private vehicles to public transport.”\nLOOKING TO THE COURTS FOR SOLUTIONS\nOn the ground, environmental activists like 16-year-old Aditya Dubey are trying to eradicate Delhi’s air pollution crisis one step at a time.\nThe effects of air pollution have taken a toll on his body, causing him to wake up in the middle of the night with breathlessness, a symptom other students have experienced too.\nBesides using Twitter to call the authorities out on their inaction, he filed a Public Interest Litigation in November on behalf of Delhi’s millions of schoolchildren.\nSeparately, on his platform Let Me Breathe, Tamseel carries out his own investigations into Delhi’s problems — and possible solutions — and makes these available online. But activists like them need the backing of a Supreme Court order to see significant change.\nAditya’s case was taken on by Aparajita Singh, who has litigated cases on pollution and environmental protection for over two decades now.\n“When we’re talking specifically about air pollution, it’s covered by Article 21 of the constitution, which is the right to life — and that’s the most fundamental provision,” said the senior advocate at the Supreme Court.\nThe activists also seek a Supreme Court order to be enforced on Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to clean up Delhi’s air. But the four chief secretaries were no-shows on the day they had to present their action plans.\nIt might be disheartening, but Tamseel has decided to keep helping people upload pollution and climate change stories using their mobile phones.\n“The media might move on, politicians might keep (playing) the blame game ... sensational news will keep happening, but you know what doesn’t change is (the) citizen’s voice,” he said. “Citizens’ voices asking for positive change have a long-lasting impact.”\nCHANCE FOR A FRESH START\nSince the Undercover Asia episode was aired, Tamseel has some suggestions on how the government can ride the wave of the environmental benefits of the COVID-19 lockdown.\nSeeing how “beautiful and healthy” life can be with “next to zero cars on the road”, he wants the government, institutions and citizens to work together. The government, for instance, can use “powerful public engagement techniques” to ensure lasting behavioural change.\n“We need to limit vehicular traffic. The push for electric mobility needs to be amplified. Industrial emissions need stricter control. And cities can look at a more accessible plan when it comes to public transport,” he said.\n“The lockdown also highlights challenges in interstate travel, so this is a great opportunity to fix a robust and sustainable travel system between states.”\nThen, if the air pollution finally abates, families like Vaibhav’s would not need to leave the capital any more just to give their children a fighting chance to breathe clean air.\nWatch this episode of Undercover Asia here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     COVID-19 ', '     India ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      NEA launches fund to help subsidise cost of installing food waste treatment systems

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A number of factors such as the contamination of recyclables and incorrect recycling could have possibly contributed to Singapore’s low recycling rate among households, experts told CNA.\nThis follows statistics released by the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Wednesday (Apr 15) which showed that despite generating less waste, Singapore’s overall recycling rate fell in 2019.\xa0\nOf the 7.23 million tonnes of waste produced last year, about 4.25 million tonnes, or about 59 per cent, was recycled – a dip from the recycling rate of 61 per cent in 2018.\nIn particular, Singapore’s domestic - from households -\xa0recycling rate fell 5 per cent from 22 per cent in 2018 to 17 per cent in 2019.\nCONTAMINATION\xa0A MAJOR PROBLEM\nMs Pek Hai Lin, who is the manager of non-governmental organisation Zero Waste SG, told CNA that contamination ""seems to still be a huge problem"", preventing items from being recycled.\xa0\nSingaporeans may also be recycling incorrectly, throwing items which are not recyclable, into the blue bins, she added. This “decreases the efficiency of the waste management process”.\xa0\n“They might engage in ‘wishful’ recycling, where they hope an item can be recycled or repurposed in some ways and thus place them in the blue recycling bin, which in turn causes inefficiency in the waste management process,” she said.\n“For instance, mattresses and pillows cannot be recycled, and they are bulky, taking up precious space in recycling trucks, which will head to the sorting facility before heading to the incineration plant.”\nNoting that a decrease in recycling rate does not mean that people are recycling less, Ms Pek added: “In fact, despite contamination rate still being high, people seem more aware and interested in better waste management habits, which is heartening.”\nMany also “do not have the inclination” to properly separate and properly dispose of recyclables, added Associate Professor Tong Yen Wah from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the National University of Singapore, and more education is needed in this area.\xa0\n“We are too used to the conveniences of throwing everything into one bin or chute, and do not bother to recycle properly,"" he said.\n""Having good infrastructure such as more recycling locations that are closer or easier to access, and having incentives such as the reverse vending machines can help too, because there is currently a lack of easily accessible ways to recycle.""\nWaste collectors he spoke to recently also said there has been an increase in the contamination rate in the recyclables they collect, and have had to divert more recyclables to the incineration plants, said Assoc Prof Tong.\xa0\nMs Pek said the rubbish chute discourages recycling as there is a “lack of accountability” for residents who may dispose of waste irresponsibly, which can contribute to contamination as well.\xa0\n“Explicit education is needed for Singaporeans to know what to recycle, as there are still quite some misconceptions on the ground which we try to address whenever possible,” she added.\xa0\nEXPORT OF PLASTIC AND PAPER\nA drop in demand for recyclable materials overseas could also have also been a factor in the decrease, said experts.\nThis would include countries such as China banning imports of recyclable materials as well as restrictions on imports from countries such as Malaysia and Thailand, creating more supply than buyers, said Ms Pek.\n“This seems to have resulted in a drop in prices of some recyclable materials, such as paper and plastic, deeming it much less profitable to go through much effort to collect and sell the materials,” she added.\xa0According to NEA, the drop in the overall recycling rate is “largely attributable” to the drop in the recycling rate of paper.\xa0\xa0“The market for recycled paper was affected by shrinking export markets and reduced demand for printing paper from increasing digitalisation,” said NEA on their website.\xa0\xa0“Given that 34 per cent of Singapore’s recyclables are exported, the status of the external market and policy of other countries towards recyclables would have a significant impact on our recycling rate.""\nMs Melissa Tan, chairman of the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore, said knowing that paper and plastic waste will eventually be incinerated could discourage people from recycling.\xa0\n“People can place their used paper in the blue bins, but if the paper cannot be exported, they would have to be disposed of,"" she said.\n""Some people may thus be less inclined to recycle paper or plastics because they know that there is no market for them overseas and they would be incinerated.”\nAdding that the solution might be for paper and plastic recycling plants to be built in Singapore, she added: “This will then encourage more people to recycle them because they know their used paper and plastic bottles will actually be recycled and not simply incinerated.”\nSome Singaporeans also might lack faith in the country’s recycling system, and may hence decide not to recycle, noted Plastic-Lite Singapore founder Aarti Giri.\xa0\n“When someone goes to drop off their recyclables in the blue bin, and spot regular trash in the same bin, their belief in the system, rightfully so, may reduce,” she said.\n“They may get dejected seeing this and stop recycling altogether, thinking everything is going to get incinerated anyway.”\xa0\nBut experts remained generally positive that Singapore will be able to reach its target of a domestic recycling rate of 30 per cent by 2030.\xa0\nUnder the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, targets include increasing the nation’s overall recycling rate to 70 per cent, non-domestic recycling rate to 81 per cent and domestic recycling rate to 30 per cent in ten years.\n“If the general market situation does not change and we continue to rely on exporting our recyclables for processing, we might not be able to achieve the target,” said Ms Pek.\n“However, with schemes such as extended producer responsibility for e-waste and packaging kicking in, in the next few years, it can still be possible to reach the target if Singapore is able to own a certain percentage of recyclables processing, which we should.”\nAdded Assoc Prof Tong: “I think we can definitely achieve 30 per cent domestic recycling by 2030 as that is not a high (target). Other countries like Japan, South Korea, Germany have a much higher recycling rate, so this target is definitely achievable if we do our best.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     NEA ']}"

      Indonesia stands at the crossroads of a waste crisis and plastics problem
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Indonesia is one of the biggest contributors to plastic pollution in the ocean. It became a dumping ground for the world’s plastic waste after China’s ban on trash imports. And now, a new crisis is brewing in the country.\nIts landfills are running out of space, even with only 60 to 70 per cent of urban waste being collected and taken to its hundreds of landfills.\nIndonesia’s largest landfill, Bantar Gebang — the only one serving the capital, Jakarta — will run out of space next year, officials have said. It is not the only one, however, facing a deadline.\nOwing to urban growth and increasing incomes, Indonesia’s mountains of waste are growing faster than anyone had imagined. “Every zone is almost full because of the increase in waste,” said Bagong Suyoto, head of the National Waste Coalition.\nThe country produces nearly 200,000 tonnes of waste a day — not only plastic but also paper, rubber, food, et cetera. A lack of funding and weak law enforcement, however, have resulted in an inadequate waste management system for years.\nThese problems are now coming to a head, the programme Undercover Asia finds out. (Watch the episode here.)\nOPEN DUMPING\nAcross the country, most of the landfills operate as an open dump: The waste is piled high, with little control over any resultant environmental problems, such as groundwater pollution and the release of methane gas.\nBut as landfills are cheap to build and easy to maintain, there has been little incentive to make a change so far.\nIn West Java, the most populous province, there are even landfills located side by side with communities, with barely any separation from the surrounding farms and homes, like in Burangkeng.\nVillage resident Hatta and his family live 500 metres from the landfill there. And he complains that “everyone’s affected by the noise and smells”. But they have “tolerated it for 23 years”.\nYounger residents such as Carsa Hamdani, however, are upset by the mismanagement of the landfill. He wants a different fate for his hometown, and is starting to take action.\nHe has enlisted the help of Bagong, who works with communities living near landfills. Among the veteran campaigner’s priorities is to make sure authorities give to Burangkeng something known as “smelly money”, or compensation for what they must face.\n“The people of Burangkeng are merely fighting for their rights,” says Bagong.\nOne of the landfill’s most immediate hazards is the lack of water treatment facilities. By law, waste water in the landfill should be treated, and the rubbish should be covered regularly with soil to control the smell.\nBut many of Indonesia’s landfills, including the one in Burangkeng, are managed by private operators. And they do not always go by the book.\n“The water flow here is uncontrolled, and it’s flowing to the paddy fields, killing them, making them unable to grow crops,” says Carsa.\n“Then it directly flows into the river. And it’s very unfortunate. There should be better safety measures; instead, you see wastes piling up near the river.”\nWhat he and other residents want is to be consulted about the landfill’s future, especially as landfill authorities plan to triple its size because it is getting full.\n“If possible, don’t do any expansion,” urges Hatta. “Manage the waste properly, improve on it (and) align the policies with the will of the local community.”\nTHOUSANDS OF SCAVENGERS\nNot far from Burangkeng is Bantar Gebang, which holds over 39 million tonnes of waste now, its towers reaching 40 metres high. It receives some 7,500 to 7,800 tonnes daily, says Bagong, “all day and night, especially in the afternoon”.\nThe clock is ticking, but its future is still being debated, along with that of other landfills across Indonesia.\nThe government wants to build incinerators to shrink the amount of waste and buy more time. But one reason there has been little progress is the thousands of people whose lives depend on landfills.\nAt Bantar Gebang alone, there are 6,000 scavengers who are part of an informal recycling network that salvages what Indonesians discard. No one has decided what to do with these informal workers if landfills get nothing but incinerated ash.\nCantel, for example, works morning to night to earn about 160,000 rupiah (S$15) a day.\nIn a day, he can collect up to 100 kg of plastics that he can sell to makeshift workshops where the waste is further sorted and then sold to recycling factories.\nIn his experience, there is a buyer for almost every type of plastic except polystyrene and single-use sachets — which are, ironically, the most common plastic items in the rubbish heaps.\n“There is no value to (them),” he says. “(They) can’t be recycled. (They) aren’t strong enough to be processed.”\nIt is filthy, labourious work. And despite these efforts to separate recyclables from trash, about 40 per cent of what is collected from landfills is rejected by recyclers.\nIndonesia’s big recycling companies accept only a specific kind of plastic — high-grade, clean and not mixed with other materials — in order to make water bottles, cups and straws, or plastic pellets sold to other manufacturers.\nFor many of these major recyclers, the only way to satisfy their needs is to look overseas.\n“The quality of the materials in the country doesn’t meet our standards because (they’re) smelly, dirty and so on. What we have domestically isn’t enough,” says Indonesia Industrial Plastic Export-Import Association chairman Akhmad Ma’ruf Maulana.\n“We’re heavily dependent on the import of (recyclables).”\nNEW REALITIES\nIndonesia’s plastic recycling industry’s opportunity to grow came when China banned waste imports like plastic and unsorted paper products, with effect from 2018. Shipments of plastic waste to Indonesia that year increased by 141 per cent to 283,000 tonnes.\nBut it was soon discovered that what was shipped as recyclable plastics often came with dirty, low-grade and even toxic wastes, which were impossible to recycle and led to more contamination.\nPaper recyclers also accepted unwanted plastics together with paper scraps, in return for a cheaper price.\nLast year, when non-governmental organisations sounded the alarm about foreign plastic waste being dumped in Indonesia, there was public outrage.\nWATCH: How foreign plastic trash was smuggled into Indonesia (4:13)\nThe government took action: Extra permits are now needed before paper and plastic recyclables can be imported; customs inspections have been tightened; and hundreds of containers carrying contaminated scrap have been denied entry.\nThe stringent checks mean a longer time for legitimate recyclables to reach companies, and the industry says the new rules have hurt business. But the authorities are standing firm.\n“These improvements are necessary. This is progressive,” says Achmad Gunawan Widjaksono, a waste management director at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. “Our rules must catch up with developments in the world.”\nAcross the country too, an environmental movement is growing, spurred by what some have called a waste crisis. In Bali, images of choked beaches triggered a provincial ban on single-use plastics. Elsewhere, thousands of Indonesians have mobilised to clean up major rivers.\nEven in Tropodo village in East Java, where at least 50 tofu factories have relied on cheap plastic fuel, especially from imported waste, there seems to be an adaptation to new realities.\nWhile the chimney stacks of some factories continue to spew thick black smoke, the telltale sign of burning plastic, others have switched to wood.\nTake, for example, factory owner Komar. Previously, his workers had to not only put up with the pungent smell of burning plastic but also breathe in the poisonous fumes. Firewood, he acknowledges, is more environmentally friendly.\n“My motivation is to provide a better working environment, so that I’m able to receive more good prayers,” he says.\nReplacing his burners cost him 150 million rupiah — not something many of his fellow tofu makers can afford. But with their old fuel supply drying up and the local government threatening penalties, there is no other choice.\nThose working to clean up Indonesia’s waste recognise that the status quo must change. The country’s landfills are an example.\n“In waste management, landfills are (usually) the final solution. But it’s the least desirable solution. It’s an outdated solution,” acknowledges Gunawan.\nA lack of funding and technology are the challenges Indonesia must now overcome, says Bagong. “We need a new paradigm ... and creative, innovative ways to dispose of our waste from the source, using different methods and technologies.”\nWatch this episode here.

      Why Manila is at risk of becoming an underwater city
  </h1>, 'text': 'MANILA: Saturnino Espiritu remembers a time when he could walk to the nearby church in his neighbourhood. But now he must reach it by boat.\nThe coastal village of Sitio Pariahan, about 17 kilometres north of Manila, is where he built a home and a family. Today, its streets are gone, submerged under water.\nThe church has also been engulfed by water, its walls stained with moss.\n“Masses are now being held with churchgoers on their boats,” said Saturnino. “The altar gets splashed by the waves. You can see oysters growing on our church grounds already.”\nSome 100 families used to live in this community, but only around 40 remain today. Since 2003, their village has been sinking by around four centimetres every year.\nWatch: Living in a village that’s sinking into the sea (5:31)\nThe rise in sea level, rapid land subsidence and the disappearance of mangrove forests explain why “water keeps gushing in towards their community”, said researcher Rodrigo Narod Eco from the University of the Philippines’ Marine Science Institute.\nThe troubles plaguing this village foreshadow future events in Metro Manila, which is faced with a multitude of problems including climate change and excessive groundwater extraction, the programme Insight discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nA PROBLEM SINCE THE 1960s\nThe Philippines is among the most vulnerable in the world to hazards such as rising sea levels, floods, earthquakes and typhoons.\nIt gets hit by an average of 20 typhoons a year, which can flood coastal areas. And these tropical storms, scientists believe, are likely to become more frequent and stronger because of climate change.\nIn the Manila Bay area, the sea level is rising four times faster than the global average rate of 3.2 millimetres a year, said Dennis Bringas, chief of the Physical Oceanography Division at the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority.\n“We have 13.2 mm per year up to 2018,” he cited. “It’s probably (owing to) ground subsidence or climate change.”\nExcessive groundwater extraction has led to continual land subsidence, which will eventually result in flooding in many parts of Metro Manila.\nMahar Lagmay, executive director of the University of the Philippines Resilience Institute, said the rate of subsidence started to rise during the 1960s, at the height of the city’s industrialisation, when the growing population meant a greater demand for water.\n“And if there’s no supply of surface water, then they’d need to get it from the ground,” he added.\nThe growth of agriculture, fisheries and commercial industries that use large volumes of water also put pressure on the groundwater resources.\nThe problem lies with the regulation of the water extraction, according to Susan Abano, chief of the Policy and Programme Division at the National Water Resources Board. ”We don’t have the data on those illegal extractors,” she said.\nIn fact, about 60 per cent of the country’s groundwater extraction is done without permits, reported the 2003 Philippine Environmental Monitor published by the World Bank.\nRUBBISH IN THE WATERWAYS\nThe dumping of rubbish is another perennial problem in Metro Manila, whose estuaries and creeks are often clogged and must be constantly filtered by pumping stations to protect against flooding.\nAt the Tripa de Gallina pumping station, for example — one of Metro Manila’s 62 pumping stations — the amount of rubbish collected in a day is sometimes so much that the machine may break down.\n“Even if one unit gets damaged or bogged down because of garbage … we could experience flooding, the worst kind of flooding, especially when there’s heavy rain,” said Metro Manila Development Authority’s flood control and sewerage management director, Baltazar Melgar.\nAnd when there are high volumes of rubbish or mechanical sorting problems, the rubbish also makes its way to the bay and worsens the siltation there.\nThe challenges in Manila brought about by floods, overpopulation and poor traffic had actually been addressed in a World Bank-funded project in 1976.\nArchitect and urban planner Felino Palafox Junior, who was part of the team who drafted the plan, said: ”There was good planning but there was no implementation or updating those plans.\n“Even the water crisis was addressed … (by) identifying different sources of water supply.”\nEventually, rapid urbanisation and uncontrolled population growth — in a city of 13 million now — led to weak oversight of what needed to be done, which raises the issue of whether the existing laws were implemented well.\n“When you develop in wanton fashion, and all places are already occupied because of the growing population (and) the poor planning, then disaster strikes,” said Lagmay.\nDECONGESTING THE CITY\nScientific evidence has suggested that by 2050, many of the Philippine coastal regions, including the Manila Bay area, could find themselves underwater if countries fail to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nSince 2016, however, with President Rodrigo Duterte at the helm of the country, it has been reported that more than 6,000 flood control projects have been completed to protect flood-prone areas across the country.\nThese include the building of pumping stations, dykes and flood warning systems.\nNonetheless, Palafox Jr believes that reducing Manila’s urban density and congestion is the way forward. This includes relocating government offices to other regions. By developing other urban growth centres, he said, this could reduce the primacy of Manila.\n“That would reduce the attractiveness of Metro Manila, alleviate traffic, lack of housing and many of the urban ills,” he added. “Maybe we should start looking at a new capital region.”\nIn fact, Manila was not always the administrative capital; in 1948, the seat of power was relocated to nearby Quezon City. “When the government offices were moved to Quezon City, there was some kind of relief (to Manila),” said Lagmay.\nBut in 1976, the then President, Ferdinand Marcos, reinstated Manila as the capital, although Quezon City still hosts a number of government offices today. And after several decades, said Lagmay, it is time to relocate the administrative centre again.\nIndeed, work has started on a new metropolis called New Clark City — about 100 km north of Manila — becoming the seat of the national government by 2030. Some key government offices, like the Department of Transportation, have already relocated there.\nLagmay sees a clear need for this because Metro Manila has become too crowded and “hard to manage”. He said: “The population … is extremely large, and the hazards are overwhelming.”\nWatch this episode here.

      28,000 charging stations for electric cars is possible - but where? Industry players weigh in
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: At this year’s Budget, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said Singapore will aim to phase out vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) over the next 20 years.\xa0\nIt is part of a bigger vision under the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 to make the country’s land transport sector more environmentally sustainable. At the core of this strategy are electric vehicles (EVs).\nIn fact, after 2030, Singapore should see no new purchases of ICE vehicles,\xa0according to Senior Minister of State for Transport Dr Janil Puthucheary at the Transport Ministry’s Committee of Supply Debate.\xa0\nThat will be no mean feat, given Singapore has more than 900,000 of such vehicles today.\nTo incentivise electric vehicle adoption, the Government is dangling several carrots such as the EV Early Adoption Incentive (EEAI) – essentially a rebate on Additional Registration Fees (ARF) capped at S$20,000 starting next January.\xa0\nIf this gets the needle moving, then the gradual growth of the electric vehicle population should rise in tandem with the intended construction of up to 28,000 public charging points by 2030. It will be an incremental exercise from the current 1,600 chargers now publicly accessible.\nExisting players in the industry say the 28,000 goal is realistic, but tell CNA that significant effort will have to go into readying Singapore\'s infrastructure.\nLAYING THE GROUNDWORK\nOver the past two years, BlueSG has built 1,291 charging points for its electric car-sharing service. A total of 239 of those charging points are accessible to third-party users – in other words, non-BlueSG vehicles can use them.\nCommercial and Network Director Jenny Lim described the factors that affect whether a charging point can be built at an existing parking lot.\n""Other than the 4.8m by 2.4m size of the lot, there needs to be ample space around the lot so that we can install the equipment,” said Ms Lim.\nSurrounding features such as trees and underground cables also matter. For instance, trees cannot be cut down to make way for construction and installation work.\xa0\n“It’s also important not to disrupt construction halfway,"" said Ms Lim. ""After you set about the construction process, if you realise there are underground cables, you will delay the whole construction process. And sometimes you may even have to abort it.""\nIt is also generally more expensive and time-consuming to build a charging point outdoors, because regulations dictate that trenching work has to be done to hide electrical cables underground.\xa0\nMs Lim said an outdoor project can cost 50 per cent more than one in a sheltered, multi-storey car park – and take twice as long.\n\xa0“We need to do trenching, digging, and then we need to do casting – weather permitting,” said Ms Lim.\xa0\n“From the moment we select a station to when the station is fully functional with all the approvals and applications in place, this will typically take four to six months.”\nAccess to power is another important factor. Commercial players such as BlueSG have to tap available power sources to draw electricity to its charging points.\xa0\nIf the parking lot is outdoors, it has to be near an overground box, and there might only be one on an entire street. For multi-storey car parks, proximity to electrical rooms is key and these switch rooms are usually on the ground floor.\nSimply put, the further the charging point from the power source, the more expensive the construction and installation.\nNEW VERSUS OLD\nIt is generally more cost-effective to build charging lots from scratch by including them in new car park designs, according to Assistant Professor Raymond Ong, who researches transport infrastructure at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the National University of Singapore.\xa0\nBut it is more likely than not that the conversion of existing car park lots will have to factor into the numbers game.\nBlueSG’s Ms Lim has a similar view that it would be easier to install charging points in newer developments such as public build-to-order flats. She thinks getting to 28,000 charging points will not\xa0be a problem.\n“For the landscape in Singapore, there are 4,000 public car parks – HDB, URA, various agencies\' car parks – altogether,” said Ms Lim.\xa0\n“If you take away a good proportion that are older car parks, and you spread the rest across newer car parks, community areas near transport hubs, (with) easily between seven to 10 parking lots (for charging) per car park, the Government should be able to fill up (and get to) the 28,000.""\nHowever, Ms Lim also pointed out another challenge – that many car parks in Singapore are older and tend to only be equipped with just enough power for lights, elevators, and electronic gantries.\nProperty developers such as City Developments Limited (CDL) are already addressing this problem.\nChief Sustainability Officer Esther An said\xa0even older buildings such as Republic Plaza can be made ready for electric charging, as long as they are properly maintained and upgraded to meet energy efficiency auditing standards.\n“In every building, you have to maintain an upgrading schedule,” she said. “So, we don\'t see it as a problem if you have continuous efforts to maintain building performance.""\xa0\nRepublic Plaza is more than two decades old and has six lots for electric vehicles, two of which are for public use. The other four are for BlueSG’s car-sharing service, and are not among those BlueSG has opened to private car owners.\nThe building will add two more public lots by the second quarter of 2020.\nCDL has also committed to installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure at its new residential developments moving forward.\xa0\nIn 2016, it provided isolators for 97 units at its landed property development in Serangoon Gardens, giving owners the flexibility to plug-and-play EV chargers if and when they decide to get an electric car.\nCharging facilities provider Greenlots – which is wholly owned by Shell – said\xa0more developers are showing interest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure.\n“Condominiums and commercial buildings in Singapore have been quite slow to adopt EV charging stations, but the awareness is starting to grow amongst the building and facility management sectors,” said a Greenlots spokesperson, who added that charging locations are becoming more common because tenants, businesses and visitors are creating demand.\n“The Government may help to alleviate these concerns by implementing requirements for buildings to be EV-ready,"" the spokesperson said. ""In Singapore, the Green Mark Award is a good example of how EV-readiness can be promoted.\n""This building benchmarking scheme will encourage the construction of environmentally friendly buildings and features that align with the long-term goals of sustainability and liveability. EV\xa0charging stations definitely fall within the category of a green feature.”\nIMPACT ON THE GRID – GRIN OR GRIMACE?\nAlso very much a part of the debate are concerns about what impact 28,000 charging stations will have on the national power grid.\nGreater electric vehicle adoption will inevitably lead to greater electricity demand, something the Transport Ministry has assured it can manage through the construction of new power generation capacity and the reinforcement of the grid network.\xa0\n“We will also incorporate innovations such as smart charging and energy storage solutions that store energy from the grid during off-peak periods,” said Dr\xa0Puthucheary at the Committee of Supply debate.\nEnergy provider SP Group said it has progressively upgraded the grid infrastructure over the years to keep up with changing consumer demand. The company is also confident of handling the additional load.\n""It\'s likely going to be highly distributed across the whole of Singapore. Therefore, the impact on the grid, in our view, will be highly manageable,” said Goh Chee Kiong, CEO of New Energies at SP Group.\xa0\n“That said, SP Group will undertake all measures to ensure there\'s no adverse impact on the grid arising from EV charging.”\nSP Group is also building and operating its own charging points and has a mix of fast- and slow-options available.\xa0\nRight now, it has 166 chargers, with 86 of them accessible to the public.\xa0\nBy the end of this year, the company has committed to 1,000 charging points and will run Singapore’s largest public EV charging network, with a quarter of them fast-chargers.\nMr Goh said SP Group is working with property owners and managers to get these rolled out.\xa0\n“There are three types of charging locations. The first being the workplace, the second would be residential areas, and the third being general public areas such as shopping malls,” said Mr Goh.\xa0\n“A lot of the districts that will work with SP Group in the coming few months will be a combination of those three types of areas.”\nLOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION\nSo, where exactly will the 28,000 charging stations be located? And how many will be fast- or slow- chargers?\nThese considerations will depend on demand projections, according to Dr Ong.\xa0\n“Most of the time in transportation planning, we will estimate where the demand nodes are for drivers,"" he said.\xa0\n""In the case of electric vehicles, we would usually estimate the proportion of drivers who would switch from an internal combustion\xa0vehicle vehicle to an electric vehicle.\n“Based on that, we have some numbers to estimate where around Singapore these drivers would be distributed, and based on that, we would estimate potential locations to plant the charging stations.""\nThe Transport Ministry is conducting studies to better understand the different factors that affect the demand for charging and is studying potential solutions to guide its roll-out.\xa0\nFor a start, it will prioritise public car parks and work with the private sector to improve the availability of electric vehicle charging.\n“If you are considering an electric vehicle over an internal combustion engine vehicle you must be convinced that access to a charger will be as convenient as access to a petrol station,” said Dr\xa0Puthucheary at the Committee of Supply debate.\nDr Ong said location will also depend on charging technology. Under the national EV charging standard TR25, there are two standards – Type 2 (AC) for slow-charging and Combo 2 (DC) for fast-charging.\nSlow-chargers can fully charge a car in six to eight hours and are more useful for overnight charging.\xa0\n“It would make more sense to actually have these (slow) charging stations in, perhaps, HDB estates, where drivers are already parking their cars at HDB car parks overnight,” he said.\nFast-chargers, on the other hand, are more suited to those constantly on the move. For example, SP Group’s fast-chargers primarily serve drivers of fleet vehicles such as electric taxi service HDT, Grab’s electric cars, and multi-national corporation Schneider Electric’s internal-use fleet.\nThese can get a car battery pumped up in 30 minutes and many are spread out in areas such as office buildings, housing estates, business parks, JTC industrial estates and even on Sentosa.\nOn top of these two charging standards, the Land Transport Authority and Energy Market Authority have announced the addition of the Japanese fast-charging method CHAdeMO as an optional public charging standard.\xa0\nThis is compatible with electric vehicle models such as the Nissan Leaf, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Honda Fit EV, which means buyers can choose from a wider range of options.\nCHARGING AHEAD – WHAT’S NEXT?\nAs Dr Puthucheary put it, having all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040 is ambitious. It will require significant changes to commuting and consumer behaviour and the necessary supporting infrastructure.\nStill, economist Associate Professor Walter Theseira who heads the Master of Management in Urban Transportation programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, is not quite sold on the target of 28,000 charging points.\n“What does 28,000 mean? How many EVs can 28,000 support? If you have charging technology where you can charge within 15 minutes to half an hour, then 28,000 can support a lot of EVs,"" he said.\xa0\n""But if you are relying on overnight charging, then I\'m sorry, 28,000 actually supports fewer than 28,000 EVs, maybe 28,000 at most.""\nDr Theseira added that even if people do not\xa0expect to charge every night - in other words, for a charging point to support more than one car – it would require a system of subscription and payment which has yet to be worked out.\nOthers, though, see the battery as half full and Dr Ong believes 28,000 is just the beginning.\n""Once this demand is created, and we see there\'s a growth in EVs compared to EV-ICE mix, I believe strategies will be adjusted to potentially increase the locations and the charging points, iteratively, so we can achieve an electrification of vehicle future,” he added. \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     electric vehicles ', '     environment ', '     transport ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A multi-agency task force has been formed to step up public hygiene standards in Singapore beyond the COVID-19 outbreak, authorities said on Friday (Mar 6).\nThe new SG Clean Taskforce, chaired by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, is\xa0under the purview of the multi-ministry task force for COVID-19 announced in January.\nMr Masagos, who was speaking alongside Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference, said\xa0SG Clean was a long-term campaign.\xa0\n""SG Clean is not a one-time exercise for COVID-19,"" said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nBuilding on the SG Clean campaign launched last month, the SG Clean Taskforce will aim to ""galvanise collective action"" in ensuring the cleanliness of public spaces, encouraging good personal hygiene and adjusting social norms to reduce the spread of disease, said the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources in a press release.\nAs of Thursday, Singapore has confirmed\xa0117 cases of COVID-19.\xa0The vast majority - 81 cases - have fully recovered.\nAs part of its scope, the new task force aims to encourage the public to adjust social norms to help prevent community spread of the disease.\n""For instance, many have refrained from shaking hands during this period,"" said the ministry. ""The SG Clean Taskforce will also encourage people to use serving spoons when sharing food, eat from trays and return trays in public dining places and to keep their tables clean.""\nIt will also encourage the adoption of good personal hygiene habits such as washing hands frequently, using a tissue when sneezing or coughing and keeping public toilets clean and dry.\n""Although Singapore is generally considered a clean and green city, we want to further step up cleanliness and hygiene standards in all facets of our lives, and make these our new norms beyond the immediate COVID-19 situation,"" said Mr Masagos.\n""This will help keep our families and communities safe and healthy.""\nMr\xa0Wong said public hygiene was the easiest to tackle because the Government could work with cleaning companies, set standards and audit them.\xa0\xa0\nBut he added personal hygiene and social norms were ""more difficult"" to address.\nHe highlighted that habits like not touching one\'s face and shaking hands were hard to shake off, although he said he was beginning to see changes.\n""A few weeks ago if you tell people \'I don\'t want to shake hands\', you will get sort of strange looks, but now people understand,"" he added.\n""Some of these habits are hard to change. That’s why we do have to keep emphasising the message, we do have to ask everyone to step up this responsibility and this is the only way to fight the virus.""\nIn a Facebook post on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong similarly\xa0stressed the importance of hygiene and cleanliness in slowing the spread of COVID-19.\n""We have been quite successful identifying patients, tracing contacts and stamping out clusters,"" said Mr Lee. ""We will keep on doing this. But we also need to slow the spread of the virus, and that means we must raise our hygiene standards.\n""Better hygiene must be our first line of defence,"" he said.\nAlso speaking at Friday\'s press conference was the health ministry\'s director of medical services, Associate Professor\xa0Kenneth Mak, who urged travellers entering Singapore to cooperate with authorities.\xa0\n""Being socially responsible helps protect our community. Won\'t prevent new cases from coming ... we are a porous country,"" said Assoc Prof Mak.""We ask therefore that all travellers be cooperative with us.""\nAMENDMENTS TO ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH ACT\nA key part of the SG Clean campaign is the SG Clean quality mark, which serves as a hygiene indicator.\nVarious government bodies have been working with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to audit their premises and related areas, some of which are already SG Clean certified.\nNEA aims to roll out the SG Clean certification programme at\xa0premises with high human traffic and more vulnerable segments of the population by the end of the year, said the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources.\nAs part of efforts to raise cleanliness standards in Singapore, the ministry will also make amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act later this year.\nMandatory cleaning standards will be introduced, including a regime for ""pro-active routing cleaning"" and disinfection at prescribed frequencies, it said.\nThese will cover areas such as frequency of cleaning and disinfection of high contact areas, pest management and back-of-house waste management such as bin centres.\nGreater accountability will also be placed on premises\' managers, who will be required to implement an environmental sanitation programme and remedy lapses in cleanliness.\nThey will also be required to appoint a trained designated person to help develop\xa0and implement\xa0the sanitation programme.\nNEA will work with sectoral leads to progressively implement the new requirements for 2021, starting with higher-risk premises such as pre-schools, schools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres.\n""It is important not just for COVID-19, but even not so long ago we had\xa0food poisoning cases at some of these pre-school centres, so we really need a higher level of hygiene for COVID-19, but also for other infectious diseases,"" Mr Wong said.\n""The (Ministry of Environment and Water Resources) will be in a better place when they work out the details –\xa0which are the places that we are focusing on in terms of raising the level of public cleanliness.""\nCNA has also contacted\xa0the environment ministry for comment on penalties for non-compliance.\nThe other members of the task force are Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee, Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor, Senior Minister for State for Transport and for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Manpower Low Yen Ling and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth as well as Transport Baey Yam Keng.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the COVID-19 outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Wuhan virus ', '     health ', '     environment ']}"

      Singapore to plant 1 million trees, develop more gardens and parks by 2030
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Singapore plans to plant 1 million trees and develop more and better connected green spaces over the next 10 years, said Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee\xa0on Wednesday (Mar 4), as he announced a new stage of urban planning for the National Parks Board (NParks).\n“We want to transform Singapore into a City in Nature to provide Singaporeans with a better quality of life while co-existing with flora and fauna of this island,” said Mr Lee.\n“Indeed, with climate change, more extreme weather conditions, increased urbanisation, we must do more on this front.”\nIn February, NParks unveiled plans to create a 6km green connection linking the Singapore Botanic Gardens to the Singapore River. NParks also plans to redesign the Istana Park at Dhoby Ghaut by combining it with its surrounding green spaces.\nMoving from Singapore being a “City in a Garden”, the country's bid to become a “City in Nature” comprises four key thrusts: More nature parks, enhancing the natural environment in new and existing parks and gardens, integrating nature into the built environment and making green spaces more accessible.\nBy 2030, there will be another 200ha of nature parks, which act as complementary habitats and buffer nature reserves from urbanisation, said Mr Lee, who is also the Minister for Social and Family Development. A 40ha nature park is planned for Khatib Bongsu.\n“This is important as nature reserves are the richest sources of our natural capital. They contain our primary and secondary rainforests, and core habitats for our native biodiversity and wildlife,” said Mr Lee.\nCurrently, nature parks are being established around Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves. Members of the public may use the space for nature-based recreation such as hiking and bird watching.\nOver the next five years, NParks will also develop 140ha of new gardens and parks in Sengkang, Punggol, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Timah.\nWaterways and water bodies in gardens and parks will also be made more natural “to protect against sea-level rise and flooding”, said Mr Lee.\nOther than that, NParks plans to conserve over 70 more native animal and plant species and enhance 30ha of forest, marine and coastal habitats over the next 10 years.\nRoads, buildings and industrial estates will also become more green, as NParks aims to plant more trees.\nMulti-tiered planting - started in 2013 - will continue to be implemented along roads, with these roads being called Nature Ways. Over the next 10 years, NParks hopes to create 300km of Nature Ways, and to make every road a Nature Way in the long-term.\nIndustrial estates, one of the hottest areas in Singapore, will get more than 100,000 trees over the next 10 years.\xa0\nThere will also be an additional 80ha of skyrise greenery over the next 10 years, which will bring the total skyrise greenery to 200ha by 2030.\nMore park connectors will also be available, with up to 500km of park connectors to be established by 2030, effectively putting “all households within a 10 minute-walk of a park”, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nThere are currently 340km of park connectors.\nWORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY\nNParks will work with the community in greening Singapore, said Mr Lee, announcing the launch of the One Million Trees movement over the next 10 years. Currently, NParks plants about 50,000 trees a year.\n“We want a whole new generation of Singaporeans to carry on this responsibility to keep planting and nurturing trees, for the benefit of future Singaporeans,” said Mr Lee.\nSo far, about 100 individuals and more than 100 groups and organisations have pledged their support to plant more than 120,000 trees.\nSome of these organisations and groups include Friends of the Park community, Community in Nature schools, Community in Bloom gardening groups, the National University of Singapore (NUS), JTC, OCBC and Shimizu and their contractors.\nKeppel Corporation has also pledged S$3 million to plant 10,000 trees in parks and nature reserves over the next five years, being the single largest tree planting donation to date.\nNUS will plant 80,000 trees on its campus over the next 10 years, while JTC and its stakeholders will plant 30,000 trees on Jurong Island.\nBy 2030, NParks aims to expand its volunteer network from its current 48,000 to 70,000, and to work closely with more schools and partners in reforestation efforts and citizen science projects. It also hopes to expand the Community in Bloom programme by providing more allotment gardens and encouraging planting of edibles.\nWorking closely with the community also means that communities can help to design, build, manage and programme more than 50 parks and estates by 2025. This includes activities such as designing park signage, promoting park etiquette and partnering gardeners for landscape planting.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2020 ', '     parliament ', '     NParks ', '     environment ']}"

Commercial vehicles, especially Light Goods Vehicles or LGVs, are key emission sources and pollute our air due to their high mileage and reliance on diesel.""\nThe CVES shares similarities with the\xa0Vehicular Emission Scheme (VES) which gives car buyers and taxi operators who choose cleaner car models an upfront rebate of up to S$20,000 and S$30,000 respectively. There are plans to refine the VES further, added Mr Masagos.\nThe CVES will apply to new vehicles as well as vehicles that are no more than three years old at registration.\xa0\xa0\nFor owners whose vehicles are in Band A (cleanest vehicles), the incentive will be handed out annually in equal payments of $10,000 over three years. Owners of Band B vehicles will receive an upfront $10,000 incentive upon vehicle registration, while owners of Band C vehicles will have to pay a $10,000 surcharge upon registration.\nIn order to complement\xa0the CVES, the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) will be expanded from April next year and cover Euro 4 diesel vehicles, said Mr Masagos. The existing ETS will be extended until end of March next year.\nThese initiatives are part of a slew of measures as Singapore moves towards a vision to have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2020.\xa0\nIn\xa0Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat\'s Budget speech last month, it was also announced\xa0that the\xa0Government will introduce the EV Early Adoption Incentive (EEAI),\xa0where those who buy\xa0fully electric cars and taxis will receive a rebate of up to 45 per cent on the Addition Registration Fee.\n“Public transport generates up to three\xa0times less carbon dioxide than private transport. Hence, our approach is to encourage public transport and green public transport as far as possible.\xa0The\xa0Land Transport Master Plan 2040 by the Ministry of Transport supports this. This is how Singapore moves to cut GHG (greenhouse gas)\xa0emissions – simply drive less,"" said Mr Masagos.\xa0\n""If driving less is, somehow, not an option, motorists can still practise sustainable consumption by choosing cleaner vehicles that emit less GHG and harmful pollutants.""\nBoth the CVES and the enhanced ETS will run till Mar 31, 2023.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2020 ', '     transport ', '     environment ']}"

Together with our industry stakeholders and Singaporeans, we will design a DRS suitable for Singapore.”\nIn countries such as Norway\xa0and Germany, similar schemes have achieved a high recycling rate of beverage containers of more than 80 per cent, she said, adding that NEA is studying international best practices.\xa0\nNEA will start industry consultations and conduct a request for information for the scheme later this year, she added.\xa0\n“We have been working closely with our economic agencies to actively engage interested companies to set up mechanical recycling plants for post-consumer plastic waste here,” said Dr Khor.\xa0\n“PET bottles and the like can then be processed locally into plastic pellets, which can in turn be used to make new products. We will announce details when ready.”\nHowever, Dr Khor also noted that not all plastic waste is suitable for mechanical recycling, including contaminated plastic bags and other single-use plastics.\xa0\n“To treat these, we are also pursuing chemical recycling solutions. Chemical recycling can potentially convert these plastics into higher-value products, like pyrolysis oil, which is a potential feedstock for Singapore’s petrochemical sector. If successful, this will move us closer to both our goals of being a Zero Waste nation and a low-carbon economy,” she said.\xa0\nDr Khor said the Ministry hopes these solutions will become “NEWOil”, similar to NEWater and NEWSand, to strengthen Singapore’s resource resilience.\xa0\nThe Environment and Water Resources Ministry is working with the Economic Development Board\xa0(EDB) and industry partners to explore establishing a pilot chemical recycling plant that will contribute to and help anchor the chemical recycling value chain in Singapore within the next few years, she added.\xa0\nDr Khor also noted that under the Extended Producer Responsibility framework, producers are responsible for collecting and recycling their product packaging.\nThe mandatory packaging reporting requirements under the Resource Sustainability Act will commence from Jul 1.\xa0\nThe Bill, passed in September 2019, introduced regulations to reduce food, packaging and electronic waste, as Singapore’s only landfill at Pulau Semakau is expected to run out of space by 2035.\nCompanies that use packaging, like importers and supermarkets, will be required to submit an annual report on the amount of packaging in their products and their packaging waste reduction plans from 2021.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Budget 2020 ']}"

According to NEA, more than 300,000 one-, two- and three-room HDB households will qualify for this voucher.\xa0\n“Not only will this help fight climate change, households can also benefit from electricity cost savings of up to S$60 annually,” he added.\xa0\nMr Masagos noted that refrigerators are among the top three highest energy-consuming household appliances.\xa0\nRefrigerators account for about 17 per cent of the total electricity consumption in Singapore households, based on the NEA's 2017 household energy consumption survey. Less than 7 per cent of households today are using energy-efficient refrigerators, said the agency in a separate media release.\xa0\n“Many households continue to purchase one to two ticks refrigerators, partly due to the higher upfront costs of energy-efficient models, without considering the savings from electricity consumption over the long term,” said Mr Masagos.\n“Similarly, showering takes up a significant proportion of water consumption, yet many households are choosing the less water-efficient fittings.”\nMr Masagos also announced that all one- to three-room HDB households will receive a S$50 voucher to offset the cost of changing their shower fittings to more water-efficient three-tick models.\n“If all eligible households make the switch, we can collectively reduce emissions equivalent to taking around 12,600 cars off the road, and save up to 400 million gallons of water annually,” he added.\xa0\nMORE LED LIGHT VOUCHERS\nMr Masagos also announced that the Switch and Save - Use LED programme, first launched in 2018 for one- and two-room HDB households, will be expanded to all three-room HDB households.\xa0\nAs part of the Climate-friendly Household Package, each three-room HDB household will receive a S$25 voucher to buy LED lights, which are 80 per cent more energy-efficient than incandescent lights and 40 per cent more energy-efficient than compact fluorescent lights.\xa0\nAbout 233,000 HDB households will benefit from the programme expansion, of which 64 per cent are not using LED lights, said NEA. If all these households switched to LED lights, they could save the equivalent energy required to power about 4,000 three-room HDB flats, or 12.4 million kWh.\xa0\nSince the programme was rolled out, about 8,700 one- and two-room HDB households across Singapore had used the vouchers and switched to LED light bulbs, said\xa0NEA.\nREDUCE USE OF CLIMATE-UNFRIENDLY REFRIGERANTS\xa0\nIn addition to the S$24.8 million package, Mr Masagos also announced a slew of measures targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from refrigeration and air-conditioning.\xa0\nIntroduced to reduce Singapore’s greenhouse gas emissions arising from the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in the refrigeration and air-conditioning sector, the measures will be implemented by NEA in phases from 2020 to 2023.\xa0\n“HFCs can be found as refrigerants in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, and could leak during installation,\xa0\xa0maintenance and disposal. Some forms of HFCs trap a much larger amount of heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide,” said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nNEA will also introduce a voluntary climate-friendly label to help households identify refrigerators and air-conditioners that use alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potential (GWP),\xa0said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nGWP refers to a measure of the warming effect of a gas relative to the warming effect of an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide, usually over a 100-year period.\nAccording to NEA, about 10 per cent of registered air-conditioning unit models in Singapore use refrigerants that are climate-friendly, while most of the registered refrigerator models in Singapore already use a climate-friendly refrigerant.\xa0\nNEA will launch a new grant to support companies who want to make an early switch to more climate-friendly commercial water-cooled chillers, announced Mr Masagos.\xa0\n“From 2022, we intend to restrict the supply of commercial water-cooled chillers and household refrigerators and air conditioners that use HFCs with high global warming potential,” he added.\xa0\nLater this year, NEA will launch a training course to train and certify technicians to handle refrigerants properly, said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nNEA is working with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and Temasek Polytechnic (TP) to introduce training courses for household air-conditioner technicians and chiller technicians respectively, it said in a media release.\xa0\nThe training and certification scheme aims to establish the proper handling of refrigerants during installation, maintenance and decommissioning of refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, said NEA.\xa0\nThe training courses conducted by ITE for household air-conditioner technicians will commence in the second half of 2020, while the courses for chiller technicians conducted by TP will commence in 2021.\xa0\nCompanies carrying out these services are also encouraged to send their technicians for training and certification.

About 20,000 food establishments are expected to come under the integrated framework, he added.\xa0\xa0Establishments in Category A and B involve significant or moderate food handling practices, such as restaurants or bakeries respectively.\xa0\xa0They will be recognised with longer licences and presented with higher award tiers if they put in place systems and processes to strengthen their food safety and hygiene standards, as well as demonstrate good food safety performance, he said.\xa0\nEstablishments in Category C such as supermarkets, which involve minimal food handling, that have a good track record of food safety assurance will be similarly eligible for longer licences.\xa0\xa0This framework will replace the annual grading and licence renewal system for food establishments, and incorporates the Food Hygiene Recognition Scheme for retail food outlets.\xa0\xa0Despite the longer licences, SFA noted that it will continue to carry out inspections to ensure food establishments comply with food safety and hygiene requirements.\xa0\xa0“Food establishments which commit any major food safety or hygiene lapse or are implicated in a gastroenteritis outbreak will have their award tier downgraded. They will also be issued a new licence with a duration\xa0corresponding to the lower award tier,” said the agency.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Budget 2020 ']}"

      Singapore is becoming a nation of urban gardeners – but is it all that sustainable?
  </h1>, 'text': 'As global warming continues to be an oft-debated topic amongst the public, scientists, teenage activists and the adults who get riled up by said teenage activists, the one topic that’s gained traction is that the real solution to climate change is planting more trees.\nThe Science journal published a study in 2019 that mapped potential tree coverage of 4.4 billion hectares and its ability to absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global warming. Dr Jane Goodall is one of many environmental influencers leading the reforestation agenda (find out more at 1t.org) and has committed to planting five million trees this year.\n\n\nIn Singapore, where land is scarce, districts are built up, and most residents keep home in high-rise apartments, many have taken to greenifying their homes, offices and even public spaces through the use of plants, urban gardens and rooftop urban farms.\nPlants have become big business for nurseries. In the most recent study conducted by NParks in 2016, the revenue generated from the sales of plants by the nursery industry was estimated at S$265 million. This figure includes both commercial and private purchases of ornamental plants, orchids, shrubs, trees and turf.\nPlant shop founders and owners, like Alex Low of Potta Plantta and Cheryl Lee of The Botanist and Her Thieves (TBHT), credit this ever-growing love for plants to social media and the online community of “plant parents” (#plantparenthood).\n“Pinterest and Instagram have definitely played a huge part in inspiring people to ‘live better’, for example, styling their personal spaces, or learning to cook,” said Lee.\nThese inspirational images, worthy of any interior design hardcover, have put plants on the must-have decor item list – green thumbs optional. Visit any pop-up boutique market and you’ll spot plant stalls hawking Philodendrons and Monsteras, only the hottest plants to own right now. (Move over, fiddle-leaf fig tree).\nAnother “It” plant is the succulent (plants with thick, engorged stems or leaves), which has found its way into weddings as potted favours or on wedding cakes alongside fresh flowers. Companies too have caught on to the plant-loving trend and started to incorporate gardening workshops, like terrarium potting, into their corporate team-building efforts.\nTumbleweed Plants is one such business that runs these workshops. But much more than that, Denise Law, one of the founders of Tumbleweed, helps to greenify offices too.\n“We are working with some very prestigious brands, helping them create the kind of work environment that their employees, customers and clients want to spend time in,” said Law. “The tech-focused companies in particular have really caught on to the importance of plants to the look and feel of a working space.”\nBesides the obvious aesthetic appeal of plants, this boom in plant ownership can also be attributed to our increasingly digital, indoor-sy lifestyles.\xa0\n“More than at any time in our past, we are living in big towns and cities and often in confined living spaces, spending work and leisure time in the digital world, without much connection to the natural world that we’re inherently part of,” said Law. “Being around plants is a kind of antidote to our busy, urban, digital lives.”\n“More than at any time in our past, we are living in big towns and cities and often in confined living spaces, spending work and leisure time in the digital world, without much connection to the natural world that we’re inherently part of. Being around plants is a kind of antidote to our busy, urban, digital lives.” – Denise Law\n\n\n“Gardening has physical and mental benefits. It is good exercise which also has an uplifting effect on our mood,” said Ng Cheow Kheng, Group Director, Horticulture & Community Gardening, NParks.\xa0\n“It invigorates the mind and enables us to satisfy our innate need to connect with nature – also known as biophilia. There is growing scientific evidence to support beneficial biophilic effects on health, such as reducing stress, enhancing positive mood, improving cognitive skills and academic performance, as well as moderating the effects of ADHD, autism, and other childhood illnesses,” he added.\xa0\nPlants offer other health benefits too. According to Far East Flora’s Sales & Marketing Director Peter Cheok, air-purifying plants are a popular choice for their customers. “Plants [such as Anthurium, Snake Plant, Peace Lily and English Ivy] filter harmful indoor airborne toxins (or VOCs – votatile organic compounds) from the air around and release clean air to improve air quality at homes and offices. VOCs are emitted from materials found anywhere at home – from paint on the wall to fibres on the couch.”\nOn the surface, this growing green scene is good news all around with its environmental and social benefits. However, digging a little deeper, any trend and increase in demand for products means more logistics (to have plants supplied) involved, and more packaging to ensure safe delivery to customers.\nWhat does this mean for our carbon footprint and how are plant shop owners mitigating the negative impact on the environment?\nFor small businesses like Tumbleweed, Potta Plantta and TBHT, every small step makes a big difference in preventing adverse effects while helping to make Singapore greener.\n“All our bags are paper rather than plastic,” said Tumbleweed’s Law. “But we do use some single use plastics in our packaging (though we try to keep it to a minimum). We’ve also introduced waste reducing measures by encouraging customers and local businesses to share organic waste such as coffee grounds and eggshells that we can use as organic fertilisers.”\nPotta Plantta’s Low said, “We keep packaging to a minimal and often transport plants for deliveries in recycled fruit/vegetable baskets that are collected from the market. For our customers, we provide paper bags that can be reused or recycled. For deliveries, we always plan the most efficient route to minimise our time spent on the road, and we [also] tend to do our deliveries at night when the roads are less congested which reduces the time taken and fuel used, ultimately reducing our carbon footprint.”\nEven big businesses like Far East Flora are making efforts to reduce their carbon footprint through “the promotion and education of gardening, and the introduction of biodegradable bags at all four retail garden centres. There are more green initiatives in the pipeline – for example, the introduction of reusable tote bags,” said Cheok.\nHowever, a potentially bigger culprit in reversing the positive effects of gardening could be lack of knowledge in how to maintain a garden.\nFor Lee, The Botanist & Her Thieves started as a retailer for beautiful plant pots. But it soon morphed into a business to solve gardening problems and the wastage in resources they faced themselves as home plant owners.\n“We were making a mess at home when repotting. There was confusion with the range of fertilisers found off the shelf. We eventually amassed so many different types that you didn’t know what worked or not. Plants were dying even though we kept to a watering routine. It became our mission to design solutions to solve problems other houseplant owners might face too.”\n“Plants are living things, like any other pet,” said Low. “Time and effort are needed to successfully care for plants, and some people might not have the time or energy to do so.\n“In order for [plant ownership] to be sustainable, people must be able to pick a plant that is suitable for their home or office environment. Too often, we get customers coming to us for advice after the plants that they bought elsewhere died in a matter of days or weeks. This happens because they lack the proper knowledge to determine whether the plant is suitable for their environment,” said Low.\nEducation is key to fixing this waste problem. NParks has been fostering a love for gardening through their Community in Bloom (CIB) programme of creating community gardens and indoor gardening options. Sustainable practices are important to reduce waste but are not difficult to do, said NParks’s Ng.\n“Members of the public can take simple steps to ensure that they are as environmentally-conscious as possible,” he said. “Used containers can be recycled to become flowerpots for gardening. Biodegradable pots can also be used as greener alternatives. Food waste from the kitchen can be recycled via various composting methods.\xa0\n""Where natural light is lacking, more energy-efficient LED grow lights can be used to provide the right spectra of light for indoor plants. In addition, low-maintenance plants that are less pest-prone can be planted to minimise the usage of pesticides. Some of these plants include the Mini Monstera (Rhaphidophora tetrasperma) and the Trailing Watermelon Begonia (Elatostema pulchrum),” he offered.\n“We know the environment is straining under the weight of human impact and people want to make a positive contribution, wherever they can,” said Law.\xa0\nUltimately, going greener can only benefit our environment when done right.\n“Members of the public can take simple steps to ensure that they are as environmentally-conscious as possible. Used containers can be recycled to become flowerpots for gardening. Biodegradable pots can also be used as greener alternatives.” – Ng Cheow Kheng\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     environment ', '     business ', '     Singapore ', '     Expert Advice ']}"

      Banned! New York sends plastic bags packing
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK: Consumerist mecca New York targets its throwaway culture this weekend with a ban on single-use plastic bags that has been years in the making and is still rare in America.\nNew Yorkers like to see themselves at the forefront of efforts to save the environment but are used to receiving groceries in free plastic bags, often doubled up to ensure sturdiness.\nOn Sunday (Mar 1), that will change when New York becomes only the third US state to outlaw the non-biodegradable sacks blamed for choking rivers, littering neighborhoods and suffocating wildlife.\nEnvironmental activists welcome the new law but caution that exemptions will weaken its effect, while some small businesses worry the ban might negatively impact their profits.\nAt the Westside Market in Manhattan, 66-year-old Janice Vrana, who says she has been shopping with a reusable cloth bag for a decade, is delighted ""pervasive"" plastic sacks are being banished.\n""You could drive over them 500 times with a Mack Truck and they probably wouldn\'t break down. Whatever little I can do, I do,"" she told AFP.\nJanine Franciosa, a 38-year-old who works in advertising, said it is great people are becoming more aware of how their ""everyday purchases are affecting the environment"".\nBut not everyone is happy.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nWestside Market manager Ian Joskowitz, 52, told AFP some customers were ""upset"" because they use free plastic bags as garbage bags.\nFINES\nNew York uses some 23 billion plastic bags every year, according to the state government.\nAbout 85 per cent are thrown away, ending up in landfills, and on streets and beaches, it says.\nAfter several failed attempts, lawmakers finally approved the ban in April 2019.\nIt bars all retailers who pay state taxes -\xa0such as department stores, supermarkets, neighborhood corner stores and gas stations -\xa0from providing plastic bags to customers.\nViolators can expect fines of up to US$500, although officials have said they will give stores time to adapt to the new rules.\nThe ban will ""protect our natural resources for future generations"", said Governor Andrew Cuomo when he announced the legislation last year.\nThe law allows New York City and counties to levy a five-cent tax on paper bags, with part of the resulting revenue going to an environmental protection fund.\nKate Kurera, deputy director of Environmental Advocates of New York, says the ban will cause ""a tremendous reduction"" in plastic waste pollution.\nShe laments, however, that food takeouts, beloved by the city\'s 8.6 million inhabitants, are exempt.\nOther exemptions include bags for prescription drugs, plastic wrapping for newspapers delivered to subscribers, and bags used solely for non-prepackaged food such as meat and fish.\nKurera wishes the government would make the paper bag fee mandatory to force customers to bring their own carriers, noting that producing paper bags is intensive in terms of oil, fossil fuels and trees used.\n""LIVE WITH IT!""\n""Ideally neither bag is preferable,"" she told AFP. ""Behavior is slower to change when people know they can get a free paper bag.""\nGreg Biryla, New York state director at the National Federation of Independent Business, says alternatives can cost up to seven times more than plastic bags.\n""They are proportionally more burdensome on small businesses who aren\'t ordering in as big a quantity as their big business counterparts,"" he told AFP.\nCalifornia and Oregon have statewide bans of plastic bags while Hawaii has a de facto ban.\nFour other states have bans starting soon while Texas has prevented its cities from outlawing plastic bags.\nNew York is viewed as one of the most innovative cities in the world, but on the issue of plastic it has some catching up to do internationally.\nUbiquitous across the Big Apple are single-use plastic utensils such as cutlery, straws and stirrers, which European Union countries have voted to outlaw by next year.\nNew York\'s older residents note that plastic bags only became available in US grocery stores in 1979, signaling how quickly habits can change.\n""When I was growing up we brought our own bags,"" shopper Denise Shaleaon told AFP, adding of the ban: ""The New Yorker will have to live with it!""\n', 'related_topics': ['     New York ', '     environment ']}"

      From crop to kopitiam, Asia's coffee is facing its biggest threat - climate change
  </h1>, 'text': 'DILI: Wandering through Timor-Leste’s coffee plantations is like being lost in a forest. Across the country, the coffee grows wild and unkept, partially hidden under the sweeping canopies of the crucial shade from trees overhead.\xa0\nJorge Lopes stands and watches his young son run through the greenery, a natural playground. But for the 30-year-old\xa0farmer, he is not sure if these coffee plants can provide a decent future for his family.\nHere in the mountain town of Maubisse, the favourable weather conditions and fertile soil that have sustained quality coffee for generations are fading into memory. The temperature is increasing, driving away the\xa0mist that forms at altitude. Rain that used to start falling at the end of November every year is inconsistent and much reduced.\n“On the coffee farms, life is difficult,” said Lopes. “I really feel sad about the climate situation because it is really affecting the quality of our coffee beans. We can see that the coffee in Timor is natural, it’s organic and without chemicals. Climate change is hard for us.”\nClimate change is slowly making growing coffee in Timor-Leste unsustainable. It is a global theme -\xa0coffee cultivation is\xa0under threat across the planet. Farmers are hurting already and eventually, experts say, the impact\xa0will start to be felt by consumers too.\nAround the region, coffee farmers are enduring the toughest conditions they have ever faced. Worse is on the way. In Vietnam, Southeast Asia’s largest coffee producer, fewer areas will remain suitable for growing and water shortages will become more common. In Indonesia, volumes of coffee are already on the decline and quality is forecast to take a hit over the coming years.\xa0\nWhile Timor-Leste accounts for less than one per cent of the world’s coffee, few countries are as dependent on the crop. Eighty per cent of Timor’s agricultural exports are in the form of coffee, and apart from oil, it is the largest contributor to the national economy.\xa0\nThe quality of what is grown is what sets this young country’s coffee apart. It is single source and entirely organic. For more than 150 years, through colonialism and conflict, coffee has endured, despite the normal climate conditions for growing coffee in Timor-Leste being challenging.\xa0\nThe country typically experiences more arid conditions than other parts of Southeast Asia as well as shorter wet seasons. Climate change is already exacerbating all of these factors.\nIn late 2019, when rains should have arrived, providing relief to farmers and growth to newly seeded crops,\xa0 extreme drought was impacting all areas of the country, according to monitoring by the United Nations World Food Programme. Last year, the nation’s capital Dili experienced its lowest annual rainfall\xa0since 2006.\n“Coffee production is decreasing from temperature increases and rainfall change,” said Adao Soares Barbosa, Timor-Leste’s National Focal Point to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC).\n“We have soil and fertility loss, we have agricultural production problems due to flooding and decreasing rainfall and we also experience drought,” he said. “Communities’ lives and livelihoods are very much affected. There’s no financial or technological capability to adapt.”\nAmid diminishing yields, the economics make little sense anymore in Timor-Leste. Farmers’ months of physical labour and painstaking cultivation deliver little: For one kilogram of coffee fruit, they normally receive only about US$0.35.\xa0\n“In a poor season, it means our farmers and our supply chain struggles. In a good season, they’ll survive. But no one is making a big fortune out of Timor coffee at the moment,” said Bobby Lay, the executive director of one of Timor Leste’s biggest coffee export operations.\xa0\nHis company, Timor Global, has strong connections to Singapore, where it sends approximately 27 tonnes of coffee each year, the vast majority of which ends up in kopitiams - Singapore’s traditional coffee shops. Business is not great right now.\n“We expect our yield from the crop this year will be less than last year,” he said. “In Timor’s case, our coffee is still very much grown in its wild condition.\xa0 So we’re very much just relying on nature and the natural rain seasons.\n""The weather pattern has changed - either we get a much longer dry period or we get unseasonal rain. With unseasonal rain, the coffee is flowering at the wrong time. It’s confusing our trees and also ourselves.\n“We are only currently yielding about 15\xa0per cent of production of what it should be. In Portuguese time or my father’s time, Timor had an annual production of 50 to 70,000 tonnes of coffee. Now if we get 10 or 12,000 tonnes, everybody is jumping for joy that we had a good year,"" he said.\nTimor Global operates a 3,000 hectare plantation but also purchases coffee from small plot growers. Lay has seen firsthand the cost pressures that have fallen on them, worsened by climate change.\n“The motivation and initiative for them to continue to stay on the land and produce the crops, especially for the younger generation, is not there. Eventually over time, if it continues, there will be a breakdown, a separation and there won’t be any farmers that are still willing to work the coffee,” he said.\xa0\nJorge Lopes has already been questioning his future. “Coffee can only be harvested once per year and given the price, we’re maybe better off going to work somewhere else, like building the roads or other construction projects. We can make more money doing that and save our time,” he said.\nSome of the forecasts for the future of the 25 million coffee growers around the world are alarming. A report by Australian think tank the Climate Institute in 2016 found that climate change would halve the area suitable for coffee production around the world.\xa0\nMuch of the pain will be borne by developing nations. But there will be an inevitable impact\xa0on people’s lattes in developed countries too, according to Michael Hoffman, an entomology professor at Cornell University.\xa0\n“There are major problems causing extensive losses around the world. This is a pretty big deal, impacting local producers - many, many are very small scale -\xa0 all the way through to the corporate headquarters at Starbucks,” he said.\n“There are predictions that the price of coffee will increase. I know for some varieties that has already happened. Ultimately in the future it could be very different.\n“We’re talking about the whole planet changing and with one crop, it’s hard to predict. But there are going to be incremental price increases in the coming decades. I can’t see anything otherwise.”\nFor Timor-Leste’s coffee farmers, there are few solutions to help them defend their livelihoods. Norberto Soares, a grower working on generational land in Railaco says diversifying away from monocultures is important, but the climate is affecting everything in the ground. He sees others turning away from coffee and trying their hand at more lucrative crops like vanilla.\n“We worry. Some farmers now are not taking care of their coffee. They just leave it. They don’t clear it,” he said. “Coffee is the flavour in this country, but the price we get for coffee at the moment is not.”\nOthers like Mariano da Costa Alves, considered a young rising star of Timor’s coffee scene, are looking at small improvements to growing and processing techniques. Ameta, as he is known, wants to take advantage of the fourth wave of coffee movement - a demand for fair trade, high quality and organic specialty coffee - and is yielding astounding results.\nMuch of the country’s coffee trees are ageing and so too are the methods that farmers continue to use on their land. Ameta is bringing new knowledge to try and improve these processes, including simply planting more trees. In just a few short years, the 27-year-old has won prestigious coffee awards in Timor-Leste and is exporting his beans directly to hip cafes in Australia.\xa0\n“We cannot fight against nature. But we have to be thinking about having protections for what we’re doing,” he said. “I hope Timor-Leste can increase the quality and raise our hand to say that we’re here. So everyone looking for specialty coffee will come to Timor-Leste.”\nProf Hoffman says that coffee lovers should be more aware of where their morning cup comes from. With that comes a greater chance of understanding and support for actions to reverse the damaging impacts of climate change.\n“It’s important to appreciate the hand that touched that coffee berry at the beginning of the food chain, to realise the changes that they’re facing, let alone along the chain to get it into the cup in your hand,” he said.\n“The point is to simply raise awareness that our food is changing and that we’re all in this together.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     environment ', '     Singapore ', '     Trending ', '     sustainability ']}"

      Why Jakarta is the fastest sinking city in the world
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Ramli was born on Ubi Besar island, one of the many islands scattered around the bay of Jakarta.\nThe old fisherman has spent much of his life there, but the place he regards as paradise on earth has slipped between the waves.\n“In the late afternoon, I used to see people having fun on the beach. There are those who played football and only returned home after sunset,” the 87-year-old recalled fondly.\n“It’s gone … The waves pounded and slowly washed away the sand … It’s sad.”\nAs with Ubi Besar, some of the other islets in this chain of more than 100 islands, called the Thousand Islands, have disappeared or are about to — owing to changing weather patterns.\nA boat ride away from these islands is the sinking megacity Jakarta, which is in danger of suffering a similar fate.\nA combination of rising sea levels from global warming and land subsidence from the over-extraction of groundwater, among other reasons, has caused this coastal city to sink at an alarming rate each year, as the programme Insight discovers.\nThe question now is whether relocating Indonesia’s capital can safeguard the city. (Watch the episode here.)\nUNDUE GROUNDWATER LOSS\nFlood-prone Jakarta is the world’s fastest sinking city — as fast as 10 centimetres per year. In parts of North Jakarta, which is particularly susceptible to flooding, the ground has sunk 2.5 metres in 10 years.\nIt is little wonder that the World Economic Forum has warned that it is one of the world’s fastest disappearing cities. Almost half the city now sits below sea level.\nExcessive extraction of groundwater for drinking and commercial use is largely responsible for this: When water is pumped out of an underground aquifer, the land above it sinks.\nCurrently, 40 per cent of Jakarta’s residents lack access to piped water. Many of them then resort to carrying out their own groundwater extractions.\nIsnu Sulistyawan, who heads the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources’ Groundwater Conservation Centre, said these illegal extractions are the easiest, cheapest way to extract water.\n“Because once you drill a borehole, water can be extracted (from wells) without paying for it. The extraction of groundwater isn’t easy to monitor because the borehole may be hidden and difficult to find.”\nHe does not deny that groundwater extraction is partly responsible for the subsidence. But he also cites other reasons causing soil to move and the land to sink, such as tectonic activity and the load of heavy buildings.\n‘MASSIVE’ DEVELOPMENT\nPulung Arya Pranantya, a researcher with the Public Works and Housing Ministry, thinks it is likely that Jakarta’s new developments have had an impact on its soft soil.\n“It’s very possible that the buildings today have a greater weight than they did in the past,” he said. “And it’s very possible that this weight has led to faster land subsidence.”\nMuch of North Jakarta, for example, was originally swampland but has been converted into housing estates, shopping centres and factories.\nWatch: Why Jakarta is sinking, and what’s being done to stop it (4:29)\nEvery corner of the city, in fact, is being filled with residential buildings or shopping centres as the demand for residential and commercial spaces keeps rising. A growing number of skyscrapers dot the skyline.\nTory Damantoro, chairman of the Jakarta Chapter, Indonesia Transportation Society, agrees that the city’s infrastructure development by the government seems to have been “’massive” in the last five years.\n“A lot’s been built. There are subways, roads, ports, airport upgrades and so on,” he said. “It’s an attempt to play catch up because in the past 15 years, not much had been done.”\nIn the Muara Baru neighbourhood, one of the fast sinking areas in North Jakarta, water trader Yulianti’s shop is in front of a wall built to protect her business from flooding.\nBut the wall offers her little security; during the last flood, the water came up to 2m high. “The corners of the wall broke,” she said. “I slept until my foam mattress began to float because of the rising water.”\nA dyke was built to regulate water levels here, said Pulung, but because of the land subsidence, the dyke has had to be raised by about 20 cm a year.\nBIG MOVE, LITTLE GAIN?\nRujak Centre for Urban Studies executive director Elisa Sutanudjaja believes that Jakarta’s subsidence rate has hit a plateau, however — compared with the “severe sinking” up till 2011 — and that the ground is becoming “a lot more compact”.\nA mega project called the National Capital Integrated Coastal Development programme is also proceeding as a measure to protect the city from the onslaught of seawater. It includes the construction of a giant seawall.\nAnd to help ease the burden on Jakarta, Indonesian President Joko Widodo announced in August that the country’s capital will move from the heart of Java island to East Kalimantan, on the forest island of Borneo.\n“We can’t let the pressure on Jakarta and Java increase further — the problems faced by Jakarta in terms of population density, traffic jams, air pollution and rising water levels that we need to handle,” he said.\nHowever, some of Jakarta’s issues, especially rising water levels and land subsidence triggered by climate change and rapid development, will take years to overcome.\nIn a CNA commentary, researcher Rendy Diningrat at The SMERU Research Institute said the move also seemed like “an attempt to escape the chronic problems in Jakarta that need to be addressed immediately”, like water shortages, floods and traffic congestion.\nRudy Prawiradinata, deputy minister for regional development) at the Ministry of National Development Planning, has given the assurance, however, that the central government will continue to assist Jakarta in tackling its problems, including the land subsidence issue.\n“There are several projects which are in the pipeline. We’ll continue to finance them or help Jakarta to seek loans from other countries,” he told CNA recently.\n“Moving the capital will alleviate some of the problems Jakarta is facing. Fewer people will mean less traffic and more access to clean water.”\nWatch the episode here.

      Snake wranglers to the rescue as sightings increase in Jakarta amid urban sprawl, frequent flooding

Snakes could often be found at\xa0his front porch and\xa0backyard.\n""I have had six encounters with snakes during my time here,"" he said.\xa0\nFearing that they might one day harm his two-year-old son, Mr Ratuwalu raised the issue\xa0with his neighbours early this year.\nHis neighbours, who had either sighted or had their own run-ins with the limbless reptile, decided to hire snake wranglers to comb their neighbourhood.\nTheir plight was shared by many others in Greater Jakarta.\nScientists have speculated that a prolonged dry season in Indonesia, which lasted into mid-November, prompted snakes to extend their egg incubation time, increasing the egg\xa0hatching rate from the usual range of between 50 per cent and\xa070 per cent to 80 per cent and 90 per cent.\xa0\nFlooding which hit the region\xa0in early January also meant that snake pits were sometimes inundated, forcing the serpents to venture out in search of safer dwellings.\nThere were also snakes that were\xa0washed away by the floodwaters and ended up in residential areas.\nA recent snake scare\xa0gripped the\xa0Greater Jakarta area, prompted by the discovery of 34 cobra snakelets in a residential area in Citayam, south of the Indonesian capital on Dec 11.\nThis incident was followed by the discovery of 18 cobra snakelets in a densely populated housing complex in Joglo, West Jakarta on Dec 15 and the removal of 8 cobra snakelets from a residential area in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta on Dec 17.\nWhile a higher snake hatching rate was observed, a herpetologist told CNA that it was\xa0nothing to be alarmed about.\xa0\nHuman-snake encounters would see an upward trend as people continue to\xa0push further into the snakes\' natural habitat, he added.\nRISKY BUSINESS\nWith the recent snake scare, Mr Nurdin Anoy\'s reptile removal company Indah Pesona\xa0has been swamped with requests from residential areas and factories to comb their premises.\nThe company, which charges 2.5 million rupiah (US$182) per visit, is booked all the way until the end of February.\nArmed with snake hooks, flashlights and cotton pouches, an eight-member team arrived at Mr Ratuwalu\'s 7ha neighbourhood at 9pm on Jan 11. \xa0\nThe team prefers to get to work\xa0at night because snakes are nocturnal and like to hunt for food when the temperature is cool.\nThey diligently\xa0scanned the rows of trees\xa0along the perimeter walls surrounding the residential area, inspected every drainage hole, turned over rocks and stacks of wood, and\xa0poked holes and cracks on the ground. They also\xa0combed through thick\xa0shrubs and grass patches.\xa0 \xa0\nIt was not long before they found their first serpent, an Asian vine snake wrapping around\xa0a tree branch.\nTo the untrained eye, the vine snake would be\xa0nothing more than a thin line amid\xa0the thick foliage, but\xa0the team spotted its body\xa0glistening in the beam of their flashlights.\nOne wrangler tried to catch the snake using his hook while another readied the pouch. The snake\xa0tried to escape but in the end the wrangler managed to pinch the snake’s body with his hook.\nAs the wrangler tried to put the 50cm snake into his pouch, the snake put up one last fight and bit the wrangler’s hand.\nAlthough vine snakes are not venomous, their bite can still lead to infection if the wound is left untreated, particularly if the snake’s fang snaps and lodges underneath the skin.\nThe wrangler examined his two puncture wounds, washed them with antiseptics, wrapped his hand with bandages and carried on with his work as if nothing had happened.\nMr Anoy, who has been wrangling snakes since the company started in 2006, said his line of work is very risky. “That’s why we only let the more experienced members of our team to handle venomous snakes,” he said.\nBut even the most skilled wranglers are prone to mishaps and accidents do occur.\n“Our team is depleting. Some left the profession because they got married and their wives told them to stop. One team member died four months ago after he was bitten by a cobra,” he said.\nKEEPING THE NEIGHBOURHOOD SAFE\nIt was 3am when the team finished combing the housing complex.\nAfter six hours of hunting, the team caught ten highly venomous serpents - seven Javan spitting cobras, one Malayan krait and two white-lipped pit vipers.\nThey also caught several non-venomous snakes, including\xa0two pythons, six vine snakes and two painted bronzebacks.\n“We catch the snakes and release them in the wild, away from residential areas,” Mr Anoy said.\nMr Ratuwalu\xa0was shocked by the amount of snakes the team managed to find.\n“I can breathe a little easier easier now,” he said.\xa0“I hope the neighbourhood will be a lot safer after this.""\nMr Anoy has a few tips for homeowners\xa0to keep their houses safe.\n“The first thing they need to do is close all access. Smaller snakes can creep through\xa0gaps underneath the doors. People need to invest in sink hole covers as well,” he said.\n“Snakes are also sensitive to pungent smell like moth balls and air freshener. People can also put hemp ropes around the house because snakes wouldn’t slither across coarse surface.”\nMr Anoy admitted that it is impossible to completely remove all snakes from the area, “especially with the housing complex divided by a river and connected to a drainage system, there are many ways for snakes to still creep in.”\n""SNAKES HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE""\nThe snake wrangler shared that the number of snakes they netted recently provides\xa0a hint of how rampant the problem has been this rainy season.\nThey caught 15 cobras from one housing complex in Condet in\xa0East Jakarta. There were also 24 cobras found in Cilangkap, East Jakarta while 31 hatched cobra eggs were discovered in\xa0Bojong, south of Jakarta.\nDoes this mean there are now more snakes in Jakarta residential areas?\nDr Amir Hamidy, a herpetologist from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), said that the recent scare does not necessarily mean that there has been an unusually large number of snakes inhabiting residential areas.\n“As cities grow\xa0and more houses and buildings are being built, humans are encroaching on\xa0snakes’ natural habitats. Snakes, particularly cobras are extremely resilient and they can adapt to human-modified environments. They can live and lay eggs around houses in damp holes and gutters,” he told CNA.\n“Conflicts between humans and snakes happen all the time. But this time,\xa0the cases were well documented and reported. Coincidentally, the cases also happened within a short interval.”\nIndonesia is home to 349 species of snakes, 77 of which are venomous, Dr Hamidy said.\nHe added: “Snakes have always been there. People just don’t know it because snakes tend to avoid contact\xa0with humans and hide. But if the snakes felt threatened, they will strike back”.\nWith more housing complexes being built, conflicts\xa0between humans and snakes will continue to rise, he noted.\nDr Hamidy noted that there has been a higher hatching rate this season, attributed to the changing climate patterns and this year’s prolonged drought. However, this spike is not out of the ordinary, he added.\n“We need to see if such influx occurs again during the next wet season. Then we can determine if this is a one-off phenomenon or a trend,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Thailand gives up plastic bags yet leaves rampant consumerism intact
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Thailand recently took an important step towards environmental protection when 75 leading retailers stopped issuing plastic bags to shoppers.\nThis step continues a campaign started by environmentalists and local governments in Thailand to reduce urban waste and pollution. The long-term plan is to ban all single-use plastics by 2021.\nThai newspapers have shown customers responding in good faith to the ban. Many are taking wheelbarrows and buckets to supermarkets, and others are re-using sacks made for transporting sugar and rice.\nBETTER LATE THAN NEVER?\nBut critics ask why it has taken so long.\nThe first bans of lightweight plastic bags took place in Bangladesh and India in 2002. China banned lightweight bags in 2008. And Thailand’s role in producing plastic waste has been known for years.\nA recent article in Science shows that, in terms of national averages, Thailand is the world’s sixth largest dumper of plastic. Adjusting these figures for coastal populations and coral reefs, Thailand leads the world.\nAccording to the article, Thais and visitors to Thailand will –\xa0 knowingly or otherwise – throw some 8.9 million plastic items into sewers and canals by 2025, resulting in more than half a million tonnes of waste in the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea.\nRecent news stories in Thailand have reported occasions of animals, including a deer and baby dugong, dying from eating plastic bags.\nRAMPANT CONSUMERISM\nDespite its late arrival, the new plastic ban is a welcome and pragmatic step.\nYet too often, attempts at regulating plastic use are wrapped up in the consumerism they seek to control.\nFrom 2008 to 2010, shops in Bangkok started a temporary craze of selling reusable bags with the words “global warming” on them.\nMeanwhile, supermarkets in central Bangkok remain icily air-conditioned and their products overly packaged. Bangkok’s annual carbon use has risen from some 7 tonnes per person in 2005 to nearly 11 tonnes today.\nThis is higher than London, New York City and Tokyo (but about the same as Beijing). It is also more than twice Thailand’s national carbon average of nearly 4 tonnes per person.\nGovernments have often supported these trends. In 2012, first-time car buyers received tax breaks, choking Thailand’s already crowded streets by an additional half a million cars.\nOne factor impeding long-term environmental planning is Thailand’s chaotic politics and military coups.\nThese have\xa0also shaped environmentalism itself. Like other countries, Thailand’s environmentalism reflects broader worries about the impact of growth on social order and tradition.\nMuch historic environmentalism in Thailand focused on fears about lost wilderness and heritage. Colourful paintings on the walls of schools and public buildings often show images of bucolic rural landscapes or threatened wildlife that present the “environment” as something remote from cities.\nAnother theme in local environmentalism is the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy promoted by the late King Bhumibol, who ruled Thailand for 70 years until his death in 2016.\nSufficiency economy presents a mode of living that urges moderation and tradition. It is promoted widely in Thailand by official sources.\nBut the US embassy once described it — in emails exposed by Wikileaks — as “vague and malleable”, popular only because of a “public reluctance to criticise anything associated with the revered King”.\nPOPULAR ENVIRONMENTALISM\nDespite these limitations, environmentalism in Thailand has served an important purpose in harnessing opposition to military governments. The last military government of 2014 to 2019 banned public gatherings of more than five people and curbed other forms of dissent.\nYet, in 2018, more than 1000 people gathered in Thailand’s northern capital of Chiang Mai to protest against a government luxury housing project on forested land near the revered national park and Buddhist temple of Doi Suthep.\nIronically, a similar proposal was made and criticised during 1980 to 1990 by the prime minister deposed by the military in 2006, Thaksin Shinawatra. One of Thailand’s earliest environmental controversies was opposition to a proposed cable car on Doi Suthep in the 1960s.\nEnvironmentalism has its strongest legitimacy in the public eye when it opposes what is seen as state corruption and where it involves national heritage and wilderness.\nSo, a consequence of this pattern is that popular environmentalism might only be effective on selected topics, and that necessary restrictions on other topics such as plastics are ignored.\nThailand’s new ban on plastic bags is a sign that environmental policies are becoming more effective.\nBut there are many more steps to take. The ban needs to be enforced and extended. Climate change policy needs to adopt more efficient and renewable sources of energy.\nReplacing fossil fuels with technologies such as hydrogen cells and solar panels are priorities for public transport and home heating, and so are addressing excessive packaging and air conditioning.\nWhat is needed is a root-and-branch rethinking of environmental priorities and an awareness that much popular environmentalism tends to romanticise Thailand’s past rather than think pragmatically about its future.\nTim Forsyth is Professor of Environment and Development in the Department of International Development, LSE.

      Avocados hit sweet spot in China, while sucking Chile dry
  </h1>, 'text': 'PETORCA, Chile: It is a superfood, packed with vitamins, minerals and fibre. And in China, avocado has also become a social media superstar since a fitness craze took the country by storm about six years ago.\nMore and more people are working out, toning up and showing off on social media, including what they eat to help burn fat and gain muscles.\nIn Shanghai, one avocado restaurant is taking to social media at a whole new level, with its marketing done entirely through word of mouth online.\nKiss Avocado even has a pink decor to attract girls who would “take selfies and post on social media”, said co-owner Lynn Yin. And as the Chinese middle class grows, more of them are eating such trendy foods.\nA decade ago, China’s volume of avocado imports was low: 31.8 tonnes in 2011. But it has increased by more than 1,300 times, to 43,000 tonnes in 2018.\nPreviously, an avocado from Mexico retailed domestically at about 50 yuan (S$10), in no small measure because of a 40 per cent total tax rate for the fruit.\nBut in 2014, Beijing granted market access to Chile. And under a bilateral free trade agreement, Chilean avocados have since entered with zero tariffs. By 2017, half of China’s avocados came from the South American country.\nThe fruit now costs about 10 to 15 yuan, whereas in Chile, the price has tripled to 3,200 pesos (S$6) per kilogramme, observed FoodyChile tour guide Colin Bennett.\n“When I first moved here (12 years ago), it was 1,000 pesos a kilo,” said the American, who settled in Santiago, the capital.\nThe price increase, however, is not the only concern in the world’s third-largest producer of avocados. As its exports increase, so too have its environmental problems.\nAnd the programme China’s Growing Appetite questions whether Chinese consumers should wake up to how their “food-print” affects other countries. (Watch the episode here.)\nWATER SHORTAGE\nChilean activist Rodrigo Mundaca knows all about his country’s problems with big avocado plantations, especially in Petorca, a major avocado-producing region in central Chile.\nIt has the kind of warm climate and stable temperatures for the fruit to thrive, except that a lot of water is needed.\nThe amount of water it takes to produce one avocado is enough to grow three oranges or 14 tomatoes. And plantations have been extracting “more water than authorised”, said Mundaca, who is fighting to protect local communities’ access to water.\nA 2011 investigation by Chile’s water authority showed at least 65 illegal underground channels bringing water from the rivers to private plantations.\nThe investigation led to criminal convictions of some agribusinesses, but that was not enough to stop them from trying again.\nThey still dug riverside wells to irrigate their fields, Mundaca pointed out at one such site that was fenced off to keep it out of sight.\n“This is a river. It’s a national good for public use,” he said. “You can’t simply install underground water (systems). This is fully illegal.”\nOne of the province’s rivers, the Ligua River, was declared depleted as far back as 2004 — “overexploited” by avocado producers, he added.\nIn the past 10 years, however, central Chile has also been living with a mega-drought. So nearly half of the country’s rural homes — some one million people — do not have regular access to drinking water nowadays.\nAs the groundwater level continues to drop, the local government has resorted to trucking water to Petorca’s rural residents. They are among 380,000 people in Chile receiving water from tankers as part of emergency measures declared last year.\nAsked if the plantations can be stopped from drawing too much water, Petorca municipal government’s water affairs manager Carolina Vilches replied that the municipality “doesn’t have the power to evaluate the environmental impact of agriculture”.\n“The ministry that has that power doesn’t consider agriculture as something that could impact the environment. Therefore the impact isn’t assessed,” she said.\nWATCH: Avocado madness in China is sucking Chile dry (3:47)\nVILLAGERS VS FARMS\nIt is obvious, however, that families are struggling with the lack of water. “(The most difficult thing) is seeing how everything dies — it’s terrible to see our little plants die — (and) washing up with so little water,” said Zoila Quiroz.\nHer family, who have lived in the Petorca valley for generations, used to get water from a stream four kilometres away. But it dried up, and they do not own rights to dig a well to get water.\nThat is not the case for the avocado farms surrounding the family on all sides. “The avocado trees have more rights than us, the human beings,” added Quiroz, wishing that the farms could all go.\n“I think this is the only part of the world where water is sold like candy.”\nIt turns out that in Chile, water rights are treated like property and granted in perpetuity by the government. With the drought, and plantations sometimes drawing more water than they have rights to, there are no more rights to allocate.\nWhile villagers are losing out in this way, Allent Vega Diaz disagrees that the criticisms are fair. The farm manager from Cabilfrut, the biggest avocado exporter in Petorca, pointed out that Chilean law “doesn’t discriminate between the uses of water”.\nNor does he think the government should change the law. “The government needs to invest to secure water for the population. People without water need water; they don’t need laws,” he said.\n“This area needs agriculture. Agriculture is the main activity in this area.”\nHe added that Cabilfrut has about 3,000 hectares of orchards but is using only about 200 hectares “because we don’t have water for all the areas”.\nHe is waiting for the next rainy season so that plantations can be irrigated and production restarted — even as Chile’s worst drought in 60 years spiked last year, with rainfall hitting new lows.\nA BETTER WAY?\nSeeing as Petorca’s water problems began before China became a market, CNA correspondent and Chongqing native Wei Du noted that “in a way, it’s really not our fault”.\n“But now we’re part of the problem … it does make you wonder, isn’t there a better way?” she questioned.\nThere is, according to Mundaca, the leader of water rights movement Modatima. “Nowadays there are some markets such as Denmark’s that have restricted the purchase of avocados from Petorca … because these companies have left our communities without water,” he cited.\nThe fruit has also been removed from menus elsewhere in Europe. But he pointed out that the agribusinesses have “signalled publicly that if the European market ceases to import Chilean avocados, they’d move on to China”.\nSome top producers in the region are already selling up to a third of their crop to China. That is a disproportionate share, given that China accounts for about 10 per cent of Chile’s avocado exports.\nHaving seen how China’s changing eating habits can affect other countries, Wei said: “We’ve been told for decades now that eating extravagantly is what the good life is about. So I wonder, is it time to set new ideals?”\nRead about whether bamboo rats are an eco-friendly answer to growing appetites for meat, and about how China’s love of durian is reshaping the Thai countryside.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     environment ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

However, for a start, some incentives may be helpful to nudge the right recycling behaviour, and we will continue to tweak the incentive system to bring about the desired outcomes,""\xa0NEA and F&N said.\nThey added that they hope that with time, residents will recycle to protect the environment, without any need for incentives.\nAs of Dec 31 last year, the “Recycle N Save” initiative had collected more than 1.2 million containers through 10 machines deployed in or near NTUC FairPrice outlets, according to the joint reply.\xa0\nFrom Jan 10, NEA and F&N, in consultation with NTUC FairPrice have relocated some reverse vending machines to places like hawker centres and community centres to “reach out to more users and residents in different parts of Singapore”, they said.\xa0\n""NOT WORTH IT""\nCustomer service executive Stella Hoe, 56, was one of the recyclers who said that she would not return after the change because the wait would not justify the returns.\xa0\n“If it’s 20 pieces for S$0.20, it won’t be worth the time spent here,” she told CNA a day before the change was implemented.\xa0 She had about 40 bottles and cans with her that day, and\xa0received about S$2 after waiting more than an hour.\xa0\nAfter the change, she would get about S$0.40 for the same number of items.\nMs Hoe, who had been going to the machine once to thrice a week since the launch of the initiative, said on weekends, she has had to wait four hours.\xa0\nShe lamented that it would take too long to accumulate 20 bottles, and even longer to accumulate them in multiples of 20. She told CNA she is now likely to throw the cans and\xa0bottles away.\n""I might put (them) in the (blue) bins, but it might be a wasted effort. In the end, they (the items) might still be treated like rubbish,"" she said, referring to blue recycling bins that are placed around housing estates for residents to deposit recyclables.\n""I don\'t like to throw\xa0in the blue bins because the area is not sheltered. I have to walk under the sun or rain.""\nMs Hoe was among about 15 people who were in line that day, some with at least a hundred items. Among them were also workers from cleaning companies.\nThose who were in line appeared to know one another, helping each other deposit the items, and contributing to their count so they could make multiples of four.\xa0\nThey were first queuing at one machine inside the NTUC FairPrice outlet at Our Tampines Hub, partially blocking the paths of customers trying to enter and leave the supermarket.\xa0\nWhen\xa0they were informed that two more machines had been installed in another area,\xa0some of them rushed towards the new machines.\nThe machine at the FairPrice outlet has since been moved.\nARE INCENTIVES\xa0COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE?\nNational University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser said he felt that there would always be people with low or no income, or grew up in an era when S$5 was a significant amount.\xa0\nIf they have time on\xa0their hands, they would\xa0find returning, say, a bag of 100 cans to receive S$5 of “free money” quite worthwhile.\n“Once\xa0the rates are reduced, it would not be worth the while queuing up, and we could expect the numbers to fall drastically, unless people eventually internalise the intrinsic value of recycling and make it a lifestyle, with or without monetary incentives,” he said.\nEnvironmental expert and founder of non-profit group Plastic-Lite Singapore Aarti Giri said there could be a “tiny bit of advantage” to such incentive schemes.\n“If they\xa0aren’t deposited in these machines, they may get incinerated if disposed as general trash or if they get contaminated in our blue bins,""\xa0she said.\n“There is a risk that people may buy more of such products if they see these machines as a better avenue to recycle bottles and cans. Refuse should always remain as the most important ‘R’ when it comes to plastics,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     NEA ']}"

      Bamboo rats – eco-friendly answer to growing appetites for meat?
  </h1>, 'text': 'JIANGXI, China: Tucked at the edge of bamboo-covered mountains in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province is a small niche farm that could be China’s answer to its insatiable appetite for meat: Bamboo rats.\nKept as pets by some, these slow-moving rodents look like cute over-sized guinea pigs, but two young vloggers in this farm are breeding them as a source of food.\nAnd they have rocketed to Internet fame by chronicling their day-to-day life on this rat farm.\nAsked if the critters were too cute to be killed for food, Liu Suliang, co-owner of Chinese Farm Brothers, quipped: “I’m willing to. It’s just like raising chicken or goats. I can’t possibly send them to university.”\nRegarded as agricultural pests, these furry bamboo rats are rodents that feed on the roots of crop plants such as sugar cane, tapioca and bamboo.\nBut increasingly, they are getting recognised as valuable food animals, and they could be the solution to China’s growing appetite for protein, as the programme China’s Growing Appetite discovers. (Watch the episode here.)\nTHE MORE ECOLOGICAL SOURCE?\nIn China, hundreds of millions of people are joining the global middle class, and this rising affluence means they have more money to spend on eating more, and eating better.\nThe country produces nearly all of its own meat, from poultry to pork to beef.\nBut its output of meat is expected to hit some 90 million tonnes by 2023 to 2024, an increase of about 30 per cent from 2012, according to a report by the US Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.\n“China’s livestock sector is under pressure from rising costs, disease, environmental regulations and resource constraints,” said the report.\nWhere the Chinese Farm Brothers come from, there’s not much going on in their inland remote village – there are plenty of abandoned houses as many of the young people there have left for the coastal factories.\nThe winding hills of their village also means that finding enough flat land to rear cows or even pigs can be difficult.\nSo mini-livestock like bamboo rats are a much better fit, and they don’t cost very much to rear either -\xa0both ecologically and financially.\nLiu said that the feed is essentially free as the surrounding area is abundant with bamboo. \xa0\nThe duo started with a modest 50 bamboo rats five years ago, and are now selling some 1,000 rats a year, thanks to their online hit series on how to cook these rodents.\nMarketing their unusual produce took quite a bit of ingenuity.\nThey seemed to have hit a winning formula with their online videos – which usually start with one of them picking up a bamboo rat and declaring that it can’t be saved, and culminating in the rat being grilled.\nLiu often appears on camera while his partner Hu Yueqing directs, shoots and edits.\nIn one video, Liu picks up a lively, squirming rodent and declares: “This rat looks like it has gotten heat-stroke. It doesn’t seem like it has much energy.”\nHe proceeds\xa0to cook and eat the slaughtered rat beside the river.\nWATCH: Would you eat this? (3:42)\nThe two men, who are not actually brothers, have since amassed millions of followers online with their quirky videos, especially on Chinese video sharing site Bilibili.\nSAID TO ENHANCE BEAUTY\nSome Chinese restaurants have already started serving these rats as a delicacy.\nZhu Zhibao, executive chef of Prosperous Kitchen in Guangdong Province, said that this practice of eating bamboo rats dates back some 1,000 years, and they are particularly popular among the Cantonese.\nIn fact, the northern part of Guangdong is mountainous and is unsuitable to farm crops or to rear cattle, said Yuan Jiecheng, owner of the restaurant. But there are plenty of rats and snakes.\nHe said that when they first introduced the bamboo rat dish at the restaurant, it wasn’t well-received by the young until online videos popularised it. Yuan also claims that consuming the bamboo rat is good for one’s skin and “it enhances your beauty”.\nGoing forward, Liu thinks that there’s huge potential for their rat business as farming tens of thousands of these rodents wouldn’t be a problem.\nThese rats produce rapidly with three or four litters a year. And the newborns can rapidly grow from 10 grams to 2 kg in just six months.\n“Right now, supply can’t meet demand. When more people know about bamboo rats, more people will want to eat,” he added. “If one person eats just one rat, the demand would be enormous.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     environment ']}"

      The year the world woke up to the climate emergency
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Schoolchildren skipping class to strike, protests bringing city centres to a standstill: armed with dire warnings from scientists, people around the world dragged the climate emergency into the mainstream in 2019.\nSpurred on by Swedish wunderkind Greta Thunberg - virtually unknown outside of her homeland a year ago but now a global star nominated for a Nobel prize - millions of young people took part in weekly demonstrations demanding climate action.\nAnd, like harbingers of the apocalypse, the Extinction Rebellion movement embarked on a campaign of peaceful civil disobedience that spread worldwide, armed with little more than superglue and the nihilistic motto: ""When hope dies, action begins.""\nAlthough scientists have warned for decades about the risk to humanity and Earth posed by unfettered burning of fossil fuels, in 2019 -\xa0set to be the second hottest year in history - their message seems to have finally hit home.\nThe 2015 Paris agreement saw nations commit to limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels as a way of curbing the worst impacts of global warming.\nA safer cap of 1.5 degrees Celsius was included as a goal for nations to work towards.\nWith Earth having already warmed by 1 degree Celsius, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) dropped a bombshell late last year.\nIts landmark report in October 2018 laid the groundwork for the string of climate shockwaves that rumbled throughout 2019: The world is way off course for 1.5 degrees Celsius, and the difference between 1.5\xa0degrees Celsius and 2\xa0degrees Celsius could be catastrophic.\n""The message from scientists was that each half-degree counts,"" said Amy Dahan, a science historian specialising in climate at France\'s National Centre for Scientific Research.\nIt was a message heard around the world.\nFor Corinne Le Quere, president of France\'s High Commission for Climate Change and member of Britain\'s Committee on Climate Change, 2019 was ""something new"".\n""I\'ve worked on climate change for 30 years and for 29 of those, as scientists, we\'ve worked unnoticed,"" she told AFP.\nThe IPCC report concluded that global CO2 emissions must drop 45 per cent by 2030 -\xa0and reach ""net zero"" by 2050 - to cap temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n""It\'s given us a clear timeline: we have 12 years to act,"" said Caroline Merner, 24, a Canadian member of the Youth4Climate movement.\nThe UN last month said carbon emissions must decline 7.6 per cent annually by 2030 to stand any chance of hitting 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nScientists meanwhile said emissions this year will instead rise 0.6 percent.\nDespite growing mobilisation and awareness, COP25 - the climate summit in Madrid this month - barely squeezed out compromises from countries over a global warming battle plan that fell well short of what science says is needed to tackle the climate crisis.\nANNUS HORRIBILIS\nBut while society and particularly younger generations appear to have woken up to the threat of climate catastrophe, industry shows little signs of sharing their urgency.\nGreenhouse gas emissions are once again set to rise in 2019 after hitting a record in 2018, as extreme weather events -\xa0made more likely as the planet warms - struck seemingly everywhere this year.\nCyclone Idai in Mozambique, typhoon Hagibis in Japan, a deadly, record-breaking heatwave across much of Europe, wildfires in California and eastern Australia, floods in Venice ... the list goes on.\nThe threat posed by climate change became so stark in 2019 that Indonesia, one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth, decided to move its capital to somewhere that wasn\'t sinking.\n""We\'re seeing climate change with our own eyes,"" Le Quere said. ""Reality is forcing us to act.""\nThe science came thick and fast this year, with the IPCC releasing two additional special reports on land use and oceans, and another UN body, IPBES, issuing a stunning warning of the threats posed by human activity to the natural world.\nFaced with an unbreachable body of evidence and mounting pressure from the streets, governments in 2019 started, slowly, to mobilise.\nA total of 66 nations now have plans to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The cities of London and Paris declared official ecological and climate emergencies.\nYet there are fears meagre progress could be undermined as developing economies appear no closer to ditching fossil fuels and the United States - the largest historic emitter - looks poised to complete its Paris pullout.\n""CLIMATE MAKES US EQUAL""\nEnvironmental activism, of course, is nothing new.\nAs Alfredo Jornet, professor at the University of Oslo, pointed out, indigenous peoples ""have been very active for a long time"" in protesting against climate change and deforestation, often to little fanfare.\n""It\'s easy to be worried about the climate when you have money and privilege,"" said Melina Sakiyama, 34, a Brazilian activist.\nWith the deadline for countries\' Paris commitments looming, as well as a series of high-profile environment summits in 2020, this year is unlikely to be a one-off in terms of climate action.\n""The question is how to mobilise this unrest in a way that can lead us to better, more peaceful, democratic and sustainable societies,"" said Jornet.\n""In a sense, climate change makes us all more equal. It makes us more capable of acting together.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     environment ']}"

      Oxygen bar to fake rain: 10 ways India tried to beat its 'airpocalypse'
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW DELHI: From an oxygen bar to artificial rain, a number of initiatives and ideas were floated in 2019 to battle India\'s pollution crisis.\nIndia is home to 15 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, with New Delhi named as the capital with the dirtiest air, according to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss-based group that gathers air-quality data globally, and Greenpeace.\nLarge swathes of north India, including Delhi - a metropolis of about 20 million - are covered under a thick blanket of toxic air at the onset of winter.\nVehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites, smoke from the burning of rubbish and burning of crop fields contribute to what is locally dubbed as the ""airpocalypse"".\nHere are some ways authorities, engineers and companies tried to help Indians breathe easy:\n1. DELHI\'S OXYGEN BAR\nDelhi residents gasping for fresh air could head to Oxy Pure, a bar that offers 15 minutes of ""oxygen enriched air"" for about US$7 in seven different flavours ranging from lavender and lemongrass to cinnamon and spearmint.\nBut it may be a costly affair in a country where the average person spends US$1.80 a day, according to research by Goldman Sachs and news website IndiaSpend.\n2. FRESH AIR IN A CAN\nWhen pollution spiked to ""hazardous"" levels, Indians could go online and order themselves cans of fresh air.\nSeveral companies, like Vitality Air in Canada and Indian brand Pure Himalayan Air, sell ""pure air"" in 10-litre cans for anywhere between 550 rupees and 5,400 rupees (US$75).\nEstimates suggest that the average adult inhales and exhales about 8 litres of air per minute.\n3. WEARABLE AIR PURFIER\nFor those who did not want to be cooped up inside on smoggy days, a wearable air purifier called AirTamer was the answer.\nThe 50 gram gadget, which can be worn as a necklace, emits negative ions that push pollutants away.\nIt sells for nearly 10,000 rupees in Delhi, a city described as a ""gas chamber"" by its own chief minister and where doctors say the air is as bad as smoking up to 20 cigarettes a day.\n4. ANTI-SMOG GUN\nDelhi residents craving clear skies could turn to an anti-smog gun, which ejects fine droplets of water at high speeds to flush out air pollutants.\nShaped like a hair dryer and mounted on a flatbed truck, the cannon can blast up to 100 litres of water per minute and get rid of 95 per cent\xa0of tiny particulate matter.\nCritics, however, called it a quick-fix solution that could do little to combat the noxious air.\n5. ODD-EVEN CAR SCHEME\nNew Delhi\'s authorities restricted the use of private cars for two weeks in November with the so-called ""odd-even"" system - allowing cars on alternate days, depending on whether their licence plate ended in an odd or even number.\nThe scheme helped little, prompting environmentalists to call for urgent action to combat air pollution.\n6. ARTIFICIAL RAIN\nAuthorities in the Indian capital considered cloud seeding developed by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in an effort to trigger rainfall and bring pollution levels down.\nBut the plan was stalled as there were no planes or the technical support available to spray the seeds.\n7. ROADSIDE AIR PURIFIERS\nDozens of giant air purifiers were installed at busy intersections of Delhi to combat roadside dust and vehicular pollution.\nIndia\'s top court in November ordered the federal and Delhi governments to install ""smog towers"" like those in China that can act as pollution vacuum cleaners.\nEnvironmentalists, however, termed them as ""band-aid fixes"" that did not bring down small particulate matter that can penetrate the lungs and enter the blood system.\n8. PURIFIERS AT TAJ MAHAL\nTwo mobile air purifiers were fitted at the iconic Taj Mahal in November as a toxic haze shrouded the 17th century mausoleum, whose white marble is turning yellow and green weathering filthy air in the world\'s eighth-most polluted city of Agra.\n9. BUS STOP SHELTERS\nProviding a small breather for commuters, several bus stops in Delhi were curtained with thick plastic sheets, creating a what local media called a ""fresh air chamber"".\nBut many said it was gimmickry as people had to step out within minutes and expose themselves to smog.\n10. INK FROM POLLUTION\nChakr Innovations, started by IIT engineers, capitalised on fumes from smoke-belching back-up diesel generators by turning the soot into ink and paint.\nThe technology can capture 90 per cent\xa0of dangerous pollutants.\nThe company has installed more than 50 such devices in government firms and offices as well as real estate developers.\n', 'related_topics': ['     India ', '     pollution ', '     New Delhi ', '     health ', '     environment ']}"

      Climate change, floods and drought: Here’s how badly Singapore could be affected
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The official projection, by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore, is that the country could experience a mean sea level rise of up to a metre by 2100.\nBut climate scientist Benjamin Horton thinks Singapore, of all places, should be worried because it could get higher.\n“What about a high emission (scenario)?” questions the professor at Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment. “We’re looking at a full 1.5 metres for Singapore … That’s our best estimate.”\nTo protect residents and infrastructure, he says Singapore must look at an even higher number. “You’d want to know what the extremes are … what the one-in-20 possibility is. We’re looking at greater than 2.5 metres.”\nThe implication is that inland areas as far as Bishan and Toa Payoh could be at risk.\nThat is how badly climate change could affect the island, even as the government prepares to spend probably S$100 billion over the coming decades to protect Singapore.\nAnd as the programme Why It Matters finds out, Singaporeans might see the effects of the climate crisis sooner than they think. (Watch it here.)\nTIP OF THE ICEBERG\nThe present-day sea level rise of 3.2 millimetres a year is “the fastest … we’ve seen for around six or seven thousand years”, notes Horton. And that does not add up to only six centimetres over the next 20 years.\n“What you want to think about is totalling that … with an acceleration,” he says. “For Singapore, in the next 20 to 30 years, we’ll get about 20 to 30 cm of sea level rise.”\nWATCH: Singapore in deep water: A flooded future (3:51)\nSingapore is a “hot spot” because the effects of the melting ice at the poles are “amplified in the tropics”.\n“These ice sheets are massive. Anything that has mass has attraction to it … (As) the ice sheets lose mass, that attraction is diminished and the water flows away,” he points out. “And it goes back to the tropics.”\nGreenland, if it were all to melt, would raise global sea levels by six metres, while Antarctica has enough ice to raise sea levels by 10 times that.\n“And all our observations of Antarctica and Greenland are indicating that we’re approaching a tipping point,” he adds.\nPERFECT STORM\nSingapore’s rainfall trend is already enough to cause concern, reckons senior research scientist Muhammad Eeqmal Hassim from the Meteorological Service Singapore.\nAnnual rainfall has trended upwards at a rate of 9 mm per decade from 1980 to last year.\n“Nine millimetres doesn’t seem a lot, but … we’ve seen an upward trend in terms of the intensity and also the frequency. So heavy rainfall events are becoming more frequent and more severe,” he says. “When it rains, it pours.”\nHe notes that heavy rainfall occurring over a short period is a “key ingredient” for a flash flood, “so with climate change, we can expect more of these events”.\nAdam Switzer, a principal investigator for NTU’s Earth Observatory of Singapore, is inclined to agree that there is an increased likelihood of inland flooding, especially if such rainfall events coincide with a storm surge.\nA storm surge occurs when low atmospheric pressure causes a swell in the ocean and wind blows the water mass against the coastline — which means a “temporary elevation of sea level”.\n“So we’ll see … up to 30, 40 cm over several hours, moving through the Singapore Strait,” says the associate professor.\n“You have a baseline of rising sea level, but on top of that, you have these temporary storm surges. This is where you get to the perfect storm.”\nHow often Singapore will experience these perfect storms, however, is a question mark, he acknowledges.\n“In Southeast Asia in particular, the data gap is so significant that it’s hard to put solid numbers on where we’re going to be in 2050 or 2100.”\nEVALUATING THE COSTS\nNTU’s head of economics, Euston Quah, says “proper data” is also needed to measure, in dollar terms, the damage flooding could cause.\nBetween 2000 and 2015, economic damages from floods were estimated to have exceeded S$32 million. Just the floods in June to July 2010 had cost S$23 million, from 868 insurance claims for business interruptions, property damage and motor vehicle damage.\nBut there is more to measuring damages than that, says the professor of environmental economics.\nThere is a cost to health, including treatment delays caused by traffic congestion; productivity loss is another aspect, for example if people cannot get to work or goods cannot be delivered; and there is lost tourism.\nAny loss of life must also be factored in, Quah points out, citing a study he and a colleague did in which the valuation of a person’s life here was S$4 million.\nThere are also intangible costs, such as loss of reputation, lost recreation and the psychological impact on people. “All of these feed back to the economy,” he adds.\nThis is why Singapore is spending S$400 million upgrading and maintaining drains in the next two years, on top of the S$1.8 billion spent since 2011.\nBut care must be taken not to overspend, says Quah, an expert in cost-benefit analysis. “If the cost of damages is S$10 million, (and) let’s say the cost of (the control measures) is S$12 million, then it makes no sense.”\nHe calls for a “more detailed study” of the two costs so that a “better decision” on spending can be made.\nRISK TO WATER SUPPLY\nPolitical and business leaders must also understand the scale of the “missing risks” in climate change, according to a recent joint report by the London School of Economics, the Columbia University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\n“Economic assessments of the potential future risks … have been omitting or grossly underestimating many of the most serious consequences for lives and livelihoods because these risks are difficult to quantify precisely and lie outside of human experience,” the report states.\nOne obvious scenario, however, is that a warmer climate means more droughts, so the reservoirs here and in Malaysia will be less than reliable.\nNEWater and desalinated water can close the gap, but they cost more. Their production requires between five and 17 times more energy, compared with the treatment of rainwater.\nThese two water sources will also be affected by climate change, points out Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder.\n“If we don’t have enough fresh water to begin with, we can’t recycle what we don’t have,” says the NTU professor.\nSeawater is not a simple solution either, as the warming of the oceans increases the amount of plankton such as algae.\nMost planktonic organisms, which drift in water, are microscopic. But in the right heat and light conditions, they can multiply and create blooms that are visible even from space. And scientists predict that climate change could make blooms more frequent.\n“We could have a decrease in the quality of the water,” says Snyder, who has focused on water issues for two decades and is a member of the World Health Organisation’s Drinking Water Advisory Panel.\n“In Singapore, we rely primarily on membrane technology that separates the salt from the fresh water … So essentially, the increasing plankton in the ocean is more than the current filters were designed to handle,"" he adds.\n“They can still filter the water, but they can’t filter as much water. So it lowers production, and it makes the entire system less efficient.”\nWatch the episode here.

  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: The prolonged dry season has hastened the hatching of cobra eggs, leading to more snake sightings in Indonesia.\n“The increase in snake numbers is an annual event. Coincidentally, this year the breeding cycle was greatly affected by the prolonged dry season, which will increase the hatching of cobra eggs from December until February,” Jakarta Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA Jakarta) Ahmad Munawir said on Friday (Dec 20).\nHe added that this should not be cause for alarm but instead an opportunity for education and more understanding about how to handle snakes, especially cobras.\nAccording to the Jakarta Post, authorities have received\xa0at least 45 reports of cobra sightings in Jakarta in the first two weeks of December. \xa0\nOther cities on\xa0Java island and Gowa in\xa0South Sulawesi\xa0have also reported more sightings of cobras and other snakes in residential areas after this year’s long dry season.\nIn Bekasi city, which borders Jakarta,\xa0officials said they have caught about 50 cobras in 20 separate incidents, the report added.\nIn a Twitter update on Dec 17, the Jakarta Fire and Rescue Department said they retrieved\xa013 young cobras near\xa0a weekly street market.\nA video of the operation shows fire and rescue officials placing the black snakes into a plastic bottle.\xa0\nOn the same day, Jakarta authorities retrieved another young cobra from a local museum in Cilandak, a district in South Jakarta.\nOn Dec 16, about nine young cobras were retrieved from a home in the district of Cakung in East Jakarta during a two hour operation.\nCobras are not the only\xa0snakes species\xa0that have been sighted.\nIndonesian authorities said they successfully caught a King Koros snake at a building in Central Jakarta on Dec 15, while a large python was captured on Dec 13 in North Jakarta.\nHead of the Indonesia Environment and Forestry Ministry’s genetics resources division, Mohamad Haryono, was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying that snakes lay their eggs during the dry season, and more eggs are laid if the season is prolonged.\n""Once the rainy season comes, all the eggs hatch. Meanwhile, the rains have started to flood the holes where they live, causing them to look for drier and higher areas like the residential areas,""\xa0he said.\nIndonesian Institute of Sciences\xa0herpetologist Dr Amir Hamidy said members of the public should keep their homes neat and get rid additional items that may serve as shelter for the snakes.\nDr Amir also recommended homeowners use scented\xa0floor cleaners as snakes dislike strong scents.\nFood waste should\xa0also not be left around the home as this attracts mice, which cobras prey on, he added.\nIn the event of a cobra bite, victims are advised to immediately seek treatment at the nearest hospital.\nThe Indonesian Institute of Sciences said that victims should not apply a tourniquet to the wounded area as this may impair blood flow.\nThey should also elevate the wound to above heart or chest height and abstain from medication like aspirin or traditional remedies.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     weather ', '     environment ']}"

      If you don’t try to fix it you’ll never know: A 79-year-old retiree who's the neighbourhood handyman 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Her hands were shaking slightly as Ms Tang Sai Tham used\xa0a screwdriver to open the safety grill of a table fan. She pulls out the fan blades to show us the motor inside.\xa0\n""Many people think fans are broken because the blades are moving slowly so there\'s no wind. But usually the moving parts inside are just rusty or dirty, so the blades move slowly.\n""I think this might be rusty.\xa0You just have to take the fan apart and clean the insides, and it should work,"" she added as she fitted the blades back on, and checked if they were running smoothly.\xa0\nHand tremors and old age (she\'s 79)\xa0have not stopped Ms Tang from pursuing her interest in repair work. When she is not spending time at the nearby community centre or bowling with her friends, she often\xa0finds appliances to take home and repair, either from people who no longer want them, or at the void deck of HDB blocks.\xa0\nMany Singaporeans throw away appliances, especially fans and radios, that are still in working condition, Ms Tang observed.\xa0\n“When I see things being thrown away, I think about why it is broken. Just like when you’re sick, you have to go to the doctor and figure out why you’re sick, and ask the doctor if he can help you get well,” she told CNA in Mandarin.\xa0\nDespite not having any formal technical education or training, Ms Tang has done this for about 40 years, learning how to fix furniture like cupboards and tables, and appliances like rice cookers, radios and more.\xa0\nAN ANALOGUE LOVER\nEntering Ms Tang’s home in Ang Mo Kio\xa0is like traveling back in time to the analogue\xa0age, with appliances and furniture from yesteryears lining the corridors and walls. Visitors are greeted with well-maintained, vintage furniture and drawers and cupboards full of vinyl records, video tapes and cassettes.\xa0\nOne of the oldest objects in her home is a Philips vinyl record player that she bought when she was in\xa0her 20s, about 50 years ago. She saved up\xa0almost a year for it. Unfortunately, it no longer works\xa0because the needle is broken and Ms Tang has yet to find the right spare part.\xa0\n“If I had the needle, this thing would still work.” she said, adding that she is still searching for the right needle, and will not hesitate to pay for it if she finds it. “Money is not an issue.”\xa0\nAnother one of her prized possessions is a karaoke set that she built herself by combining a boxy cathode ray television, several DVD players, two amplifiers and two microphones.\xa0\nShowing off her extensive collection of karaoke DVDs, Ms Tang explained that many of the components of the karaoke set were given to her by neighbours or friends who had replaced their speakers and DVD players.\xa0\n“The TV was so heavy, I had to ask a few people to help me carry it home before I could fix it. It works now, but only for playing from the CD players, it has no signal and you can’t watch TV on it,” she explained.\xa0\nBUY AND THROW AWAY\nMs Tang strongly believes that more people should try to repair their appliances or furniture before throwing them away, as this is less wasteful and better for the environment.\xa0\n“If you try to fix it, then you will know whether you can save the item. If you don’t try to fix it you’ll never know,” she added.\nTo learn how to repair the items she finds, she usually goes to second-hand shops or other neighbourhood repair shops to ask for advice.\xa0\n“I will go to the shop after finding out where the item is from. I won’t bring the item there. If I bring it there they won’t teach me.\xa0\n“I’ll tell them the situation, and they would tell me: ‘Maybe you can try changing this wire to that side and see what happens.’”\xa0\nMs Tang said that after some trial and error, she usually figures out what\xa0the problem is\xa0 and how to fix it.\xa0\nMs Tang\'s ability to repair items\xa0is known to her neighbours in Ang Mo Kio, where she has lived for more than 30 years. They often ask her for help to fix household appliances and furniture. They also give her their old appliances when they buy new ones, because they know she enjoys tinkering with them.\xa0\n“There was once a lady who asked me to help her fix her washing machine. I said I don’t know how to fix it and I can’t fix it. It’s so big, it’s not like a small radio you can carry around,” Ms Tang shared.\xa0\nAfter fixing the appliances, Ms Tang either uses them at home, or gives them away to neighbours who need them. Most of the time, people ask her if she has fans or radios to spare.\xa0\nNEIGHBOURLY BONDS\nShe has also become close friends with her neighbours who look out for her. Ms Tang shared that last year, her gall bladder ruptured when she was at home. She was in a lot of pain, and could not move, said Ms Tang.\xa0\nHer immediate neighbour noticed that he had not seen her the whole day, and went to check on her. When he looked into her unit, he saw her sitting on a chair, in obvious pain.\nHe insisted on calling an ambulance to take her to the hospital. She ended up being hospitalised for a few days.\xa0\n“At first I didn’t want to go to the hospital because I thought the pain would pass. When I got there, the doctor told me it was lucky that my neighbour found me. It could’ve been serious,” added Ms Tang.\xa0\n“She doesn’t take payment for helping us with repairs and that kind of stuff, so when I have extra food I will share it with her,” said her neighbour Mdm Toh Eng Hng, whose son called the ambulance.\nAcknowledging that her friends and neighbours often worry because she is independent and prefers to solve problems by herself, Ms Tang explained that she does not want to call a repairman for help unless she needs it.\xa0\nFor example, when the door of one of her cupboards fell off, she climbed on two chairs to screw it back in because she is not tall enough to reach the top shelf.\xa0\nMs Tang explained: “I didn’t think I had to call a repairman over a small thing. You should only ask for help if you can’t do it yourself.”\nKnowing that she loves to repair things, a friend introduced Mr\xa0Tang to Repair Kopitiam earlier this year, an initiative\xa0that aims to reduce the impact of Singapore\'s throw away culture.\nAs the oldest certified “coach” of Repair Kopitiam, Ms Tang enjoys attending the monthly community repair sessions.\xa0\n“There are more things to see there, it’s not just fixing things. There are so many types of appliances that I usually can’t get.”\xa0\nEven though Ms Tang has tried taking apart computers, she does not know how to fix them and is still learning about the different components in a computer. She has a laptop and a desktop computer at home that she uses to play games and archive photos from her phone, as well as a CPU waiting to be taken apart and explored.\xa0\nWhen asked about her collection at home, and why she has multiples of the same item, Ms Tang explained that she does not like throwing away things that are not broken. “I have so many things at home, I keep them because no one wants them.”\n“I like collecting old things, so I never throw things away,” she said.\xa0\n“You can’t find these anywhere now.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Community ']}"

      Antarctica, 'heart of the Earth' needs protection: Expert
  </h1>, 'text': ""PUNTA ARENAS, Chile: It may be remote and uninhabited but Antarctica is suffering from man's activities, says the director of the Chilean Antarctic Institute, Marcelo Leppe, in an interview with AFP.\nWHY IS ANTARCTICA IMPORTANT?\nOriginally in school we were taught that there were only five continents around the world. Antarctica is the sixth continent, but it's a continent that you can define as the heart of Earth.\nThe world's main marine current is the circumpolar Antarctic current that moves from west to east around Antarctica. It appeared 13 million years ago and it has frozen a continent that was green in the past. This current has connections with the thermohaline (ocean) currents around the world.\nIt's like a heart because every year it changes its shape from 14 million sq km to more than 20 million. It expands in winter with the sea ice and retreats in summer ... You can see it beating, really beating.\nAnd the subantarctic current is moving around the world like a circulatory system. It's probably playing a major role in the control of climate change.\nSo it (the current) is very important to understand and to predict, but it's also very important to preserve.\nWHAT IS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON ANTARCTICA?\nThe main impact in Antarctica is probably the cryosphere. Every year you can observe and record the melting of glaciers, the disappearance of sea ice ... and, in areas that are left without ice, the recolonisation of plants and other organisms that were not present in Antarctica before.\nWe have recorded that in the last 50 years, probably 15 per cent of all the ice has disappeared. And in the coming years this curve will accelerate, more than originally expected in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) predictions.\nIn 2100, probably an important share, more than 35 per cent of the ice will have disappeared. The landscape of the Antarctic peninsula will be different and the dynamics of the sea currents will also definitely be different.\nARE THERE ANY OTHER THREATS? WHY SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED?\nAntarctica is not as isolated as we think. Microplastics are starting to be a big, big issue in Antarctica. They are everywhere and ... we have detected them in all environments. We have detected them in the eggs of penguins, for example.\nSo what we produce in the rest of the world is reaching Antarctica and this nature that looks very untouched is actually impacted by humanLeppe beings through microplastics.\nWhen you have a continent that is regulating the weather, the climate around the world, with these teleconnections (related to each other at great distances), of course you have to pay attention.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      PUB to deploy new portable flood protection devices for northeast monsoon season
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: National water agency\xa0PUB\xa0is testing two new flood protection devices “which can be easily deployed” if flooding occurs during the northeast monsoon season, it announced on Friday (Nov 22).\nThe first two months of the monsoon season, which sets over Singapore from the second half of November, typically brings frequent and heavy thundery showers, and flash floods may occur “if the intense rainfall temporarily overwhelms the drainage system”, said PUB.\xa0\xa0DAM EASY FLOOD PANEL\nOne device is called Dam Easy Flood Panel\xa0(DFP) and is installed across doorways to prevent floodwaters from entering.\xa0\nIt weighs about 20kg and is\xa00.6m high. It is reusable and\xa0can be adjusted to fit doorways between 0.78m and 1.10m wide. Unlike conventional flood panels, installation does not require tools or fixings that can damage doorways, said PUB.\xa0\nPUB said it has purchased 20 DFPs costing S$1,200 each, which it will loan out\xa0to homes and businesses in flood-prone and low-lying areas in eastern and central Singapore for one year.\xa0These areas include Lorong Melayu, Lorong Marzuki, Mimosa Walk, Tampines Road, Everitt Road, Lorong 104 Changi and Syed Alwi Road, said Mr Yeo Keng Soon, director of catchment and waterways at PUB, in response to CNA queries.\xa0“These are localised areas where conventional measures to alleviate floods like raising roads and platform levels are not feasible due to low-lying existing developments,” said PUB in a media release.\xa0\xa0Explaining, Mr Yeo said some of the homes and shophouses in low-lying areas were built decades ago, and do not meet the current minimum platform levels for flood protection.\n“Only when the area undergoes redevelopment can the ground level be raised,” he said.\nPUB said it will purchase an additional 50 DFPs so that more properties in low-lying areas\xa0can be protected.\n“As long as they are residing in a flood-prone area, we will definitely let them try this. But with the weather changing, and as and when more hotspots (arise), and we think they will benefit from this Dam Easy Flood Panel, we will also loan it to them to let them try,” said Mr Thomas Soh, senior principal engineer (drainage operations) of PUB’s catchment and waterways department.\n“When we loan this out, we also work with the residents to try and train them how to use this, it’s quite straightforward and easy, they should be able to master it in about less than an hour,” he said.\xa0\xa0\xa0Mr Lim K S, who lives in a landed property along Tampines Road, received his DFP on Friday. He said given its weight, the DFP could be difficult for the elderly to install on their own.\xa0\n""I hope that as technology improves, we can have a lighter one that we can use.\xa0But it’s better than nothing. Without it the water will just come in,” he said.\xa0\nThe 47-year-old, who lives with his 83-year-old father, recalled the last time his house was flooded in 2014 after a heavy rainfall. The water reached above his ankles and Mr Lim\xa0spent six hours clearing the water and debris.\xa0\nPORTABLE FLOOD BARRIER\nTo tackle flash floods, PUB’s quick response teams will also be equipped with portable flood barriers (PFBs). They are designed for use on firm surfaces like roads and pavements. These barriers help divert or confine floodwaters so that traffic remains passable, said PUB.\nIt would take a two or three-man team about five to 10 minutes to set up the PFB, said Mr Soh.\xa0\nWhen installed, the PFBs create a 0.5m high dam, about 6m in length.\xa0\xa0Mr Soh noted that the highest floodwater levels Singapore has experienced are between 0.3m and 0.4m high, which is lower than the maximum height of the barriers and panels.\xa0\xa0PUB stressed the importance of being aware of and prepared for the possibility of a flood. The agency will be releasing alerts on impending heavy rain or flash floods on its Facebook and Twitter, and invited the public to stay updated on the weather and flash floods in the coming months.\xa0\nTo manage storm water and reduce flood risk, and cope with more intense and frequent storms due to the effects of climate change, PUB takes “a holistic approach”, said Mr Yeo.\xa0\n“These include upgrading drains and canals, installing detention tanks and flood barriers at buildings, and raising entrance levels to underground facilities, to contain and slow down the flow of storm water,” he added.\xa0\nNoting that the DFPs are “relatively still quite affordable” considering that they can be reused over a long time, Mr Soh said PUB hopes that this will make landed property owners more aware of the solutions available on the market.\xa0\n“What we want to do here is to try to build up Singaporeans’ individual response and to get them to see that actually everyone can play a part when it comes to flood response.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     PUB ']}"

      Aquaponics farming: How two hotels are looking to boost their sustainable practices
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE:\xa0You're sitting down in a restaurant with some friends, looking at the menu of\xa0finely curated steaks, fish dishes and salads.\nThe ingredients for these dishes would likely come\xa0from countries like New Zealand, Indonesia and Malaysia. This is given that Singapore imports most of its food.\nBut for guests at the Fairmont Singapore and Swissotel The Stamford, some of the ingredients could come from a place much closer -\xa0the hotels' rooftop, where an aquaponics farm was recently installed.\nAquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, where fish and plants are grown together in a closed system.\n“Quite simply, you feed the fish, the fish eat the food, pass the food, and then all the nitrates from that go through the different towers and the different beds within the garden.\n“The vegetables absorb the nitrates\xa0from the water, and grow, in a circular system,” said chef Robert Stirrup, who is also the director of culinary operations at the hotels. He oversees the farm’s daily operations.\n\nThe hotels said the farm will be able to produce about 1,200 kg of vegetables and\xa0350 kg of fish monthly for the hotels' kitchens\xa0once it's fully operational.\nThe farm is the brainchild of the hotels' general manager Marcus Hanna.\n“I was at a friend’s place for dinner, and he had this hydroponics tower in this living room, where he was growing numerous types of lettuce. I was quite intrigued by that, because as you know, 90 per cent of the produce in Singapore is imported, so to have something in the living room – you’re not going to find anything fresher to eat,” he said.\nHe wanted to replicate this freshness for\xa0the hotels' guests, and\xa0raised the idea with Mr Stirrup and Mr Ahmed Disokey, the area director of technology and business innovation at Accor Luxury Hotels.\xa0The Accor Group operates both hotels.\nThey bought into the idea quickly as it will also boost the hotels' sustainability efforts and four months later, they had turned it into an operational aquaponics set-up.\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME\nNestled between the hotels' two buildings,\xa0the 450 sq m rooftop farm is deceptively small.\nYet, that's enough space for thousands of leafy vegetables - from kangkong (water spinach) to several kinds of lettuce - to grow on two rows of densely packed white towers and six rows of green plastic half-cylinders, also known as module infinity tanks (MITs).\nFive fish tanks in the back,\xa0each containing about 400 little red tilapias, complete the system.\nIn 10 months' time, the farm will produce 30 per cent and 10 per cent of the hotel’s daily\xa0requirement for greens and\xa0fish respectively, estimated Mr Hanna.\nTwo gardeners perform the day-to-day maintenance.\n“It’s very difficult to sustain something up here under this kind of conditions.\n“We don’t have enough light, we don’t have enough sunshine, we don’t have water, we have extremely strong winds coming through. So this is not a very ideal location,” said Mr James Lam who was hired about five years ago to tend to a\xa0tiny herb garden which used to occupy the space.\xa0\nThere is also the issue of\xa0regulating the temperature and moisture in the farm, said Mr Stirrup.\n“We had to work out a way of dropping the temperature so we put the tentage and the coverage over the aquaponics itself and it helps us to bring the temperature down by about six degrees which makes it more of an ultimate temperature to grow a lot of those vegetables,” he said.\nHOW THE PRODUCE ARE GROWN\nThe farm is outfitted with features that provides an optimum environment for the plants to grow rapidly – a shelter protects the plants from direct sunlight and cools the area to between 24 and 25 degrees Celsius\xa0during the day.\xa0\nLED lights hung above the plants are switched on from 6pm to 8pm to boost their\xa0growth.\nThey help shave off 50\xa0to 60 per cent of the time needed to grow the vegetables,\xa0said Mr Disokey.\nFast-growing vegetables and fish are grown in different batches for a constant supply of produce. A collection of herbs completes\xa0the farm.\n“We have one of the largest collection of mints,” said\xa0Mr Lam, counting them off on his fingers. Some choice mints include: chocolate, pineapple, ginger, orange, lime, grapefruit and apple, which are specially curated for use in the hotels' bars.\nThe gardeners work\xa0closely with the chefs in the kitchen so that what is grown is tailored to\xa0their\xa0needs.\nDescribing how vegetables are grown on\xa0the aquaponics system,\xa0Mr Lam said the seeds have to be individually\xa0placed into a floating block by hand. Sometimes\xa0he and fellow gardener, Ms Jenny Kang, will put two seeds\xa0into the same cross-shaped opening\xa0as an assurance that at least one of them will grow. Each block contains between 60 and 96 such openings, depending on its size.\nThese blocks will go into the nursery for one to two weeks, until the seeds germinate. They would then be transferred into individual pots and are left to grow either in the green MITs or towers.\xa0The vegetables would take three to four weeks to be fully grown.\xa0\nThe hotels are looking to incorporate them in special menus in several of their restaurants.\n“The idea will be that we will do dishes on the menus where we will use initially… the vegetables, and then long-term, the idea is obviously we will incorporate the fish into the dish, so we will have a completely sustainable dish from the garden,” said Mr Stirrup.\nWhile the farm can only produce 30 per cent of all vegetables needed, Mr Stirrup is optimistic that in time it will be able to produce enough of some varieties to fully meet their requirements.\nThe hotels are also hoping to experiment with growing fruits including a variety\xa0of strawberries which have grown well in Thailand.\n“Just working through the whole process, to actually see what vegetables work well and grow in the best way, that we would shorten it down to the products that we would select long-term,” said Mr Stirrup.\nTo see the farm grow from an idea to a reality is “very exciting”, he added.\n“I’ve only seen this done on a very small scale within a hotel before. Not as aquaponics, but as hydroponics.\n“So for us to actually build on the scale that it is, to see it actually being very close to where we can actually go to pick and use it, and to actually just taste some of the product and how fresh it is, in comparison to some of those products that we’ve been buying… it’s very different.”\n'30 BY 30' VISION\nThe aquaponics farm is the hotels' way of helping Singapore attain its\xa0'30 by 30' vision, said Mr Hanna.\nAnnounced in March this year, this is a target set by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) for the country to\xa0produce 30 per cent of its own nutritional needs by 2030.\nAquaponics is only one prong of the\xa0hotels' sustainability drive.\nThere are several initiatives, among which are:\xa0the Eco-Wizz digester, which turns leftover food into water and compost; the Treatsure App, which sells the buffet food at reduced prices just before closing; and a partnership with local charity ‘Food from the Heart’ which collects leftover food from the hotel to support families in need.\nAs a champion of several sustainability initiatives, Mr Stirrup is extremely conscious of the impact of the efforts in\xa0promoting sustainability.\n“Honestly, we have a huge impact, being such a big property, on the volumes and quantities that we use. So even making a small change… obviously has a huge impact\xa0on how much we’re actually producing in terms of waste and what can be recyclable instead,” he said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     environment ']}"

      ‘Not enough for coffee’: Karung guni men, cardboard collectors hit hard as scrap prices and volume fall
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In the sweltering heat, karung guni (rag and bone) man Goh Joi Kim hauled a variety of junk off his lorry and into a metal cage. There were old standing fans, newspapers and the usual cardboard boxes.\nThe 71-year-old collects these items from housing estates in Hougang and Sengkang. And every two days, he goes to an industrial estate\xa0in Ang Mo Kio to sell them. It is backbreaking work that comes with little reward.\nFor instance, 1kg of newspapers gets him S$0.14, while the same amount of cardboard is worth a paltry S$0.05. “It’s very difficult now,” he told CNA, sweat dripping off his face. “Five cents is not enough to even buy a cup of coffee.”\nInformal recyclers, who already contend with rising fuel prices, said newspapers and cardboard used to be worth at least S$0.20 and S$0.10 per kg, respectively.\nThe sector has been hit hard by falling prices of scrap material in Singapore after China banned imports of “foreign garbage” like unsorted scrap paper and plastic waste since January 2018.\nThe ban has led to an excess stockpile\xa0of scrap material like cardboard and newspapers, industry players told CNA, adding that the US-China trade war has also made matters worse.\nThe volume of scrap material collected has gone down as well, karung guni men said, citing lifestyle changes like increasing consumption of news online and a greater awareness of official recycling efforts.\nPLUMMETING PRICES\nUpstream, traders that buy scrap material from informal recyclers before selling them on to larger players are likewise finding things more difficult.\nTay Paper Recycling, which runs a collection point at the Ang Mo Kio industrial estate\xa0and exports the scrap to paper mills overseas, has had to slash the buying price of used cardboard by about 60 per cent to S$0.04 per kg, in tandem with falling export prices.\n“Our export price for carton boxes is about 11 to 12 cents, fluctuating more on the lower side,” its business development manager Andrew Tay told CNA. “So as any business, how much can you buy your raw material?\nMr Tay said the company was only making a S$0.01 profit on the used cardboard per kg, adding that he still needs to factor in transport and labour costs. “So, it’s really tough for us,” he said.\n\n\nHe attributed the falling prices to China’s ban, pointing out that the recyclables “still have to go somewhere”.\n""Everybody has so much inventory and they want to sell it off. Buyers can pick and choose the cheapest and best,""\xa0he explained.\xa0\n""That has caused an oversupply situation (which means) prices will go down.""\n\n\nMr Tay said China – one of the world’s major producers of finished products like plastic bottles and paper – is producing less as a result of the trade war with the US. This means there is less\xa0demand for scrap material as well.\n“Because of the export restrictions, the need to buy scrap material reduces,” he said. “So, that causes prices to go down.”\nMr Tay called the situation a “double whammy” adding: “I assume all my competitors are in the same situation.”\nNearby, Huat Seng Cleaning Company – a trader which sells on the scrap to larger recyclers – said the selling price for used cardboard has gone down from S$0.20 a year ago to S$0.09 now. The price of old newspapers has also fallen from S$0.20 to S$0.15.\n“I have to decrease my price, or else I cannot sustain the business,” its sales development manager L K Tan told CNA, adding that profits have gone down 80 per cent over the past year.\xa0\nThe firm now buys cardboard and newspapers at S$0.05 and S$0.14 per kg, respectively.\nDECREASING VOLUME AND NEWSPRINT\nMs Tan similarly attributed the falling prices to China’s ban, adding that the slowdown in Singapore’s trade environment means the volume of scrap material collected has also gone down.\nAccording to the latest official data, total trade decreased\xa0in September on a year-on-year basis, while both imports and exports declined in the same month.\n“The market volume has gone down,” Ms Tan said, noting that business is not good. “Import and export is down, so (companies) are buying less and throwing less.”\nMs Tan said another reason for the decreasing volume of scrap is the decreasing circulation of newspapers as news consumers shift online.\nAccording to publisher Singapore Press Holdings, the daily average print circulation of the Straits Times\xa0went down from 263,200 in August 2017 to 232,500 in August 2018. In contrast, its digital circulation went up from 120,400 to 138,200 in the same period.\n“People use the computer to see the news,” Ms Tan said. “They never buy the newspaper, so the volume becomes less.”\nOne karung guni man who only gave his name as Mr Tan said he used to be able to collect up to 800kg of newspapers from HDB blocks in a day. Now he only manages about 100kg.\n“Now where got newspaper? All online,” he said as he hurried into his lorry before driving off.\nSHIFTING TO\xa0FORMAL RECYCLING\nOther karung guni men said the volume collected has gone down as companies and individuals seem to be embracing formal recycling.\nMr Peter Shia, who collects newspapers and magazines from businesses, said he could collect 100kg of the material previously but only manages\xa010kg a day now.\n“They are wrapping it up as a parcel then sending it to other countries,” the 64-year-old said. “They recycle it themselves.”\n\n\nThis comes as Singapore moves\xa0to make recycling easier for the masses, with recycling bins and collection services provided at HDB estates, private landed properties and private apartments.\nFrom April 2018, new public housing developments and non-landed private residential developments have also been equipped with individual household chutes for recyclables, while reverse vending machines have increasingly sprung up islandwide.\nMr Goh said he is collecting less scrap now too. “Last time, people throw away more,” he lamented. “Now, people put it in the recycling bin.”\nSTIFFER COMPETITION\nThe challenges do not\xa0stop there.\nCardboard collectors are facing stiffer competition from others like foreign workers who similarly collect scrap material from stores and dumpsters before selling them to traders and recyclers, said Mr Nafiz Kamarudin, founder of Happy People Helping People.\nThe volunteer-run group supports those in need, including cardboard collectors, with meal vouchers at different eateries and outings to places like Gardens by the Bay.\n“Although the shops keep the cardboard boxes at the back, it’s first-come, first-served,” Mr Nafiz told CNA. “So, a lot of these old folks will lose out if the younger ones get it first.”\nMr Nafiz said the elderly cardboard collectors he has\xa0met include\xa0an 89-year-old woman who pushes her cart from her Whampoa neighbourhood to a\xa0selling point in Toa Payoh, a 45-minute journey, every day.\nSome have conditions like Alzheimer\'s, he said, while others travel along busy roads and jaywalk with their goods.\n""You ask them: \'Aunty, why are you doing this? Isn’t it dangerous?\' A lot of them will tell you: \'I\xa0live so long already, I die also no problem,\'"" he added.\nMr Nafiz said they still do it because\xa0“even a few cents make\xa0a lot of difference”, although they rue the measly\xa0price\xa0of used cardboard now.\n""They said it\'s very low,"" he said. ""Obviously, 4 cents per kg is ridiculously low for anyone.""\n\n\nBut he acknowledged that traders and recyclers had to consider market conditions when deciding their rates.\n""We cannot force (them)\xa0to increase the price,"" he stated.\xa0""I don’t think it’s right because they are doing business.\n""If they are not earning enough, we cannot do anything about it.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     economy ', '     trade ', '     environment ', '     Community ']}"

      China is hungry for food. The Amazon is left counting the cost
  </h1>, 'text': ""MATO GROSSO, Brazil: It is the world’s largest rainforest, containing 10 per cent of the world’s known biodiversity. And it is paying the price for helping to feed a country 17,000 kilometres away.\nBetween 2015 and last year, 29,000 square km of Brazil’s part of the Amazon were deforested. That is 40 times the size of Singapore. Up to 80 per cent of this land clearance has been driven by cattle ranching.\nAnd the largest buyer of all that meat is China. Brazil’s beef exports to the Chinese market have more than doubled since 2015, to 722,000 tonnes last year.\nChina’s food consumption is not only growing, but also changing as the ranks of its middle class swell to nearly 30 per cent of its 1.4 billion-strong population.\n“More and more people are eating beef,” says Liu Juan, a beef wholesaler at Beijing’s Xinfadi Market, which has some 8,000 stalls. “If we’d relied only on domestic production, we wouldn’t have met the demand.”\nIndeed, Chinese beef imports have jumped by about 50 times since 2011, reaching a million tonnes last year.\nBut this newfound love of beef as well as the country’s demand for soya are making an impact on the environment and on local tribes halfway round the world, the series China’s Growing Appetite discovers.\nTo put food on China’s tables, landscapes are about to be changed.\nWORLD’S LARGEST CATTLE HERD\nChina consumes 28 per cent of the world’s meat. And it has turned to Brazil, home to the world’s largest cattle herd, to feed its appetite for beef.\nThe Brazilian state of Mato Grosso alone has about 30 million cattle, which is 10 times its human population and more than the 26 million cattle in all of Australia.\n“Brazil is the only country today that has the volume to feed China,” says cattle farm owner Arlindo Jose Vilela.\n“If we (in Brazil) have enough slaughterhouses approved (by China), we could send up to 25 per cent of the production to China.”\nLast year, Brazil shipped 1.64 million tonnes of beef, 44 per cent of which went to China. It is the highest export volume in history by a beef nation. And it is a bonanza time for the farmers.\nThe price of forequarter cuts going to China has already increased from US$4.50 (S$6.10) per kilogramme in 2017 to US$6 this year.\nVilela believes that within 10 years, however, “we’ll be dealing with volumes that are three to four times more”. He predicts: “Brazilian beef is going to be very common in China.”\nThe reason is the swathes of unexploited land north of Mato Grosso, which will allow more cattle to be raised for export.\nBut there is the rub, because Amazonian forests are being cleared for farms at a worsening rate. In the first nine months of this year, deforestation was up by 93 per cent from last year.\nProtections for the forest and indigenous lands have been loosened especially since Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. Under his reign, deforestation is at a 10-year peak.\n“The previous governments cared about environmental regulations,” says agronomist and adjunct professor Isaias da Silva Pereira from the Agroecology Centre in the Federal Institute of Para, Campus Itaituba.\n“Nowadays with all the changes, this new government seems to be treating this as a secondary issue, especially the dismantling of the federal environmental protection agencies.”\nOne of the cattle farms with pastures converted from forested land belongs to Valmir Climaco de Aguiar, the mayor of Itaituba town in Para state. And he is proud of his expanding farm, never mind that trees were cut down.\n“We can’t produce inside the forest,” he says matter-of-factly.\nWe have more than 200 million people. We have to eat, produce, sell, export and make money.\nChina, he points out, is not going to pay him “to preserve the forest”. “When a country has high spending power and a lot of people to feed, then it’s the best country (to sell to),” he adds.\nDespite the rising prices, Brazil’s abundant land makes its beef economical to import, compared with China raising more of its own cattle.\nChina has 6 to 8 per cent of the world's grassland area, but that is being encroached on by urban expansion. And its domestic meat is already more expensive because of the land cost.\n“In other countries, the farm owners are the ones rearing cattle. They own the land. In China, the cattle-rearing businesses have to lease the land, which is an additional cost,” explains Cheng Guangyan, an authority on China’s food consumption trends.\nCattle rearing in China also involves mostly small-scale farms. “Big cattle farms need to hire workers, so there’s a labour cost,” says Cheng, a director in the Institute of Food and Nutrition Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.\n“(They also) would contract with small family farms to bring up their calves. It’s cheaper that way because the cost of leasing land is high.”\nGRAIN EXPECTATIONS\nChina still has a massive livestock industry, which is why the country is buying not only Brazilian beef, but also soya beans, a vital grain in animal feed.\nTariffs on American soya beans have made Chinese buyers look elsewhere, so 75 per cent of their soya bean imports last year came from Brazil as its shipments to China jumped by almost a third.\nPretty much all of the US$5 million worth of soya beans produced yearly on the Santa Guarita farm, for example, goes to China. But it is an “expensive journey”, says second-generation farm owner Joel Strobel.\nWe’re in the middle of the continent. So the cost of exporting soya beans, for us, is high because a big part of it is road freight.\nAccording to a local soya bean lobby, transport accounts for 30 per cent of the production costs in Brazil, which is three times more than in the United States. And the logistical challenge is increasing as exports grow.\nFrom the centre of Brazil’s agribusiness, Mato Grosso, the farmers’ only route to the country’s northern port cities is the BR-163 highway cutting across the Amazon. That 1,700-km drive takes two and a half days off-season.\nCome harvest time, however, trucks can be backed up for miles. A stretch of the road is also not paved, which makes it dangerous during the rainy season and adds to the journey time.\nTo ease the bottleneck, infrastructure projects have been proposed, one of which is to build more than 40 dams to turn the Tapajos River and its tributaries in the Amazon into an industrial waterway fit for large ships.\nItaituba, with a population of about 100,000 and where highway meets river, is already seeing signs of change such as river port construction projects.\nIts strategic location in the soya bean trade between Brazil and China — and their ambitions to open up a new food frontier, with the backing of Chinese engineering — have got its mayor excited.\nAnd he is not worried about borrowing from the Chinese. “China’s going to rule the world,” Climaco declares. “If it wasn’t for China, there wouldn’t be so much production of soya beans.”\nBut the indigenous people who live in the forest are not pleased at such plans. Already, the Munduruku tribe is feeling the effects of the town’s recent transformation; for example, there is no longer enough fish to make fishing viable.\n“Our god gave us this river,” says Brasilino, a village chief. “It’s our responsibility to take care of it. But now we’re not able to do that … because they’re depleting the land and bringing more diseases through the dirty water.”\nThe type of economic development that would come with damming the river is not what he wants for his people.\n“It’s good for the government. But the salary of the working man doesn’t increase. (Even if it does,) it’s very little,” he says. “We have a healthier life. We can walk around the trees and breathe clean air.”\nHe has this to say to China: “Stop farming soya beans in the Amazon.”\nEnvironmental activist Brent Millikan makes the point that the Amazon “isn’t like any other place”.\n“Where investments are happening, it’s important for Chinese investors to understand what the local context is — environmentally (and) culturally,” says the Amazon programme director at non-governmental organisation International Rivers.\n“The big question is what sort of policies China will adopt to make sure that its investments are living up to its standards in terms of social and environmental safeguards.”\nSome dams in the Tapajos basin are already being constructed and operated, and have had a socio-environmental impact, he adds.\n“If you have a government now that’s encouraging land invasions, land violence (and) deforestation, things are going to be detrimental to Brazilians … to the Chinese (and) to the whole planet.”\nWatch this first episode of China's Growing Appetite tonight, Nov 16,\xa0at 9pm.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     food ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

The seven stores involved in the earlier trial are also part of the year-long trial.\xa0\n“This is a very significant move. I think it is,” he added, speaking to reporters\xa0at the FairPrice Finest in Paya Lebar Quarter, about the decision to increase the number of participating outlets from seven to 25.\nWhen asked about whether NTUC FairPrice would consider extending the plastic bag charge to more, or all stores islandwide, he said: “Changing behaviour takes time, we recognise that too. We are pushing the agenda, pushing the envelope, we are stepping up the pace.\xa0\n“That’s why there are more stores now, and these are not small stores, these are stores\xa0which are located in the heartlands, big stores.”\xa0\nThe one month trial in September concluded with most customers supportive of the plastic bag charge, said Mr Seah.\xa0\nAccording to NTUC FairPrice, 71.1 per cent of the 1,745 customers surveyed expressed support for a plastic bag charge at supermarkets in the consumer sentiment study conducted at the seven outlets during the month-long trial.\xa0\nMr Seah\xa0also acknowledged that while there are customers who believe the charge should be much higher and per bag instead of per transaction, there is also “a much smaller group who needs more convincing”.\xa0\nDescribing the two groups as “two extreme ends” he added: “I don’t think we should go either extreme. I think what we have done is a calibrated approach, and I think so far from the pilot results, it seems to have struck a chord. There is a fair balance between the two extreme ends.”\xa0\nWhile charging on a per bag basis would cost the individual more, charging consumers on a per transaction basis would be “administratively easy for all”, said Mr Seah.\xa0\nWith the year-long extension, there are also reusable bag donation stations in 12 participating FairPrice outlets, where shoppers can donate clean reusable bags they do not use, or take them free-of-charge if they forget to bring one along.\xa0\n“One year from now I hope we don’t have to talk about why we have to encourage more people (to reduce their use of plastic bags),” said Mr Seah, adding that he hopes to see more than half of corporates and retailers in Singapore implementing similar measures by next year.\xa0\nStressing that companies are in a position to effect change, Mr Seah said that reducing plastic waste is a “multi-stakeholder journey” that “needs to take place over a sustained period of time”, with individuals and corporates sharing the responsibility.\xa0\xa0He also acknowledged that plastic bag use is “just one part” of sustainable behaviour, and noted that NTUC FairPrice also works internally to reduce plastic packaging waste and food waste.\xa0\n“We cannot ask consumers to be the only ones (reducing plastic waste), I think corporates also need to play a part.

Greenpeace says more than 1.2 million Indians died prematurely in 2017 due to air pollution.\nTOXIC COCKTAIL\nNew Delhi is hit each year by a near perfect storm of pollution that takes hold immediately after the Hindu festival of Diwali in late October, when millions of revellers let off firecrackers.\nOn top of the firework hangover, the city of 20 million people is threatened by the widespread burning of wheat and rice stubble in neighbouring farmlands, along with traffic fumes, factory emissions and smoke from fires used in poor neighbourhoods for heating and cooking.\nPollutants from this toxic cocktail get trapped over Delhi by cooler winter temperatures and the usually slow-moving winds that prevail at this time of year.\nNEW LAWS\nAuthorities have ordered schools to remain shut and banned construction work across the city until at least Tuesday.\nDiesel-spewing trucks that rumble into Delhi each night have been stopped, except those carrying essential commodities.\nA new law came into effect on Sunday restricting cars from the capital\'s roads to alternative days, depending on if their number plate ends in an odd or even number.\nHundreds of police tried to enforce the car rationing order but many owners ignored the restrictions despite the threat of a US$55 fine.\nThe local government has started handing out millions of pollution masks, while calling on people to restrict outdoor activities.\n""LIVES AT STAKE""\nThe Indian capital is one of 14 Indian cities listed in the World Health Organization\'s top 15 most polluted cities globally.\nNew Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal says that ""lives are at stake"" in the mega-city\'s pollution crisis.\nBut residents complain that no-one is taking the emergency seriously, and experts say neither the national nor city government are taking the required long-term action to control the deadly smog.\nWith a state election due in Delhi in early 2020, the crisis has also become a casualty of political bickering, with each side blaming the other.\n""I can\'t even imagine what it must be like to live here under these conditions,"" Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, in town to shoot a movie, said in an Instagram post.\n', 'related_topics': ['     India ', '     health ', '     environment ', '     pollution ']}"

      Carbon emissions from tropical forest loss underestimated, scientists say
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: The amount of planet-warming carbon emitted by the world\'s lost tropical forests has been under-reported as estimates failed to take into account the longer-term effects of tree destruction, researchers said.\nA new international study re-evaluated the carbon impacts of forests that were destroyed or degraded between 2000 and 2013, adding up to 49 million hectares, roughly the size of Spain.\nThe carbon released from losses to those ""intact forests"" will amount to more than six times previous estimates when additional emissions caused by changes to the forest up to 2050 are included, it found.\nIntact forests are large areas of continuous forest with no signs of intensive human activity, like agriculture or logging.\n""Once you\'ve caused the initial round of damage, you have committed to a lot of further emissions in the future once the forest has opened up,"" said study co-author Tom Evans of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\n""It\'s a bit like if you\'re injured at work you have lost earnings for years into the future,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Those carbon lost earnings turn out to be the biggest part of the picture for these intact forests.""\nTrees suck carbon dioxide from the air, and store carbon, the main greenhouse gas heating up the Earth\'s climate. But they release it when they are cut down and are burned or rot.\nEnvironmentalists say protecting existing forests and restoring damaged ones prevents flooding, limits climate change and protects biodiversity.\nThe tropics lost 12 million hectares of tree cover in 2018, the fourth-highest annual loss since records began in 2001, according to forest monitoring service Global Forest Watch.\nOf greatest concern, it said, was the disappearance of 3.6 million hectares of old-growth rainforest, an area the size of Belgium, much due to fires, land-clearing for farms and mining.\nAreas analysed in the new study, published in the journal Science Advances, included intact forests lost in the Amazon and Congo basins and on Southeast Asia\'s islands.\nWhile previous research largely focused on stored carbon losses directly linked to deforestation, the new study also took into account the knock-on and future effects.\nThose include indiscriminate logging around newly opened up forest areas as they become more accessible and a rise in hunting that limits the spread of seeds and hinders forest regeneration.\nOver time, the carbon-storing abilities of the new forest edges created by deforestation also decline as human and grazing activities increase and temperatures change.\n""Once you open up a forest, there are several forms of damage that lead to that dwindling of carbon stocks,"" said Evans, adding that undamaged forests also become more carbon-rich each year.\nThese effects tend to get overlooked in carbon accounting used to work out how and where to target conservation incentives and provide payments for preventing forest loss, he added.\nIn 2013, the world had about 549 million hectares of intact tropical forests left, the study said.\nEnsuring their future should now be a priority, with increased efforts and policies to keep them safe, Evans said.\nThat should include better recognition of indigenous land rights and a halt to the expansion of mining, fossil fuel extraction, agriculture and infrastructure which often drives forest loss, he added.\n""Our results revealed that continued destruction of intact tropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions,"" the study\'s lead author Sean Maxwell, a scientist with Australia\'s University of Queensland, said in a statement.\n""There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes because they play an indispensable role in stabilising the climate.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     climate change ']}"

The closed-loop process also means that all recovered materials will ultimately be reused in the forward manufacturing supply chain.\xa0\xa0\nTES also announced that they are working with partners to develop energy storage systems (ESS) that will use retired electric vehicle batteries to store electricity for various commercial and residential energy needs.\xa0\xa0\n“Looking ahead, the battery space is potentially facing raw material commodity shortages stemming from the exponential proliferation of Internet of Things devices, electric vehicles, and mobility devices,” said CEO of TES Gary Steele, adding that TES has worked in close partnership with the Economic Development Board (EDB) and NEA.\nAs the first facility in Singapore to recover precious metals from batteries using a new hydrometallurgy process, TES B serves domestic needs and enhances the regional value chain for e-waste management, said Mr Damian Chan, assistant managing director of EDB.\xa0\xa0\n“In addition, as electric vehicle adoption and solar deployment scale up in Singapore, TES B and TES’ efforts in second-life ESS will contribute to our battery recycling and energy management ecosystem,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      Trash for gold: Jakarta’s waste bank rewards residents for trading in recyclables
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: How many aluminium cans can get you 1g of gold?\nIn North Jakarta, the trade-in value of 70kg of aluminium cans – around\xa04,500 empty cans – is equivalent to 1g of gold at the Wijaya Kusuma Waste Bank.\nOther recyclables such as cardboard and plastic bottles are also accepted by the programme initiated by the Bermis Gading neighbourhood in January last year.\nThe waste bank was set up with a simple mission – to encourage the locals to recycle and reduce waste. After residents deposit recyclables here, the waste bank would clean and sell them to the North Jakarta government.\nIn April this year, pawnshop PT Pegadaian offered to collaborate with this waste bank – and four other waste banks in Jakarta – by rewarding the residents with gold.\nMdm Roswanthy Suweden, 67, is one of the serious participants of the programme. She has collected enough recyclables to receive more than 10g of gold.\n“I’m happy. I save little by little, and over time I have a lot. The gold is for my children and grandchildren,” she told CNA at the waste bank.\nHead of North Jakarta environment agency Mr Slamet Riyadi applauded the idea of offering gold as an incentive to recycle.\nWomen, who usually manage the households, will find the scheme attractive, he said.\n“Before it worked together with the pawnshop, it had around 34 or 36 customers (residents who took part in the programme). But since the partnership, the number increased to 105,” Mr Riyadi said.\nBesides Jakarta, similar “trash for gold” schemes are also found in other Indonesian cities like Palembang, Bandar Lampung and Makassar.\nThe initiative is lauded by environmentalists as a small step toward instilling green awareness in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest contributor of\xa0plastic pollutants in the oceans\xa0after China.\nTRASH IS GOLD\nThe Wijaya Kusuma Waste Bank, which is managed by a couple of housewives of the neighbourhood, is open on alternate Tuesdays from 9am to noon.\nOnce residents arrive with their bagsful of waste, the items will be weighed and recorded in their saving books as well as the waste bank’s system.\nDepending on the amount and type of trash, the customers will receive cash from the officers on duty.\nOne kilogram of cardboard, for example, is priced at 1,200 rupiah (US$ 0.08), while 1kg of clean plastic bottles is worth 3,000 rupiah.\nAluminum cans are considered the most valuable, with every kilogram priced at 10,000 rupiah.\nIf the residents have their eyes set on the big prize – gold – then they have to surrender the cash to the pawnshop staffer present on site.\nOnce the residents have saved enough for 5g of gold based on the market value, they can visit the pawnshop to take home the gold.\xa0One gram of gold is valued at around 700,000 rupiah currently.\nThe attractive scheme has piqued the interest of the not just housewives, but also men.\nMr Muhammad Supardi, a 70-year-old retiree, said he enjoyed taking part in the programme.\n“I like to support the government’s programme… If the trash is still worthy, why not give it to them?” he said.\nThe programme has also attracted office workers who drop by the waste bank before going to work. \xa0\n“I’m participating in the scheme to reduce waste. Some of the housewives told me I can take part in the saving programme here, rather than throwing away my garbage,” said Mr Indra, who was visiting the waste bank for the first time.\nCREATING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS\nConsidering the amount of recyclables one needs to collect before he will receive the gold, the waste bank does not have much financial value to the residents, said Mr Budi Winarko, one of the founders of the Wijaya Kusuma Waste Bank. \xa0\nNonetheless, what is important for the waste bank is to promote environmental awareness in this neighbourhood of 360 houses.\n“Our short-term goal is to have more customers, but our long-term goal is to have zero waste,” Mr Winarko said.\nPeople amassing more waste so to trade them for gold is acceptable, he said, as long as residents are educated on the importance of reducing, reusing and recycling.\nThe waste bank also sends a vehicle\xa0to collect recyclables every fortnight from those who do not have time to haul the items to its premises.\nFor pawnshop PT Pegadaian, its partnership with waste banks has a marketing benefit.\n“By selling their waste to the waste bank, the residents can have savings in the form of gold with us. They can then browse and shop our products,” PT Pegadaian Jakarta auditor Mr Margono told CNA.\nBermis Gading resident Mdm Sulistiowati exchanged her savings for 5g of gold last Tuesday (Oct 8).\n“I am very happy, especially when this (the gold) comes from something which is otherwise\xa0worthless. The result is extraordinary – gold,” she said.\nCHANGING HABITS\nThese waste banks raise awareness on the importance of waste segregation, which is not common in Indonesia, said Greenpeace Indonesia’s environmentalist Mr Muharram Atha Rasyadi.\nHe opined that success of the waste banks is dependent on the efforts spent to educate the residents, bearing in mind that not all types of waste can be recycled, especially plastic.\nInitiatives like this also need to be supported by other green habits, he added. An example being composting organic waste, which constitutes the majority of household waste.\nHowever small the impact may be, the waste banks are slowly changing people’s habits, one resident at a time.\nMdm Roswanthy Suweden, who has been a regular customer at the Wijaya Kusuma Waste Bank since its inception, said getting rid of her trash at the waste bank means more than just saving up for gold.\n“My house is now clean and tidy. What used to be piled in my storeroom, I have sold\xa0to this waste bank,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     environment ']}"

      ‘Inconvenience stores’ help Thailand turn green amid plastic crisis
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Most retailers strive to make shopping easy for customers. But Papawee Pongthanavaranon is determined to make it less convenient.\xa0\nHer clients must come prepared with empty containers and shopping bags - a practice still largely uncommon in Thailand - and pay for a range of environmentally sourced merchandise at her self-service bulk store Refill Station in the capital.\nA bulk store is an emerging type of eco-conscious retailer. Products are priced according to quantity and sold with zero or low-plastic packaging. Unlike traditional shops, they require customers to bring their own containers or borrow and return them on their next purchase.\xa0\nThe businesses are common in many developed countries which have greater awareness of environmental issues. In Thailand, however, it is a new and unusual concept.\n“We’re an ‘inconvenient store’. While others go with concepts like ‘ready-to-eat’, ‘ready-to-cook’ and ‘ready-to-use’, we have nothing ‘ready’. All the products here make life more inconvenient but our customers are ready to change,” Papawee told CNA.\nThe 30-year-old architecture graduate opened the bulk store two years ago with like-minded people, in one of Bangkok’s busy alleyways. They are passionate environmentalists who hope to spread more green concepts in the city where they live and help build a sustainable low-waste community.\nEach day, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration collects an estimated 10,000 tonnes of waste, including 80 million plastic bags. Its data showed an average Bangkok resident\xa0uses eight plastic bags per day and often throws them away after a single use. The longevity of plastic products, whose original form can last 400 years, results in most of them going to landfills. The process costs authorities\xa0THB700 (US$23) per tonne of plastic waste.\nNationwide, the\xa0plastic use shows no signs of falling. Thailand’s Pollution Control Department reported last year the country uses 45 billion plastic\xa0bags annually, 6.8 billion styrofoam food containers and 9.8 billion single-use plastic cups.\xa0\nAbout 18 billion plastic bags are handed out at fresh markets and stalls, while the rest - 27 billion bags - come from retailers, malls and convenience stores, according to the department’s data.\nThe magnitude of plastic waste in Thailand has made many residents more eco-conscious. In big cities, it is increasingly common to see people carrying cloth shopping bags, reusable water bottles, food containers and stainless straws. But a few years ago, Papawee said, the practice would have been strange for many people she knows.\xa0\nBack then, environmentalists in Thailand wouldn’t dare express themselves. People thought we were weird. They’d ask: ‘Why do you have to carry a water bottle?’. But these days, it’s quite normal to do so and the question now would be: ‘Why don’t you do it?’.\nDROWNING IN PLASTIC\nIn Bangkok, bulk stores have begun to emerge as demands for eco-friendly products and services grow in Thailand.\xa0\nThe country is facing a serious environmental challenge caused by millions of tonnes of plastic. In fact, it is the fifth biggest contributor in the world to ocean waste. A 2015 report by Washington DC-based environmental advocacy group Ocean Conservancy showed more than half of plastic waste in the ocean originated from five rapidly growing economies - China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.\nGrowth in GDP and improved quality of life in these countries has resulted in “exploding demand” for consumer goods, which exceeded their waste-management infrastructure, the report added.\nUnless steps are taken to manage this waste properly, by 2025 the ocean could contain one ton of plastic for every three tons of finfish - an unthinkable outcome.\nEach year, Thailand produces about 1.03 million metric tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste. More than 3 per cent finds its way into the ocean, according to Ocean Conservancy’s report. It also added that more than 80 per cent of ocean plastic comes from land-based sources - a result of uncollected waste and poor waste-management systems.\nIn Thailand, the problem of unmanaged plastic waste has prompted its environment minister to convince 43 major shopping malls and convenience stores to stop handing out plastic bags to customers from Jan 1 next year.\n“After a long time of campaigning against plastic waste, it’s now time to take real action,” Minister of Environment Varawut Silpa-archa said in August.\n“Let’s get used to carrying cloth shopping bags today. Cut down on the convenience a little to let the world and the environment stay with humans for a long time.”\nThe move came shortly after the death of a well-loved baby dugong, Mariam, who died in August after months of intensive care. The autopsy linked the animal’s death to several pieces of plastic blocking its intestinal tract.\n“The inflammation that ensued had caused gas build-up in her digestive system and blood infection,” veterinarian Nantarika Chansue from Chulalongkorn University wrote on her Facebook page last month.\nWhile Thais have grieved for their beloved dugong, many of them were not surprised by the news.\xa0\nIt has become increasingly frequent for people in the country to hear reports about rare and threatened marine species found dead with plastic waste in their stomach.\xa0Last year, a short-finned pilot whale died in the coastal province of Songkhla after throwing up five plastic bags. An autopsy revealed 80 more weighing 8kg in its stomach.\nThe pilot whale and the baby dugong are among an estimated 300 rare marine animals in Thailand that have died from ingesting waste and parts of fishing tools every year. According to the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, 60 per cent of them are dolphins and whales, and the rest are turtles.\nTHAILAND’S PLASTIC ADDICTION\nA zero-waste or low-plastic lifestyle remains limited to a small network of people in Thailand largely because life can be cheap and easy with plastic.\nPichmol Rugrod from Greenpeace Thailand said Thais’ plastic addiction has stemmed from its convenience, availability and low cost. Affordable take-away services such as Grab Food, she added, have also increased plastic consumption in the country with single-use plastic for packaging, cutlery and cups.\n“Just a few months ago, Grab celebrated figures showing its food delivery service had racked up 4 million orders in the first four months of 2019. And you don’t need to be a genius to work out just how much plastic waste would have been left behind,” she told CNA, citing a lack of strong regulations and a sustainable plan for reducing plastic junk.\nThailand is in the grip of a growing plastic waste crisis.\nTo cut down on their plastic addiction, people in Thailand have to pay more for eco-friendly products. They also have to put maximum effort in sorting and recycling waste due to a lack of waste management options in the country.\nAccording to Pichmol, only a quarter of plastic waste - mainly plastic bottles - was recycled last year. “Among the rest was around 1.2 million tonnes of plastic bags, a major contributor to plastic pollution in Thailand,” she added.\nStill, many people believe their country can still overcome the plastic crisis. Its grim situation has not discouraged the likes of Papawee, who has noticed small but gradual change in consumer behaviour over the past two years.\nRefill Station now welcomes more customers than before. The variety of its products has also grown from shower gel, shampoo and dish-washing liquid to bamboo toothbrushes, reusable sanitary pads and plastic-free toothpaste tablets.\n“These provide alternatives for whoever wants to start reducing plastic use; they can start with anything. We’re also in the process of setting up a food refill station,” Papawee said.\n“We have hope and we work based on that,” she added. “We believe little things make great change.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     pollution ', '     environment ']}"

      It all begins with a lit match: Long odds in hunt for forest fire culprits in Indonesia
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAMBI, Indonesia: A man in Muaro Jambi regency wanted to clear his land to plant coffee, and the easiest way\xa0was to light a match and fling it into the vegetation.\nWhen the fire spread quickly, he panicked. Then,\xa0someone called the police.\n“Based on a tip-off, we caught him red-handed and seized the evidence,” Commissioner Adjutant George Pakke, head of Muaro Jambi’s crime and detective unit, told CNA.\nThe man was among the three suspects nabbed last month\xa0by the Muaro Jambi police\xa0for setting their lands on fire, since hotspots emerged in late July.\nDominated by peatland, the regency has the highest number of hotspots in the Jambi province, with an average of 300 to 400 hotspots last month.\nAir quality deteriorated as fires raged, with Muaro Jambi cast in an alarming hue of orange-red on Sep 21 due to scattering of sunlight by micro particles in the air.\nThe Jambi province in central Sumatra is one of the six Indonesian provinces experiencing raging forest and land blazes, which sent thick, choking haze blanketing the skies last month.\nAccording to the national disaster agency, the air pollution in Jambi was worse than the situation in 2015, when a major haze crisis sent harmful smoke across parts of Southeast Asia. \xa0\nProvincial police said they have so far detained 41 smallholders and two company representatives on suspicion of\xa0starting fires.\nSpecial crime director Grand Commissioner Thein Tabero said police were doing their best to catch the perpetrators, but it was not an easy job.\n“The challenge is they (the perpetrators) throw a cigarette and then they run away … They are not dumb. They don’t throw the cigarette and then wait till the fires become large,” he told CNA.\nThe police also faced other challenges such as difficulty in accessing remote places and limited manpower, he added.\xa0\nThe police, eager to pin down the suspects, have appealed to the public to feed them accurate information. But many people affected by the annual haze\xa0have remained sceptical about the real impact of police enforcement actions.\nMeanwhile, green groups and experts continue to point their fingers at palm companies and peatland owners, stressing that the blazes were caused by humans.\nThey are demanding stricter enforcement and stronger penalties to put an end to the problem once and for all. \xa0\nLOCALS LAMENT ALLEGED LACK OF PUNISHMENT\nMost of the burning happened at night to escape watchful eyes.\nJambi police Mr Tabero said he would not risk sending his men into the dark, when visibility is further reduced by the thick smoke.\n“It is dangerous as the forests are home to wild animals, which could emerge anytime.\n“Officers have to take into account the possibilities of dealing with snakes and even the Sumatran tigers, although no such case has happened so far,” he said. \xa0\nWhile swiftness of arrival at the scene\xa0is key to catch the perpetrators, Mr Pakke from the Muaro Jambi police force said the remote locations have also proven\xa0to be a challenge.\n“Sometimes when we arrive at a location after a long drive, the suspects are already gone,” he said.\nMr Pakke said tip-offs from the people are really helpful in catching the culprits.\n""Information such as \'next to my house there\'s fire\', \'fire at the back of my house\' or \'my neighbour is starting a fire\' is useful.\n“It shows that some people already have the awareness to share such information with us. They understand the danger of forest and land fires,"" he said.\nHowever, while some lauded the police effort, locals said more has to be done.\n“They say they have caught the perpetrators, but what happen to them, we don’t know,” elementary teacher Mdm Desniwati said.\nJambi-based taxi driver Mr Amiruddin Noer wondered about the companies which own the burnt land.\n“Apparently it’s not just individuals who set the land on fire. There are a lot of companies too, but they are untouchable by the police,” he claimed.\xa0“I don’t know why the authorities can’t catch them.”\nIf convicted, those who start a fire will be fined 10 billion rupiah (US$706,600) and jailed up to 10 years.\nHowever, Mr Rudiansyah, head of Jambi’s environmental group Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI), said even if authorities have caught the suspects, it is not always easy to sentence them or find the real mastermind.\nThe challenges that hinder the sentencing process range\xa0from inadequate evidence to not having enough eyewitnesses, he added.\nREVOKE PERMITS OF COMPANIES WHOSE LANDS ARE ON FIRE: GREENPEACE\nTo curb forest and land fires, Greenpeace Indonesia suggested that the government introduce severe punishments for the culprits.\nIts global head of forests campaign Mr Kiki Taufik said a recent finding showed that plantations as well as pulp and palm companies, whose lands were burned between 2015 and 2018, were not punished with serious sanctions.\n“This will not deter companies from continuing the bad practice of burning forests and land.\n“Therefore, we encourage the law to be enforced more seriously, such as by revoking the permits of companies whose lands are on fire.”\nMr Taufik also urged authorities to be more transparent in their investigation by announcing the identities of\xa0the culprits promptly.\nHe claimed that the government may not have the courage to disclose the possible involvement of big corporations. \xa0\n“On the ground, the government also needs to have teams to monitor lands that have been sealed, so the owners would not be able to access and work on the lands,” he added.\nNational disaster agency head Mr Doni Monardo, meanwhile, said the problem has to be tackled at its roots – drumming awareness into the public mind by teaching disaster prevention in\xa0schools.\n“Educate them from an early age so that they have a real understanding of the danger of forest and land fires,” he said.\nIndonesians should also plant crops that have high economic value, but are less harmful to the environment, he added.\n""WE CAN SUE COMPANIES FOR NEGLIGENCE"": POLICE\nAcross Indonesia, the number of hotspots have reduced significantly by 90 per cent\xa0following cloud seeding operations, the Environmental Affairs and Forestry Ministry said.\nOn Wednesday, the ministry announced it has sealed more than 60 companies – including 20 foreign-owned firms – which were thought to be responsible for\xa0fires throughout the country.\nWALHI’s Mr Rudiansyah said merely sealing companies is not enough.\n“The legal process against companies responsible for forest and land fires is ineffective.\n“For example, in 2015 a company was caught burning land and was later punished with criminal and civil sanctions, but now in 2019 the company’s land is burning again,” he said.\nJambi police said while they have difficulties catching the real culprits behind the blazes, they can sue companies for negligence as they are obliged to safeguard their concessions.\n“If there is a fire, they have to extinguish it immediately. But companies, or at least the two companies we are currently investigating, have no facilities and manpower to deal with the fire.\n“So they just let the fire happen. And the fire will creep into their land. This may be their tactic too,” Mr Tabero said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Hotel waste: The huge switch to becoming a more sustainable business
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Many travellers checking into their hotels\xa0expect amenities such as shampoos, conditioners, bath gels and body lotion in miniature plastic bottles. Toothbrushes, disposable razors\xa0and slippers are also the norm at many hotels.\nSuch items are usually discarded by the hotels after\xa0the guests check out,\xa0contributing to the mountain of waste\xa0generated by the\xa0hospitality industry each year, said experts.\nFigures from the National Environment Agency (NEA) showed that larger hotels in Singapore - defined as those with more than 200 rooms - have a recycling rate of just 7.7 per cent in 2018.\n""The top performers typically segregated common recyclables such as carton boxes, plastic packaging, and newspapers, and operated food waste digesters,"" the agency said on their website.\nAlthough the recycling rate was an improvement\xa0over 2014,\xa0experts said the single-digit percentage is low, and more could be done.\nTHE DILEMMA OF GOING GREEN\nThis speaks to the dilemma faced by the hospitality industry, said Singapore Institute of Technology Associate Professor\xa0of design and specialised business\xa0Detlev Remy.\n“It’s a huge switch (for hotels) to go green, because it has an impact on customers, on the whole hotel living and hotel standards on what you expect as a customer,” he said.\nHe added customers of luxury hotels expect the full set of amenities and services, and it would be difficult for these hotels to completely do away with them.\nUsing the example of room slippers he said: At ""four-, five-star (hotels), you expect this. Now (if hotels) tell customers, we are going green, we want to act sustainable, we don\'t have any more slippers for you - (customers) wouldn\'t like it"", he said.\nCustomers ""would say fine, but then I go for another hotel"".\nPerhaps three- or four-star hotels would be able to do away with certain amenities in the name of sustainability, as customers would not expect as much, said Prof Remy.\nSo mindsets need to change and some pressure exerted on the industry ""from a customer perspective, from the government, or from the competition"".\nFrom the customer perspective, pressure could be applied by millennials, said Professor Ang Swee Hoon of the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School.\n“This generation of consumers are willing to forego brands that do not align with their personal beliefs,” she said.\nAnd on the government\'s front, experts pointed to the\xa0mandatory waste reporting exercise which NEA introduced in 2014. It\xa0aims\xa0to draw greater management attention to the amount of waste produced by large commercial premises like shopping malls and hotels.\nThe agency\xa0determines how well hotels perform by tracking how much of each major type of waste is recycled compared to the total waste generated.\nHOW SOME HOTELS ARE REDUCING PLASTIC WASTE\nSome international hotel chains are indeed paying closer attention to the waste\xa0they generate and are taking initial steps to address\xa0their impact on the environment.\nIn August, international hotel chain Marriott International announced it would stop providing shampoo, conditioner and body lotion in single-use plastic bottles by December 2020. They will be replaced by pump-topped bottles.\nGlobally, this results in 500 million less plastic bottles thrown away annually, a 30 per cent yearly reduction from current usage, said Marriot International in a press release.\nEarlier in July, the Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) also announced that it would implement bulk-size amenities in all guest rooms, replacing single-use plastic toiletry bottles. This is expected to be completed by 2021.\nCurrently, IHG uses ""an average of 200 million bathroom miniatures""\xa0worldwide every year, said IHG in a press release.\nThe Fullerton Hotels and Resorts’ general manager Cavaliere Giovanni Viterale also said that the hotel is “switching (their) in-room toiletries to eco-friendly versions”, which will be rolled out in October this year.\nThe eco-friendly version would be Eco-pure or non-plastic toiletries, and will include a full suite of vanity kits, dental kits, sewing kits, shower caps, combs, sanitary bags and loofas.\nNOT JUST PLASTIC BOTTLES\nA Hilton Singapore spokesperson noted that the hotel has already replaced all plastic straws with paper straws and provide glass bottled water and recyclable or environmentally-friendly dishware for meeting spaces.\n“At Hilton, we have committed to doubling our social impact and halving our environmental impact through responsible hospitality across our value chain by 2030,” said the spokesperson.\nThe spokesperson added that Hilton Singapore is also currently working with its parent company\xa0on alternatives to other single-use plastics.\nThe Singapore Hotels Association (SHA) added that they have seen more of their member hotels “switching from miniature-bottled amenities to dispensers”.\n“There is also a strong movement in the industry to do away with single-use plastics such as from plastic straws to paper straws,” said SHA president Kwee Wei-Lin.\n“As consumers are increasingly more aware and supportive of green initiatives, it only makes good sense for hotels to embrace going green,” she said.\nNOT JUST PLASTIC WASTE, PLEASE\nWhile applauding the action taken by these hotels,\xa0founder of environmental group Plastic-Lite Singapore Aarti Giri noted that this is only one way to reduce waste.\n“Consistent and sincere efforts need to be made to eliminate single-use items, be they plastic or paper wherever they are avoidable,” she said.\nShe suggested that hotels improve sustainability efforts by removing plastic water bottles both in rooms and during conferences, stop supplying disposable room slippers and to only give other toilet amenities such as brushes, disposable razors and sewing kits to guests only on request.\nShe added that hotels can also make “targeted efforts” to reduce food waste, and also to “invest in their own food digesters/composters with the resulting fertiliser sold to farmers and/or used in their own organic gardens”.\nAdditionally, hotels can look at donating items as part of reducing waste, said environment group Zero Waste SG’s Pek Hai Lin.\n“There are other aspects, such as when they change items like towels and mattresses. For items which cannot be reduced upstream, hotels can look at donating to beneficiaries downstream if they are still in good condition,” she said.\nUltimately, it appears to be a matter of priorities, said Ms Giri.\n""As is the case of many private industries, profits seem to be at the bottom-line of the company\'s overall agenda. This short-sighted profit-based corporate mentality is, I would say, a systemic problem,"" she said.\nShe added that companies should focus on making the best use of resources\xa0rather than on its own growth, and that ""profits made at the expense of the environment is not sustainable"".\n""The sooner the businesses realise this, the better the chance we have at controlling the damage arising from climate change,"" she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     sustainability ', '     National Environment Agency ']}"

      Palm oil from conserved rainforest in Indonesia's Sumatra sold to major brands, says forest group
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Palm oil from an illegal plantation inside an Indonesian rainforest home to endangered orangutans has found its way into the supply chains of major consumer brands including Unilever and Nestle, according to a US-based environmental group.\nA Rainforest Action Network (RAN) investigation showed Asia-based palm oil traders Golden Agri-Resources (GAR) and Musim Mas Group bought oil from two mills that sourced palm fruit from a small, privately-owned plantation on Sumatra island.\nThe plantation is inside the protected Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve, in a high-priority conservation area and critical wildlife habitat, dubbed the ""orangutan capital of the world"".\nPalm oil is the world\'s most widely used edible oil, found in everything from margarine to soap, but has faced scrutiny in recent years from green activists and consumers, who have blamed its production for forest loss, fires and worker exploitation.\nSingapore-listed GAR and Indonesia\'s Musim Mas supply - either directly, or indirectly - to a list of brands including Unilever, Nestle, PepsiCo, Mondelez International, General Mills, Kellogg\'s, Mars and the Hershey, RAN said.\n""Effective immediately, the food companies and traders need to suspend sourcing from these mills that we have exposed,"" said RAN\'s forest policy director Gemma Tillack.\nThe investigation is the latest expose to put pressure on companies to prove pledges that they are not fuelling clearing of forest land for plantations and contributing to the impact shrinking forests are having on climate change.\nNeither Musim Mas nor GAR confirmed which brands they sell palm oil to. GAR said the two mills named do not source palm oil from plantations in the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve, although it said it could not yet fully trace the links between all the mills it uses and the plantations supplying them.\nAll the companies involved vowed to investigate, monitor or keep track of suppliers to ensure palm oil from protected forest areas does not feed into their supply chains.\nINDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS\nHigh-profile palm oil buyers like Nestle, PepsiCo and Unilever have committed to zero deforestation and to source only sustainable oil by 2020.\nA spokeswoman for Nestle said GAR, a direct supplier to the Swiss food giant, had ""conducted verification"" with the mills named by RAN.\n""Nestle is opposed to deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats around the world,"" she said, outlining efforts in the last decade to ensure its buying is not linked to deforestation.\nHershey Co and Mars said they did not buy palm oil directly from GAR, but understood that the palm oil trading firm had reviewed the situation and found no evidence of wrongdoing.\nMondelez, the maker of Oreo cookies, said it had required all its palm oil suppliers to convert their entire supply chains to sustainable practices since 2014, and progress had been made.\n""We, the industry, cannot win the fight against deforestation alone, and partnership with governments, suppliers and farmers is critical for success,"" added sustainability director Jonathan Horrell.\nConsumer goods giant Unilever said it was aware of the RAN probe and was closely monitoring GAR\'s progress as it continued to map and trace suppliers close to Rawa Singkil.\nKellogg\'s and PepsiCo did not respond to requests for comment, while General Mills could not provide an immediate comment.\nHIGH RISK\nTillack said RAN began to map the Sumatran supply chain, including the mills and brokers who deliver palm fruit, a year ago. Satellite images showed that an area within the 82,000-hectare Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve had been cleared in 2013 and illegally replanted with oil palm.\nBy tracking trucks and conducting interviews on the ground, RAN said it found that palm oil fruit grown on this land had been supplied to two nearby mills run by PT Global Sawit Semesta and PT Samudera Sawit Nabati.\nThe mills and owners could not be reached for comment.\n""These mills are located on the doorstep of this reserve,"" Tillack told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It is very clear that they are at high risk of sourcing illegal palm oil.""\nBoth mills are publicly listed as GAR suppliers, while one is linked to Musim Mas, RAN said.\nTillack said GAR was made aware of the risks of using the two mills located so close to protected forests in 2017, and told RAN it would work with the mills on this by February.\nGAR spokeswoman Anita Neville said the firm had engaged with its suppliers in Aceh and near the reserve since 2015 to help them ""overcome the specific challenges"" - and had made progress.\nShe said the company reserved the right to suspend suppliers who were not improving but that was not seen ""to be the case in this instance"".\nGAR has a target of 85% of the palm fruit in its supply chain being traced to the plantation it comes from by the end of 2019, rising to 100% by the end of 2020, Neville added.\nA Musim Mas spokeswoman said there were nine mills in its supply chain that operate in the area surrounding the reserve.\nAbout half the palm fruit the mills process can be traced to the plantation where it is grown, and like GAR, Musim Mas has a target of increasing that to 100% by the end of 2020, she said.\nAs in previous cases, Musim Mas would ""take immediate action once we know who the suppliers in question are"", she said, adding that the company had conducted workshops with suppliers in the region to boost sustainability and traceability.\nRobert Nasi, director-general of the Indonesia-based Center for International Forestry Research, said there had been ""a slow but constant erosion"" of the reserve\'s peat-swamp forest.\n""Fears are that if this continues, the remaining orangutan population will become marooned on an isolated forest island in a sea of plantations,"" he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Malaysian environment minister brushes off calls for resignation amid alleged conflict of interest in handling haze issue
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin on Tuesday (Sep 24) brushed off calls for her resignation, as the opposition pointed to potential conflict of interest in her handling of the regional haze issue.\nThis came after it was revealed that IOI Corporation, which is linked to her husband\'s family, has a plantation subsidiary in Indonesia suspected of causing haze.\nResponding to media queries, the minister said that it is up to the Indonesian government to take action against those who infringe the laws there.\n“I hope the opposition can give more constructive proposals to address the problem which has affected the country for decades,” she said.\nThe Star also quoted her as saying: “We welcome ideas from either the government or the opposition”.\nMalaysia has been on the receiving end of cross-border haze from Indonesia since August, which forced schools to be closed and flights to be cancelled.\nThe haze also led to a diplomatic incident between the two countries, with Malaysia sending a diplomatic note to Indonesia to urge prompt action over the fires, while Indonesia said some of the fires in the archipelago were on palm plantations operated by Malaysian-owned companies.\nMdm Yeo has said that her ministry would seek the advice of the attorney-general on drafting a Cross-Border Pollution Act that would apply to Malaysian companies and individuals.\nIn a tweet dated Sep 14, the minister wrote: “If anyone is proven to be causing forest fire after investigation, Indonesia should take action against them according to the law, regardless of who they are and without fear or favour. Most importantly, the fires must be put out ASAP.”\nThe opposition has criticised her handling of the haze issue.\nOver the weekend, Malaysian Chinese Association’s youth chief Nicole Wong called on the minister to resign immediately\n""She (the environment minister)\xa0said five days ago that the Transboundary Haze Act must be introduced right away for Malaysia and Southeast Asian nations, which have always been hit by haze, but her husband\'s company is among the four named by the Indonesian government responsible for forest fires,"" noted Ms Wong.\n""Therefore, it is not suitable for YBY (Yeo\xa0Bee Yin)\xa0to handle\xa0the issue while her husband\'s company is one of those involved,"" she said, adding that\xa0the issue is a serious one because it involves people\'s safety.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Companies responsible for haze to be penalised when entering Malaysia: Finance Minister
  </h1>, 'text': ""KUALA LUMPUR: Companies found to be responsible for haze in the region may be penalised upon entering the Malaysian market, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said on Tuesday (Sep 24), as the monsoon transition provided a respite from the choking haze.\n“There was a suggestion that we enact the Transboundary Haze Act where anyone identified as among parties that caused forest fires be subjected to a penalty if they come to Malaysia,” he was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times.\xa0He did not elaborate further.\nMalaysia has been on the receiving end of cross-border haze from Indonesia since August, which forced schools to be closed\xa0and flights to be cancelled.\nLast Wednesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia may introduce a law to compel its companies to put out fires on land they operate abroad.\n“If we find that they are unwilling to take action, we may have to pass a law which will make them responsible for fires in their property, even if it’s outside of Malaysia,” he said.\nMdm Yeo Bee Yin, the minister in charge of the environment, said last Thursday that her ministry would seek the advice of the attorney-general on drafting the Transboundary Haze Act to handle the haze problem.\nAn environmental law expert had suggested for the government to study the United States’ extraterritorial legislation known as Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) 1977 when drafting its proposed Transboundary Haze Act.\nDr Hanim Kamaruddin of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia told Bernama that the FCPA was the first to introduce corporate liability, responsibility for third parties and extraterritoriality for corruption offences. This means that any US-based company and person can be held criminally and civilly responsible for corruption offences committed abroad.\n“Hence, the proposed Transboundary Haze Act should also have provisions with a similar concept in order to tackle transboundary haze pollution crime,” she said.\nIn 2014, Singapore passed the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act to go after companies that started fires or let their concessions burn, and contributed to haze that blanketed Singapore and other parts of the region.\nHAZE SITUATION IMPROVES IN MALAYSIA\xa0\nLast week, the\xa0Malaysian Meteorological Department had predicted\xa0that the haze situation would improve when the monsoon transition begins on Tuesday. \xa0\nAs of 5pm on Tuesday, only eight monitoring stations in Peninsular Malaysia reported unhealthy air, with Johan Setia in Klang topping the chart with an Air Pollutant Index (API) of 161.\nSarawak, which has been badly hit by haze originating\xa0from fires in Kalimantan, recorded moderate air quality.\nIn Sri Aman, air quality improved from last Friday's 402 (hazardous)\xa0to 81 (moderate).\n\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     environment ', '     Indonesia ']}"

      How the vulnerable are being protected from the haze
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As the haze continues to persist, healthcare institutions\xa0and nursing homes across Singapore say they are taking steps to protect those under their care, especially those in wards and rooms without air-conditioning.\nAt Changi General Hospital (CGH) for instance,\xa0\xa0a ""multi-pronged"" approach has been put into place to\xa0ensure the safety of patients and staff, CGH\'s service operations director Dr Goh Min Liong told CNA.\nSaid Dr Goh: ""In wards without air conditioning, portable air cooling units and air purifiers are deployed, and screens to prevent the inflow of haze are fitted where necessary.""\nCGH\'s ventilation systems are also fitted with HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air)\xa0filters, added Dr Goh. These\xa0are filters that trap harmful particles in the air.\nIn addition, CGH is monitoring the number of\xa0patients with respiratory-related conditions, explained Dr Goh, and\xa0patients who have medical conditions that make them susceptible to the haze have been given suitable respirators for support\xa0where advised by doctors.\nThe National University Health System (NUHS) - which manages several hospitals, including\xa0National University Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Alexandra Hospital\xa0and Jurong Community Hospital - has also implemented measures to maintain indoor air quality, an NUHS spokesperson told CNA.\nThis includes shutting windows in the naturally-ventilated patient areas and deploying\xa0portable air cooling and purifying units.\n""Filters are installed to the air-conditioning systems in the buildings to minimise pollutants and smell in the air. We have a good supply of essential supplies ... medicine, eye drops, inhalers, surgical masks and N95 masks,"" said the spokesperson. ""Staff who are susceptible to the haze condition will be redeployed to work indoors.” \xa0\xa0\nFor instance at Alexandra Hospital, security personnel wear masks when deployed outdoors for patrolling, while\xa0the daily frequency for\xa0groundskeeping such portering and landscaping has been reduced.\xa0\nAt NUHS\xa0polyclinics, the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with existing chronic respiratory and heart diseases will be given priority for consultations and treatment, its spokesperson added.\nWhile Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH)\xa0did not respond to CNA\'s queries, a visit to one of its wards last Wednesday\xa0also found that windows were shut, with all fans switched on for ventilation.\xa0\n""The healthcare institutions take reference from the National Environment Agency’s guidelines on indoor air quality, in managing the particulate matter (PM) levels in indoor spaces,"" said the Ministry of Health in response from CNA\'s queries.\nAN EYE ON THE SITUATION\nNursing homes have\xa0also been proactive in battling the haze.\nAt\xa0Thong Teck Home for Senior Citizens, steps are taken to ensure that residents in the non air-conditioned nursing home are protected when the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)\xa0exceeds 100.\nAccording to the National Environment Agency (NEA), PSI readings of 50 and below denote “good” air quality, “moderate” for 51-100 and “unhealthy” for 101-200.\nHaze updates are\xa0disseminated to all key personnel\xa0every two hours through a central information kiosk,\xa0said the home\'s\xa0deputy nursing officer, SN Santie Antonio Soria,\xa0with fans being turned on at all times, and face masks being made available to residents, staff and visitors.\nWhen the 24-hr PSI reading crosses into the unhealthy range,\xa0Ren Ci Hospital\'s haze management plan also kicks in at its nursing homes, it told CNA.\n\n\nIn addition to making use of air purifiers and monitoring residents for adverse reactions to the haze, it also conducts less intensive rehabilitation activities in air-conditioned areas.\n""We placed emphasis on hydration for patients/ residents and have been brewing drinks like barley water for them and staff as well,"" added Ren Ci.\xa0\nAt Thye Hwa Kwan\'s nursing home, two-hourly rounds in ""designated areas"" are also\xa0conducted to check on residents\' well-being, it told CNA.\nAll outdoor activities in the nursing home have also been cancelled until\xa0further notice.\xa0\nStandby inhalers, eye drops and heart-related medications for emergency use are also readily available, it added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Ministry of Health ']}"

      At ground zero, Indonesians cry foul over inadequate response to fight forest fires
  </h1>, 'text': 'PEKANBARU, Riau:\xa0Mdm Sri Ruayati posted a note on at the front door of her tiny home sitting at the end of a small dirt road in the village of Rimbo Panjang.\nWritten in black and red marker pen, the note read: “We are not blaming anyone. But please carry out the duties you are sworn to do.”\nSince Sunday (Sep 15), fire has been raging just 50 metres from her home, in a peatland covered in thick shrubs and tall trees. The flames have been slowly inching toward\xa0her house.\nAn orange glow was clearly visible above the treeline beyond her backyard fence as thick black smoke billowed tens of metres up into the air.\nIn a panic, Mdm Ruayati and her three teenage daughters frantically summoned everyone around them, including the people relaxing at a small coffee shop at the side of a busy road.\nPeople came one by one, watching the flames and documenting the scene\xa0on their phones.\n“I asked my neighbours, ‘who here called the fire brigade?’ Everyone fell silent,” she recounted to\xa0CNA, shaking her head in disbelief.\n“I tried calling (the fire brigade) but was only told to be patient. Help never came. I immediately ran to the main road, stopping every police car, every\xa0government agency vehicle\xa0to get their attention.”\nFirefighters finally came the following morning, staying for five to six hours before heading off elsewhere, thinking that they had completely extinguished the blaze.\nBut peatland fire is very\xa0difficult to extinguish and flames could still be smouldering beneath the surface, inside the layers of decomposed plants which can run up to four metres deep.\n“At night the fire started again,” she said. “So I went back on the phone and back on the main road, stopping cars to get people’s attention.”\nMdm Ruayati\xa0has been repeating her routine every day since the fire started.\n“I barely get any sleep. All I think about is how to get government officials to come and do their job. With fire so close to my house, I should have been evacuated. The government should have told me it is not safe for me to stay here and found\xa0me a shelter,” she said in a frustrated tone.\nWhen CNA visited Mdm Ruayati on Tuesday\xa0evening, the fire near her house was still raging.\nShe said a government official recently came over to her house demanding that she remove the note on the\xa0front door.\n“He said that my note is hurtful. He told me that I am ungrateful, that the government is doing its best,” she said.\nShe eventually agreed to take down the note, only to put it up again after the official left.\xa0“The fire\xa0near my home is still raging. I wonder what the official has to say about that.”\nPerceived slow response by firemen, lack of healthcare access and a belief that the authorities have not learnt from past episodes of haze are just some of the issues that have frustrated those on the ground.\nLACK OF MANPOWER\nDuring a visit to Riau province this week, Indonesian President Joko Widodo instructed officials to put out the flames as soon as a forest fire is detected.\n“If a fire is detected, put it out immediately. The best way is to prevent a fire from starting or at least from spreading,” the president, known popularly as Jokowi, told reporters.\nBut that was not what happened in the case of Mdm Ruayati, whose house is located just one hour drive from Riau’s bustling capital city, Pekanbaru.\nOne of the reasons for the slow response might be the lack of manpower.\nBefore the president’s visit, the Riau Disaster Mitigation Agency’s 1,512 personnel had to fight 49,266ha of fire spread across a province 120 times the size of Singapore. \xa0\nAfter Mr Widodo\'s visit, the number of personnel grew to 5,809.\nBut disaster mitigation agency officials and volunteers still have to travel hundreds of kilometres through dirt and muddy roads to get to the fires that are mostly located deep in the jungle.\n“We are facing many challenges from lack of water source, access to the locations and the prolonged drought which makes the trees and shrubs much more flammable,” Riau Disaster Mitigation Agency chief Edward Sanger told reporters.\n“Firefighters even had to travel by boat to get to certain locations. Some firefighters even encountered bears, tigers and crocodiles to get to the fire near the Kerumutan wildlife preserve. Putting down the fire is not an easy job. Our officials are risking their lives.”\nSince August, more than 286,000ha of forests and peatlands have been burnt\xa0across six provinces in Indonesia: Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan and South Kalimantan.\nThe fires have been blamed on the slash-and-burn practices of clearing land for plantations, exacerbated by the prolonged drought caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.\nThe forest fires have been so bad cities in Indonesia and neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore have been blanketed by thick haze.\nAs air quality worsened, thousands of schools in Indonesia and Malaysia have been closed and many people have been treated for respiratory illnesses.\nSince the beginning of the month, air quality\xa0in Riau\'s capital, Pekanbaru has\xa0consistently reached the hazardous level.\nOn Friday morning, the Air Quality Index (AQI) measured in one monitoring station in Pekanbaru ranged between 444 and 529.\nAn AQI\xa0reading of\xa0between 151 - 200 is considered unhealthy, 200-300 is considered very unhealthy and anything above 300 is considered hazardous. \xa0\nPAST LESSONS UNHEEDED\nGreenpeace Indonesia researcher Mr Rusmadya Maharuddin said the government has been slow to provide healthcare for the millions of Indonesians living in suffocating haze. \xa0\n“Air quality in Kalimantan and Sumatra has reached hazardous level. When it is already hazardous, people should be evacuated. At the very least there should be places which have good air quality like buildings equipped with air purifiers,” Mr Maharuddin told CNA. \xa0\n“You need to provide healthcare for vulnerable people like children, pregnant women and the elderly. The government has the responsibility to look after its people.\n“The government has been slow to provide facilities for people exposed to the haze. This happens every year without any effort to make the emergency response procedures quicker.”\nIn front of the governor’s office, a modern nine-storey structure at the heart of Pekanbaru, students have been staging protests demanding the resignation of the provincial governor.\nMr Syamsuar, who like many Indonesians goes by one name,\xa0has drawn flak for\xa0attending a seminar in Thailand between Sep 10 and 12 as the haze situation worsened.\nUpon his return, he told reporters that the business seminar was one he had to attend.\xa0“Important ministers from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand attended the seminar. I was invited in August and I confirmed my attendance. I can’t just abruptly cancel\xa0my visit,” he said.\nHe claimed that before his departure, he had instructed the province’s health agency to set up health clinics.\xa0\n“Perhaps there are people who are not aware of this. We will make sure everyone knows where (the clinics) are located,” he continued. “All (medical) expenses will be covered by the provincial government.”\nThe National Disaster Mitigation Agency said health clinics in Riau were operational starting Sep 15, weeks after air quality started to deteriorate.\nAccording to the agency, the Riau government has converted 14 buildings into makeshift refugee centres and clinics, including the indoor assembly hall of a mental asylum.\xa0All 14 locations were\xa0located within Pekanbaru city.\nSome have also criticised the central government for not learning from the 2015 haze which exposed around 69 million people in the region to unhealthy air.\n“Last month, President Jokowi promised to fire officials who fail to prevent forest fire from spreading just as he did in 2015. But no one has ever been fired even after forest fires got this bad,” Ms Nur Hidayati, executive director of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) told CNA.\nAs a response to the 2015 Haze Crisis, the president also established the Peatland Restoration Agency. “But nothing has been achieved. Peatlands are not restored. In fact, they continue to be burned and converted into plantations,” Ms Hidayati said.\nLOCALS SAY HEALTHCARE SERVICES ARE LACKING\nRiau residents have also criticised the state of healthcare services rendered during the haze.\nMdm\xa0Yolanda, 30, who is eight months pregnant,\xa0recently went to a public hospital because she was worried about how the haze would affect her\xa0pregnancy.\xa0\nShe recounted how she was charged for the treatment even though the governor said all expenses will be covered by the government.\n“We are in a disaster situation. We are suffering because of the haze. The government should have done its job preventing forest fires. And now the government won’t pay for my medical bills?”\nWith the government criticised for not doing enough, local Islamist party, the Prosperous Justice Party has stepped in.\nBefore the government established clinics, the party had converted its main office into a makeshift refugee shelter, housing hundreds of pregnant women and those with babies and toddlers. \xa0\xa0\n“We have around 100 people seeking refuge here. The air is not healthy for pregnant women and babies even if they stay indoors because you need air purifiers,” one volunteer Irda Vriyeni told CNA.\nMs Vriyeni said hundreds of people also flocked to the makeshift shelter in need of treatment for illnesses ranging from respiratory problems, nausea to headaches.\n“We even had ambulances standing by. One time we had to evacuate an elderly woman in the middle of the night. We also used the ambulance to rush people to the hospital when their case was\xa0too severe to be treated here,” she said.\n""NOT TRUE WE HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND"": PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT\nWhen contacted by CNA, the Riau government said that it is doing all it can.\n“We have prepared health clinics as well as refugee centres for people affected by the haze. The governor has also instructed regencies and districts to open similar facilities. So it is not true that we have been slow to respond to the haze,” said Riau provincial secretary Ahmad Syah Harofie.\n“However, not many people know about their presence. We just need to inform the public about them.”\nWhen asked about Mdm Yolanda’s experience at the hospital, Mr Harofie noted that the government only covers medical expenses for those seeking treatments at the designated clinics.\nThe provincial secretary added: “Putting out forest fires is hard work and we believe we can handle it. But the weather has not been in our favour.” He also said that the provincial government has\xa0staged regular communal Islamic prayers asking God for rain.\n“The reason why the haze is like this in Riau is because the wind is moving north, so we are getting haze from neighbouring provinces as well. If the other provinces are as serious as us (in tackling the issue), the haze problem in Riau would be less severe.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

Borneo is shared between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.\nThousands of schools have been forced to close in Malaysia and Indonesia amid mounting health concerns, while several airports have shut due to poor visibility.\nRUN ON FACE MASKS\nPeople have been dashing to buy face masks and there has been an increase in reports of respiratory illnesses and conditions such as dry and itchy eyes.\nThe worst-affected part of Malaysia has been Sarawak state, on Borneo, where more than 1,000 schools were shuttered Friday and air quality reached ""hazardous"" levels in one area bordering Indonesia.\nThe second round of an Asian Development Tour golf tournament in the state, the PGM MNRB ADT Championship, was postponed for a second consecutive day Friday due to the haze, organisers said.

      Climate change takes toll on oceans, ice: UN report
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Humanity should brace for blowback from oceans and frozen zones increasingly addled by climate change, a major UN report will warn.\nLoading the atmosphere with CO2 and greenhouse gases has spawned a host of consequences, starting with irreversible sea-level rise, according to a draft Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report obtained by AFP.\nHere are impacts highlighted in a summary slated for release on September 25:\nOCEANS WARMING\nSOAK IT UP: Oceans have absorbed a quarter of manmade greenhouse gases and 93 per cent of the extra heat they generate in the atmosphere. As a result, the world\'s seas have become warmer, more acidic and less salty.\nHEATWAVES: The frequency, intensity and extent of marine heatwaves like those that devastated Australia\'s Great Barrier Reef have all increased, with ocean hot spells twice as likely today as during the 1980s.\nEL NINOS: Extreme El Ninos - weather phenomena which drive forest fires, cause disease outbreaks and affect cyclones -\xa0are expected to double in frequency if emissions are not cut.\nSUSTENANCE: Food supply from shallow tropical waters could decline by 40 per cent by the year 2100 because of warming and acidification.\nSome ocean wildlife populations - from minuscule plankton to big fish and marine mammals - have shifted hundreds of kilometres toward their preferred temperatures, adversely affecting coastal fisheries.\nOCEANS RISING\nSEA LEVEL: Compared to the 1980-2000 period, seas will rise nearly half a metre by 2100 if Earth warms 2C above preindustrial levels, and 84 cm in a 3C-4C world. In the 22nd century, the pace of sea-level rise is likely to jump 100-fold from 3.6 millimetres per year today to several centimetres annually.\nEven if global warming is capped at 2C, oceans will eventually rise several metres, submerging areas that are today home to 280 million people.\nFLOOD DAMAGE: Without major adaptation efforts, the cost of annual flood damage caused by storm surges would increase 100- to 1,000-fold by 2100.\nADAPTATION: Rising seas will force all coastal regions to adapt. Rich nations will more likely build barriers, developing ones will more likely be forced to retreat to higher ground.\nNEW NORMAL: Many low-lying megacities and small island states will experience what are today rare sea-level extremes every year by 2050, no matter how fast CO2 emissions are drawn down.\nWETLANDS: Globally, 20 to 90 percent of coastal wetlands will disappear by 2100, depending on sea-level rises.\nOCEANS DYING\nOXYGEN: The concentration of life-giving oxygen in marine environments has dropped two percent in 60 years, and will decline another three to four percent by 2100 at current rates of carbon pollution. Oxygen levels will likely decline over 59-80 per cent of the ocean surface within 20 years.\nDEAD ZONES: Coastal pollution and warming waters are creating vast oxygen-depleted dead zones.\nCORALS: Coral reefs -\xa0a major bulwark against storm surges - will decline by 90 per cent even in a 1.5 C world. Two degrees would be a death sentence for corals, which underpin the livelihoods of half a billion people today.\nICE MELTING\nICE SHEETS: Earth\'s two ice sheets, sitting atop Greenland and Antarctica, have shed on average more than 430 billion tonnes of mass each year since 2006, becoming the main drivers of sea-level rise.\nGLACIERS: Average annual runoff from glaciers in most mountain regions will have peaked and begun to decline by 2100. Worldwide, more than two billion people today depend on glaciers for fresh water.\nLow-altitude glaciers in the Alps, the Caucasus mountains and Scandinavia will lose more than 80 per cent of current mass by 2100.\nSNOW: Mountains will lose snow cover, with far-reaching impacts for agriculture, energy supply and tourism.\nPERMAFROST THAWING\nPERMAFROST: Thirty to 99 per cent of the world\'s top-layer permafrost - the top three metres - could melt by 2100 if carbon pollution continues unabated, releasing a carbon bomb of greenhouse gases. If emissions are aggressively capped, the area thawed could be vastly reduced.\nHEAVY METAL: Toxic mercury and other ""legacy contaminants"" in drinking water will increase with the melting of glaciers and permafrost, which may store nearly 800,000 tonnes of mercury - twice the amount found in all other environments combined.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     environment ', '     UN ']}"

      Understand the haze: What do Singapore's air quality readings mean and how do they differ from others?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With the haze affecting many aspects of life in the\xa0region from tourism to work and school,\xa0CNA spoke to Dr Khairunnisa Yahya, a senior scientific officer at the National Environment Agency\'s (NEA) pollution control department, to find out how the haze is measured and what the various readings mean.\xa0\nWHAT IS THE 24-HOUR PSI?\nThe 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)\xa0is computed based on six air pollutants -\xa0PM2.5, PM10, ozone, sulphur\xa0dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide.\xa0\nIt was developed as an indicator of Singapore\'s daily air quality and is the reading that NEA\'s daily health advisories are based on.\xa0\nPSI readings can fall within each of five ranges - Good (0 to 50), Moderate (51 to 100), Unhealthy (101 to 200), Very Unhealthy (201 to 300) and Hazardous (Above 300).\xa0\n\n\nWHAT IS THE ONE-HOUR PM2.5?\nIt is the hourly average of the PM2.5 pollutant levels.\xa0\nPM2.5 is\xa0fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or shorter.\xa0\nIt is the\xa0dominant pollutant during haze and can be harmful to health.\xa0\nWhile the 24-hour PSI is an average of the past 24 hours,\xa0the one-hour PM2.5 reading offers the option of looking at air quality at a single point in time.\xa0\nThe one-hour PM2.5 readings may fall within one of these bands - I (Normal), II (Elevated), III (High) and IV (Very High).\xa0\nWHICH READING SHOULD YOU FOCUS ON?\nHealth advice issued by NEA is based on the 24-hour PSI forecast so that members of the public can plan ahead.\xa0\nFor example, if you have an outdoor sports tournament planned for Saturday, you can look at the 24-hour PSI forecast for Saturday. If the figure is in the unhealthy range, it may be a good idea to think of protective measures.\xa0\nThe one-hour PM2.5 readings are\xa0best used as a guide to adjust immediate activities.\nThinking of going for a dip at the nearby swimming complex? If the PM2.5 figure is in the elevated band, you may want to postpone that swim to a later time.\xa0\nDr Khairunnisa sums it up: ""For the 24-hour PSI, we give out a forecast so the public can plan their activities for the day. But for the immediate activity that you are doing for the next hour or so, you should be looking at the one-hour PM2.5.""\nIS THE ""WINDOW TEST"" A GOOD INDICATOR?\nLooking out your window is not a good indicator because poor visibility is not always caused by air pollutants. It is, in fact, water that can cause visibility to worsen.\xa0\nWater droplets scatter light. Water can also bind to particles of certain air pollutants, making them swell to a size that makes them scatter even more light. In this way, the haze can appear enhanced.\xa0\nThe effect is even greater when there is high humidity or rain.\xa0\nThis means that on days where there is not just haze but also high humidity, visibility can appear worse than indicated by the air quality readings.\xa0\nIF THE ONE-HOUR PM2.5 READS AS NORMAL FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME BUT THE 24-HOUR PSI REGISTERS AS UNHEALTHY, DOES THIS MEAN OTHER POLLUTANTS ARE AT PLAY? \nIt is highly unlikely that such a PSI reading is caused by pollutants other than the PM2.5 during periods of\xa0haze.\xa0\nIt could be down to the fact that there were increased concentrations of PM2.5 earlier in the day, which may be confirmed by looking at PM2.5 readings recorded in the morning.\xa0\nThe PSI calculates the air quality over 24 hours so it is possible the reading you are looking at still factors in\xa0some of PM2.5 levels from then.\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PSI AND AQI?\nThere are multiple air quality indices readily available to the public\xa0including the World Air Quality Index (AQI) from website\xa0aqicn.org,\xa0a non-profit organisation set up in 2007.\xa0\nNeither the PSI nor the AQI is incorrect - each is just computed using a different air quality index. The AQI adopts the United States Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality Index reporting system.\xa0\nIt obtains PM2.5\xa0data from various countries to compute\xa0the latest numbers.\nWHY IS THE PSI THE BEST READING FOR SINGAPORE?\nTo calculate the PSI, the NEA uses data from a network of air-monitoring stations\xa0around Singapore.\xa0\nDifferent countries look at different health findings and their local circumstances to come up with their own index system, said Dr Khairunnisa.\nAs such, it has control of the entire process, ensuring a more accurate reading of the local situation.\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     environment ']}"

Sixty-five countries have signed up to it so far - equivalent to 87 per cent of all international activity in the sector.\n""There will be a number of eligible carbon reduction schemes and airlines will be able to buy the equivalent tonnes of CO2 via these projects,"" says Nathalie Simmenauer, Air France\'s head of environment and sustainable development.\nThe aim is to reach ""neutral carbon growth"" - that is to ensure future emissions are held at 2020 levels.\n""A COP-OUT""\nWhile trees are an important tool for regulating the climate, reforestation alone cannot whitewash a company\'s carbon-emitting activity, say activists.\n""If you don\'t reduce your emissions and don\'t stop deforestation, you\'re not going to solve anything by merely planting trees,"" says Stephane Hallaire, president and founder of Reforest\'Action, which has planted 3.8 million trees in nine years.\nFor just three euros, the company will plant a tree adapted to the local biodiversity and purchase part of a carbon credit for a foreign forest conservation project.\nBut Hallaire argues that reforestation must also be accompanied by better behaviour elsewhere.\nJean-Francois Rial, the head of the environmentally friendly tour operator, Voyageurs du Monde, agrees.\nHe fervently advocates so-called ""absorption"", where ""precise and sustainable"" reforestation projects are identified and financed without the use of carbon credit systems, which are seen by some as more opaque and less effective.\n""It\'s a cop-out that risks dissuading society collectively from making greater effort and investing in costlier technologies,"" says Alain Karsenty, researcher at the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD).\nLarge-scale reforestation also poses other problems: the planted trees may compete with local cultures and forests and may not necessarily be beneficial to the local environment.\n""These are often fast-growing species such as eucalyptus, pines, because we need trees that store carbon very quickly, but it can end up causing problems of biodiversity, soil drying,"" Karsenty said.\nReforestation alone is ""insufficient"", but still ""better than nothing"", and, for the time being it is just one tool among others to reduce emissions, the expert says.\nThat is until technological advances that allow the efficient capturing and storage of CO2 from the air or developing jets that run on hydrogen.\n""It at least lets you buy time.

The land is for my children,” the 56-year-old head of the\xa0Paser Balik tribe said.\nThe locals said land value in Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kertanegara districts – the two districts set to house the new capital – has surged immediately following Mr Widodo’s announcement.\nBusiness-minded agents wasted no time to spring into action, actively approaching the locals to broach the possibility of them putting up their land for sale.\n“Agents from Berau, Tarakan, Tenggarong (in Kalimantan), and even Surabaya and Jakarta have contacted me. They are really aggressive,” Mr Sikbukdin, who goes by one name,\xa0told CNA.\nThe Indonesian government is determined to relocate the nation’s capital because Jakarta, which is heavily polluted, is one of the fastest sinking cities in the world.\nJakarta is currently home to more than 10 million people, with another 30 million living in surrounding satellite cities, resulting in severe traffic congestion\xa0that cost\xa0S$7 billion in\xa0losses a year.\nBy comparison, East Kalimantan – which is largely free from natural disasters, unlike Jakarta and most parts of Indonesia – only has a population of 3.5 million people.\nThe government hopes the relocation could take pressure off Jakarta. It also believes that with the relocation, the country’s development will spread out as it is currently Java-centric.\nShould the parliament give the\xa0greenlight to Mr Widodo’s proposal, the government will begin constructing the new capital next year on an initial plot of 40,000ha land and transfer its administration here by 2024.\nSome 1.5 million civil servants will move here as well.\nThe relocation plan has excited some\xa0local residents, not for the future it holds for the province\xa0but the potential it brings to land value.\nThe relocation also spells good news for property developers, for the abundance of opportunities it offers from building a new capital from scratch in a province still covered in lush rainforests.\nHowever, others were sceptical about the central government\'s ambitious initiative.\nLAND PRICES SOAR\nThe government has said that it owns the 180,000ha land earmarked for the new capital, which is\xa0strategically located in the middle of the country. The area is located near Balikpapan – known as the oil city – and the provincial capital of Samarinda.\nWhile the exact site is anyone’s guess for now, people are betting on sub-districts straddling the border of Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara to be the new administrative capital.\nOne such places is Samboja, where Mr Apriansyah was demarcating\xa0the land during a recent CNA visit.\nHe said he has been tasked with checking the line markings on the piece of land belonging\xa0to his relatives, who live in Balikpapan, about 50km from Samboja.\n“The line markings have long disappeared. They haven’t inspected their land for years,” he said.\nMr Apriansyah, who goes by one name, said despite the president’s proposal, his relatives have no intention to sell the land. But they\xa0thought it is best to mark the land\xa0properly to declare ownership, he added.\nA few “properties for sale” signs were spotted along the road connecting Penajam Paser Utara and Kutai Kartanegara district. \xa0\nA man, who put up the sign but did not want to be named, told CNA he is selling his 1ha for 1.2 billion rupiah (US$85,210).\xa0\n“Everybody is increasing their land price. It used to be 125 million rupiah for one hectare,” he said, but adding that he did not have official documents to support his ownership.\nMr Eko, who runs a restaurant\xa0in\xa0Penajam Paser Utara, said there has been an enthusiastic discussion on land prices.\n“Every day, my customers talk about land prices. People coming from Penajam, Jakarta, Samarinda. All they talk about is land,” he said.\n“They’re looking for land. They’re middlemen … land mafias,” he added, using a term used by the locals to refer to those who jump at the opportunity to hoard land.\nHe concurred that land price has increased drastically ever since the president announced the capital would move to East Kalimantan.\n“Before this, a piece of 4ha land will be sold at around 350 million rupiah, but now it’s priced at four billion rupiah,” he claimed.\nPROPERTY DEVELOPERS WELCOME THE MOVE\nThe relocation plan comes as a good news for property developers, and it is especially so for Agung Podomoro Land, a consortium of developers which has built properties across Indonesia.\nThe company had\xa0in 2013 developed Borneo Bay City, a superblock consisting of malls, offices, hotel and apartments in Balikpapan, which borders Kutai Kartanegara to the north and Penajam Paser Utara to the west.\nEconomic growth in Balikpapan, known as the oil city, has slowed since oil and commodity prices plummeted a few years ago, with a number of companies leaving the city and relocating elsewhere.\nA day after Mr Widodo announced the relocation, Agung Podomoro Land put up a huge advertisement of its Balikpapan project on a national newspaper.\n""This is a blessing for us. The plan to relocate the capital to the two districts, which are relatively close to the Borneo Bay City, has brought an increased interest to our property here,"" said Mr Agung Wirajaya, director of Agung Podomoro Land.\nWill the vast development potentials and the soaring land prices force the existing citizens to move to the outskirts, as in the case of Jakarta?\nEast Kalimantan governor Isran Noor said no.\xa0“The government has given thought to this,” he said, but declined to divulge more. \xa0\nLOCALS SCEPTICAL OF AMBITIOUS INITIATIVE\nHowever, not everyone is thrilled.\nMr Bambang Sutrisno, 46, is against the idea but said there is nothing he can do.\n“Actually, if you ask me, I object to the idea of the capital moving here because I like it like this.\n“It’s calm, and our forest has already been destroyed. It only looks still intact but if you go further, you will see the forest is gone,” he said, pointing out the environmental consequences the relocation may bring.\nThere is also the question of whether the government’s relocation plan will come into fruition by the targeted deadline.\nThe residents in East Kalimantan pointed out that construction of a 99km highway connecting Balikpapan and Samarinda began in 2011 and after almost a decade, it is finally slated to be opened before end of this year.\n“People are worried whether the relocation will actually be realised. Some are sceptical.\n“The process of moving a capital is not easy,” Mr Eko said.\nMr Isran the governor said the government will see to the completion of the relocation.\xa0\n“It has to be successful. If the central government says it has to be done by 2024, then it has to.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     East Kalimantan ', '     Jakarta ', '     environment ']}"

      Earth to warm more quickly, new climate models show
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Greenhouse gases thrust into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels are warming Earth\'s surface more quickly than previously understood, according to new climate models set to replace those used in current UN projections, scientists said Tuesday (Sep 17).\nBy 2100, average temperatures could rise 6.5 to 7.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels if carbon emissions continue unabated, separate models from two leading research centres in France showed.\nThat is up to two degrees higher than the equivalent scenario in the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change\'s (IPCC) 2014 benchmark 5th Assessment Report.\nThe new calculations also suggest the Paris Agreement goals of capping global warming at ""well below"" two degrees, and 1.5C if possible, will be harder to reach, the scientists said.\n""With our two models, we see that the scenario known as SSP1 2.6 -\xa0which normally allows us to stay under 2C - doesn\'t quite get us there,"" Olivier Boucher, head of the Institute Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Modelling Centre in Paris, told AFP.\nWith barely one degree Celsius of warming so far, the world is already coping with increasingly deadly heat waves, droughts, floods and tropical cyclones made more destructive by rising seas.\nA new generation of 30-odd climate models known collectively as CMIP6 -\xa0including the two unveiled Tuesday -\xa0will underpin the IPCC\'s next major report in 2021.\n""CMIP6 clearly includes the latest modelling improvements,"" even as important uncertainties remain, Joeri Rogelj, an associate professor at Imperial College London and an IPCC lead author, told AFP.\nThese include increased supercomputing power and sharper representations of weather systems, natural and man-made particles, and how clouds evolve in a warming world.\n""We have better models now,"" said Boucher. ""They have better resolution, and they represent current climate trends more accurately.""\n""TIPPING POINTS""\nA core finding of the new models is that increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will warm Earth\'s surface more easily than earlier calculations had suggested.\nIf confirmed, this higher ""equilibrium climate sensitivity"", or ECS, means humanity\'s carbon budget - our total emissions allowance - is likely to shrink.\nThe French models are among the first to be released, but others developed independently have come to the same unsettling conclusion, Boucher confirmed.\n""The most respected ones -\xa0from the United States, and Britain\'s Met Office - also show a higher ECS"" than the previous generation of models, he said.\nThis is bad news for fight against global warming, which continues to face strong political headwinds and institutional inertia despite a rapid crescendo of public awareness and concern.\n""A higher ECS means a greater likelihood of reaching higher levels of global warming, even with deeper emissions cuts,"" Boucher and two British scientists -\xa0Stephen Belcher from the UK Met Office and Rowan Sutton from the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science - wrote in a blog earlier this year, tiptoeing around the implications of the new models.\n""Higher warming would allow less time to adapt and mean a greater likelihood of passing climate \'tipping points\' such as thawing of permafrost, which would further accelerate warming.""\nA third to 99 per cent of top-layer permafrost could melt by 2100 if carbon pollution is not abated, releasing billions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the air, according to a draft IPCC special report on oceans and Earth\'s frozen zones obtained by AFP.\n""Unfortunately, our global failure to implement meaningful action on climate change over recent decades has put us in a situation where what we need to do to keep warming to safe levels is extremely simple,"" said Rogelj.\n""Global greenhouse gas emissions need to decline today rather than tomorrow, and global CO2 emissions should be brought to net zero.""\nThe 2014 basket of climate models show Earth warming on current trends an additional 3C by 2100, and at least 2C even if national carbon cutting pledges are all met.\nThe two French climate models, including one from France\'s National Centre for Meteorological Research (CNRM), were to be unveiled at a press conference in Paris.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     climate change ']}"

      Cutting through the haze: When do you need an N95 mask?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Tuesday (Sep 17) that it pushed out additional stocks of N95 masks to retail\xa0stores over the weekend, amid reports that the masks were sold out at some shops.\xa0\nSaturday was the first time since August 2016 that the 24-hour PSI reading reached the ""unhealthy"" level, after the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) went beyond the 100 mark at 4pm.\xa0\nAir quality\xa0again entered the ""unhealthy"" range on Tuesday\xa0and Wednesday.\n\n\n\nWhile the NEA has said the government has ""sufficient"" stockpiles of the masks, here\'s a guide on how and when you should wear one:\nDO YOU NEED A MASK?\nAccording to NEA’s list of frequently asked questions and answers on its website, in general, a healthy person may want to wear a mask if he has to be outdoors for several hours when the air quality forecast is in the hazardous range.\nN95 masks are not necessary if you are going to be indoors or out for only a short period of time, such as commuting from home to school or work.\nAccording to NEA, PSI readings below 50 denote good air quality. The air quality is moderate if the reading is between 51 and 100, unhealthy for 101 to 200, and very unhealthy for 200 to 300. A PSI reading above 300 mean air quality is considered hazardous.\nWhen air quality reaches the very unhealthy level, children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic lung or heart disease should avoid or minimise outdoor activity. If they have to be outdoors for several hours, an N95 mask may help them reduce their exposure.\nThe agency cautioned, however, that the elderly, pregnant women and those with severe lung or heart problems who have difficulty breathing should consult their doctor as to whether they should use the N95 mask. If they do wear a mask, they should stop doing so if they feel uncomfortable.\nEmployers of workers who are required to work outdoors for prolonged periods are encouraged to maintain a seven-day stock for immediate response.\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO WEAR AN N95 MASK?\nAccording to NEA\'s website, N95 masks increase the effort it takes for one to breathe. For some people, the masks could cause discomfort in breathing, tiredness or headache.\n""This may be due to the mask causing increased resistance to breathing, and a reduction in the volume of air breathed,"" it said.\nFor most people, this is not serious.\nHowever, some elderly people, people with lung or heart conditions, and women in the later stages of pregnancy may already have reduced lung volumes or breathing issues and should take a break from using the masks if they feel uncomfortable.\nIS THE N95 MASK ADEQUATE PROTECTION AGAINST HAZE?\nThe mask will only work if it fits the face of the wearer. If the fit is not good, the air the wearer breathes in will go through the gaps between the mask and his face, and not through the filter as intended.\nHaze can contain fine particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller (PM2.5), and studies have shown that N95 masks provide good protection against particle pollutants as they are at least 95 per cent efficient against fine particles that are between 0.1 and 0.3 microns.\nWHERE CAN YOU GET A MASK?\nMasks are available at major pharmacies and supermarkets, such as Unity, Watsons, Guardian, Cold Storage, Giant\xa0and NTUC FairPrice.\nNEA said on Tuesday that it has been working with the Ministry of Health since April to ensure stocks of N95 masks are made available in retail shops.\n""We will continue to closely monitor the availability of masks to the public,"" said NEA.\n""We would like to assure the public that there are sufficient stocks in the warehouses and government stockpiles,"" it added.\nNEA also said on its website that the national stockpile of N95 masks may be released to the major pharmacies and supermarkets if more are needed.\nSHOULD YOU REUSE A MASK?\nYou can reuse your N95 mask, said NEA. However, the mask should be changed when it is soiled or distorted in shape. It should not be shared.\nHAZE IN SINGAPORE\nHaze conditions took a turn for the worse on\xa0Friday when PSI readings\xa0hiked to high-end of ""moderate"" level.\xa0On Saturday, it reached an unhealthy level for the first time in three years as it surpassed the 100 mark, and remained high through Sunday morning.\nThe situation improved\xa0on Monday, with the PSI in the moderate range, before hitting unhealthy levels again on Tuesday afternoon\xa0in certain parts of Singapore.\nOn Tuesday, NEA also said government agencies in Singapore\xa0have put in place ""robust action plans"" to minimise and manage the impact of haze on the public.\xa0\nThe plans by the Haze Task Force, comprising 28 government agencies and led by NEA, allow ""tiered responses depending on the intensity of haze which is based on the 24-hour Pollutants Standard Index (PSI) readings"", NEA added.\nFollow us on Telegram for the latest on the haze:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     health ', '     environment ']}"

      Customer reactions mixed as FairPrice begins charging for plastic bags in one-month trial
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As seven FairPrice and Cheers outlets began charging for plastic bags in a month-long trial starting Monday (Sep 16), shoppers CNA spoke to were mixed about its waste-cutting impact.\xa0\nUntil Oct 16, shoppers have to pay 20 cents per transaction at the participating FairPrice, FairPrice Finest and FairPrice Extra stores if they want plastic carriers with which to bag their groceries, and 10 cents per transaction at the Cheers and FairPrice Xpress outlets.\xa0\nThe proceeds will be donated to the Singapore Children\'s Society and The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.\xa0\nOne customer, who had just paid 20 cents for two plastic bags at the FairPrice Xtra in Hougang One, said the move should have been implemented sooner.\xa0\nThe housewife, who only wanted to be referred to as Ms Moralis,\xa0also said she thought the fee was too low if the aim was to stop Singaporeans from using plastic bags.\xa0\n“It’s just 20 cents. For most people, it’s almost nothing. If they want people to stop using, it should be more expensive,” said Ms Moralis.\xa0\nWhen CNA visited the FairPrice Finest outlet in Zhongshan Mall, cashiers were seen informing customers of the newly implemented plastic bag charge\xa0and suggesting that they buy a reusable bag for S$1 instead.\nCashiers were also seen double bagging heavy and wet items like milk and rice.\xa0\nA customer of the outlet, Ms Vivienne Yue, said: ""I think the charge should be per bag, not per transaction. I don\'t know if this would really incentivise people to bring their own bag.""\nThe housewife brings eight to 10 reusable bags to the outlet every week to buy groceries and has been doing so for years.\n“The 20 cents won’t stop the double bagging or giving of plastic bags for single item purchases. If they charge per bag, the customer might say \'no, I just need one\'. It’s enough to just fit everything in one, they’re not likely to take five bags for five items,” she said.\xa0\n“I notice the cashiers also always double bag and I always tell them they don’t need to. (It\'s also good) for the cashiers to know what to tell customers.”\xa0\nMs Yue pointed out that not all shoppers have the habit of bringing a reusable bag everywhere they go and developing that habit is not easy.\xa0\nShe also highlighted that not all grocery shopping trips are planned.\xa0\n""Sometimes I don’t plan to go to the supermarket and I’m not carrying my bags. And if I don’t have my bags then I’ll either stuff it into my own bag or take a plastic bag if I really have to,"" said Ms Yue.\xa0\n“20 cents is probably okay to make the consumers think twice about taking a bag. It takes a long time to remember to pack the bag, so people who don’t bring one out may feel a pinch every time they go out and spend the 20 cents,"" she said.\xa0\nNon-profit organisation Zero Waste SG, which is collaborating with FairPrice on the month-long trial, said cashiers will only give out the number of plastic bags needed for the goods purchased and will not allow customers to\xa0take more than that per transaction.\xa0\nZero Waste SG volunteers will also be at participating outlets to share about the initiative.\xa0\n""We hope that this charge can be increased to per bag or to make things more palatable, maybe the first three to five bags can be free and the charge applies to additional bags,"" said Zero Waste SG manager Pek Hai Lin.\xa0\nMr Pearce Tan, 20, who works in the area and often buys snacks at Zhongshan Mall, was not aware that there would be a one-month plastic bag charge.\xa0\nHe did not bring his own bag to the outlet and paid 20 cents for a plastic bag.\xa0\n“When I go grocery shopping I bring a reusable bag, but usually when I come here I don’t really always plan to go shopping. It’s on the way back from lunch\xa0and then I realise I need to grab this and that,” he said.\xa0\n“But 20 cents per transaction is quite cheap, so I’m okay with buying it. I will bring this back to my office and reuse it anyway,"" he added.\nMs Pek said that the ""ultimate goal"" is to change people\'s behaviour and habits.\xa0\n""So far I\'ve observed that the sentiment is still quite okay. (People) are quite receptive and we can see an immediate change in behaviour and customers bringing their own bags,"" she said.\xa0\xa0\nAs for concerns over the efficacy of a campaign that only targets consumers, Ms Pek said:\xa0“Even though industries are the ones who might make a bigger impact in terms of reducing the use of resources, customers still drive the demand for the goods and services that the industries provide.\xa0\n""I think we definitely have to push from both sides for it to be sustainable in the long-term.""\nNTUC FairPrice CEO Seah Kian Peng told reporters on Monday that the supermarket chain thought it was ""the right time for (it) to do something different"".\xa0\nIn addition to the trial, NTUC FairPrice will be conducting a consumer sentiment survey, he said.\xa0\n""At the end of this one month, we will put all this together and see how we should rework ... or come up with a new scheme that we can then implement across the island,"" he added.\xa0\nWhen asked why the retailers charged per transaction instead of per bag, Mr Seah said the team wanted to ""make things simple"".\xa0\n“I personally also understand that plastic bags in Singapore do have other uses. How we get rid of plastic bags is also quite different from how other countries dispose of their plastic bags, so I think we need to take this into account,"" he said.\xa0\nHe stressed that public awareness and education are\xa0the overall goal of FairPrice’s green initiatives.\xa0\n“I think the real success will be when each and every one of us knows that we all have a part to play,” he said.\xa0\n“Imagine if Singapore is one of the few countries where we are able to have this reusable bag habit not born by legislation.

And then the next morning the ground fire will just reignite.""\n""HUMAN BEHAVIOUR""\nThe culprit behind Indonesia\'s blazes is usually illegal fires set to clear land for the lucrative palm oil and pulpwood industries - and the situation this year has been worsened by drier weather.\nSome of the most serious fires happen in carbon-rich peatlands - topped with layers of decomposed plant material several metres thick - which become highly combustible when they\'re drained of water to be converted into plantations.\n""The forest and peatland fires that occur every year are a crisis created by human behaviour,"" said Rusmadya Maharuddin, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia.\n""Sometimes the fires will continue to burn for months, releasing emissions and causing haze.""\nPeat fires can belch out three times as much smoke per kilogramme of material than high-temperature forest fires, she added.\nAt the peak of Indonesia\'s 2015 forest fires - the country\'s worst in two decades - blazes in peat swamp forests emitted nearly 16 million tonnes of carbon emissions daily, more than the entire US economy in the same period, according to watchdog The International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nAcross the Pacific Ocean, huge fires tearing through the Amazon are compounding concerns about the long-term impact, as increasing fire outbreaks globally creates more greenhouse gas emissions and makes it harder to limit temperature rises, experts say.\nDETECTION DRAWBACK\nFighting peatland fires comes with myriad challenges because they\'re often in remote locations, the soft soil makes them inaccessible by car and firefighters need huge amounts of water - often pumped below ground - to get at subterranean blazes.\nIndonesia has deployed water-bombing helicopters, but the onset of the rainy season, which usually starts in October, could be the only thing able to douse the fires.\n""When you\'re dealing with large areas of peat burning it\'s just so expensive to bring in large quantities of water,"" said Michael Brady, an Indonesia-based peatlands expert at the Center for International Forestry Research.\n""Water-bombing is not very effective because you just can\'t drop enough water"" to douse them, he added.\nSatellite radar used to find hotspots - areas of intense heat which indicate a high chance of fire - does not always pinpoint below-ground blazes.\n""It may not show up as a hotspot ... (because) there might not be enough heat at the surface of the ground,"" Brady said.\n""So, one of the challenges is just to detect them.""\n""NOT GOING AWAY""\nAuthorities are beefing up law enforcement to catch those responsible for illegal burning and have moved to restore degraded peatland forests -\xa0a key buffer against annual flooding and home to endangered species, including Sumatran orangutans.\nBut despite Indonesia\'s progress over the past few decades, fighting fires is still a challenge even for countries like the United States, Canada and Australia which have some of the top technologies and fire prevention programmes, Brady said.\n""This is not going to go away,"" he added.\n""We\'re not going to find a solution to eliminate fires on the landscape completely and we\'re not going to \'tackle\' it. This requires an ongoing investment.""\nFollow us on Telegram for the latest on the haze:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     fire ', '     health ', '     environment ']}"

      Death toll rises as millions in Indonesia suffer from raging forest fires
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA:\xa0The last time Mulyoto was seen alive, he was rushing towards his plantation near his home in the village of Lintas Utara in the Indonesian province of Riau at 3pm on Wednesday (Sep 11).\nThe 69-year-old was alarmed when forest fires began to inch closer to his farmland, threatening to destroy his livelihood, according to news portal Detik.\nArmed with fire extinguishing equipment, he headed into his farm,\xa0thinking that he could contain the fire on his own. But he never returned.\xa0\n“(Mulyoto) was found completely charred, lying flat on his face,” a local police captain told the Indonesian news portal.\nMulyoto became the latest casualty of the\xa0forest fires that have been raging parts of Sumatra, Java and the Indonesian part of Borneo this dry season.\nWhile the government has yet to release an official death toll, news of deaths have been reported on\xa0local media.\xa0\nThe forest fires have so far\xa0claimed the lives of two siblings aged seven and 11\xa0in West Kalimantan province, a fire fighter in Jambi province and at least six farmers in Riau, West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan.\nAccording to the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency, more than 285,000ha of land have been burned since the dry season began\xa0in June.\nOn Friday morning, a total of 3,673 hotspots were detected across three provinces in Sumatra and three provinces in the Indonesian part of Borneo, compared to 1,092 hotspots detected in mid-August.\nThe forest fires have caused several Indonesian\xa0cities to be blanketed by thick smog. Neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia were not spared either.\nThe haze has even caused a diplomatic spat between Malaysia and Indonesia after Malaysia\xa0lodged an official complaint last week.\nIn response, Indonesia insisted that no haze from the country had travelled beyond its border, saying that the smog affecting Malaysia could have originated from Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia.\nMdm Siti Nurbaya Bakar, Indonesia\'s Environmental Affairs and Forestry Minister,\xa0went even further as saying that some of the palm oil companies believed to have been responsible for the forest fires in Indonesia were subsidiaries of Malaysian groups.\nThe government has sealed off plantations operated by at least 30 companies, where fires had been spotted, and brought criminal charges against four.\nAIR QUALITY WORSENS\nOn Friday afternoon, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore topped the list of major cities with the worst air quality according to Swiss-based group AirVisual.\nThe Air Quality Index (AQI) in Kuala Lumpur reached a “very unhealthy” level of 286 at one monitoring station while two others recorded an “unhealthy” level of 159 and 154.\nIn Singapore, the AQI ranged between 156 and 160. AQI\xa0measures the concentration of six major pollutants in the air.\xa0\nMeanwhile, in Indonesia, the air quality\xa0in Pekanbaru, Riau was far worse. It is not listed on\xa0AirVisual because it is not considered a major city.\xa0\nOne monitoring station in the city recorded an AQI of 580 on Friday afternoon, a level which is considered “hazardous”, meaning that the air is deemed toxic and poses serious risk to the heart and lungs.\nThe haze was so thick in the city that visibility dropped to as low as 300 metres.\nFor more than a week, schools in most of Riau province were closed while residents were told to stay indoors.\nThe neighbouring province of Jambi, where air quality in one area reached a hazardous level of 347, also took similar measures.\n“We are facing a haze emergency. Today is the worst day in the two months since fire rages across Riau,” Pekanbaru-based environmental activist Mr Rawa El Amady told CNA on Friday.\n“The air quality has reached a hazardous level. Even animals are at risk of lung infection, let alone humans. Government officials in their air-conditioned offices must do more so citizens can breathe fresh air.”\nMr Tauhid Ahmad, executive director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Development of Economic and Finance (INDEF) told CNN Indonesia that\xa0the forest fires have also taken its toll on the Indonesian economy.\n“The industry is suffering because transportation of goods is hampered. The aviation sector is also affected because aeroplanes couldn’t land in several airports with low visibility,” Mr Ahmad was quoted as saying.\n“Tourism is also affected while businesses will see a decline in productivity because people cannot go out and perform their usual activities. Then, there is the cost of treating people for their health problems.”\n""WE ARE DOING OUR BEST""\nThis year’s forest fires are the worst since the 2015 haze crisis, when smog from forest fires in Indonesia reached as far as Hanoi and Phnom Penh.\nScientists had estimated that the 2015 fires\xa0released CO2 emissions comparable to Japan or India\'s annual fossil fuel emissions, exposed more than 69 million people to unhealthy air, and cost more than US$16 billion in damages.\nThat year, 19 people died and an estimated 500,000 cases of respiratory tract infections were reported.\nIndonesian Environment and Forestry Ministry spokesman Djati Witjaksono told CNA that the government is committed not to let the forest fires reach\xa0the same level as 2015.\nMr Witjaksono blamed the worrying situation\xa0on the El Nino weather phenomenon, which also hit the region four years ago.\n“If it weren’t for El Nino it wouldn’t be this bad. Although the phenomenon was milder than that in 2015, it has triggered a prolonged drought. Some areas have not seen rain for months. That’s why the trees are drier than normal and the fires more widespread compared to the last two or three years before,” he told CNA.\nThe same phenomenon has also been blamed for the uncontrollable fires in the Brazilian Amazon recently as well as fires in California and China.\n“The government\xa0has intensified joint patrols with police and military personnel in areas deemed prone to wildfires. We also ramped up measures to extinguish fires,” Mr Witjaksono\xa0said.\n“We are doing our best to prevent and extinguish the fires.”\nThe military, police, disaster mitigation agency and the forestry ministry have deployed a total of 23,000 personnel to\xa0six provinces with the most number of hotspots.\nThe disaster mitigation agency also deployed 34 water-bombing helicopters to help extinguish the fires from above while waiting for the rainy season, which scientists predict would not start until some time next month.\nSLASH-AND-BURN IS THE REAL CULPRIT\nHowever, a scientist pointed out that the real cause of forest fires is the slash-and-burn techniques employed by plantation workers and owners.\xa0\n""El Nino only exacerbated\xa0the fire,"" said Mr Henry Purnomo from the Centre for International Forestry Research.\nSlash-and-burn is preferred\xa0as it is the\xa0cheapest and fastest way to clear land, he said.\xa0\n“Clearing land using slash-and-burn techniques only costs US$20 per hectare while other methods can cost more than US$400 per hectare. The risk of fire spreading is very high but there is a strong economic incentive to use this method.”\nDisaster Mitigation Agency chief Doni Monardo backed the scientist’s assessment.\n“We went on a helicopter ride recently and we can see that most of the lands on fire bordered plantations,” he said in a statement.\nPolice in Riau recently arrested nine people in different parts of the province for burning forests to clear land.\xa0\nThe Indonesian Forum for the Environment (WALHI) said the government must name all of the companies whose concessions are on fire.\n“It is important for the public to know which companies may be responsible for the fires so people can make informed choices when purchasing palm oil products,” WALHI researcher Mr Wahyu Perdana told CNA.\xa0\n“Slash-and-burn is cheap. If you name and shame them, there is an incentive for companies to stop employing the practice.”\nForestry ministry spokesman Mr Witjaksono however said the government cannot divulge any names before they have collected enough evidence to launch a formal lawsuit.\nThe\xa0minister, Mdm Siti Nurbaya, meanwhile, said at least four palm oil companies whose land had been sealed off were subsidiaries of Malaysian groups.\xa0\nAccording to Reuters, she identified the four as\xa0West Kalimantan-based Sime Indo Agro – a unit of Sime Darby Plantation, Sukses Karya Sawit – a unit of IOI Corporation, Rafi Kamajaya Abadi – a unit of TDM Bhd and Riau-based Adei Plantation and Industry – a unit of Kuala Lumpur Kepong Group.\nA spokeswoman for Sime Darby’s Indonesian operation Minamas Plantation told Reuters that the company was not aware its plantation had been sealed off and was monitoring for hotspots.\nSime Darby and IOI both said they were checking their Indonesian operations.\nSukses Karya Sawit, Rafi Kamajaya Abadi and Adei Plantation and Industry could not immediately be contacted.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ', '     Malaysia ']}"

      Air conditioning for all? Hotter world faces risk of 'cooling poverty'
  </h1>, 'text': 'OXFORD:\xa0As climate change brings more frequent and extreme heatwaves around the world, demand for air conditioners is soaring, with 10 new units sold every second on average - but the poor may be left to swelter, said a University of Oxford researcher.\nBy 2050, energy use for cooling is projected to triple, while in hot countries like India, China, Brazil and Indonesia, it is expected to grow five-fold, the World Bank has said.\n""By the end of the century, global energy demand for cooling will be more than it is for heating,” said Radhika Khosla, who leads an Oxford Martin School programme on future cooling.\nBut not everyone will be able to afford to beat the heat.\n“Traditionally, energy poverty has been defined as people not having heating. Now that is potentially going to shift, and we could have cooling poverty,” Khosla warned on the sidelines of a conference on efforts to slash planet-warming emissions.\nRising heat is having a huge impact on health – deaths and hospital admissions jump in heatwaves – but also on productivity as workers struggle to cope, climate scientists say.\nA 2018 report from Sustainable Energy for All, a UN-backed organisation, said more than 1.1 billion people globally faced immediate risks from lack of access to cooling.\nOn a warming planet, cooling is not a luxury but ""essential for everyday life"", said the organisation\'s CEO Rachel Kyte.\nBut because air conditioners use 20 times as much power as running a fan, their growing popularity could fuel demand for fossil fuel-based electricity that exacerbates climate change.\nRather than relying entirely on air conditioning, buildings should be designed so they are easier to keep cool, which is still rare, said Khosla, who also directs research at the Oxford India Centre for Sustainable Development.\nHer modern apartment has windows that open just a few inches, making it hard to keep cool on hot days, she said.\n“Net zero” buildings – designed partly to stay cool without heavy use of air conditioning – are popping up around the world, from Southeast Asia to the United States and Europe, but remain the exception, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nKhosla, who has herself lived in a range of hot cities from New Delhi to Chicago, predicted that in the future, housing that cannot be kept cool or have air conditioning installed could see a drop in value, even in relatively cool places such as Britain.\nNEW TECHNOLOGY\nIn some developing nations with rising incomes, buying an air conditioner is also a status symbol, which could make any push for lower-energy alternatives challenging, she said.\nMaking less power-hungry, affordable air conditioners will be crucial, Khosla believes.\nMost machines for sale now – the majority built in China – are half as energy-efficient as they could be, she said.\nBut researchers are working on more efficient cooling technologies that could hit the market in as little as two years, Khosla said.\nJudges are now looking at entries for a US$3 million global cooling prize, launched by the Colorado-based Rocky Mountain Institute, aimed at developing an affordable window air conditioning unit that is at least five times more efficient than current models.\nAmory Lovins, co-founder of the institute, said designing cheaper, greener air conditioning was ""extremely important"".\nGetting manufacturers to ramp up production fast - partly by putting in place policies that require greater energy efficiency - will also be key, Khosla said.\nGreener cooling is ""one of the levers we have left"" to hold the line on climate change, and using less energy for cooling would help avert power blackouts in cities on sizzling days, she said.\nCities face an ""awful feedback loop"" as air conditioners churn out hot exhaust, boosting temperatures further, she said.\nAll these risks mean smarter cooling must be figured out quickly, before the world gets even hotter and more families rush to appliance shops, she said.\n“It’s a future we can’t afford to get wrong,” she warned.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     energy ', '     environment ', '     weather ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS: Nations rich and poor must invest now to protect against the effects of climate change or pay an even heavier price later, a global commission warned on Tuesday (Sep 10).\nSpending US$1.8 trillion across five key areas over the next decade would not only help buffer the worst impacts of global warming but could generate more than US$7 trillion in net benefits, the report from the Global Commission on Adaptation argued.\n""We are the last generation that can change the course of climate change, and we are the first generation that then has to live with the consequences,"" former UN chief Ban Ki-moon, who chairs the commission, said at the report\'s launch in Beijing.\n""Delay and pay, or plan and prosper,"" he said, sharing a catchphrase from the commission, which is co-chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva.\nInvesting now in early warning systems, climate-resistant infrastructure, mangrove protection, better agriculture and improving fresh water resources would pay for itself several times over, the report said.\nMangroves -\xa0tropical tidal water forests -\xa0protect, for example, against storm surges and act as nurseries for commercial fisheries, but at least a third of them globally have been uprooted for tourism or aquaculture.\n""Global actions to slow climate change are promising but insufficient,"" the report stated. ""We must invest in a massive effort to adapt to conditions that are now inevitable.""\nWithout action by 2030, climate change could push more than 100 million people in developing countries below the poverty line, said the report.\nAt the launch, Chinese environment minister Li Ganjie -\xa0whose country is the world\'s top carbon polluter - called adaptation practices ""an inherent requirement of China\'s sustainable development"".\nIn the 25-year history of UN climate negotiations, adaptation has trailed far down the agenda compared with ""mitigation"", or the reduction of carbon emissions.\nIt was long seen as an issue only affecting poor and developing nations.\nBut recent massive inland flooding and a string of record-breaking hurricanes in the United States, along with ferocious heatwaves in Europe and Japan, have shown that wealth is not an adequate shield.\nDominic Molloy, a co-author of the report from Britain\'s Department for International Development, said a new focus on adapting should not detract from the need to slash carbon pollution.\n""We absolutely need to do both, reduce emissions and adapt,"" Molloy told AFP. ""The purpose of this commission was to raise the visibility of adaptation, not shift away from mitigation.""\nCOST OF FAILURE\nFailure to curb the greenhouse gas emissions slow-roasting the planet has already unleashed a crescendo of deadly heat waves, water shortages and superstorms made more destructive by rising seas.\nThe Bahamas was devastated this month by one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record.\nEarth\'s average surface temperature has gone up 1 degree C since the late 19th century, and is on track - at current rates of CO2 emissions - to warm another two or three degrees by the century\'s end.\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement calls for capping global warming at ""well below"" 2 degrees C, and 1.5 degrees C if possible, but it was given a hit when US President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2017.\n""I sincerely hope that President Trump will return to Paris climate agreement and do something good for humanity,"" Ban said.\nThe report\'s US$1.8 trillion adaptation price tag for the period 2020-2030 is not an estimate of global needs, covering only warning systems and the four other areas identified.\nThe US$7.1 trillion dividend is based on the World Bank calculation that the value of damage caused by climate change is increasing, averaged across the globe, at about 1.5 per cent per year.\nPatrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the centre that commissioned the report, described the proposal as a ""global Marshall Plan"" -\xa0the US aid programme that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II.\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     environment ']}"

      Biodegradable plastic alternatives not necessarily better for Singapore, say experts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: You might think that switching from single-use plastics to biodegradable plastic alternatives is good for the environment but in Singapore, there are “no effective differences”, experts said.\nThey\xa0often end up in the same place - the incinerator, said Associate Professor Tong Yen Wah from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\xa0\nBiodegradable plastic wastes make a difference to the\xa0environment only when they are buried in\xa0landfills, he added.\n“In these situations, these plastic bags can degrade faster as compared to a regular polyethylene plastic bag and will not affect the environment as much. Overall for Singapore, it might even be more expensive to incinerate biodegradable plastics,"" said Assoc Prof Tong. He explained that this is because some biodegradable options take more resources to produce, which make them more expensive.\xa0\nThe opinion\xa0squares with what Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources\xa0said in Parliament in August - that a\xa0life-cycle assessment of single-use carrier bags and disposables by the National Environment Agency (NEA) found that substituting plastics with other types of single-use packaging materials is “not necessarily better for the environment”.\n""In Singapore, waste is incinerated and not left in landfills to degrade. This means that the resource requirements of oxo-degradable bags are similar to that of plastic bags, and they also have similar environmental impact when incinerated.\xa0\n""In addition, oxo-degradable bags could interfere with the recycling process when mixed with conventional plastics,"" said the NEA study.\xa0\nOxo-degradable plastics quickly fragment into smaller and smaller pieces, called microplastics, but don’t break down at the molecular or polymer level like biodegradable and compostable plastics.\nThe resulting microplastics are left in the environment indefinitely until they eventually fully break down.\nThe European Union (EU) has in fact decided in March to ban items made of\xa0oxo-degradable plastic alongside a\xa0ban on single-use plastics.\nIn making the decision, the EU said\xa0oxo-degradable plastic ""does not properly biodegrade and thus contributes to microplastic pollution in the environment"".\nThe measures will take effect in 2021.\nSTILL KEEN ON ALTERNATIVES\nAlthough biodegradable alternatives may not make a difference to the environment, several companies here have already made the switch.\nA BreadTalk Group spokesman told CNA that\xa078 per cent of plastic bags used by the group’s bakery division is biodegradable.\nThe takeaway boxes used at Food Republic outlets and the cups used at Toast Box outlets are also biodegradable, he said.\xa0\n“As a key player in the F&B business, BreadTalk Group remains highly committed to gradually increase our biodegradable packaging options for consumers. However, we are also conscious of the reality that certain local cuisines will still require plastic lids for easy handling.”\nSimilarly, caterer Neo Group has implemented biodegradable cornware utensils since 2010.\xa0\n“The cost of changing our disposable ware to biodegradable cornware was higher, but we believe in doing our part to save the Earth, which is why our founder initiated the move to implement the change nine years ago,” said a Neo Group spokesman.\xa0\nThe spokesman added that Neo Group’s company-wide long-term goal is to go paperless and reduce the use of plastic by 30 per cent in its day-to-day operations.\nBIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC PRODUCTS = LARGER CARBON FOOTPRINT?\nDespite the belief that they are better for the environment, experts said a larger carbon footprint could be created in producing them.\n""Some biodegradable plastics may require more resources to produce and that would inevitably incur a higher carbon footprint,"" said Mr Liow Chean Siang, head of environmental certifications at the Singapore Environment Council.\xa0\nHe added: ""Consumers may have less guilt in using such bags but ultimately this could have little impact on reducing carbon footprint or greenhouse gas emissions.""\nMany biodegradable materials can only break down under specific circumstances, many of which cannot be provided by natural environments, said general manager of Zero Waste SG Pek Hai Lin.\nAccording to Ms Pek, the carbon footprint for cornware is high compared to regular plastic, and based on the NEA study, it is not clear whether it can be recycled.\xa0\n“Furthermore, cornware is made from corn starch extracted from kernels, which makes one wonder if the same resource could have been used for food instead of convenience,” she added.\xa0\nDr Alexander Jackson, a plastic scientist from A*STAR, thinks companies are rushing to find alternatives to single-use plastics without fully considering the complete environmental impact.\xa0\n“The producers themselves would be the best people to ask, do they know how truly environmentally friendly these products are?”\nBOLDER STEPS NEEDED\nBy 2020, businesses will have to report the type and amount of packaging they put into the market to the NEA, and outline their plans for reducing it. This applies to brand owners, manufacturers, importers of packaging and packaged goods, as well as supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than S$10 million.\xa0\nAn extended producer responsibility framework for packaging waste will also be launched by 2025, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) announced on Friday (Aug 30).\xa0\nAssistant Professor Marvin Montefrio who lectures on environmental studies at Yale-NUS believes that there are still merits in the shift towards biodegradable alternatives.\nHe said: “I imagine Singapore to be a significant market for the plastics industry, just seeing how pervasive single-use plastics are in the retail sector.\xa0\n“If the demand changes or if there are regulations that control the use of non-biodegradable single-use plastics in Singapore and elsewhere, imagine how this could potentially influence the single-use plastics and packaging sector.”\nBut it could be challenging to completely eradicate single-use plastics because they are still necessary in some situations, such as in food packaging or for medical purposes.\xa0\n“We do need to admit though, that in many other cases they are completely unnecessary, as all they do is just make our lives a little more convenient,” said Asst Prof\xa0Montefrio.\xa0\n“So at some point we do need to make bolder steps beyond just making all single-use plastics biodegradable.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

""They used to throw paper and clothing,"" the 53-year-old said, adding that mental health issues could be a factor.\nTHE PROBLEM OF HIGH-RISE LITTERING\nNational University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser told CNA\xa0a ""large proportion"" of people occasionally litter because of convenience and the perception that they would likely not\xa0be detected.\xa0\n""There is, however, a small minority who are habitual litterbugs. I believe they are self-centered, lacking in empathy or sensitivity towards others, and generally lacking in mindfulness of their surroundings,"" he said.\n""Some habitual litterbugs may have mental problems and are unable to understand the consequences of their action for others.""\nUsed sanitary pads are ""very unhygienic"", Public Hygiene Council chairman Edward D\'Silva told CNA, stating that they can contaminate surfaces and spread diseases to people.\nTo combat the problem, the experts suggested a combination of education and enforcement.\nPublic education could include short and catchy segments\xa0on television, as well as door-to-door engagement by grassroots leaders.\xa0""The message can also be regularly communicated at block parties and other community events,"" Mr D\'Silva said.\nAs for enforcement, Dr Tan said\xa0""soft"" approaches could include bringing offenders to\xa0dirty estates and asking them to share their thoughts.\nHowever, ""clearly irresponsible and reckless"" offenders should be ""punished to the maximum extent\xa0of the law"", Mr D\'Silva said.\n""This would include fines, conscription to do the work of cleaners through Corrective Work Orders\xa0or even imprisonment, in the case that the object thrown causes death,"" he added.\nIn August, a 47-year-old man was charged with causing death by a rash act after he\xa0threw a wine bottle from the seventh floor of a condo in Outram.

      Germany plans to ban single-use plastic shopping bags next year
  </h1>, 'text': 'BERLIN:\xa0Germany plans to ban single-use plastic bags from next year, joining a growing movement to fight global pollution, the environment minister said Friday (Sep 6).\xa0\nSupermarkets and other retailers will be barred from offering lightweight plastic carrier bags at their checkouts, including those now marketed as being biodegradable or being made from renewable sources instead of petroleum.\n""The vast majority of Germans want this ban,"" said Environment Minister Svenja Schulze of the centre-left Social Democrats, introducing the initiative that she hopes to soon turn into law.\nBreaches of the ban, set to take effect in the first half of next year, would threaten businesses with fines of up to 100,000 euros (US$110,000), according to a report by Bild newspaper.\nPlastic pollution, especially in waterways and oceans, is a major ecological hazard as it injures or kills marine and birdlife, fouls beaches and creates giant floating garbage patches in oceans.\nScientists warn that, as plastic slowly breaks down, the micro-particles enter food chains and end up in humans, with studies showing toxic traces in the waste of people in Europe and Asia.\nGermany\'s planned move follows the 2016 introduction of a voluntary commitment by the retail industry to no longer give plastic bags away for free.\nThis helped drive a decline in use from 68 plastic bags per capita then to 24 last year, said the ministry.\nThis is already better than the EU\'s target of 40 bags per person per year by 2025.\nMany retailers have already phased out plastic bags altogether as consumers have learnt to bring their own sturdy multi-use bags or nets when they go shopping.\nThe trade association HDE immediately criticised the planned ban, with its managing director Stefan Genth slamming it as ""a clear breach of trust"" by the government.\nEnvironmental groups, meanwhile, argued the prohibition doesn\'t go far enough and demanded state surcharges on all disposable bags.\nThis should also cover paper bags, which degrade faster but still use up vast resources and energy in their production, green activists say.\nThe planned ban in 2020 does not cover the very thin tear-off plastic bags commonly found at supermarket fruit and vegetable counters.\nThe fear is that banning them would lead growers to pre-package fruits and greens in bulk in plastic, which could ultimately lead to more food wastage, the ministry said.\nUnder Germany\'s planned law, a six-months transition period would allow retailers to reduce their remaining stocks before the prohibition takes effect.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      Pandan Reservoir midge infestation: 'You can say that we’ve given up'
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For the past month, stallowners at Makan Shiokz coffee shop on the ground floor of Block 49 Teban Gardens have had to watch their regular customers turn around and go home after seeing the swarms of midges plaguing the block.\xa0\n“At around 6 or 7pm, I see them walk here to buy food, and after they see the midges, they u-turn and go home,” said the coffee shop manager, who only wanted to be known as Zai.\xa0\n“They don’t even want to come here and take away food. It\'s\xa0so sad. We couldn’t even do anything,” he added. \xa0\nLocated adjacent to Pandan Reservoir, the coffee shop has seen a 40 per cent dip in business over the past month, said Zai.\xa0\nHe told CNA that the stallowners have grown so frustrated at the swarms of midges that they decided to take the problem into their own hands.\xa0\n“First we tried electric racquets. Then we bought electrical insect traps. Then we tried glue boxes. Then these weren’t working, so we bought small fogging machines to try fogging ourselves, and now we’ve put up this net.\n“Every night in August, we even used a paint brush to brush the net and the columns with oil, because it is sticky and the midges get stuck.”\xa0\n“The problem with (the coffee shop) being here, is because we are located at an angle and there is no HDB blocking us, the wind blows all the midges towards (the coffee shop),” said Zai.\xa0\n“Whenever they do the fogging, it works for the reservoir, but then the midges come to us. You can see them sticking to the second and third floors also.”\xa0\nHe added: “We did email PUB asking if there’s any possibility for us to get compensation, because (the reservoir) belongs to them. But they emailed back and said no way of compensation.” According to Zai, PUB informed residents that the problem is predicted to persist until October.\xa0\n“The insects really fly into your food. It makes me uncomfortable,” said housewife and regular customer Ms Normah Johan, 53.\xa0\nMs Normah stopped eating at Makan Shiokz for about\xa0a month, but\xa0recently started going to the coffee shop again\xa0as she observed that there has been a reduction in the swarms of\xa0midges.\xa0\nHer husband, Mr Aziz Biat, drives a lorry for work every day, and has to wash it more often because the midges stick to the vehicle after he drives around the area.\xa0\n“When it was hot in August, there were really a lot of insects flying around. Now it is a bit better,” said the 61-year-old. “Actually this is not so bad, it is just irritating. At least it is not mosquitoes, that actually can be dangerous.”\xa0\nThe couple has lived at Block 24 Teban Gardens for over 20 years. While their home has yet to be invaded by midges because their block is located further away from the reservoir, the family closes all their windows and sprays insect repellent before going to bed.\xa0\nWhen CNA visited Teban Gardens between 4.30pm and 7pm on Thursday afternoon (Sep 5), midges were swarming above drains in large numbers, and dead midges had accumulated in crevices on walls and pillars, appearing to be dirt or dust at first glance. Standing still resulted in\xa0midges swarming around and getting into one\'s eyes, mouth, nose and hair.\xa0\nAt about 4.30pm, Block 31 and Blk 33 Teban Gardens, which directly face the reservoir, were washed down with water jets. And at about 6pm, PUB officers carried out fogging around the reservoir, as well as drains surrounding the blocks next to the reservoir.\xa0\nPUB said in a Facebook post on Aug 1 that it has increased the frequency of fogging and misting around the reservoir dyke and surrounding vegetation, frequency and dosage of biological liquid larvicide within the reservoir, as well as the installation of bright spotlights at the Pandan Reservoir pumping station to attract adult midges when they emerge at night.\nAccording to PUB, the bright lights deter them from flying into residential estates. Midge egg masses attached to floating structures and rocks along the edges of the reservoir have also been removed.\xa0\nResidents and passersby were spotted wearing masks, swatting the insects away and avoiding drainage areas where huge swarms of midges were gathering.\xa0\nMr Lim Thiam Chye, who works in a provision shop in the industrial area near Pandan Reservoir, has worn a mask and a cap to work every day since the midge\xa0emergence began in July, to prevent the insects from flying into his eyes, nose and mouth.\xa0\n“It rained the other day, and the midges disappeared for a while. A few days later, they were back and there was even more of them,” said the 57-year-old in Mandarin.\xa0\n“I don’t think the fogging has helped. The number of midges hasn’t decreased at all, and the wind is so strong, it just blows them back to the HDB area,” he added. \xa0\nAfter the fogging on Thursday ended, CNA observed swarms of midges returning to the drains and the surroundings just 15 to 20 minutes later.\xa0\nResident Xavier Lopez, who has lived at Block 40 Teban Gardens for over 40 years, said the midges emergence happens most years.\xa0\n“But this is the first time it is like that. It’s been going on for more than a month, last time is at most one week. It’s probably the most insects I’ve seen,” he added.\xa0\nMr Lopez said he closes all his windows at home, but this does not prevent midges from flying through the bathroom windows. He told CNA that dead midges accumulate on the floor, walls and mirrors, and he washes the toilet every day. He also does not turn on any lights, even at night.\xa0\nStudent Zena Seah and her family have adopted similar habits, choosing to leave all windows closed at all times. They also avoid turning on the lights, as they have observed that midges swarm around their bright kitchen lights.\xa0\nZena, who stays in Block 25 Teban Gardens, said she encounters swarms of midges in the lift when she leaves and returns from school. “I don’t even dare to open my mouth,” she said.\nWhen she eats at the nearby hawker centres, she has also noticed midges landing on tables and chairs.\n“There was once I went to the hawker centre to get food, and I saw a table full of black marks. Then the cleaning aunty wiped the table, and I realised it was all dead midges,” she added. \xa0\nBut Zena said that while the midges are a nuisance, they have not affected her family’s daily routines. “We don’t really care. Even if we see them, they’ll die in one to two days anyway.”\xa0\nThe current dominant midge species that has recently emerged at Pandan Reservoir is a rare one that has not been studied in great detail, said Minister for Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli in Parliament on Monday.\xa0\nThe species exhibits different behaviours from other species, like hiding in drains and culverts in the day and swarm above the drains in the evening, he added.\nPUB has greased drain walls to trap midges when they land to rest, and have targeted these areas for fogging, he said. It has also explored the use of free-moving oily paper within drains to increase the capture rates of adult midges.\xa0\nThe netting on the reservoir dyke has also been extended by 1km, said Mr Masagos, acting as a barrier to trap adult midges and reduces the number of adult midges that would otherwise be blown to residential estates.\nSpeaking in Parliament on Monday, MP for West Coast GRC Foo Mee Har said residents who live near Pandan Reservoir have “suffered greatly” from the mass emergence of midges since July this year.\n""This year’s outbreak is the most severe we have witnessed yet and also persisted for the longest time, impacting the daily lives of our residents. Some have likened it to being in a horror movie. If you visited it\'s really scary,"" she added.\xa0\nAs for Zai, returning home is not an escape from the midges at work. The 46-year-old lives in a unit in the same block.\xa0\nHe spends his free time looking on the Internet for solutions that might work against the midges, but has not found any other options yet. “I do not know what to do anymore. Seriously, I do not know what to do anymore,” he said.\xa0\nHe added that while he, along with other stallowners, used to paint the insect net and columns with oil by hand every night, they have since stopped doing so.\xa0\n“You can say that we’ve given up. There are just too many.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     PUB ']}"

      MPs question Government’s stand on single-use plastics as Parliament passes new sustainability Bill
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The issue of\xa0single-use plastics was discussed in Parliament on Wednesday (Sep 4), with some Members of Parliament (MP) reiterating a call for plastic bag\xa0charges.\xa0\nThis came as MPs debated the Resource Sustainability Bill, which was passed on Wednesday.\xa0\nThe Bill introduces regulations to reduce food, packaging and electronic waste, as Singapore’s only landfill at Pulau Semakau is expected to run out of space by 2035.\nIt will be mandatory for large food waste generators to segregate and treat their food waste by 2021.\nProducers of regulated electrical and electronic products will\xa0be responsible for collecting and recycling\xa0e-waste like mobile phones, computers and large appliances through an extended ""producer responsibility"" framework that will be launched by 2021.\nA similar framework for packaging waste will also be introduced. Companies that use packaging, like importers and supermarkets, will be required to submit an annual report on the amount of packaging in their products and their packaging waste reduction plans from 2021.\nMPs lauded the Bill as a step in the right direction, but some felt that more could be done to tackle the excessive use of single-use plastics.\nCALLS FOR PLASTIC BAG CHARGE\nNee Soon GRC MP Lee Bee Wah reiterated the call for a plastic bag charge, pointing out that while the regulations mainly target businesses, individual actions would also make a difference.\n“The impact may be insignificant, but I strongly believe that such gestures will make people more conscious of what they do, how many plastic bags they need and such consciousness will have knock-on effects on their daily life and consumption patterns,” she said.\n“Certainly, we must stop consuming more than what we need.”\nWorkers’ Party Non-Constituency MP Daniel Goh agreed that charging for single-use plastics could change mindsets on reducing waste.\xa0\nFor instance, he pointed to how some cities have made it mandatory\xa0for households to buy and only use government-certified garbage bags to dispose of trash, nudging people to think less of convenience and more of its cost, leading to overall reduction in the use of plastic bags.\n“It has tremendous educational value that will nudge Singaporeans to change their whole approach to consumption and disposal of waste,” he said, describing single-use plastics as the “epitome of convenience”.\n“When we tackle single-use plastics, we are not just tackling the plastic. We are challenging the idea of convenience and undermining its importance.”\nAssociate Professor Goh added\xa0that a “true circular economy” cannot have convenience guiding behaviour.\n“This is why I think the Government is mistaken in its reluctance to tackle single-use plastics as such, despite the strong public calls to do it,” he stated. “We don’t have to ban plastic bags to (challenge convenience). We need to nudge smartly.”\nAnother reason why single-use plastics are\xa0popular is because it is cheaper than other packaging alternatives, Nominated MP Walter Theseira said, causing manufacturers and businesses to favour them.\n“Members of this House will remember when soft drinks were sold in glass bottles. When you finish your drink, the stall owner would collect back the glass bottle and it would be washed and refilled at the factory,"" he said.\n""This practice has ceased because the costs of reuse became too high, compared to the cost of providing single-use plastic or even glass bottles.\n“It is really a problem of prices. The goods that we consume,\xa0from consumer appliances to bottled drinks to food,\xa0have no price attached to reflect the problems their disposal will create.”\xa0\nMAJORITY PREFER EDUCATIONAL APPROACH\nA recent survey by government feedback unit REACH showed that just 9 per cent of Singaporeans wanted a ban on disposable plastic bags, while another 21 per cent opted for a charge.\nThe remainder preferred public education to reduce usage, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said in her round-up speech of the debate.\nDr Khor said that Singapore’s approach to single-use plastics should account for “our unique, urbanised, high-rise living context”.\xa0\n“Most of the plastic bags that Singaporeans bring home from the shops and supermarkets are not ‘single-use’. We reuse them for other purposes, such as carrying wet items, before eventually using them to bag waste for disposal,” she reiterated.\n“This has become a way of life for Singaporeans and ensured that our waste disposal is clean and hygienic.”\nNevertheless, Dr Khor said a citizen’s workgroup will be set up to tackle excessive consumption of single-use plastics in Singapore, even as she applauded a move by NTUC FairPrice to charge for plastic bags at seven outlets in a month-long trial starting Sep 16.\nDr Khor urged people to support the trial and encouraged major supermarket companies like Dairy Farm - which runs Cold Storage supermarkets -\xa0Sheng Siong and Prime “to do their part”, as the insights could inform recommendations made by the workgroup.\nA ""SINGLE STAND"" ON PLASTIC BAG CHARGES\nBut raising\xa0a clarification to Dr Khor’s speech, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked the Government for a “single stand” on whether it supports a plastic bag charge.\n“We just said that we support NTUC FairPrice for introducing the plastic bag charge, but at the same time we keep giving reasons why it is not going to work,” he said.\nMr Ng raised the example of the United Kingdom, which saw an 80 per cent decline in the use of plastic bags after it introduced a plastic bag charge.\n“They also use plastic bags to bag their trash, so it’s similar to Singapore,” he added. “I don’t think we can keep using that argument.”\xa0\nDr Khor responded\xa0that Singaporeans have differing views on the issue of single-use plastics and whether to charge for plastic bags.\xa0\n“I have also given you in detail the various reasons why our context is unique. So, it is not an excuse that you don’t want to charge for plastic bags because people are using it. These are views from the ground,” she stressed.\n“We are equally concerned, so we want to form this workgroup, bringing people from diverse backgrounds and views together. Let us work together and come to an inclusive solution on the way forward.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     sustainability ', '     climate change ']}"

      Cross Island Line environmental impact on nature reserve can be 'adequately managed': LTA study
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The environmental impact of both proposed routes for the Cross Island Line (CRL) near the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) can be “adequately managed” with “comprehensive” mitigation and monitoring plans, a study commissioned by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has found.\nThe direct route involves building a 2km tunnel about 70m deep under the CCNR, worrying green groups who want Singapore’s wildlife and nature preserved.\nThe other route is a 9km stretch going around the reserve and under homes and businesses, increasing end-to-end travel time by about four minutes. This option adds an estimated S$2 billion in costs, and the Government said it may also need to acquire land.\nBoth routes will not involve surface works in the nature reserve. The direct route will have two worksites outside the CCNR, while the skirting route will have three worksites outside the CCNR, one of which will be located next to a residential estate on Upper Thomson Road. The worksites will be converted to permanent facility buildings for the CRL.\nLTA said in a statement on Monday (Sep 2) that the expected environmental impact of both routes is “largely confined” to parts of the tunnel and construction worksites outside the CCNR, adding that this can be managed by “robust” mitigation measures, citing the study.\n“This can be achieved through locating the worksites as far as possible from the CCNR and the implementation of a comprehensive Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan (EMMP) to protect flora and fauna,” it stated.\n“This EMMP will also help to mitigate any disamenities to nearby residents.”\nAn independent panel of international advisers, comprising industry experts in tunnelling and underground construction, has also reviewed engineering schemes for both routes and concluded that tunnelling along both options is safe with control measures in place.\nThese findings are part of the second phase of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the underground stretch of the CRL near the CCNR. The first phase, completed in February 2016, had evaluated the environmental impact of site investigation works in the CCNR.\nHowever, LTA has not made a decision on the final route of the CRL.\n“In addition to the EIA findings, the Government will consider other factors, such as transport connectivity, travel times, costs and impact on home owners and commuters, when deciding on the final route of the CRL,” it added.\nLTA has not set a timeline on when it will make a decision on the final route. The public can give feedback on the report for one month, before LTA starts advanced engineering studies on one or both routes next year, a process that can take two years.\n“LTA will mitigate the environmental impact of the chosen alignment, and put in place a robust EMMP as laid out in the EIA report,” the agency said. “The EMMP will also be further assessed and strengthened as the project progresses.\nThe CRL, a roughly 50km fully underground MRT line with about 30 stations spanning Jurong to Changi, is expected to open in 2030. Commuters are expected to make at least 600,000 trips daily on the CRL, more than the existing North-East Line.\nIt will also connect existing radial MRT lines with almost half of its stations being interchange stations, and is part of a plan to almost double Singapore's rail network by 2030 and put eight out of 10 households within a 10-minute walk of a train station.\nIMPACT OF DIRECT ALIGNMENT\nFor the direct route, the impact to people during the construction phase includes an impact on nearby water resources and noise pollution to Windsor Park residents due to construction activities, the study found.\nThe study noted that this impact can be reduced to “negligible to minor” significance with mitigation measures like the diversion of water discharge points from the worksites to drains that are not connected to nearby streams, and the installation of visually compatible noise barriers.\nThe impact on plants and animals during the construction phase include the clearing of forest habitats and impact on\xa0a stream system within Windsor Nature Park due to sedimentation during construction, the study found.\nThe study noted that this impact can be reduced to “moderate” significance with mitigation measures like shepherding wildlife and erecting barriers\xa0during worksite clearance, and\xa0artificial crossing aids to reduce the impact of habitat separation.\nThe study added that the residual impact of vibration at the surface of the CCNR during tunelling works can be reduced to negligible through the monitoring, assessing and reviewing of vibration in advance of the works. This will allow the implementation of further mitigation measures to reduce vibration levels to below background levels.\nThe impact during the operation phase include an impact on\xa0surface water bodies due to an increase in surface runoff from the permanent facility buildings, and the potential risk of wildlife changing their behaviour and getting trapped in the buildings, the study found.\nThe study noted that this impact can be reduced to “moderate” significance with mitigating measures like the “sensitive design and location” of the buildings and proper removal of roosts found within their premises.\nAccording to the study, a “moderate” significance indicates “small effects” that are comparable to existing conditions and/or accepted standards.\nIMPACT OF SKIRTING ROUTE\nFor the skirting route, the impact on people during the construction phase will include increased dust around the worksites and increased noise levels during night-time works, the study found. High-rise residents near Upper Thomson Road will also have a view of the construction work.\nThe study noted that this impact can be reduced to “moderate” significance with mitigation measures like the installation of visually compatible noise barriers and advanced notification of tunnelling operations to affected residents.\nHowever, the study pointed out that the residual impact will remain of “major” significance for high-rise residents in\xa0three blocks overlooking one of the worksites.\nThe impact on plants and animals\xa0during the construction phase will include worksite clearance and construction works, the study found, adding that the ecological impact at one worksite is negligible due to its highly urbanised location.\nIt noted that\xa0this impact can be reduced to “moderate” significance with mitigation measures like shepherding wildlife and erecting barriers during worksite clearance and the enforcement of speed limits along access roads.\nThe impact during the operation phase would be similar to that in the direct route option, the study found, adding that the impact can be reduced to “moderate” significance with similar mitigation measures.\nNATURE GROUP “HAPPY” LTA COMMITTED TO MITIGATION MEASURES\nNature Society Singapore president Shawn Lum said he is “happy” that LTA is committed to implementing the proposed mitigation measures, adding that the agency had met members of the nature community over several “deep dive” sessions since June 2013.\n“We sought to highlight potential environmental impacts as accurately and objectively as possible, with everyone committed to ensuring that the diversity and ecological integrity of CCNR is not impaired,” he stated.\n“Finding a way to carry out vital infrastructure work without diminishing our precious natural heritage remains important common ground to all of us.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     transport ', '     environment ', '     Land Transport Authority ']}"

      PUB stepping up measures to tackle emergence of rare dominant midge species at Pandan Reservoir: Masagos
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The current dominant midge species that has recently emerged\xa0at Pandan Reservoir is a rare one that has not been studied in great detail, said Minister for Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli in Parliament on\xa0Monday (Sep 2).\xa0\n“The species exhibits different behaviours from other species. For example, they hide in drains and culverts in the day and swarm above the drains in the evening,” he added.\xa0\nThe minister was replying to\xa0parliamentary questions from MPs about the rise in the\xa0midge population\xa0at Pandan Reservoir and the measures being taken to address it.\xa0\nProviding details,\xa0he said PUB has greased drain walls to trap midges when they land to rest, and have targeted these areas for fogging.\xa0\nPUB has also explored the use of free-moving oily paper within drains to increase the capture rates of adult midges, he added.\xa0\nThe netting on the reservoir dyke has also been extended by 1km, said Mr Masagos, acting as a barrier to trap adult midges and reduces the number of adult midges that would otherwise be blown to residential estates.\xa0\n“Midges cannot be eradicated as they are part of the natural aquatic ecosystem, and will emerge to breed, especially when aided by favourable environmental conditions. Climate change will further complicate our efforts,” he added.\xa0\nPUB said in a Facebook post on Aug 1 that it has stepped up measures to control the rising midge population around Pandan Reservoir.\nThese include increasing the frequency and dosage of biological liquid larvicide\xa0within the reservoir, increasing the frequency of fogging and misting around the reservoir dyke and surrounding vegetation, as well as the installation of bright spotlights at the Pandan Reservoir pumping station to attract adult midges when they emerge at night, said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nAccording to PUB, the bright lights deter them from flying into residential estates. Midge egg masses attached to floating structures and rocks along the edges of the reservoir have also been\xa0removed.\xa0\nSpeaking in Parliament, MP for West Coast GRC Foo Mee Har said residents who live near Pandan Reservoir have “suffered greatly” from the mass emergence of midges since July this year.\xa0\n“Their homes have been invaded by the midges. Corridors, lifts and bus stops have been swarmed. And the midges stick to your clothes, your hair, fly around your eyes, get into your nose, get into your food, and they’re everywhere.\xa0\n“This year’s outbreak is the most severe we have witnessed yet and also\xa0persisted for the longest time, impacting the daily lives of our residents. Some have likened it to being in a horror movie. If you visited it\'s really scary.”\nMs Foo raised concerns about the health risks of exposure to chemicals from sustained fogging, and whether residents could be supported with insect screens for their homes as such installations can be costly.\xa0\nMr Masagos said the pesticide used by PUB has been certified safe and suitable for use by the World Health Organization, and is also diluted before use.\nAs for the installation of insect screens, Mr Masagos noted that the residents can also protect themselves and their property.\xa0\n“This situation doesn’t come all the time, not every year. And to put in something that will become a permanent feature, this may also affect the image of the reservoir or the places around the reservoir,” he added.\xa0\nMr Masagos also explained that the larvicide used in the reservoirs is a safe, biological larvicide.\xa0\n“It is actually a naturally occurring soil bacteria, which produces spores that are toxic specifically to the digestive system of midge larvae.”\xa0\nUnderscoring the importance of maintaining water quality, he added: “There is a trade off between killing enough midges, or killing so much or everything that we kill ourselves. We can’t do that either. There is a limit to which these measures can mitigate the issues that residents are facing.\n“This problem is really man versus nature, the kind of war man has never been known to win. We can only suppress it and do our best but we have to live with nature. In fact, we are the ones who are intruding into their living spaces.\n""Our reservoirs supply drinking water to the population and we have to be careful to ensure that PUB’s mitigation measures, both short- and long-term, do not end up compromising water quality.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     PUB ', '     environment ']}"

It will be two months at the latest, most likely in November,” she said, according to Antara news agency.\nOn Monday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo announced that the capital would be moved from Jakarta in the crowded main island of Java to North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara districts in East Kalimantan.\nUnder the plan, government workers would be relocated to the new capital while the centre of business would remain in Jakarta. The government said the new capital would be a smart and green city.\nMdm Siti Nurbaya said on Wednesday that\xa0simultaneous restoration of the environment in these two districts would be part of the relocation.\nHer ministry was preparing a reference framework and strategic actions for Mr Widodo, the Presidential Secretariat Office and the National Development Planning Agency, she said.\nDespite the government’s promises, environmentalist have remained sceptical.\nGreenpeace Indonesia director Leonard Simanjuntak said developing a new city without prioritising environmental protection would risk creating the same problems plaguing Jakarta.\n“Jakarta’s air is polluted not only by a poorly planned transportation sector, but also from the many coal-fired power plants around Jakarta.\n“If Indonesia’s new capital also relies on coal power as Jakarta, then don’t expect the move to a new capital to bring a breath of fresh air,” he said in a statement.\nGreenpeace also noted that the proposed area is prone to forest fires. In Kutai Kartanegara district, there were 3,487 hotspots in the 2015 fire crisis, it added.\nJAKARTA TO TURN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS INTO PARKS\nSeparately, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said some of the government buildings vacated following the relocation could be transformed into green open spaces and preserved as heritage sites, Jakarta Globe reported.\n“Former office buildings could become strategically located parks. It would be great, but some of them could be repurposed as office buildings,” he said on Wednesday.\nThe State Palace, for instance, could be maintained as a historic site, he added.\nMr Baswedan said with the looming capital relocation, Jakarta would still have to continue to develop its economy, tourism and business.\xa0\n“(This is so) especially when Jakarta is going to be the global business gateway to Indonesia and its financial centre,” he said.\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     East Kalimantan ', '     environment ']}"

      New Indonesian capital offers opportunities for development, but environmental pitfalls abound
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: The announcement to relocate Indonesia\'s capital city to East Kalimantan\xa0province\xa0provides an opportunity to shift the developmental focus to other parts of the archipelago, but environmental pitfalls will need to be avoided, said experts and activists interviewed by CNA.\nEconomist Kresnayana Yahya from ITS University in Indonesia’s second-largest city Surabaya said the government\'s decision provides a good opportunity to develop Kalimantan and other parts of Indonesia.\xa0\nAt the same time, this will allow the government to shift the developmental focus\xa0away from Java, he said.\n“Economically, this will improve\xa0Kalimantan’s economy because it will be integrated with other islands. At the moment, the national economy is\xa065 per cent\xa0dominated by Java,” Mr Yahya noted.\nUrban planner Ahmad Gamal agreed, adding that\xa0there may be other positive outcomes.\n“If an official criticises the government services at the location where he or she lives, the parties involved will feel\xa0obligated to improve things,” said Mr\xa0Gamal, who is with the University of Indonesia.\nHe added\xa0that East Kalimantan\'s\xa0geological structure\xa0is more suitable for the construction of a new city as compared to Central Kalimantan, an\xa0alternative site\xa0dominated by swamps.\nJakarta is choked with air pollution, suffers from massive traffic congestion and is sinking up to 20cm yearly, one of the fastest rates in the world.\nThus, the government decided to move the current capital from megacity Jakarta which has a population of 10 million people to a less crowded area in the dense jungles of Borneo island, home to the critically endangered species orangutan.\nThe new capital, which the president announced on Monday (Aug 26), would be located partly in Penajam Paser Utara regency and partly in Kutai Kartanegara regency in mineral-rich East Kalimantan province. The government has said it would be a\xa0smart and\xa0green city.\xa0\n“We cannot continue to burden Jakarta and Java any more in terms of population density, congestion, pollution and water resources,” President Joko Widodo said during the televised announcement.\nHe named several reasons for choosing the area in East Kalimantan as the yet to be named new\xa0capital and seat of the central government.\nBoth regencies\xa0are not prone to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, forest fires, volcanic eruptions and landslides, unlike most parts of Indonesia.\nThe government also owns 180,000 hectares land in the area which is\xa0strategically located in the middle of the country, near major towns Balikpapan and Samarinda.\nUnder Mr Widodo’s plan, government workers would be relocated to the new capital while the centre of business would remain in Jakarta.\nThe move to relocate the\xa0capital has been in discussion since 1957 when Indonesia’s first president Soekarno proposed to move the Dutch colonial capital from Jakarta to Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan.\nSecond President Soeharto later planned to move it to Jonggol, West Java in 1997.\nENVIRONMENTALISTS SCEPTICAL\nDespite the government’s promise to protect the environment and East Kalimantan from becoming the next Jakarta, environmentalists are sceptical.\nMining Advocacy Network JATAM believed the capital’s relocation will only benefit concessionaires and land-owners at the expense of the environment.\nThere are currently 1,190 mining licenses issued in\xa0East Kalimantan and 625 in Kutai Kartanegara, according to JATAM’s data.\nAbout 13.83 million hectares of permits have been granted and 5.2 million of them are mining permits, the NGO claimed. \xa0\nKIARA, an NGO focusing on fishermen’s livelihood, noted that the capital’s relocation will affect the livelihoods\xa0of coastal communities that are dependent on marine and fishery\xa0resources in Balikpapan Bay.\nIt said more than 10,000 fishermen catch\xa0fish daily\xa0in Balikpapan Bay. Of this figure, 6,426 are from\xa0Kutai Kartanegara, 2,984 are from North Penajam Paser, and 1,253 are\xa0from Balikpapan.\n""The threat now besides being a traffic lane for coal barges, Balikpapan Bay will be the only logistical route for the needs of the construction of a new capital,"" said Ms Susan Herawati, Secretary General of KIARA, adding that East Kalimantan does not yet have zoning regulations on coastal areas and small islands.\nJATAM also claimed the citizens were not consulted. ""The citizens have the right to express their opinion\xa0and this was clearly denied\xa0… East Kalimantan residents, including its indigenous people weren’t given the chance to express their voice,” JATAM’S spokesman Merah Johansyah said in a statement.\nMr Gamal of the University of Indonesia also noted that the\xa0new area\xa0includes\xa0protected forest.\n“We need the full commitment of the government, not only at the planning stage but also at the implementation stage, that the interests of ecological conservation are not sacrificed for the purposes of moving the capital,” he\xa0told CNA.\nPLANNING\xa0FROM A CLEAN\xa0SLATE\nLooking ahead,\xa0Jakarta-based urban planner Sibarani Sofian said the construction of a new capital would allow the authorities to start from a clean slate\xa0and get things right.\n“The new capital has to be built thoroughly, not in conventional ways and in a rush.\nSingapore is the best example when it comes to tropical city design. They (the government) need to study from various cases and learn from various sources. Not only from success stories, but also from failures,” he said.\nHe added\xa0that it cannot\xa0be “business as usual” and the planning needs to be comprehensive.\n“It can’t be just another standard Indonesian city, meaning there have to be clear targets which are measurable. For example, the city which improves air quality from X to Y, with Y being good air quality level internationally.""\nHe added that Kalimantan\'s climate is highly humid and the temperatures are always high.\xa0In this regard, the design needs to bear in mind these\xa0climatic\xa0conditions, especially in terms of\xa0wind and sun orientation, he said.\nMr Sofian elaborated that the new capital should be based on people, not vehicles and thus mass transport systems need to be implemented before private cars invade the city.\n“This is very possible because they’re designing a city from scratch,” he said, adding that it should also have a specific Indonesian character.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     East Kalimantan ', '     environment ']}"

      Elaborate mooncake packaging difficult to recycle and damaging to the environment, experts say
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Every Mid-Autumn Festival, many in Singapore buy and gift mooncakes\xa0to celebrate the occasion. Most of them come enclosed\xa0in fancy boxes, with colourful and lacquered packaging.\xa0\nAnd each year, the mooncakes seem to come in more extravagant packaging. But as these retailers compete to win over consumers with the most extravagant designs, the resulting packaging waste from these mooncake boxes can be harmful to the environment, said experts.\nAbout 40 per cent of the packaging is unnecessary and wasteful, said Mr Liow Chean Siang, head of environmental certifications at the Singapore Environment Council (SEC).\xa0\nHe added: “Over the years, packaging for mooncakes has become so much more elaborate and fancy, resulting in more paper and plastic being used. Besides the presentation box itself, more plastic and paper are also used for the inner packaging to keep each mooncake in place to prevent spoilage, contamination and damage during transportation.\xa0\n“All this adds up to more waste being generated than necessary.”\xa0\nA spokesman from Tay Paper Recycling told CNA that it receives slightly less than five tonnes of paper and cardboard waste from mooncake boxes every year. Tay Paper Recycling is one of the major paper recycling companies in Singapore;\xa0it processes about 5,000 to 8,000 tonnes of waste paper monthly.\xa0\nHe added that mooncake boxes can be difficult to recycle due to the laminate that makes the boxes glossy. “We generally do not accept them. There is not much we can do but to send them for incineration.”\xa0\nAnd each tonne of paper used is equivalent to 17 trees, said Mr Liow.\xa0\n“With the growth of green consumerism, we have the power to say no to elaborate packaging, and send a clear message to manufacturers to reduce product packaging to a minimum and cut down on unnecessary wastage,” he added.\n“If we can reduce paper consumption, we can reduce the number of trees from being cut down.”\xa0\nMooncake retailers CNA spoke to acknowledged that mooncake packaging can be made more environmentally friendly, but also highlighted the importance of design and food safety.\nMr Cavaliere Giovanni Viterale, general manager of Fullerton Hotels and Resorts, said their mooncakes this year are packed in cardboard boxes which are\xa0“95 per cent recyclable and 100 per cent reusable”.\xa0\n“The team designed the boxes such that they can be repurposed and reused. Our premium boxes are designed to be reused as jewellery boxes. Our limited edition boxes, meanwhile, are collectibles. This year’s edition is designed as a carry case with a mirror, perfect for reuse as a beauty kit.”\xa0\nHe added that the team is currently exploring a fully recyclable mooncake box for next year, but highlighted that retailers have to strike a balance between reducing packaging waste\xa0and ensuring quality, food safety and hygiene.\xa0\nA Hilton Singapore spokesman said the team “worked closely” with its packaging supplier to create a mooncake box that is recyclable, reusable and can be repurposed for other uses.\xa0\nThe hotel’s mooncakes come in\xa0a four-tier round floral embossed tiffin carrier made from 100 per cent\xa0fully recyclable, food-safe aluminium material, meant to be repurposed as a takeaway food carrier, he said.\xa0\xa0The spokesman also highlighted that the team is considering using food-grade paper instead of plastic packaging when wrapping individual mooncakes.\nChairman of the Packaging Council of Singapore Betty Tan said it may be difficult for retailers to avoid fanciful packaging.\xa0\n“The trend now is to give these mooncakes as a gift. In order to attract consumers to purchase these mooncakes, the presentation and marketing must be eye-catching. And the only way to do this is to have attractive packaging to gift wrap these mooncakes,” she added.\xa0\nUSING LESS IS STILL BEST\nMr Liow believes “using less is still the best”, adding that the SEC strongly believes that reducing usage is always preferred over reusing and recycling.\xa0\n“Packaging should be functional. If retailers and manufacturers need to make it more fancy, then one way is to design the boxes to have dual use, which some are already doing, but it is still not preferred as additional resources are used,” he added.\xa0\nMs Melissa Tan, chairman of the Waste Management & Recycling Association of Singapore, agreed that manufacturers should cut down on unnecessary packaging because\xa0not everything can be recycled.\xa0\n“Most of the packaging can be recycled as long as it is not contaminated by food waste like remnants of mooncakes and oil stains, and the paper or cardboard is not covered by a layer of glossy varnish or waterproof wax,” she added.\xa0\n“Besides contributing to less generation of waste, the manufacturers should let the quality of their products speak for themselves to attract customers, rather than the design of the packaging. The outward appearance of the product should be decent, but it need not be ostentatious and ultimately, wasteful.”\xa0\nIt “would be ideal” if consumers could peel off the laminate before sending their unwanted mooncake boxes for recycling, said the spokesman for Tay Paper recycling.\xa0\n""Remove all non-paper materials such as plastic stickers, laminate, cushioning materials. Manufacturers could adopt a package labelling scheme similar to the one in Australia to better indicate if the packaging is recyclable or if steps are needed before sending them for recycling,” he added.\xa0\nMr Liow said: “Eating mooncakes used to be a delicacy eaten once a year as part of the tradition of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Over the years, the custom seems to have changed. Today, buying expensive mooncakes is often about gifting to impress someone and not about the festival, for example, given as corporate gifts by businesses to their clients.\n“Let us start to do our part for the environment by being more conscious of our consumption and voice it out through our choice of purchases.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Mid-Autumn Festival ', '     sustainability ', '     environment ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'GENEVA: Social media users are fueling a burgeoning appetite for acquiring wild otters and other endangered animals as pets, conservationists say, warning the trend could push species towards extinction.\nPopular Instagrammers posting selfies with their pet otter may simply be seeking to warm the hearts of their sometimes hundreds of thousands of followers, but animal protection groups say the trend is posing an existential threat to the silky mammal.\n""The illegal trade in otters has suddenly increased exponentially,"" Nicole Duplaix, who co-chairs the Otter Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, told AFP.\nAll Asian otter species have long been listed as vulnerable or endangered after facing decades of shrinking habitats and illegal trade in their pelts.\nBut conservationists say the recent surge in social media hype around the creatures has sparked such a frenzied demand for baby otters in Asian countries, Japan in particular, that it could drive entire species towards extinction.\nParties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), currently in Geneva to evaluate and fine-tune the treaty that manages trade in more than 35,000 species of plants and animals, will consider proposals to hike protection of two particularly imperiled otter species.\nDANGEROUS ""CUTE FACTOR""\nThe Asian small-clawed otter and the smooth-coated otter are already listed as threatened under CITES Appendix II, but India, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Philippines are asking that they are moved to Appendix I, which would mean a full international trade ban.\nConservationists insist the move is vital, after both species have seen their numbers plunge at least 30 percent over three decades, and with the decline believed to have accelerated significantly in the past few years.\n""This is especially being fuelled by the desire to have otters as an exotic pet, and social media is really driving that,"" Cassandra Koenen, who heads the Wildlife Not Pets campaign at World Animal Protection, told AFP.\nPaul Todd of the Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC) agreed.\n""It is really remarkable to see how the latest trends in social media and social influencing have a direct correlation with the demise of species on the ground,"" he told AFP.\nPopular figures on Instagram and Facebook often rake in thousands of gushing comments about their otter pictures, such as ""cuteness overload"", ""otterly adorable"", and ""want one!"".\nDuplaix acknowledged that otters are ""very charismatic creatures,"" saying ""it is the cute factor that is causing their demise.""\nThe pictures mask the suffering of the naturally social mammals taken from the wild when they are held in captivity and isolation.\nKoenen pointed to the numerous ""funny videos"" posted of pet otters turning in circles, saying that to a trained eye, it is obvious: ""The reason the animal is spinning around is that it is in huge distress.""\nAmid the growing demand for pet otters, hunters and fishermen in Indonesia and Thailand especially are increasingly killing adult otters and snatching the babies, which are caged and shipped off to become exotic pets.\nThe main destination is Japan, where one otter pup can fetch up to US$10,000 (€9,000).\nOTTER CAFES\nSeveral ""otter cafes"" have also popped up in the country, with patrons urged to buy small pieces of food to feed the caged mammals and to snap a selfie with them while drinking a coffee.\n""It is a very unnatural environment for them,"" Koenen said, maintaining that they are often isolated in individual cages, given poor nutrition and little access to water.\nPet otters may have it better, but they still suffer from being far from their natural environment and away from the large family groups they lived with in the wild, she said.\nKoenen also warned that smiling selfies with pet otters provide a ""false narrative"" about what it is like to live with the wild creatures, which smell and are prone to biting.\n""They make very unsuitable pets,"" she said.\nSocial media platforms have meanwhile made it too easy to purchase exotic pets like otters, she said, sparking impulse buys with little reflection over the implications of bringing a wild animal into one\'s home.\nOtters are not the only species suffering from a booming and often social-media fuelled interest in exotic pets.\nAmong the 56 proposals on the table in Geneva for increased protection listings, 22 involve species - including lizards, geckos, tortoises and spiders - which suffer because of the multi-billion-dollar exotic pet trade.\nTodd said there was mounting evidence that ""a species can go from completely fine to utterly gone in the matter of a few years because of this drive in desire for images"".\n""Baby otters are dying, and for what? A selfie,"" he said. ""We have to stop this.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     wildlife ', '     environment ', '     Instagram ', '     Japan ']}"

      Everest region to ban single-use plastics

      Going 'nude': UK supermarkets test plastic-free zones
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: British supermarkets are starting to go ""nude"".\nBowing to pressure from environmentally conscious consumers, big brand shops have begun taking steps to strip their shelves of plastic wrapping over concerns about saving the oceans from waste.\n""Nude zones"" and ""Food in the Nude"" campaigns are already being rolled out in places such as New Zealand and South Africa, where many fresh fruits and vegetables are grown within relatively easy reach.\nNow retailers in Britain - where even bunches of bananas are often sealed in plastic to keep them fresh and undamaged during long-distance shipping - are gradually following suit.\n""I\'ve just done my first-ever plastic-free shop,"" said May Stirling, who travelled 60km from the village of Ramsbury to Oxford for the university city\'s ""unpackaging"" event at the local Waitrose supermarket.\n""It\'s so liberating,"" the 49-year-old mother said, carrying her own containers for the loose products.\nThe Oxford branch of the upmarket chain was selling 160 types of vegetables and fruits, plus cereals, grains, couscous, lentils, wine, beer and other items in bulk, in what was initially planned as an 11-week trial.\n""I just wish there were a few more things I could have got today,"" said Stirling, who added in particular that she would have liked more choice of non-packaged cereals for her son.\nCOMMERCIALLY VIABLE?\nCurrently, British stores rely greatly on plastic to ship, store and sell items.\nThe country\'s 10 largest grocery chains produce 810,000 tonnes of single-use plastic packaging every year, a figure that does not include bags, Greenpeace and the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency said in November.\nLike Stirling, other shoppers have also been pressing the Oxford Waitrose supermarket to do more to stop plastics pollution via a wall, set up by staff, where customers have pinned hundreds of suggestions, many asking for refillable bottles for items like milk and cleaning products.\nIt has now extended its trial in the branch and announced that it would soon introduce the scheme in three other stores.\nWaitrose has said however that it has yet to establish whether plastic-free zones would work in all of its 344 locations across Britain.\n""While the priority is the environmental benefit, we clearly need to ensure (the trial) is commercially viable,"" spokesman James Armstrong said.\n""NOT THAT DIFFICULT""\nPlastic packaging is cheaper than some of the other possible options.\nSo, are shoppers ready to pay more for their groceries to come wrapped in more ecological packaging?\nFran Scott, a 55-year-old marketing consultant, is unsure.\n""I genuinely don\'t know,"" she said, while also shopping at Waitrose, armed with her own plastic containers.\n""I would like to think that,"" she added, however.\nOther big supermarket chains have signed up to ""The UK Plastics Pact"".\nThe pledge\'s four tenets include eliminating all single-use packaging and making the remainder recyclable or compostable by 2025.\nTesco and Asda, a low-cost retailer, have promised to stop using plastic for online shopping deliveries.\nMorrisons, which like Tesco and Asda is among the biggest five supermarket chains in Britain, intends to install plastic-free produce zones in 60 locations by the end of the year.\nOthers are going further.\nBudgens Belsize Park, a London branch of the smaller supermarket chain Budgens - part of a 147-year-old company of nearly 250 franchises - has already ripped the plastic off more than 2,300 of its 14,000 products.\n""We did this to show the other big supermarket chains that it wasn\'t as difficult as they said it was,"" Andrew Thornton, who runs a Budgens in north London, told AFP, of the reorganisation which took 10 weeks.\nBut among those products still delivered to the shop in plastic is cheese, which the staff cut into slices and then re-wrap in clingfilm made of sugarcane.\n""If all the big players globally start to deal with this in their own shops and put pressure on the big manufacturers, things will shift,"" Thornton said.\n""GREAT MATERIAL""\nMaterials scientist Mark Miodownik, of University College London, said that plastic had become a victim of a global business model focused on ""disposability and consumption"".\nPart of the problem, he said, stemmed from the marketing of plastic in the 1960s when it came to symbolise modernity and practicality.\n""Plastic is a great material,"" he said, pointing to its advantages for hospital materials, pipes and technological equipment.\nHe said that plastic is good for packaging too, but only if it can be recycled well.\nBritain\'s Food Standards Agency notes that plastic limits the exposure of produce to air and moisture, extending its shelf life and ""helping to reduce food waste"".\nBut Budgens shopper Richard Brady still said he felt guilty about being caught holding a plastic container of sushi.\n""Well, there is nothing else,"" he said.\n""It comes like that and my wife is hungry.

      5 ways to understand and break down the concept of sustainability
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sustainability is currently one of the most commonly used buzzwords. But do we know exactly what it means or entails? According to Lexico Dictionaries, it is defined as “the ability to be maintained at a certain rate or level”, and it includes not just environmental sustainability – arguably the most popular area of discussion now – but also business and social sustainability.\nIn a bid to go deeper into the concept, and promote awareness of its different aspects, Generation T and\xa0CNA Luxury\xa0co-hosted the very first Gen.T Table, during which a lively panel discussion on the topic took place.\nThree panellists were involved in the conversation, including Gen.T 2017 honourees\xa0Pocket Sun\xa0and\xa0Tan Szue Hann, as well as Tatler Tribe member,\xa0Pat Law.\xa0CNA’s award-winning news presenter Glenda Chong was the moderator for the evening. Here were some of the evening\'s most noteworthy takeaways.\n1. TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS IS TO BE FUTURE-READY\nA priority of business leaders and owners is making sure that their company has a healthy profit margin. But what about the survival of their business in the long term? According to Pat Law, it is highly dependent on promoting a work culture that embraces curiosity, creativity, openness and failure, if it comes.\nShe shared an anecdote of one of her past clients: “I had a client who was a leading force in the mobile phone market, before Apple was even big. I was in a meeting with them when Apple announced that it was coming up with a smartphone that didn\'t have a keypad – it was the iPhone. My clients laughed because they didn\'t think that Apple would make it big with this product. But look at what Apple has become!\xa0\nWhen I think back, I realised that this was Apple thinking ahead of the crowd and daring to make a risky investment – and it paid off. So I feel that for a business to be sustainable, leaders need to always want to find out what\'s next for their company and what they have to do to get there before anyone else.”\n\n\n2. INVESTING IN SUSTAINABILITY IS A NATURAL PROGRESSION\nIn a\xa02014 survey by Glass Packaging Institute, it was reported that millennials believe they have more at stake than any other generation with regard to health and the environment. As a result, we are seeing this younger generation exhibiting different consumption habits from their predecessors, including moving away from single-use plastics, actively seeking out ethical and sustainable experiences such as eco-conscious holidays, and supporting the use of renewable energy.\nIn the same vein, Pocket Sun posited that ""the next generation of brands will see environmental and social sustainability almost as a default option. I feel the idea of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) will eventually cease to exist as these two concepts will no longer be something that\'s an extra part of what you do as a company, but part of who you are.”\n3. PUTTING IN PLACE GREENER PRACTICES DOESN’T NECESSARILY MEAN BAD NEWS FOR PROFITS\nAccording to Tan Szue Hann, the economic well-being of a company can benefit from it operating more consciously and responsibly.\xa0\n“Like what Pocket said, sustainability goes beyond CSR. Everyone assumes that sustainability is about cultural values, like how many trees you want to hug or how much of the planet you want to save, and they also think that these values don\'t jive with the economic needs of a business. However, I believe it\'s possible for a company to reap monetary rewards when it invests in more sustainable or greener practices. For example, a company can consider obtaining materials from sustainable sources directly instead or cut down the excesses in its supply chain. This will allow it to economise, which translates into cost savings.""\n\n\n4. CREATE A SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT THAT PEOPLE WANT OR DIDN’T KNOW THEY NEEDED\nAlthough sustainability is an effective marketing tool for companies to use in order to garner attention from their target audience, it is crucial for a company\'s product and/or service to first provide a user experience that is not only relevant, but also appealing and seamless.\n""The longevity of its business is greatly dependent on its ability to create new products and solutions that consumers didn\'t think they needed, and making sure it has recurring customers,"" said Tan.\n""The only way to do so is to ensure that the design and quality of its products and/or services. It\'s got to be a (well-thought-out) product that makes people want to come back for more. For instance, a farmer\'s fish could be sustainably farmed, but if it doesn\'t taste good, no one’s going to come back for it. In addition to this, a product has to answer a need or want. Let\'s take architecture as an example. Some likely questions modern-day consumers would include, is this building going to be a nice place to be in, is its design going to stand the test of time, is it \'Instagrammable\'? All this need to be addressed before a company thinks about talking about sustainability.""\n5. NURTURE CONSCIOUS THINKERS FROM A YOUNG AGE\nAs the issue of sustainability becomes increasingly pressing, particularly with the rising effects of climate change, there\'s a greater need to educate not just the current generation about it, but the ones to come as well.\xa0\nFor the three panellists, the teaching should start early. “Children typically take everything as the truth and the absolute truth, so the way we talk about sustainability to them is really important,"" said Tan.\n""I think it\'s a great idea to introduce them to issues such as climate change and global waste in a simplified form; to teach them what their role is on the planet and what they’ll be doing in their whole life cycle. By doing this, you aren\'t necessarily nurturing tree huggers or environmentalists, but you\'re definitely going to develop children who will grow up thinking about everything that they consume and how they can be part of the whole process of creating a better world.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     business ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Singapore’s ivory trade ban tackles elephant in room but work ahead a mammoth task
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: This week marked the end of a long wait for Singapore to stop the sale of ivory and ivory products and a victory for those working to put this in place.\xa0\nOver the last six months, Singapore authorities seized an unprecedented amount of 38 tonnes of pangolin scales and almost 10 tonnes of elephant ivory worth more than S$170 million - with some close to the largest seizures the world has seen.\nLed by the National Parks Board (NParks), these acts of enforcement were a true testament of the country’s zero-tolerance to illegal wildlife trade.\nJust two days after the most recent seizure of 15 baskets containing 815 birds over the National Day weekend, Singapore announced the latest highlight of our fight against illegal wildlife trade: An ivory ban.\nTHE WORK IS FAR FROM COMPLETE\nIt is generally estimated that customs intercepts 10 per cent of all contraband including drugs, weapons, and presumably ivory.\nAlthough the massive seizures highlighted what effective law enforcement looks like in Singapore, it also revealed the sheer size of the problem. So the work is far from complete.\nThis week will be the start of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Geneva, where 183 governments will meet to make critical decisions on wildlife protection.\nWith the ban announcement and the enforcement successes, this is a timely opportunity for Singapore to send a renewed urgent signal to global governments to interrupt trade routes and strengthen enforcement measures. What’s currently at stake: About 1,045 threatened species and subspecies, including pangolins and marine turtles.\nThe hope is that at CITES, Singapore’s leadership will spur more Southeast Asian governments into action, to close their domestic markets and step\xa0up enforcement efforts.\nWhile the most iconic animal in our conservation fight has often been the elephant, given the high-profile poaching crisis this gentle creature has faced in recent years, the illegal wildlife trade is more than just in ivory.\nWildlife populations continue to dwindle as the overexploitation of many other key wildlife including pangolins, sharks, saiga antelopes and songbirds remain widespread today.\nThese latest large-scale seizures had one thing in common: Africa was the leading source country, Singapore the transit point and Vietnam the destination. Case in point: Our little red dot has unwillingly facilitated the trade of the species and its products as the largest transshipment hub in the world.\nSo while we rejoice in Singapore’s ban on ivory domestic trade, we now also need to look at protecting the other 1,044 species and subspecies threatened with extinction and urgently advance measures to shut down any illegal trade via Singapore.\nHere are three we need to do to further disrupt wildlife crime:\n1. MAKE SURE THE IVORY BAN DOESN'T SHIFT SUPPLY AND DEMAND SOMEWHERE ELSE\xa0\nAn immediate suspension of the issuance of import and export licences for pre-convention ivory can ensure that the ban will not lead to stockpiling of new ivory or increased supply or demand in other countries.\nI also recommend making it compulsory for retailers to declare their inventory immediately.\n2. INCREASE PENALTIES TO DETER ALL WILDLIFE CRIME\nThe punishment must be a real deterrent that outweighs the benefit of the crime. WWF is proposing a minimum of four-year to maximum 10-year sentences aligned to the definition of a “serious crime” under the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.\nTo find the kingpins, illegal wildlife trade must be linked to money laundering and cybercrime investigations. We recommend the seizure of assets and an increase in the maximum fine per shipment from S$500,000 to S$5 million to tackle the huge monetary incentive for retailers to continue trading ivory on the black market. For example, the current maximum penalty of S$500,000 is pocket change compared to the S$66 million the recent large-scale seizure was valued at.\xa0\n3. DEVELOP STRONGER COOPERATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS\nWe have seen great work in the Singapore enforcement departments across the police, border controls, customs units and NParks over the last six months. But what’s next for traffickers?\nThe trade operates outside the confines of the law, taking advantage of loopholes to move around the world. Likely, they will start re-routing to other countries with weaker enforcement.\nMany Southeast Asia countries, including Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have already banned all domestic sale and display of ivory products. So, to curb the illegal trade to an extent that wild populations will bounce back will also require more strategic inter-agency and inter-governmental cooperation\nWildlife populations will only recover if all of us take action. While governments need to set stronger laws, regulations, enforcement and work together, businesses need to stop the shipments and sales of wildlife products.\nWe, too, as individuals can play our part. Just like we rejected ivory, we have to be continuously vocal that any products contributing to the extinction of species are a taboo and socially unacceptable. \xa0\nWe should be excited about this new chapter that begins, it has opened a real opportunity to stop illegal wildlife trade. Let’s continue the momentum and ensure that no further species will fall victim to this trade on our watch.\nKim Stengert is Chief, Strategic Communication and External Relations at WWF-Singapore.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     wildlife ', '     environment ', '     National Parks Board ']}"

      Where to lay my eggs? Endangered hawksbill turtles face shrinking nesting grounds in Melaka
  </h1>, 'text': ""MELAKA: It was 9pm, and a\xa0female hawksbill turtle clambered clumsily onto a sandy beach 50km north of Melaka city centre.\nIt heaved its 75kg frame upslope, its flippers tensing with the effort.

I have advised them not to use bright lights at night, informing them how it impacts turtles which nest in the area,” he said.\xa0\nBeside\xa0tourism activities, land reclamation issues have also plagued northern Melaka, making it difficult for turtles to nest with ongoing construction work and shifting shorelines.\xa0\nAccording to Ms Lau Min Min, WWF conservation manager for turtles in peninsular Malaysia,\xa0land reclamation has reduced landings in certain beaches by up to 70 per cent.\xa0\nThe Melaka department of fisheries\xa0cited how the the nestings at Pulau Upeh beach, for example, plunged\xa0from 110 in 2011 to 33 in 2018.\xa0\nLand reclamation projects, which began in 2014, are also increasing, and this has a clear direct impact on the future of the hawksbill turtles, she added.\nA fellow turtle guardian who operates in the area, Mr Tambi Shah, told CNA that the reclamation works have visibly eroded the beach.\n“The landing areas for turtles, which were previously flat and nice, are now eroded and filled with fallen tree debris, making it difficult for turtles to land,” said Mr Tambi, who is stationed at Terendak Camp, a military base.\n“So what I can do is to collect the wood and tree branches from the beach and burn them, so that they won't deter the turtles from nesting,” he added.\nFROM TURTLE POACHERS TO TURTLE GUARDIANS\nProtecting the turtles and creating a conducive\xa0environment for them are\xa0new endeavours for\xa0both Mr Zainal and Mr Tambi.\xa0\nPreviously, they were\xa0turtle egg poachers who would sneak around the beach after dark to collect turtle eggs to be sold in markets or for their own consumption.\xa0\nBoiled and eaten with rice, turtle eggs are considered\xa0a delicacy among many coastal communities in Malaysia.\n“The biggest positive outcome in converting from a poacher to a ranger is that we do not fight over eggs. And our income is certain,\xa0regardless if we manage to secure any turtle eggs,” Mr Tambi said.\xa0\nWith a salary of RM45 (US$11) per night, the turtle guardians protect the eggs, tag the mother turtles after they lag their eggs, and transfer the eggs to the hatchery.\xa0\nTheir income comes to about RM600 a month during the turtle nesting season, which is more than what they could earn as poachers.\xa0\n“It's enough to support my family,” said Mr Tambi.\nWWF Malaysia’s Ms Lau highlighted that the guardians are trained as marine researchers and they play\xa0a huge role in helping hawksbill turtles breed.\n“This is a transformation of the whole system, some of them were egg poachers but they are now turtle guardians. That’s what we are doing now in Melaka. That’s our forte,” she said.\nHOPING FOR A WIN-WIN SOLUTION\xa0\xa0\nTo preserve the nesting areas for\xa0turtles, both WWF Malaysia and the Melaka Fisheries Department have suggested that the beach stretching 1km near Padang Kemunting be gazetted as a turtle sanctuary.\xa0\nHowever, the\xa0state government has yet to respond to the proposal.\n“Once it is gazetted, activities like fishing, camping, picnic activities and sea sports will not be allowed. I hope that the state government will support our cause,” said the fisheries department's deputy director Ms Doreen Wee.\n“We expect the number\xa0of landings to reduce each year. We did mention this matter to the state government, and they do listen to us, but ultimately the reclamation works still continue. We cannot do anything about it. We can only give our comments,” she said.\nWWF's Ms Lau outlined that one way to convince the government is to find a win-win outcome for all.\xa0\nShe said if the area is gazetted as a sanctuary, the turtles would be able to nest with less disturbance, and the government will benefit if the sanctuary becomes an eco-tourism attraction\xa0on turtle conservation.\n“It’s about finding a compromise and a win-win solution.”\xa0\xa0\n“We want to have a more cohesive programme which will benefit villagers and the state government. The beach can be an asset if it’s taken care of properly.\xa0We want to rehabilitate the beaches, and if it all comes into play, everybody will be happy,” she added.\nMr Tambi, the poacher-turned-guardian, has come to understand the importance of conservation.\xa0\nHe now finds himself advising villagers to stop consuming the eggs as\xa0the hawksbill turtle species is in danger of extinction.\n“I always tell the villagers here that if you all just sit around and eat, eat and eat, if you find the eggs and eat, there will be no hatchlings released back to the sea.”\n“And in 10 to 20 years, there will be no more turtles nesting here. The mother turtles will die naturally and the hatchlings would have been consumed by you.”\xa0\n“The special thing about the hawksbill turtle is that it nests in Melaka, and this is a special thing for all Malaysia. We don’t want it to go away,” Mr Tambi said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Malaysia ']}"

      Jakarta’s only tobacco-free neighbourhood faces uncertain future
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Ms Ayu Rohaya was keeping\xa0a watchful eye\xa0on\xa0the four construction workers mending a portion of her neighbourhood’s footpath which unexpectedly collapsed several days ago.\xa0\nTwo of the workers had lit cigarettes sandwiched between their fingers.\xa0The 32-year-old mother of three wanted to make sure that the men would only smoke on a narrow concrete bridge just outside the neighbourhood’s perimeter, so as not to violate the area’s much-lauded rules.\nIn March 2017, Penas Tanggul, a poor congested neighbourhood in East Jakarta, became the\xa0first tobacco-free area in the capital, a noteworthy feat in a country where the price of a pack of cigarette is five times lower than in Singapore and tobacco advertising is still allowed.\nThe reminders to be tobacco-free are everywhere: emblazoned at the gate of the riverside neighbourhood, on stickers pasted at people’s homes and in colourful murals adorning the area’s communal restrooms and retainer walls.\n“We noticed that many women and children had respiratory problems because of all the men smoking,” Ms Rohaya told CNA of her neighbourhood’s decision to go tobacco-free.\nPeople used to smoke inside their homes, she said, and along the narrow 1.5 metres alleyways where children played and pregnant women walked.\nINITIAL RESISTANCE\nIt was a difficult\xa0process convincing people not to smoke in the neighbourhood where 120 families call home, recounted Mr Joko Sundoko, another resident.\n“There was a lot of resistance, especially from heavy smokers. But we managed to convince people that they should at least stop smoking inside their homes where their wives\xa0and kids live.""\n""Slowly, we agreed that if we want to smoke we should do it in a smoking zone which we established just outside of the neighbourhood,” he said.\xa0\nMr Sundoko said over time, many people in Penas Tanggul stopped smoking entirely, including himself. “I started smoking when I was 12 years old, because people around me were smokers. I think the biggest reward of this initiative is seeing children and teenagers not picking up the habit,"" he said.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Indonesia has the highest rate of male smokers in the world at\xa075 per cent. There is also a growing number of children taking up the habit (from 7.2 per cent of under 18s in 2013 to 9.1 per cent this year).\nAlthough the government acknowledged that the habit kills nearly 250,000 Indonesians every year, efforts to combat smoking in a country where tobacco generates more than US$10 billion in tax each year (10 per cent of its entire tax revenue) and employs 2.5 million workers, have been lacking.\nIndonesia is the only Association of Southeast Asian Nations member state which has not ratified the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).\nThe authorities have welcomed the smoke-free initiative.\xa0Health Ministry director for non-communicable disease prevention and control, Lily Sriwahyuni said: “Even though Indonesia is not an FCTC signatory, we agree on its content in spirit and continue to combat smoking.”\n“Which is why we welcome the initiative from the residents of Penas Tanggul. We are trying to create more tobacco-free neighbourhoods like Penas Tanggul and work with local governments around the country to replicate the drive elsewhere.”\nILLEGAL SETTLEMENT STATUS\nStraddling the flood-prone Cipinang River, the government has been trying for years to evict residents of Penas Tanggul, who are actually illegal squatters, to make way for a river normalisation project.\xa0\nHowever,\xa0the plan was temporarily halted after residents succeeded in putting their neighbourhood on the map, transforming the once filthy and unsanitary slum into an area adorned with colourful houses\xa0and murals.\nTubagus Haryo Karbiyanto of the NGO, Jakarta Residents’ Forum which championed the transformation said residents took inspiration from Indonesia’s first “colourful village” Kali Code and Indonesia’s first “tobacco-free village” Umbul Harjo, both located in Yogyakarta.\nPenas Tanggul was the first Indonesian neighbourhood to combine the two concepts, Mr Karbiyanto told CNA.\xa0\nThe transformation goes beyond the homes’ exterior. The residents have taken it upon themselves to be more conscious of the environment.\xa0\n“The back\xa0of their homes used to face the river and as a result, residents polluted the river with their trash and excrement,” he said.\n“Using Kali Code as an example, they flipped their homes’ orientation\xa0and turned the back\xa0of their homes into their front porches. This stopped residents from littering because now the river is technically their front lawn.”\nResidents have been lobbying the government to formally recognise Penas Tanggul\'s achievements and promote it as a tourist destination.\nThe request has been met with resistance, particularly from the local legislature which argued that despite its achievements, Penas Tanggul is still technically an illegal squatter.\n“The neighbourhood’s initiative is good. But we shouldn’t provide illegal settlers with incentives and recognition,” said lawmaker Bestari Barus.\n“It will create more problems in the future. The government must return the area back to its original function, a riverbank free from dwellings.”\nWhen asked by CNA on the plans for the\xa0neighbourhood,\xa0Jakarta provincial government’s secretary\xa0Saefullah, who goes by one name, would only say\xa0that the city hall is not making plans\xa0to demolish it\xa0for now.\xa0There are also no plans to\xa0formally recognise and preserve Penas Tanggul, he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Jakarta ', '     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

They currently retail at S$9.90, IKEA added.\nHousehold recycling surveys conducted last year by the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources and NEA found that around 60 per cent of Singapore households recycled regularly.\nFor these households, convenience was cited as an important factor for recycling. For residents who did not recycle, the most common reason was that they had too few items to recycle. Respondents also said habits play a major role in their recycling behaviour.\n“New habits and routines are more likely to be cultivated when there is a change in one’s life circumstances or environment, such as when moving in to a new home,"" NEA said.\xa0""This would include new homeowners, who are likely to be more receptive to making changes to their routines and establishing new recycling habits.""\nRECYCLING BIN TAKES INTO ACCOUNT PUBLIC’S FEEDBACK: NEA\nNEA also conducted six focus group discussions with members of the public from February to March to find out their preferences for recycling receptacles – an adhesive hook, a standard S-hook and a cardboard box. The cardboard box was the preferred option, the agency said.\nRespondents generally preferred a recycling receptacle that was durable, washable, functional and in neutral colours, it added.\n“The recycling bin takes into account this feedback, and further improves on the form of the recycling receptacle to be rolled out. The bin provided by IKEA Singapore is also made from 60 per cent recycled plastic with a design that easily fits into any home,” NEA said.\nA typical household can accumulate recyclables for at least a few days before depositing them into the blue recycling bins found at the bottom of HDB blocks or recycling chutes on common floor landings, it said.\nA prominent blue recycling label will be affixed to the bins, with recycling tips such as ensuring that recyclables are free from food and liquid, and rinsing bottles and containers before recycling them. Fridge magnets will also be given out to guide households on what can or cannot be recycled.\nNEA chief executive Tan Meng Dui said the agency hopes to encourage households to make recycling a daily routine.\n“For the HDB households which will benefit from this new initiative, the in-home recycling bin makes recycling things more convenient than disposing them as garbage. This is happening for the first time in an HDB living environment,” he said.\nNEA said it will also improve the design of the labels on the blue recycling bins to help people recycle right. More details on the new label will be announced later this year, it said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     NEA ']}"

I don’t know how long my family can survive with no income like this,” the father of three told CNA.\nIndonesia’s state-owned oil company Pertamina which operates the troubled oil rig YYA-1, said a sudden release of gas on Jul 12 triggered the release of crude oil from its bored well.\nPertamina said it has\xa0deployed\xa0more than two dozen ships armed with 2km-long oil booms - floating barriers used to contain an oil spill. It has also deployed\xa0five giant octopus-like skimmers to suck up the oil.\nIn the meantime, until the leak is plugged,\xa0thousands of fishermen and local businesses are reeling from the environmental and economic impact.\xa0\xa0\nAlthough no longer as bad as the first week after the spill, crude oil still makes its way to shore,\xa0travelling as far away as the Thousand Islands in Jakarta some 60km west of the rig and Cilamaya, 50km east.\nThe spill has polluted\xa045 sq km of water\xa0according to an assessment by activists from the Indonesian Forum for the Environment, affecting the livelihood of thousands of fishermen.\nFOOD STALLS, RESTAURANTS SUFFER\nIn Sedari village, pollution has also affected food stalls and restaurants along the\xa0beach which are popular among local tourists.\xa0\n“People are afraid to come to the beach because of the oil spill. Before the incident, I usually make 400,000 rupiah on weekdays and 800,000 rupiah on weekends. Now, I’m lucky if I get 50,000 rupiah a day,” Ms Wariyi, a vendor, told CNA.\nThe situation was worse for seafood restaurants, with some shutting\xa0temporarily because customers were worried about consuming tainted produce.\nMs Titi Sumantri said the pollution has also affected consumer confidence towards freshwater fishes, seaweed\xa0and salt\xa0from farms around the coastal areas of Karawang.\n“The oil spill didn’t touch my fish farm. But customers still wouldn’t buy my fish. People are scared. The only way is to sell them really really cheap,” Ms Sumantri said.\nThe situation is so dire that the only way to make money in Sedari and other worst hit villages like Cemara Jaya and Pasir Jaya was to join the team of workers cleaning the beaches affected by the oil spill.\nArmed with shovels and plastic sacks, some 800 locals dressed in white protective clothing\xa0and gear\xa0have been collecting and transporting tons of polluted sand.\nThe sand\xa0is loaded onto trucks adorned with stickers indicating that they are toxic. The sand will then be safely disposed at waste treatment facilities across West Java.\n“Pertamina is paying us 3,000 rupiah per sack,” one local, Wawan Darmawan told CNA as he waited along with at least a hundred others for his turn to load the six sacks of polluted sand\xa0he collected\xa0from a beach three kilometres away.\n“Sedari is pretty much cleaned but the problem is the beaches which are still polluted are inaccessible by car, let alone by truck,” he said.\nMr Darmawan said he has to make three to four 10-minute round trips on his old\xa0motorcycle, just to earn 80,000 rupiah, a fraction of the 300,000 rupiah a day he makes as a boat crew.\n“It’s better than no money at all,” he reasoned.\nPERTAMINA CALLS FOR PATIENCE\nHow long will this situation last?\nPertamina’s corporate communications vice president Fajriyah Usman said it could take eight weeks before the leak is completely stopped.\n“We are working to address the issue with our drilling platform. Until we fix the problem we will continue to keep the spill at bay with oil booms and skimmers to minimise the oil spill reaching the shore,” Ms Usman told CNA.\n“We are working with a consultant from America with proven experience in handling oil spills like this. They are analysing ways to stop the source of the leak in a safe way considering that we are dealing with oil spills and gases. This is a high-risk operation.\n“Which is why we are taking the time to make sure that we stop the leak in the most effective and safest way possible. It is not like fixing your plumbing work at home.”\nThe Pertamina executive said the company is preparing a compensation scheme for the affected communities.\n“We are working with local people to clean the beaches. We are setting up health centres to check people’s conditions. We are assessing the damage\xa0done and will make sure that people are fairly compensated,” she said.\nCoordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Binsar Panjaitan told reporters that the government is making a separate assessment on the damages, to ensure that\xa0the compensation takes into account all direct and indirect damages to people’s health, the local economy as well as the environment.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     oil ', '     environment ']}"

      Could more be done to reduce plastic packaging waste in Singapore's supermarkets? 
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: A stroll around most supermarkets reveals how important plastic seems to be in the sale of fresh food.\nFruit and vegetables are often wrapped in plastic while meat and fish usually comes in a tray encased in clingwrap. There are also usually plenty of plastic bags on hand for those loose items that shoppers select before they're weighed and priced.\nSuch scenes are repeated at supermarkets around the world.\nBut questions are starting to be raised about whether more should be done to reduce the\xa0reliance of supermarkets on plastic packaging, as the debate extends beyond cutting down on plastic shopping bags.\nFor instance,\xa0Sainsbury’s in the UK recently announced that they will be trialing plastic packaging-free fruit and vegetable aisles in their grocery stores. Two superstores will give customers the option of bringing their own containers or buying a reusable drawstring bag for loose produce.\nBut experts and industry players think a similar move in Singapore is unlikely.\xa0\nProfessor of environmental economics at Nanyang Technological University Euston Quah believes eliminating plastic packaging completely in supermarkets is not practical and could cause problems elsewhere. “Paper for wrapping can tear easily and hygiene could be compromised.\xa0\n“Bringing your own bags can also result in contamination, especially when people do not wash their bags often, which is also at the expense of water resources.”\xa0\nMr Jonas Kor, director of corporate communications and brand\xa0at NTUC FairPrice, told CNA that while the brand remains committed to environmental sustainability, food safety and quality remains a priority.\n“To reduce damage and minimise cross-contamination particularly for fresh produce, we use a variety of packaging including cling wrap, foam nets and trays and bags, depending on each type of fruit and vegetable.”\xa0\nHe cited white radish, corn and leafy vegetables as some examples of fresh produce that is typically pre-packaged by suppliers to protect them from damage while in transit, noting that this reduces food waste.\xa0\n“Nonetheless, where possible, we sell produce ‘loose’, such as hardier fruits like oranges, apples and avocados.”\xa0\nMP for Nee Soon GRC Louis Ng told CNA that he agrees that there is a hygiene concern in eliminating plastic packaging or plastic bags for fresh produce.\xa0\n“Unlike a lot of other countries where it’s more temperate, when you bring meat out here, it defrosts and gets a bit sticky in the bag. Same goes for vegetables. I do think we can draw the line there.”\nMr Ng, who called for a surcharge on all single-use bags, except those used for fresh produce, in an adjournment motion in Parliament in October last year, thinks Singapore cannot go completely plastic bag-free, especially for those who stay in HDB estates and use plastic bags to dispose of their waste.\xa0\n“Unlike other countries where they might not need it, in Singapore, if you don’t use it, that creates a real hygiene concern in our public estates.\xa0\nSingapore uses about 1.76 billion plastic items each year, according to the Singapore Environment Council’s position paper published in 2018. This includes 820 million plastic bags from supermarkets, 467 million PET bottles and 473 million plastic disposable items.\nAccording to NEA, packaging waste, including plastics, make up about one-third of domestic waste disposed of in Singapore.\nDairy Farm Group, which manages supermarkets Cold Storage and Giant, said it is “constantly looking at ways to reduce single-use plastic waste”, and is working with local government agencies and packaging industry groups to find long-term solutions.\xa0\nREDUCING EXCESSIVE PACKAGING\nManager of Zero Waste SG Pek Hai Lin said: “We are aware that most foods are imported and packaging can increase the shelf-life of certain food types, but we can reduce excessive packaging of certain items.\xa0\n“Supermarkets might have more information on how much packaging is needed to increase shelf life of food.”\nNonetheless, environmental expert and founder of Plastic-Lite Singapore Aarti Giri thinks local supermarket chains could do more to reduce plastic packaging on fresh produce.\xa0\n“Better differentiation needs to be made between minimally packaging delicate produce and more robust ones like capsicums and bananas,” she said.\nBy 2020, businesses will have to report the type and amount of packaging they put into the market to the NEA, and outline their plans for reducing it.\xa0This\xa0applies to brand owners, manufacturers, importers of packaging and packaged goods, as well as supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than $10 million.\xa0\nMs Giri urged local supermarkets to adopt packaging-free aisles for fresh produce and pass on the cost savings from the packaging reduction to consumers, to encourage them towards packaging-free produce.\xa0\nShe outlined two other solutions - alternative biodegradable packaging materials such as banana leaves or bio-plastics, and working closely with suppliers to reduce retail-level packaging.\xa0\nMr Kor said FairPrice works closely with its suppliers to maintain the quality of its produce while avoiding excessive packaging when transporting and retailing these products.\xa0\nMORE CIVIC MINDEDNESS NEEDED\nIn the past year, several smaller, zero-waste grocery shops like Unpackt and Reprovisions have opened across the island, where customers bring their own containers for a wide variety of groceries.\xa0But founders say even they foresee problems in selling packaging-free fresh produce.\xa0\nFounder of Unpackt Ms Florence Tay said while the initiative may be good for the environment, it may create another set of problems such as food waste.\xa0\nShe ran a short trial selling fresh produce at Unpackt, located in Jalan Kurau, but found that shoppers lacked “civic mindedness” and “were more keen to play with the fresh produce”.\xa0\n“Some shoppers are not considerate and may poke and rummage through the produce,” adding that large chain supermarkets would have to employ more manpower to man the packaging-free aisles.\nCo-founder of Reprovisions Mr Allann Tay agreed that customers are likely to abuse packaging-free fresh produce, because Singaporeans tend to\xa0try and pick the nicer looking fruits and vegetables, which may damage others lost in the shuffle.\xa0\nThe store, located in Jurong Point, sells mostly dried foods that are easy to store in bulk. Mr Tay said they have yet to bring in fresh produce due to space constraints, but are looking at a second, bigger location that can provide more product\nMr Tay also pointed out that most of the products sold in supermarkets are packaged by suppliers or manufacturers, making it less practical for supermarkets to enforce packaging-free standards. “There isn’t much brand differentiation once there is no packaging. Supermarkets cater to people who want the branding and packaging, whereas shops like us caters to those who can do without it.”\xa0\nTHE COST OF CONVENIENCE\nProf Quah believes there would be backlash if such measures are implemented because there are “no clear alternatives” to plastic bags and packaging.\xa0\nHe added that most Singaporeans still value plastic packaging and plastic bags for their convenience and multiple uses, and supermarkets must establish “a clear return” for reducing plastic use.\xa0\n“Supermarkets must offer clear incentives to entice consumers to behave accordingly. There must be a connection that consumers can see, that their efforts are translated to gains other than environmental gains.\xa0\n“Worse still, consumers might perceive environmental gains coming at their expense, along with cost-savings and higher profits for the supermarkets.”\nInstead of cutting out packaging entirely, supermarkets can instead look at where packaging can be reduced, he said. For example, discouraging the purchase of individually packed items.\xa0\nALTERNATIVE OPTIONS STILL GROWING\nDespite their troubles, zero-waste grocery stores remain positive that Singaporeans are making the shift towards bringing their own bags.\xa0\nMr Tay said customer feedback at Reprovisions has been positive.\n“We encounter people who are quite open to the concept once they know they are doing something good for the environment and future generations.”\xa0\nZero-waste grocery stores are not a new concept, said Ms Tay, who opened Unpackt in May last year.\n“We have shopping alternatives in traditional provision stores that still sell food in bulk. The local wet markets are also a good place to look for packaging-free fresh produce.”\nMs Tay noted that shopping package-free takes a lot of discipline and mindfulness.\xa0\n“Most people are already conscious of the environmental issues. They just need a few more nudges to action.”\nHowever, Ms Giri said while most consumers are aware of the detrimental effects of plastic pollution, not all see the urgency in choosing sustainable options.\xa0\n“The resistance from shoppers should not be taken as an excuse to prolong a problem. That would be very short-sighted of us and at the expense of the health of our future generations and our biodiversity.\n“The urgency to address climate change and enforce mitigating solutions is much akin to that of controlling an on-going infectious epidemic. Efforts need to be relentless and continuous.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     environment ', '     climate change ']}"

      Commentary: Singapore’s climate change fight must be clear about these facts
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The commentary “As time runs out on the climate crisis, Singapore prepares to address the cost of adapting” adopts the kind of urgent language appropriate to the climate crisis we are facing now.\xa0\nIt emphasises the importance of adaptation measures, which lower the risks posed by the consequences of climatic changes. One such example is recent measure to build Changi Airport Terminal 5 5.5 metres above mean sea level to deal with rising sea levels.\nIt is highly disappointing, however, that it downplays the pressing need to adopt more substantial mitigating measures that address root causes, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\xa0\nThe commentary notes that the question of mitigation in Singapore has been far simpler and less politically fraught than in other countries, and that Singaporeans have already worked towards more climate-friendly consumption patterns.\xa0\nThis obscures a few important facts about mitigation, unlike what the commentary posits, as the cost of climate change mitigation is very much “inextricably linked to political to political questions of cost, economic restructuring, decline and job losses”.\nLOOK AT INDUSTRY’S ENERGY CONSUMPTION\nFirstly, the source of much of Singapore’s emissions is not consumers, but industry.\xa0\nAs Singapore’s Energy Statistics indicate, of 2016’s total final energy consumption of 14,714.6 kilotonne of oil equivalent (ktoe), over 65 per cent (9,670.3 ktoe) was consumed by industry, far dwarfing the 5 per cent (739.2 ktoe) from household consumption and less than 18 per cent (2,587.1 ktoe) from transport.\nFurthermore, Singapore’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution states that a reduction of 36 per cent in Emissions Intensity (EI) from 2005 levels is intended by 2030.\nAs EI is measured by greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP, this means that Singapore’s emissions could continue to rise during this period, as long as our GDP continues to grow.\xa0\nThis contradicts the recommendations of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, a consensus of the best available scientific evidence, which makes it crystal clear that mitigation is necessary.\xa0\nAccording to the report, global emissions need to be cut in half by 2030 and reach net-zero in 2050 in order to stay below 1.5 degrees of warming and avoid the worst consequences of global warming to human life.\nSingapore, on the other hand, rather than mitigating total absolute emissions, is actively growing them.\xa0\nFor a commentary that calls for us to be clear-eyed in our assessment, it is a shame that its argument is ultimately detached from these realities.\nTAKE A HARDER LOOK AT DIRTY INDUSTRIES\nSecondly, if we are to be serious about the climate crisis, we should not overlook the need to engage in much more substantial mitigation measures that address the root causes of carbon emissions.\xa0\nThis includes focusing on the emissions of the dirtier industries, such as the oil and gas industry where Singapore plays host to one of the world’s largest petrochemical complexes\xa0that also contributes to the majority of emissions from industry as at 2014, according to the Government's most recent published statistics in the Biennial Update Report to the UN Framework on Climate Change Convention.\nThis is not to say that adaptation, which is the focus of the Government’s existing efforts, is not important.\xa0\nIn fact, mitigation and adaptation need to come hand-in-hand.\xa0\nAs philosopher Dale Jamieson has pointed out, adaptation without mitigation is futile. This is because the less mitigation is done, the worse warming will be, and the more adaptation will be required.\xa0\nReducing emissions to remain within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming gives adaptation measures higher chances of success.\xa0Indeed, failure to mitigate might bring\xa0climate beyond tipping points, from which it might not even be possible for us to adapt.\nSINGAPORE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM\nThirdly, while it is true that Singapore only represents a small proportion of global emissions, we should not pretend that we are not part of the problem.\xa0\nA study by the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Steven Davis and Ken Caldeira published in 2010 showed that Singapore ranked in the top three countries for net imported emissions per capita and consumption emissions per capita.\xa0\nIn addition, being a small nation has not kept Singapore from tackling ambitious challenges such as social housing and smart city planning, with our successful outcomes modelled as positive policy examples by the global community.\xa0\nReducing emissions at the scale and speed required could also bolster our expertise offering to other developing cities in the region and be a new opportunity to demonstrate to the world a Singaporean model of true sustainability.\xa0\nIn order to bring about the collective understanding and meaningful action the commentary calls for, these are the facts we must first be clear-eyed about.\nThe authors are volunteers with 350 Singapore, a grassroots group that aims to inspire the public, policymakers, and industry to get Singapore on track to a world within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, through a just transition to a net-zero carbon future by 2050.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     sustainability ', '     climate change ', '     environment ', '     pollution ', '     global warming ']}"

      Orang Asli land under threat in Pahang as Musang King plantations grow
  </h1>, 'text': 'RAUB, Pahang: The loud grunts of a crane’s engine pierced the silence of Bukit Telaga Village, near the foot of Pahang’s tourist hotspot Fraser’s Hill.\xa0The sound\xa0reverberated through the forest and interrupted the tireless croaking of crickets.\n""That’s them at it again,"" said Mr Tam, an Orang Asli in his 40s who has lived at the village all his life.\xa0“Clearing forests to make way for more durian farms. The sound gets louder each day.”\xa0\nThe villager, who only wanted to be known as Mr Tam,\xa0belongs to one of the nine Orang Asli families who live at Bukit Telaga. He told CNA that they\xa0are worried about how the plantations are encroaching on\xa0their land and surrounding forests where they gather food from.\nHe recounted\xa0incidents when members of his clan would argue with plantation workers for entering their village to look for more land.\n“It’s not peaceful here anymore. We don’t sleep well because we are scared the fruits and property we have will be\xa0stolen,” said Mr Tam.\nIndeed, the Orang Asli feel they are under siege from the growing number of plantations in the area. There is also a biodiversity dimension to the issue, with activists saying that the clearing of land will affect Malayan tigers\' habitats.\xa0\nOn the other hand, the plantation owners say the Orang Asli can benefit from\xa0employment opportunities and wealth.\n""THEY WILL FORCE US TO MOVE""\xa0\nBukit Telaga sits 500 metres upslope from rows of durian trees within fenced plantations. When CNA visited the area, there were at least three durian farms nearby.\nMr Tam said he was uncomfortable with the number of plantations that have sprouted up at Fraser’s Hill in recent years.\n“One day they will force us to move because these (plantation owners) want to make more money, I’m sure of it. We don’t want to move. We have lived here in the forest all our lives,” he said.\nMr Tam and his clan live on a hillside clearing facing the Hulu Sempam area, a piece of previously forested land that has been cleared in recent years.\nIn 2018, Malaysian daily the Star reported that the 404-hectare plot of land, which borders a water catchment area and forest reserve, is being cleared for a Musang King durian plantation.\nA logging licence was also awarded for another piece of land adjacent to the plot, the report said.\nWhile the Pahang state government has gazetted most of the forests in and surrounding Fraser\'s Hill as protected forests for water catchment and soil protection purposes, there are still small pockets of forests, such as Hulu Sempam, which are not legally protected.\nRaub is renowned regionally for being a durian hub that specialises in producing Musang King durian, a premium variety popular for its creamy texture and yellow fruit.\nInternational demand for this variety, also known as Mao Shan Wang, has grown over the years, fuelled by\xa0consumers from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.\nTo feed this growing demand, plantation owners, with the permission of the Pahang state government, have cleared the Hulu Sempam rainforest to grow durians.\n""IT\'S ALL ABOUT CASH""\nThe chief of Bukit Telaga Village, Tok Batin Ahsai, told CNA that the territorial lines between his district and the plantations have blurred in recent months.\n“We don’t have any authority to chase people away; that (land belongs to) the government. But as long as we are allowed to live here, we will protect our land,” he added.\nMs Sophine Tann, president of non-government organisation PEKA Malaysia, echoed the residents’ sentiments that the forests on Fraser’s Hill should be preserved.\nMs Tann has worked with indigenous people in various parts of peninsula\xa0Malaysia, and she noted\xa0that Pahang\'s Orang Asli\xa0are increasing “threatened” by durian plantation owners.\n“The durian industry is all about cash right now. Plantation owners want to grow durians, so (when) they propose (expansion) to the state government and Pahang Forestry Department, they get approval quickly. This is the kind of attitude that will threaten the rights of the Orang Asli to live in their home,” she told CNA.\n“We have to protest these actions. We Malaysians have the right to our forests, not the state or federal government,” Ms Tann added.\nDuring Raub’s International Durian Festival last week, Pahang’s chief minister Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail emphasised that Raub should utilise its land to boost its production of Musang King durian to attract tourists, especially visitors from China.\nHowever, Mr Wan Rosdy did highlight\xa0to farm owners that they should be more aware of the\xa0environmental angle.\n“I want to remind all plantation owners to take care of the environment while farming. and all owners follow the rules and regulations, and don’t harm the environment.\n“If these things are adhered to, it will create a positive environment and boost the economy of Pahang,” he added.\nORANG ASLI CAN BENEFIT FROM JOBS: DURIAN FARM OWNER\xa0\nThe growers maintain that their plantations are located within land sanctioned for the cultivation of the fruit by the state government.\nOne example is Mr Jovi Kong, who owns two durian farms in Raub\xa0totalling 85 acres.\xa0One of his farms is 5S Durian Station, which also has a restaurant area serving durian and drinks.\xa0It is located on Fraser’s Hill, around 600 metres downslope from Bukit Telaga Village.\xa0\nMr Kong believes that the Orang Asli settlement in the area would also benefit from the Musang King riches that Raub offers.\n“Actually, you can’t say that the Musang King plantations have\xa0negatively impacted the Orang Asli. They bring\xa0employment and help them\xa0earn\xa0money,” he said.\n“Raub is very different from other towns. People living here are rich, there’s the spending power and people have jobs because of the durians,” Mr Kong added.\nMeanwhile, Mr Lu Yuee Thing, another Raub durian plantation owner in the area, told CNA that he has farmed durians in the area for 40 years. \xa0\nHis farm – Uncle Thing Durian Leisure Farm – grows largely Musang King and Black Thorn varieties. Both are premium durians that are popular among China and Hong Kong importers.\nHe denies that his land was ever owned by Orang Asli, and stressed that the land was given to his father and other plantation owners by the British government in the 1940s.\n“The question (that we are stealing Orang Asli land) is usually fielded by foreigners who are trying to spoil Malaysia’s image,"" he said.\nHe noted that managing durian farms is a laborious and cost-intensive endeavour.\xa0""Durian trees are not like rubber and palm trees, where they can slowly mature on their own. If you don’t manage durian trees well, they will die.”\nMALAYAN TIGERS IMPACTED?\xa0\nMeanwhile, wildlife activists have claimed that the durian plantations at Hulu Sempam are threatening the survival of the Malayan tiger.\xa0\nMs Siti Zuraidah Abidin,\xa0World Wildlife Fund’s head of protected areas in peninsula\xa0Malaysia said Hulu Sempam\xa0has been identified as an area where the critically endangered Malayan tigers are expected to live in.\nWhile\xa0the surrounding forests of the Hulu Sempam area - which are confirmed tiger habitats, are protected by the government, she warned that the clearing of forests can have wider-reaching consequences.\n“The clearance of natural forest for any sort of plantation in tiger habitats would not only fragment and reduce (their) natural habitat, but also likely expose the area to higher poaching incidences,"" she said\n""This is especially so since forests that were inaccessible before would now be accessible through roads that lead to such plantations, which in turn facilitates poaching.”\nShe added that the Hulu Sempam area was identified as an Environmentally Sensitive Area Rank 1 in the Pahang Structural Plan 2050, which means that “protection of its ecological integrity is of the highest priority”.\nDurian growers, however, dismiss the possibility.\xa0\nMr Kong said\xa0he has never seen a tiger anywhere near his plantations.\xa0“When the tigers hear that there are humans in the area, they would stay away in the forest. We don’t approach them and they don’t disturb us,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      Singaporeans head to fire hotspot village in Indonesia to tackle haze
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR:\xa0A Singaporean charity is working with villagers in Indonesia to restore ancient peatlands, seeking to curb the haze that chokes the region every year, organisers said on Thursday (Jul 18).\nIndonesian farmers burn huge swathes of land every year to clear land for agricultural expansion, creating a vast haze that clouds the skies over large parts of Southeast Asia - including Singapore.\nNow the People\'s Movement to Stop Haze (PM Haze), an advocacy group in Singapore, has launched a peatland restoration project in a tiny Indonesian village that suffered bad fires in 2014.\n""One of the things we realised is that good management of peatland is very important for managing haze in the region,"" PM Haze executive director Benjamin Tay told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\n""A lot of the haze comes over from that part of Indonesia into Singapore, so by preventing fires and haze in that region, we prevent haze from coming to Singapore,"" he said.\nPeaty soil is particularly flammable when dry, often causing fires to spread beyond their intended areas.\nWhen peatlands are drained or cleared by fire, often to make way for oil palm plantations or farming, the carbon is released into the atmosphere where it traps heat, contributing to climate change.\nMr Tay\'s group is improving canals in the area around Sungai Tohor, a farming village on an island off the coast of Sumatra with a population of about 1,000, to ensure the local peatlands can be kept wet.\nPM Haze is also educating villagers about peatland conservation, setting up a nursery for tree replanting, and organising fire prevention workshops.\nOne of the worst\xa0peat and forest fire crises was in 2015 when a thick haze blanketed much of Southeast Asia, causing billions of dollars of economic losses.\nAbout 2.6 million hectares of land in Indonesia was burned between June and October 2015, mainly on Indonesia\'s Sumatra and Borneo islands, according to a 2016 World Bank report.\nA Harvard University study the same year linked the haze to more than\xa0100,000 premature deaths in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore during 2015.\nMr Tay said he hoped the scheme would be scaled up once the Sungai Tohor community was\xa0able to lead the project itself.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Plaintiffs in Jakarta air pollution lawsuit against government brace for long court tussle
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: The moment Leona\xa0set foot in Jakarta - a bustling metropolis of 10 million residents - she knew that she had a lot of adjusting to do.\nThe Bali native could deal with\xa0the heat and\xa0Jakarta’s notorious traffic congestion. However, the smog\xa0and dust\xa0in the environment was something else. \xa0\n“I was shocked. Everywhere I went, the air is polluted with smoke, dust\xa0and fumes from car exhausts, people burning their rubbish and construction works. It was so overwhelming,” she told CNA.\nJust months after moving to Jakarta, her asthma - which she suffered as a child and thought had gone away as she reached adolescence\xa0- returned and gradually worsened.\n“I didn\'t\xa0want my parents to worry, so I never told them about my health,” she said, adding that she had\xa0to secretly reallocate her monthly allowances to buy medicine, inhalers and masks.\nAfter three years of battling the effects of Jakarta’s worsening air pollution, the 22-year old university student who only wanted to be known as Leona, decided to fight back.\n“By chance, I heard that some Jakarta residents were preparing a lawsuit against the government for doing nothing about the air pollution in Jakarta and they were calling others to join as plaintiffs,” she\xa0recounted. “So I signed up.”\nShe is among those who started an organic\xa0movement to draw attention to the worsening pollution. While social media has multiplied the attention given to their cause, the plaintiffs are taking nothing for granted in what is expected to be a long judicial battle.\xa0\xa0\nOn Jul 4, Ms Leona and 30 other residents from different walks of life - activists, academics, celebrities, motorcycle taxi drivers - filed a citizens’\xa0lawsuit against President Joko Widodo, the Environment and Forestry Minister, the Health Minister, the Home Affairs Minister as well as the Governor of Jakarta and the two provinces surrounding the capital: West Java and Banten, demanding their rights to clean air.\n“There were actually more (who wanted to join in),” said Ms Ayu Eza Tiara, the lawyer in the case. “But we ignored applicants who are affiliated to political parties and those who might have conflict\xa0of interest.”\nMs Tiara said the lawsuit was a last-ditch effort to get the government to pay attention to Jakarta’s poor air quality.\nACTIVISTS\' CONCERNS DISMISSED\nIn 2016, a coalition of environmental groups and the Legal Aid Foundation began collecting data of just how bad air pollution in Jakarta had\xa0been, she recounted.\xa0\nThey spent the next two years trying to present their findings\xa0to various ministries and agencies.\xa0""Some agreed to see us. Some ignored us altogether. But all in all, no one did anything,” she said.\n“They even ignored us when we gave them an ultimatum in December. We threatened them that we will take this to court if they do nothing within 60 days.” \xa0\nWith the presidential election in April which saw Mr\xa0Widodo securing a second term - and the subsequent legal challenge and street protests launched by his rival, former general Prabowo Subianto and his supporters - occupying the entire\xa0nation\'s\xa0attention, the lawsuit was briefly put on hold.\nGreenpeace Indonesia campaigner Bondan Andriyanu told CNA that the activists had wanted the government to come up with a comprehensive research-based plan to reduce air pollution.\nEven with the deadline pushed back for several months, “the government didn’t even provide so much as a promise that they would do that,” he said.\xa0\nHowever, there may have been a silver lining in the delay.\xa0From Jun 19, Jakarta repeatedly ranked as the world’s most polluted city according to air quality monitor AirVisual.\xa0\nThe Indonesian capital had\xa0dethroned\xa0notoriously polluted cities like New Delhi and Beijing.\nJakarta’s Air Quality Index (AQI), which calculates the health risk posed by six main pollutants, peaked at an unhealthy level of 240 on Jun 27. That’s nearly half of the maximum score of 500, and 60 points shy from being considered hazardous. \xa0\nSOCIAL MEDIA UPROAR\nIt was a wake-up call. Suddenly, everyone in Jakarta was talking about the pollution and the\xa0issue\xa0gained traction on social media.\n“A friend contacted me, alerting me of the fact that Jakarta had just been named the world’s most polluted city,” said professional photographer Pio Kharismayongha. “We wanted more people to be aware of this. We agreed that we should do something about it.”\nMr Pio had been regularly telling his 28,000 followers on Twitter to share their best photos of a given subject using the hashtag #SetorFoto (upload your photos). So it was natural that he initiated a modified version of the hashtag\n“Always failed to get a good view while taking photos of Jakarta during the day because of how bad the air pollution is. Do you have photos showing how bad the air pollution in Jakarta is? Share it with the hashtag #SetorFotoPolusi (upload your pollution photos) if you do,” his Jun 25 tweet read.\nThe tweet got more than 400 retweets, more than 150 replies and the hashtag became one of the trending topics in Indonesia.\nMr Pio said he was shocked at the photos people uploaded, depicting views of the city blanketed with thick, black smog which reduced the visibility down to\xa0sometimes no more than a few hundred metres.\n“I was shocked by the photos they uploaded. I always knew that Jakarta is polluted. But the photos made everyone realised just how polluted the city really is,” the photographer\xa0said.\nEven today, social media users are regularly uploading photos of the capital shrouded in a mist of fumes, dust and smoke or sharing\xa0a screen grab of the day’s AQI. “It has become an obsession,” he said. \xa0\nSoon everyone was talking about Jakarta’s poor air quality and local media started to pay attention to the group of residents preparing to sue the government.\n“We had always planned on lodging the lawsuit this month. We didn’t time it or anything. It was all a coincidence. But the social media uproar gave us the confidence that people are supporting us,” the lawyer, Ms Tiara said. \xa0\xa0\n“It was impossible to add more plaintiffs, but people lined up stating that they are willing to provide testimonies in court.”\nA 2016 study by non-government organisation Committee to Phase out Leaded Fuel (KPBB) said\xa0that vehicles accounted for 47 per cent of the air pollution in the capital.\xa0\nEmissions from factories were second at 22 per cent, followed by road dust and households (11 per cent each), waste incineration (five per cent) and construction work (four\xa0per cent).\nGOVERNMENT\xa0METHODOLOGY\xa0SHOWS AIR QUALITY IS MODERATE\nAmid a growing public backlash, the Environment and Forestry Ministry has attempted to cast doubt on data provided by AirVisual.\n“We have our own data and our own standards. And according to our data, the air quality was still in the moderate level. Only vulnerable people like babies and the elderly are at risk,” ministry spokesman Djati Witjaksono Hadi told CNA.\n“We don’t know how AirVisual got their data from and what methodology they use. That’s why we want to meet these environmental groups and plaintiffs. We need to agree on which data we want to use.”\nChief of the Jakarta provincial government’s environment office, Andono Warih also doubted AirVisual’s assessment.\n“As far as I know, they based their assessment from satellite images and readings taken from several monitoring stations at the city centre. We have monitoring stations spread all across Jakarta, not just the city centre. So on average, the city’s air quality is not that bad,” he said.\nGreenpeace campaigner Mr Andriyanu said the government’s insistence that air pollution was under control was misleading.\n“The national standard is much more lax than elsewhere in Asia or as recommended by the World Health Organisation. Indonesia’s threshold was determined in 1999 and we desperately need to update it,” he said.\nMr Andriyanu said the government also needs to have its monitoring stations standardised. He noted that some stations are unable to measure PM2.5 pollutants, while others do not capture data in real-time.\n“Earlier this year there were forest fires in Jambi province (on the island of Sumatra), sending thick smog which caused thousands of people to suffer respiratory problems. And yet the monitoring stations still recorded the air pollution as mild,” he said.\nLONG COURT BATTLE ON THE CARDS\nMs Tiara, the lawyer said judging from the government’s response, it would be a long and arduous battle in the court\xa0for things to improve.\xa0\n“I predict it will take months, or possibly more than a year before a ruling is issued,” she said.\nThe court is supposed to hear arguments from both sides on Aug 1. “I think the government will try to stall the proceedings by not showing up or ask for more time,” she predicted.\nAnother plaintiff, Istu Prayogi, said he cannot\xa0afford to wait around for the government to get\xa0its act\xa0together.\nIn 2010, the part-time lecturer who drives Grab to supplement his income was diagnosed with a condition which made him highly sensitive to polluted air.\n“Even with the respiratory mask on, the pollution in Jakarta can still cause splitting headaches and runny nose. So I quit my job in Jakarta and found work closer to my home in Depok (a suburb near the capital),” Mr Prayogi said.\n“I still use masks everywhere I go but I found myself becoming less dependant on pain killers and anti-inflammatory drugs\xa0… I used to consume 20 of these pills in two weeks. Now, not even once a week,” he said while showing his prescription medication.\xa0\xa0\n“But once the court in Jakarta starts hearing the case, I might have to go back to my earlier consumption.”\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     environment ']}"

      Troubled waters: China-fuelled cruise boom sparks environment fears
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Cruises are enjoying a boom fuelled in part by hordes of Chinese tourists taking to the high seas, but green groups warn a wave of hulking new liners may cause environmental devastation.\nGone are the days when cruising was the preserve of retirees, who would while away the hours lounging in deckchairs, playing bingo or taking part in formal dinner-dances.\nModern liners resemble floating, futuristic cities capable of carrying thousands of passengers, where robot bartenders serve drinks and passengers can enjoy hi-tech entertainment.\nMany of the new, more sophisticated ships aim to appeal to the rapidly growing Chinese cruise market - now the second-biggest in the world after the US - and are choosing cities in the Asian giant as their home ports.\nAs tourism booms in increasingly wealthy China, there is a growing ""desire and enthusiasm"" for cruises, said Wang Mi, spokeswoman for Chinese online travel agency Tuniu.\n""Cruise products are very popular with seniors, families and honeymooners in China,"" she told AFP.\nAbout 30 million people worldwide are expected to go on a cruise this year, up nearly 70 per cent from a decade ago, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.\nWhile the more mature US market remains the largest globally, China is growing fast - last year about 2.4 million Chinese tourists went on a cruise, more than triple the number in 2014.\nThere is rising demand right across Asia with growth at double digits in some countries, said Gavin Smith, senior vice president international of US cruise giant Royal Caribbean.\n""The Asian market is increasingly important to global cruising,"" he said.\nMONSTER LINERS\nBut the rising number of monster liners, often hundreds of metres long and several stories high, has increased concerns about environmental damage.\n""We see a big range of environmental impacts from the cruise industry - everything from air pollution to waste water, sewage, oily discharges, food wastes, plastics,"" Marcie Keever, oceans and vessels programme director at Friends of the Earth US, told AFP.\nA major concern is high levels of sulphur oxide emissions, a toxic gas which causes respiratory problems and lung disease, and can lead to acid rain and damage aquatic species.\nIn 2017 ships operated by Carnival Corporation - the world\'s largest cruise company, which has several brands - emitted 10 times more sulphur oxide in European seas than all the passenger vehicles in the continent, according to a study by NGO Transport & Environment.\nEfforts are being made to reduce the amount of the gas emitted. New industry standards will from next year require all ships to cut sulphur oxide content in fuel to a maximum 0.5 per cent from the current 3.5 per cent limit.\nThere are also worries about the impact of mammoth vessels on the cities they berth at during voyages.\nA 13-deck liner crashed into a tourist boat in a Venice canal last month, injuring four tourists, and prompting a protest from local residents who called for a ban on large cruise ships in the UNESCO World Heritage site.\nIn addition, ships jettisoning waste at sea and the huge amounts of electricity used by the vessels have angered environmentalists. In June Carnival was fined US$20 million in the United States for dumping plastic waste into the ocean and other environmental violations.\nSKYDIVING, VIRTUAL REALITY TRAMPOLINING\nIndustry players insist they are doing their part to reduce pollution.\nRoyal Caribbean has installed systems that clean almost all sulphur oxide and other pollutants from emissions, according to Nick Rose, the firm\'s director for environmental programmes.\n""Cruise ships are cleaner than ever before and improving with each new class of ship,"" Rose told AFP.\nTypical of the new generation of liners is Royal Caribbean\'s Spectrum of the Seas.\nCustom-built for the Asian market and billed as the region\'s biggest cruise ship, the 345-metre\xa0vessel can carry more than\xa05,600 guests.\nEntertainment includes simulated skydiving in a wind tunnel, bouncing on a trampoline while wearing a virtual reality headset and bumper cars, all aimed at an increasingly younger generation of cruise-goers.\nThere are 17 restaurants onboard and the huge range of accommodation includes a two-storey family suite that comes with a private karaoke room and children\'s slide.\nThis can cater to Chinese tourists who often go on cruises in large groups.\nPassenger Sylvia Bau, a veteran cruise-goer on holiday with six relatives, was amazed at the rapid growth of liners over the years.\n""You can live in the ship for days without getting bored,"" the 58-year-old Singaporean said as the vessel made a call in the city-state, one of several stops in Southeast Asia before arriving at its home port of Shanghai.\n', 'related_topics': ['     cruise ', '     Travel ', '     China ', '     environment ']}"

      Drink water from a public toilet? Singapore's taps put to the test
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Esther Chia is a health-conscious homemaker — she has a water filtration system at home that cost her more than S$2,000, and it also makes her water alkaline.\nWhen she is out with her family, she always buys them bottled water. Her eldest daughter, in particular, drinks only from mineral water brand Evian.\n“She believes it’s from the French Alps. It’s spring water and … has all the good properties that’s good for the body,” said Chia.\nTo shower, they use their filtered water, and the family doesn’t ever drink directly from the tap. In her household, tap water is used only for general cleaning and washing dishes.\n“There are so many sediments in it. You don’t even know what’s inside. So it makes you wonder: What have you been drinking?” she questioned.\nShe is not the only one convinced that the bottled and filtered versions are superior, as Talking Point explores why many Singaporeans resist drinking tap water, especially from public taps. (Watch the episode here.)\nDIRTY ENVIRONMENT, UNCLEAN WATER?\nSingapore is a global hydro-hub, home to more than 200 water companies and about 25 research centres. And national water agency PUB has gone to great lengths to monitor, treat and improve its drinking water supply.\nSo Singaporeans are aware that tap water is “clean and safe to drink”, said Erny Kartolo, one of the founders of the Drink Wise, Drink Tap campaign. “But the surroundings of the tap … affect their perception of the tap water”.\nIn an old building, for example, people assume that the water pipes “are also old and rusty” and therefore “contaminate the water”, which is untrue, she cited.\nWATCH: Is water from public toilets safe to drink? (2:44)\nTo find out how credible such fears are, Talking Point collected water samples from 15 taps: Five in eateries and shopping centres, five in public toilets such as at hawker centres and five in HDB flats across the island.\nThe samples were sent to a laboratory to investigate for bacteria and harmful metal contaminants such as lead and arsenic. And the results showed that there was no presence of bacteria in any of the samples.\nAs for trace metals, they ranged from 0.02 to 0.3 parts per billion (ppb), compared to the World Health Organisation’s guideline of 10 ppb.\n“It’s well below the guideline … so it’s very safe,” noted Marchwood Laboratory Services’ head of quality assurance, Flordelina Umalia, who has spent the past 12 years testing water samples from various sources in Singapore.\nIt won’t have any significant effect on your health … Your body can easily process it.\nThe test results across the 15 samples were also “all quite consistent”, showing that the water from all the taps were “very clean”, even those from dirty surroundings.\nSome people have observed that when they use a piece of cloth to filter their tap water, it turns brown after some time, but Umalia explained that these particulates are naturally occurring minerals in the water.\n‘NEGLIGIBLE’ AMOUNT OF MINERALS\nWhile Singapore’s tap water is safe to drink, many health-conscious consumers believe that bottled water — from alkaline to oxygenated water — have more health benefits.\nSales of bottled water have also increased over the years, from S$161.3 million in 2013 to S$179.4 million last year, according to research firm Euromonitor International.\nAccredited dietician Jaclyn Reutens, from Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants, said that while many believe the minerals in mineral water will improve their nutrition, “what people don’t realise is that the levels of minerals are actually very low”.\nFor example, there are seven milligrammes of calcium in a bottle of mineral water, compared to 200 mg in a slice of cheese.\nAnd to obtain the amount of potassium in a banana, one may need to drink up to 100 litres of mineral water.\nThe amount of calcium, magnesium and potassium in a bottle of mineral water is “so negligible” that it “doesn’t make a difference”, she said.\nThere are also claims that oxygenated water can help sports performance. But the way to “get more oxygen into your body” is through the respiratory system, that is, the lungs, explained Reutens.\nIf you drink oxygenated water, there’s no way that oxygen is going to get into your bloodstream … I don’t think that can happen physiologically.\nAs for alkaline water, advocates think it can neutralise an acidic body, which they believe is prone to diabetes, gout and cancer.\nThe stomach is meant to be acidic, however, to kill the pathogens found in food and help digestive enzymes to break down protein.\n“So if you’re trying to make your stomach more alkaline, you’re defeating the purpose of your stomach,” she countered.\nTASTE TEST\nIf it is a matter of taste, can the public tell the difference between tap and bottled water?\nWhen Talking Point presented people with tap water and two brands of bottled water in a taste test, some people mistook tap water for mineral water.\n“By and large, people couldn’t really tell the difference,” said programme host Steven Chia. “And if I didn’t tell them where I got the water from, no one would’ve suspected it came from a toilet tap.”\nInstead of paying for bottled water then, a “good solution” would be to install more dispensers like water coolers “all around Singapore”, where they can also refill their water bottles, suggested Kartolo.\n“We found that people had very different perceptions about public taps compared to water dispensers or water coolers. So public taps are a complete no-no … But a water cooler is totally fine because it looks nice.”\nWatch the episode here.\xa0Talking Point airs on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9.30pm.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      No ifs or butts: Cigarette rubbish is littering Singapore's coastline
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mention the phrase “marine litter” and chances are that images of plastic straws or bottles would be the first things to spring to mind.\xa0\nYet these items, while often found in local waters, pale in comparison to the number of cigarette butts littering the world’s shorelines.\nAwareness of single-use plastic waste has been gaining traction in Singapore, most recently with the move by more than 270 food and beverage outlets to eliminate plastic straws.\nBut at a time when many other single-use plastic waste items\xa0- from plastic bags to single-use straws and cutlery - are facing growing public attention, have cigarette butts managed to slip under the radar?\nFor more than 20 years, Mr N Sivasothi, a senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Department of Biological Sciences, has been coordinating volunteer clean-ups along Singapore’s waterways and coastlines, including the local segment of global clean-up exercise the International Coastal Cleanup.\nThe annual event sees volunteers around the world collecting and documenting debris littering their respective countries\'\xa0shorelines, waterways and beaches.\xa0\nThe data is then collated and published by non-profit organisation Ocean Conservancy, which coordinates the International Coastal Cleanup.\nCigarette butts have consistently been among the top items found both locally and globally, Mr Sivasothi told CNA.\nLast year 20,915 cigarette butts were found during the International Coastal Cleanup in Singapore.\nThis figure was nearly double the number of straws and stirrers found (10,885) and about 1.6 times the number of plastic beverage bottles (12,594). The butts were\xa0second only in numerical terms to litter from foam pieces (which have a higher propensity to break down into hundreds of smaller items).\n“It’s consistently a top item,” said Mr Sivasothi, who is also a research associate at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum.\nIt is also an item which, unlike other types of shoreline litter in Singapore, is more likely to stem from local littering.\nAlthough a lot of litter along the country’s shores is washed in from the region, the concentration of cigarette butts along certain public beaches points to their local origin, according to Mr Sivasothi.\n“We always say the highest number of cigarette butts will come from East Coast and Changi (beaches), and you’re not going to find any in, say, mangroves,” he said. “Because people go to the beach and smoke.”\n“The profile when you go to the non-public beaches (is that) the cigarette butts disappear,” he added. “So they’re not being floated in. So it is a local issue.”\nHowever, Mr Sivasothi pointed out that the nature of the annual clean-up - which is normally held on the third Saturday of September - means that it only represents a single snapshot in time, and volunteer efforts across the different clean-up locations across Singapore can vary.\n“It’s a single data snapshot in September. And then, the effort is quite variable,” he said.\xa0\n“Certain groups might scrutinise the trash line very closely and pick up thousands of cigarette butts. You send another group, they may focus on the larger items and miss all of that.”\nYet the prevalence of cigarette butts is consistent with the aggregated global International Coastal Cleanup tally, which has consistently seen cigarette butts topping its list of top-10 most-found items every year.\nIn its report for the 2010 International Coastal Cleanup, which marked the exercise\'s 25th anniversary, Ocean Conservancy released data showing that about 52.9 million cigarettes/cigarette filters had been collected over the past 25 years of clean-ups - making up\xa032 per cent of total debris items and\xa0enough to fill 100 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\nBUTT WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?\nA lot of people might not recognise cigarette butts as containing plastic - but they do, with the filters in cigarette butts made up of cellulose acetate, a type of plastic that does not readily biodegrade.\nThin cellulose acetate fibres are packed tightly to remove harmful contaminants from smoke before it is inhaled, with a single filter possibly containing more than 12,000\xa0such fibres, according to Associate Professor Suresh Valiyaveettil at NUS\' chemistry department.\nThe large amount\xa0of cigarette butt litter as well as the fact that cigarettes contain harmful chemicals that can leach out into the environment were cited as key concerns by the academic.\n“Personally, I think cigarette butts are even more dangerous than any other plastic item owing to the large amounts and the harmful chemicals leaching from them,” he told CNA.\n“Usually, single-use plastic items such as straws, plastic bags etc\xa0are hydrophobic (do not mix with water) and therefore do not degrade in a short period,” he said. “They do contain a lot of additives, but the hydrophobicity of the object slows the leaching of small molecules into the environment from common plastic items.”\n“In the case of cigarette butts, the tobacco absorbs moisture readily and many chemicals are released into the environment in a short period of time.”\nThese chemicals can be deadly to organisms in the environment, with a study published in the BMJ’s Tobacco Control journal finding cigarette butt leachate “acutely toxic” to representative marine and freshwater fish - sometimes at a lethal concentration (LC50) of about one cigarette butt per litre of water for certain types of fish.\nAnd as\xa0with other types of plastic pollution, cigarette filters\xa0can disintegrate and eventually\xa0break into microplastics, according to NUS PhD student Amanda Lim, who studies the sources and impact of marine debris.\n""Cigarette filters are made of cellulose acetate fibers, a variant of rayon,"" she said. ""Filters could disintegrate into microfibres and become microplastic.""\nFILTERING OUT POTENTIAL CAUSES\nOne reason for the large amount of cigarette butt litter could come down to its relative lack of visibility, especially on sandy beaches,\xa0as compared to larger items such as a plastic bottle or brightly coloured straws.\xa0\nUnlike in some other countries which have smoking bans on beaches, smoking is allowed on beaches in Singapore according to the National Environment Agency’s website.\n“Singaporeans rarely talk about cigarette butts under the marine plastics issue,” said Mr Sivasothi, adding that global anti-plastic pollution campaigns also tend to focus on other items.\n“I think visually it does not create as much impact. Visually they see the water bottles, the food containers and the plastic bags as the most visual component,” he said. “And then they hear about bans around the world, and bans around the world tend to be focussing on these components as well; water bottles, plastic bags, food containers.”\nIn addition, tossing away cigarette butts might not be viewed in the same light as other forms of littering, according to a sociological study of littering in Singapore commissioned by NEA\xa0in 2009.\nCalling cigarette butt littering “a confounding behaviour”, the study found that the cultural acceptability of cigarette butt littering could be contributing to the issue.\n“Smokers revealed that it is culturally acceptable and expected among the smoking circle to ‘flick the cigarette butt after smoking’ or ‘stub out the cigarette under the soles of their shoes’,” said the study. “One informant even emphasised that the flicking of cigarette butts ‘is something that is universal among smokers’ and a behaviour that is constantly portrayed in popular media and culture.”\n“In fact, a few mentioned that it is very ‘manly’ to do so compared to carrying the cigarette butt all the way to the nearest bin.”\nPeople might also not see cigarette butts as litter compared to bigger items, said the study.\n“Many respondents rationalise that small items are not litter, for their perceived harm to the environment and aesthetics is negligible,” it concluded. “Thus, parking coupon tabs, cigarette butts and small pieces of paper are among the items rationalised as \'not litter\'.”\nBut ultimately cigarette butt litter still sits within\xa0a wider, longstanding plastic pollution issue, points out Mr Sivasothi.\n""The message hasn’t changed you know, for more than a decade,"" he said. ""It’s that single-use consumer plastic represents the highest proportion of items that are polluting our seas.""\n""So really if you say what’s the single message - (it\'s) how do we cut down on plastic use?""\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

The move is part of the PACT (Plastic ACTion) initiative by WWF, which is supported by the National Environment Agency and Zero Waste SG.\nMs Melissa Lam, who started Bamboo Straw Girl, a business selling biodegradable straws, suggested\xa0that the move represents\xa0a ""step"" rather than an ""achievement"".\n“It’s got a lot of publicity, a lot of countries have done this and we’re quite slow to the game,"" she said. ""It’s not going to be the be all and end all of the problem.\xa0\n""This is not an achievement, it’s just a step. It is small but it catches the attention.""\nMs Lam added that attitudes towards the use of plastic straws have been changing.\n""When I go to the coffeeshop and order a drink but refuse a straw, the coffeeshop uncle\xa0will now say:\xa0\'Oh you’re recycling.\' In the past, I would have to explain myself.\n""Right now people are generally aware, it\'s\xa0whether they wanted take that step to action.”\nPeople in Singapore use about\xa02.2 million straws daily,\xa0according to\xa0a 2018 report by AlphaBeta, The Final Straw and the Cyan Project.\nMs Olivia Choong, who co-founded\xa0environmental group Green Drinks Singapore, added that some companies may have been adopting a \'wait and see\'\xa0attitude and this move could nudge them towards reducing\xa0usage of straws.\n“Its a good first step because there are all a lot of business waiting for somebody to start first,"" said Ms Choong.\xa0""I do think that with all these people saying yes, they always need somebody to start and see that it is doable.\n""Other companies won’t want to lose, these companies look good and other companies will think that now its time … It’s just the starting point - it\'s like the poster child at the moment. It\'s something a lot of people can get behind, so why not ride the wave?”\nAccording to Singstat, there were more than\xa07,500\xa0food establishments in Singapore in 2016\xa0- the 270 outlets participating in PACT comprise about 3.5 per cent of the total number. Several companies had also announced plans to eliminate plastic straws last year, including KFC, Starbucks, Burger King and Resorts World Sentosa.\nIn December 2018, Yakult Singapore said it would no longer provide straws with its probiotic cultured milk drinks, and that it was looking at alternative materials to replace plastic as part of its packaging.\nGOING THE EXTRA MILE\nRather than just phasing out straws, some companies who are part of the WWF initiative have taken additional steps.\nTake Foreword Coffee, a cafe which also incentivises consumers to bring their own cups by providing a 10 per cent discount when they do so. The cafe serves cold drinks in paper cups and has eliminated the use of straws since it began\xa0operations.\n""We did not face with much backlash from consumers with our straw-less practices even before the straw-less movement become more prominent,""\xa0founder Lim Wei Jie told CNA.\n""It is encouraging to see larger businesses to also take part in this movement. With such solidarity, the green movement is no longer just a publicity stunt but an inclusive movement for other businesses to take part for the good of the environment.""\nAnother organisation which has made a\xa0push towards eliminating plastic waste is Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS).\nIn 2017, WRS\xa0installed 27 water dispensers across its\xa0four parks to encourage the use of refillable bottles over single-use plastic bottles. A year later, all F&B outlets operated by WRS went straw-free, and it stopped\xa0all sales of bottled water, replacing them with carton boxed water.\n""Sustainability is a core part of Wildlife Reserve Singapore’s values as it plays a major role in our commitment to protecting biodiversity,"" said\xa0Dr Cheng Wen Haur, WRS\'\xa0deputy chief executive officer.\n""Plastic pollution is a threat to wildlife and their habitats, with over a million birds and animals killed by plastic waste every year via ingestion or being trapped in them. As a conservation-minded organisation, WRS is committed to reducing usage of plastics –\xa0beyond straws – and single-use items across aspects of our daily operations, wherever possible.""\nBut beyond the measures put in\xa0place by individual organisations, concrete steps need to be taken at a higher\xa0level, stressed\xa0Plastic-Lite Singapore founder Aarti Giri.\nSingapore uses about 1.76 billion plastic items each year, according to the Singapore Environment Council’s position paper published in 2018. This includes 820 million plastic bags from supermarkets, 467 million PET bottles and 473 million plastic disposable items.\n""If you request people (to make a change), it may not be enough to mitigate the monstrous public problem,""\xa0said Ms Giri.\n""If you really want make concrete headway, it has to be at policy level ...

These are the four main pillars of waste that are generated by Singaporeans daily, according to the organisers.\nEvery item has an accompanying QR code that carries information on how it can help address the environmental impact of less sustainable alternatives.\nItems are not for sale at the shop, but the QR codes link visitors to the respective product pages should visitors wish to buy them.\n“We realise that the culture of convenience is really the culprit especially in a place like Singapore. Most of us want to do good but it’s just too troublesome,” said director of Temasek Shophouse Yvonne Tay at a media preview on Thursday.\n“Maybe it’s really just a tweak of consumer habits,” she added. “That’s why we have something a little bit more tongue in cheek called [Not-So] Convenience Store.\n“What we are trying to do is not to have a top-down approach and not to sound too preachy but something that is a little bit more fun and approachable, helping people to realise that there are so many alternatives to sustainability.”\nThe exhibition\xa0is free.

Gardens by the Bay will be conducting experiments on the usefulness of biochar before making a decision on its usage.\nThe system can handle up to one tonne of waste per day, which is about a fifth of the five to six tonnes\xa0Gardens by the Bay produces daily.\nLocated in a container within the Gardens' premises, the system is able to reduce waste down to 5\xa0per cent of its original volume.\xa0\nIn addition, minimal sorting of this waste is required.\xa0\n“As a garden that values nature and sustainability, we have a responsibility towards finding innovative ways to protect our environment,” said Gardens by the Bay CEO Felix Loh in a press release.\xa0\n“Gardens by the Bay is uniquely placed to allow for the testing of such an on-site system because waste collected in the Gardens can be directly converted and repurposed into by-products, which can in turn be\xa0used in the Gardens.”\nAt the Ecosperity Conference 2019 on Thursday, SP and Gardens by the Bay signed an agreement on the rollout of the system, which is supported by Temasek Holdings.\nThe signing was witnessed by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli.\nThe pilot project has been running since early May. It costs “a few” hundred thousand dollars, said SP Group’s Singapore district cooling CEO Jimmy Khoo, who declined to give further details.\n“We are developing district solutions to help Singapore achieve its sustainability goals. This paves the way for decentralised waste management for other businesses and residential estates,” said Mr Khoo.\xa0\n“After the pilot, over the two years we will collect the data, if its operational costs make sense, we will see more and more of such deployments.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     SP Group ', '     Gardens by the Bay ']}"

However, she said all perpetrators would be brought to justice.\nMalaysia last year became the world\'s main destination for plastic waste after China banned its import, disrupting the flow of more than 7 million tonnes of the trash a year.\nDozens of recycling factories have cropped up in Malaysia, many without operating licences, and communities have complained of environmental problems.\nPhilippine President Rodrigo Duterte last week ordered his government to hire a private shipping company to send 69 containers of garbage back to Canada and leave them within its territorial waters if it refuses to accept them.\nCanada said\xa0the waste, exported to the Philippines between 2013 and 2014, was a commercial transaction done without government consent.\nLast month, Ms Yeo said the authorities found shipping containers with waste falsely declared as 3920 plastic - which does not require an import permit - while in reality containing 3915 plastic.\nUnder the Harmonised System for the classification of goods, the 3920 code refers to plastic plates, sheets, film and foil strips, while 3915 refers to plastic waste, parings and scrap.\nApproved permits are needed for the import of 3915 plastic into Malaysia.\nMalaysian officials have identified at least 14 origin countries, including Bangladesh, the United States, Japan, France, Canada, Australia and Britain.\nIMPORTED WASTE FROM BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\nAt Port Klang,\xa0compact discs were found hidden inside\xa0a container filled\xa0with clean recyclable plastic material.

      Small businesses bear the brunt in Malaysia’s war against single-use plastic
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Visit any Ramadan bazaar during the fasting month in Malaysia and one will notice a common feature: food and drinks are all packed in single-use plastic.\nBe it thirst quenching beverages or mouthwatering rendang, traders deftly shove the packed items into thin, flimsy plastic bags and hand them over to shoppers. It is easy and convenient.\nIn general, Malaysia has achieved some success in cutting down single-use plastic, especially in terms of how fewer plastic bags are now being used in supermarkets.\nPenang was the first state to introduce the no free plastic bag campaign for all days at supermarkets in 2011. In fact, the state government is mulling over a blanket ban on all single-use plastic.\nThe Selangor government introduced a no free plastic bag policy in 2017, following the successful implementation of ""No Plastic Bag Day"" every Saturday in 2010.\xa0\nElsewhere, the Kedah state government said there will be no free plastic bags given out on Fridays and Saturdays, starting Apr 1 this year.\nDespite these efforts, single-use plastic in markets and small food establishments is still prevalent. While the small businesses generally support environmental efforts, food vendors in particular, worry about how to manage their cost.\nThose concerned with the environment say that the war against single-use plastic will not be effective, unless other players in the chain, including plastic manufacturers and consumers, are made to pull their weight.\nAccording to a recent report by the Star, citing a study by YouGov Omnibus, at least one in five Malaysians use plastic straws daily. The survey results also revealed that about 10 per cent use straws several times a day.\nMore than a quarter of those polled said they had their own reusable straws. However, 32 per cent of Malaysians polled felt that they did not see the need to use reusable straws.\nTo further cut down on the prevalence of single-use plastic, Minister of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and\xa0Climate Change Yeo Bee Yin last year launched a national roadmap towards zero single-use plastics by 2030.\nThere are three phases for the roadmap. Between 2019 and 2021, the government will seek to impose a pollution charge – at a minimum of RM0.20 (US$0.05) - on plastic bags given over the counters at fixed premises such as hypermarkets, departmental stores and fast food restaurants. The money collected for plastic bags will be surrendered to the state governments.\nStraws are given only upon customers’ request, but at no charge.\nPhases two and three of the roadmap will cover 2022 to 2025 and 2026-2030 respectively.\nFor now, the impact of the policy is still unclear. “As the implementation period of the roadmap has just begun, the statistics and reports released are still limited and no specific measurements can be determined,” Ms Siti Nurbaiyah Nadzmi, the minister’s press secretary, told CNA.\n“However, with various awareness efforts and actions plans supported by stakeholders and consumers, we hope that there will be positive change towards the zero use of single-use plastics by 2030.”\nSMALL BUSINESSES GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE\nSmall businesses interviewed were generally supportive of the government’s call to cut down on single-use plastic.\nMr Herman Shah, a chicken vendor in Shah Alam said: “We know there is an alternative to the normal plastic bag that is the biodegradable plastic bag ... If the government decides to abolish the use of plastic bags, we will just switch to the alternative ones that are made of biodegradable plastic.”\n“I don’t think there will be any difference in terms of cost if we use the alternative.”\nMr Muhammad Ridhauddin, a vegetables vendor said: “We support the government’s plan to abolish the use of plastic bags. Lately, we can see more customers coming to buy vegetables with their own bags or trolleys.”\n“It is easier this way as we don’t have to think of how to pack the produce for them ... This will (also) help us to reduce our cost by not having to pay for plastic bags.”\nWORRIES ABOUT COST\nOthers, however, noted that it would impact their bottom-line.\nMr Taufek Abdul Rahman, who runs a Malay restaurant in Gombak, Selangor added: “We find it impossible to run a restaurant without the use of plastic straws or packaging.”\n“Most Malay dishes are wet or served with gravy. If we pack them using paper, they will leak and it is not practical.”\nHe said while the restaurants can use metal straws, this will drive up cost. He opined that the government should give businesses more options to keep costs down.\nMr Abu Az, a food vendor selling roasted lamb said that if he needs to move from using plastic containers to paper containers, the cost would quadruple. “Why burden us and not the big players such as the plastic manufacturers?” he said.\nMeanwhile, a drink vendor at a night market, who only wanted to be known as Amrie, noted that under the rules of the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA), vendors cannot just use any biodegradable plastic bag.\nAll biodegradable plastic bags must be endorsed by the Industrial Research and Technology Organisation in Malaysia (SIRIM) before they are allowed for use.\xa0\nThere are actually biodegradable plastic bags that are cheaper than the type endorsed by SIRIM, but they cannot be used, the vendor said. ""We\xa0do support the government’s plans to be more environmentally friendly, but we hope there are cheaper solutions for us small vendors.""\nCONSUMERS KNOW THEY MUST DO THEIR PART\nConsumers are aware that for the war against single-use plastics to succeed, they too must do their part.\nMs Khor Sue Yee, co-founder of Zero Waste Malaysia, an environmental conservation organisation, said she was heartened to learn that the government is now spearheading the zero single-use plastic efforts.\n“However, I still believe that individual action is the easiest to implement. Being a conscious consumer is something we can control,” she said.\nMr Eric Shai, 37, a self-employed based in Kuala Lumpur noted that said the government’s efforts would push more consumers towards reducing plastic usage.\n“The whole campaign is not a punishment from my point of view. It is about encouraging everyone to bring their own containers, water bottles or reusable bags when they want to buy takeaway food or groceries.”\nHe recounted an incident at a supermarket\xa0when the cashier told a customer that he needed to pay for the plastic bags. The man simply said no and grabbed his items before leaving the store, Mr Shai said.\n“If we don’t ask the public to pay extra for the plastic bags, this campaign will not succeed. People will not change if they don’t feel the (financial) pain.”\nCertainly, consumers such as Ms Rachel Loh are cognisant of the need to reduce single-use plastic, as part of efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n“However, (cutting down on single-use plastic) needs to be coupled with innovation of biodegradable, as well as inclusive and accessible alternatives for consumers,” she said.\nPLASTIC MANUFACTURERS UNFAZED\nAre plastic manufacturers concerned about their livelihoods?\nMr Ben Chong, a senior sales manager at Advent Packaging Sdn Bhd in Klang said: “If the government wants us to move towards biodegradable plastic, then we will comply.”\nHe said that his company is already producing oxo-biodegradable plastic bags - as defined by the European Committee on Standardisation – and is looking into producing other biodegradable plastic products.\n“In terms of livelihood, we are not affected. We believe we can manufacture more biodegradable plastic bags. People would still want to use plastic bags.”\nOthers plastic manufacturers, like Mr Siva, a manager from Dynamic Plastic Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, said their companies will not be affected because the current ban is only on plastic bags and straws. His company’s main business is in plastic bottles, he said.\nENFORCEMENT SHOULD NOT BURDEN SMALL BUSINESSES, SAYS ENVIRONMENTALIST\nMr Ruben Cortes, an environmentalist and director of social enterprise Build for Tomorrow, told CNA that the roadmap should clearly define what is single-use plastic.\n“As far as the public is concerned, this involves plastic straws and plastic bags only. But if we look at the bigger picture, single-use plastics could mean plastic bottles as well,” he said.\nHe noted that based on recent clean-up activities, plastic bottles have been lodged at log booms placed in the rivers.\n“We also have to look at the bigger picture such as who are the main players in the plastic industry. The big corporations and manufacturers will keep on producing these plastic products and distribute them. Rather than targeting the small vendors at night markets or bazaars, pressure should be put on big corporations.”\nMr Cortes said enforcement efforts focusing on small vendors and their customers are unlikely to work.\n“This is also not fair as they are just buying and using the plastic products as part of their businesses ... At the end of the day, without proper education or awareness, the problem will recur.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     environment ']}"

""Where we have inserted elements such as the treehouses, they have been inserted in such a way that we have scarcely\xa0cut down any trees at all.""\nBRINGING GUESTS CLOSER TO NATURE\nWhen completed, the development aims to become the first Super Low Energy resort in Singapore - with its design incorporating energy-saving measures including the use of natural ventilation as well as solar panels.\nExtensive planting will be done on the roof and facade of the resort buildings, and more than half the trees on the site will be retained.\n\n\nWherever possible, the resort will be elevated several metres above the ground to allow native wildlife to move across the site.\nGuests will also be able to choose to stay in 24 treehouses designed in the shape of seedpods, and participate in\xa0behind-the-scenes programmes, guided nature walks as well as hands-on activities. There will also be camping opportunities,\xa0said\xa0Mr Mike Barclay, group CEO of Mandai Park Holdings.\n\n""Right from the beginning, WOW Architects impressed us,""\xa0Mr Barclay told reporters. ""They showed a deep and fundamental understanding of the design brief and they were on the same wavelength as us - they understood what we were trying to achieve.""\n""When we got together, we decided that whatever design we came up with, we need to immerse people in the rainforest,"" added Mr Barclay. ""That must be fundamental, we need to have a very light touch on the site and we also need the resort to celebrate sustainable best practices.""\n\n\nThe Mandai precinct is undergoing a\xa0rejuvenation\xa0project, which will see the relocation of Jurong Bird Park and the development of a new Rainforest Park in the same area as the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari.\xa0\n""We want our guests to come to the resort and have a conscious stay,"" said Mr Barclay. ""We want them to be conscious of the rainforest all around them, we want them to be conscious of how it\'s best to interact with plants and animals, we also want to leave them with some consciousness about how we can lighten our touch on the natural world.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Mandai ', '     environment ']}"

      Turtle eggs are being sold openly in Sabah, and tourists are partly to blame
  </h1>, 'text': 'SANDAKAN, Sabah: Cars idle in endless queues along Sandakan’s busiest street, Jalan Pryer, as locals horde the dozens of rustic shophouses for bargains.\nRight in the heart of the neighbourhood’s labyrinth of alleys, a group of men stood on a prominent street corner with wads of cash bulging in their pockets.\nThey seemed relaxed, leaning against the walls while smoking, observing passersby. The eyes of one of them lit up when he saw this reporter walking by.\n“You want turtle eggs, brother? I give you a good price,” he asked in Bahasa Malaysia.\xa0“How much?” I asked.\nHe gestured for me to wait, dashed across the busy road and disappeared into a shophouse. Just 30 seconds later, he emerged, carrying a black plastic bag filled with about ten turtle eggs that looked like table tennis balls, covered slightly in beach sand.\n“Just RM2 (US$0.50) per egg. RM20 for the whole bag,” he said. I snapped a photo of the contents of the bag before declining his offer.\nMeanwhile,\xa0three uniformed police officers stood 50 metres away, guarding the entrance of the Sandakan Public Wet Market, seemingly oblivious to the criminal activity going on in front of them.\nAlso near the entrance was a huge poster put up by the authorities to persuade the public not to consume turtle eggs.\nNeither the poster nor the presence of police officers deterred the operation, and business was booming.\nFamilies and individuals drove by the corner in cars or simply walked up straight to the men to complete the transaction in broad daylight.\xa0\nThe sale and consumption of eggs for all species of turtles are banned in Sabah and Sarawak, as the populations of green and hawksbill turtles in the region are classified as endangered and critically endangered respectively by the World Wildlife Federation.\nHowever, the expansive waters surrounding Sandakan and the porous maritime border with\xa0the Philippines means the area has become\xa0a popular trading point for the eggs.\nMORE TOURISTS, MORE DEMAND?\nFor Sabah authorities, it is worrying that the demand for turtle eggs has been fuelled\xa0by tourists visiting Sandakan.\nA licensed tour guide in Sabah, Mr Afiq Samsudin, told CNA that he has received requests from tour groups to head to restaurants in Sandakan where guests can sample turtle eggs.\nTurtle egg is a considered an aphrodisiac\xa0in Malaysia. Visitors, especially those from countries like China, Indonesia and Vietnam, believe they are beneficial to health and can help improve sexual potency.\n“I explain to them that consuming turtle eggs is illegal in Sabah, and if they continue to insist, I would report them to the Sabah Wildlife Department,” Mr Afiq said.\n“But I know of other tour companies in Sandakan who do accede to these requests. The guides would purchase the eggs from areas like Jalan Pryer, and ask restaurants to serve them to the guests during meals,” he added.\nA senior official from Sabah’s Wildlife Department in Sandakan, Mr Hussien Muin, said that demand for the eggs from people who are not from Sabah is the “main problem” allowing the business to thrive.\n“The buyers are locals, but some of them work for tour operators. They buy in bulk for their clients,” he said\xa0\n“We have stepped up enforcement at the Sandakan airport to ensure that tourists don’t bring out these eggs from Sabah,” he added.\nTourism was a hot button issue during the recent by-election in Sandakan, which saw Democratic Action Party’s Vivian Wong win the parliamentary seat by a landslide margin.\nDuring the course of her campaign, DAP’s secretary-general Lim Guan Eng wooed Sandakan residents by promising that the Sandakan airport would be expanded and more runways would be built if Ms Wong got elected.\nWhile a tourism boom will benefit the local economy, those in the illegal wildlife trade will benefit as well, noted\xa0Mr Afiq, the guide.\n“Tourism is good for Sabah, but it also has its negatives. The turtles are endangered and we as Sabahans must do our duty to educate these visitors on what might happen if we continue to consume the eggs,” he added.\nSAVING TURTLES, EGG BY EGG\nJust as some tourist activities in Sandakan contribute\xa0to the illegal trade of turtle eggs, the state is offering\xa0programmes that aim to educate visitors on\xa0preserving\xa0the turtle population.\nThe programme brings tourists to Pulau Selingan, a remote beach resort that is a one-hour boat ride from Sandakan’s coast.\nWith clear blue waters surrounding its beaches of fine white sand, the island straddles the Malaysian and Philippine boundaries lying within the Sulu Sea.\nBy day, tourists snorkel, swim and suntan. By night, when the beach is dark and nearly deserted, they observe around 40 female turtles nesting their eggs from a discreet distance.\nThe turtles heave their heavy bodies up the shore and lay their eggs into individual nests. Park rangers then immediately dig up the eggs and transport them in a bucket to the island’s hatchery, where they are buried for incubation.\nThese rangers patrol the beach in shifts until the crack of dawn to prevent the eggs from being dug up by predators such as monitor lizards or, more importantly, poachers in fishing boats.\nSabah’s Pulau Selingan and its neighbouring islands of Pulau Bakkungan Kechil and Pulau Gulisan are part of the\xa0Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), a\xa0bilateral programme between Malaysia and the Philippines to conserve sea turtles and their habitats in the Sulu Sea.\nBesides the three Malaysian islands, TIHPA also includes six islands from the Philippines: Boan, Langaan, Lihiman, Great Bakkungan, Taganak and Baguan.\nAccording to the Sabah Parks official website, Baguan is the only Philippine island that is “fully protected” and has been declared a “marine sanctuary”.\nMr Hussein of the Sabah Wildlife Department\xa0told CNA that most of the turtle egg sellers caught in Sandakan have been fishermen who have entered Sabah illegally from the Philippines.\xa0\nHe added that the syndicates also smuggle\xa0in other illegal goods, such as contraband cigarettes and drugs, and sell\xa0them together with the eggs.\nIn October 2018, Sabah authorities thwarted an attempt to smuggle in 2,000 turtle eggs via Sandakan’s Sungai Batu Putih. The pump boat carrying the eggs had a Philippine registration number. The boat skipper, the only person on board, eluded capture by jumping into the river and swimming away before the boat was seized.\nMr Hussien said that the Sabah Wildlife Department, as well as police, immigration, and marine army patrol officers were facing difficulties on the enforcement front, because of the trans-boundary nature of the illegal operations.\n“We need the residents of Sabah as well as tourists to reject any offers to buy turtle eggs. And they should report such activities immediately,” he said.\n“The integrity of consumers is key for Sabah to end this trade,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     Sabah ', '     wildlife ', '     environment ']}"

      What will it take to kick Singapore's growing multimillion-dollar addiction to bottled water? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The water flowing from Singapore\'s taps is perfectly safe to drink, but recent research shows that many people still prefer to quench their thirst with bottled water, with demand continuing to grow.\nData from research firm Euromonitor International show that sales of bottled water have been increasing steadily over the years - from S$161.3 million in 2013 to S$179.4 million in 2018.\xa0The figure includes sales of all types of bottled water, including still, carbonated, flavoured and what is known as ""functional"" water, which is\xa0enhanced with ingredients such as vitamins.\xa0\nAnd this has an impact on the environment, given that most bottled water is sold in single-used plastic containers, very little of which is recycled, according to the Singapore Environment\xa0Council.\nA study it released in 2018 showed that\xa0about 467 million polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles - which are commonly used for drinks, sauces and marinades - are used in Singapore each year. This works out to the volume of 94 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\xa0\nAccording to statistics from the National Environment Agency, 6 per cent of plastics were recycled in 2017, and 4 per cent in 2018.\nThe rising trend in consumption of bottled water in Singapore is not a recent phenomenon.\nA\xa02016 CNA story\xa0on\xa0the multimillion-dollar bottled-water industry\xa0showed consumers in Singapore spending about S$134 million\xa0on still bottled water in 2015, a 24 per cent increase\xa0from five years before.\nThe 2016 article focused on\xa0how demand for still bottled water was growing. It also\xa0highlighted how the dominant\xa0brands in Singapore were confirmed by F&N and Coca-Cola - the companies behind the most popular varieties here -\xa0to be\xa0sourced from water supplies in Malaysia.\xa0\xa0\nAccording to United Nations trade data, most of Singapore\'s bottled water is imported from Malaysia.\xa0\nWhen contacted in March this year, Coca-Cola confirmed that there has been no change in where it sources water for its popular Dasani brand. F&N added to its 2016 statement, saying\xa0that the process quoted then was “over-simplified”. It said that its water is a blend of “natural mineral water extracted from deep well and reverse osmosis water” that goes through a “stringent 5-tier filtration process that includes various filters.”\nF&N said\xa0that its popular Ice Mountain\xa0brand of\xa0water is sourced and bottled in plants in Peninsular Malaysia.\nINCREASED CONSUMPTION BOOSTED BY MOVE AWAY FROM SWEET DRINKS\nAccording to Euromonitor, health conscious consumers are boosting demand for bottled water in Singapore. In its report, the research firm noted that they began to switch to\xa0to bottled water from soft drinks, sports drinks and juice, as the drinks were perceived to be sugar-laden.\nIt added that bottled water is expected to continue its “strong growth”, boosted by this continued switch.\n\nBut why not just drink water straight from the tap?\nThe main reason is convenience, said Shane Snyder, Executive Director of Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute (NEWRI) at Nanyang Technological University.\n“I believe the average member of the public trusts that Singapore is producing water that’s healthy and safe,” he said, adding that Singapore is world-renowned for its water technologies and contribution to research in the area. “Let’s say you’re out running and you go by a convenience store … it’s a lot easier to just grab a bottle of water, rather than you having to carry a reusable bottle around and having to wash it when it gets dirty.”\n“People also tend to prefer their drinking water cold, and it’s easier for them to get a bottle of chilled water quickly from the stores, rather than getting it from the tap, which isn’t as cold.”\nThe convenience factor also plays out in places such as food courts, said another analyst.\n“How many food courts have water fountains?” pointed out Ravi Krishnaswamy, senior vice president of energy and environment at Frost & Sullivan Asia Pacific.\xa0“If you don’t have water points, what do you expect people to do, especially when low-sugar drinks are being promoted?\xa0The alternative is just to buy water.”\xa0\nThis consideration may also outweigh the environmental impact of single-use plastics, with Mr Krishnaswamy also noting that there could still be a lack of awareness among\xa0consumers about the environmental impact of not just the plastic waste generated by\xa0plastic bottles, but also the carbon footprint of transporting them into Singapore, whether it\'s from Malaysia or, as in the case of some other popular brands, much further afield.\xa0\n“While there has been a lot of awareness generated recently over plastic straws, I don’t think people have yet to realise the plastic waste generated from the bottled water is a huge environmental issue,” he said.\nWATER FOUNTAINS, MORE EDUCATION CAN HELP ADDRESS THIS\nOne key solution in addressing this issue, is to make public water fountains more accessible, suggested the two analysts.\nThis, said Prof Snyder, would help address the “ick factor” of people having to refill their bottles in public toilets.\n“One way to really advance the use of tap water would be to have dispensers readily available in public places, preferably if it’s ice cold, and if possible, even warm water,” he said, adding that well-designed water fountains can also play a part.\n“We had a water fountain on my university campus in America that was specially designed - it had a very high dispenser and you could put your bottle there. It was very popular, especially if you look at conventional water fountains, where it’s not very easy to put your bottle there to refill it.”\nDemand for such sources may be picking up in Singapore, where awareness has accelerated of the environmental damage that can be done by single-use plastics. F&N has launched a water station\xa0which it describes as an “environmentally friendly alternative” to disposable bottled water. Apart from dispensing chilled and filtered water to buyers, users also have the option of buying a reusable bottle.\xa0\nEducating the public would also be helpful, added Prof Snyder, suggesting that it could be more than just raising awareness about the plastic waste issue.\n“Bottled water could be sold as high as S$3 a bottle - if you think about the cost of water in your home, that’s a tremendous mark-up,” he said. “So there could be an education component about the wasted money.”\nMr Krishnaswamy also suggested that education start from young, particularly in the schools.\n“Students today tend to be much more aware and conscious about such issues,” he said, adding that schools can also consider not selling bottled water to develop the habit from young.\nThe rise of ground-up initiatives, he added, is also a positive step.\nGROUND-UP INITIATIVES HELPING TO CHANGE MINDSETS ABOUT TAP WATER\nOne such initiative was put together by a group of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) students as their final year project.\nThe quartet of final-year communications students decided to start a campaign aimed at encouraging people to eschew bottled water in favour of tap water, spurred by the increasing amount of money that is being spent on bottled water and the rising awareness of environmental issues.\n“We saw more people using reusable metal straws, and plastic bags aren’t given out in our school anymore,” said Erny Kartolo, one of the four students. “But we realised that there wasn’t enough attention given to plastic bottle waste, when in actual fact, this accounts for a lot of Singapore’s plastic waste.""\xa0\nTheir “Drink Wise, Drink Tap” campaign ran from January to March, with Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor praising it as “simple, but brilliant”. Prior to that, the team conducted surveys and focus group discussions to find out how people perceived tap water, and why they chose to buy bottled water.\nIt appeared, said Ms Kartolo, that it all boiled down to “psychological barriers”, where people are reluctant to drink water from public taps because of how the surroundings appeared.\n“This was one of the biggest struggles in our campaign,” she said. “The water from the public toilet tap is completely safe and clean, but if the surroundings are dirty, you don’t want to drink or refill your bottle.”\nTo prove their point, part of their efforts involved them setting up booths at four events, where they conducted a blind taste test with two identical mason jars: one filled with tap water, and the other with bottled water.\n\n“Out of the hundreds of people who tried the water, most really couldn’t tell the difference, and some guessed wrongly,” said Ms Kartolo. \xa0“So I think it’s true about the psychological barriers ... If I tell you this is tap water, you might think it tastes a bit different, but we didn’t tell them, and the majority of them couldn’t tell the difference.”\nWhile the campaign has since ended, Ms Kartolo hopes that their efforts have gone some way in helping to change mindsets among consumers and overcoming this barrier.\nMoving forward, the group also hopes that more can be done to help encourage people to make the switch.\xa0\nFor one, they suggested that to encourage more people to drink the tap water from public toilet sinks, NEA and PUB can collaborate on clean toilet campaigns, to assure people about the hygiene of the environment and the cleanliness of the tap water for consumption.\nThey also suggested that partnerships with eateries be explored, to provide tap water refills.\n“Our research found that people trust eateries to provide them with safe drinking water,” said Ms Kartolo. “This would be a great step in getting businesses involved in Singapore’s journey towards sustainability.”\n“Tap water is a simple, easy solution for Singaporeans to adopt,” she added. “We want people to realise that there’s really no need for bottled water.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     environment ']}"

      Remote island beach plastics point to greater waste problem
  </h1>, 'text': 'PARIS:\xa0The world may be seriously underestimating the amount of plastic waste along its coastlines, researchers said on Thursday (May 16) as they unveiled findings showing hundreds of millions of plastic fragments on a remote Indian Ocean archipelago.\nA team of experts travelled to the Cocos Islands, a group of 27 small atolls 2,100 kilometres (1,300 miles) west of Australia and found an estimated 414 million pieces of plastic.\nIn all, the plastic fragments would weigh around 238 tonnes, the team said.\nImages taken from the survey show white sand beaches blanketed with plastic waste.\nBut according to lead study author Jennifer Lavers, the fragments on the surface of Cocos Island beaches - and beaches around the world - may just be the tip of the iceberg.\n""I\'ve been working on remote islands as a marine biologist for 15 years or so and all of them have at least some debris, so I\'ve come to expect it,"" she told AFP.\n""One of the big surprises was that when I was digging down in the sediment to look at how much was buried and where, the quantity sometimes did not drop off with depth.""\nLavers and the team dug multiple holes across beaches on the Cocos Islands, and found plastics, mainly in the form of small or microparticles, throughout the sand layers.\nThey estimate that the true amount of plastic pollution on the beaches surveyed may be as much as 26 times greater than the fragments visible on the surface.\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, concludes that global plastic waste surveys ""have drastically underestimated the scale of debris accumulation"".\n\'CHANGE ALL ASPECTS\'\nPlastic production has exploded worldwide in recent years, with half of all plastics produced in the last 13 years.\nMankind throws millions of tonnes of plastic into the sea every year, and much of it gets washed back ashore onto beaches where it poses a risk to wildlife.\nIt can also enter the food-chain in the form of microplastics, which have been found at all ocean depths and latitudes.\nLavers, from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania, said such plastic concentrations found on a remote group of islands was deeply concerning.\n""While the five oceanic gyres or \'garbage patches\' tend to garner a lot of research and media attention, the Cocos Islands are not located near or within one of these gyres,"" she said.\n""Plastic is everywhere, in all corners of the ocean, being distributed by current systems big and small.""\nSignificantly, the team estimated that as much as 25 per cent of the plastic items surveyed on Cocos were disposable or ""single-use"", such as food packaging, straws, forks and knives and toothbrushes.\nIn March nations failed to agree to a timetable to phase out all single-use plastics, opting instead to ""significantly reduce"" their production.\nLavers said industry- and society-wide changes in behaviour -\xa0from production, to consumption and re-use - were needed to stem the plastic waste epidemic.\n""Some islands have significant quantities to the point that it forces one to pause and consider all aspects of their life, from the simple items used each day (eg. to brush one\'s teeth) to how I communicate the outputs of my research,"" she said.\n""These islands change you.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     science ', '     pollution ', '     climate ', '     environment ']}"

      Iceland turns carbon dioxide to rock for cleaner air
  </h1>, 'text': 'ON THE HENGILL VOLCANO, Iceland: In the heart of Iceland\'s volcano country, 21st-century alchemists are transforming carbon dioxide into rock for eternity, cleaning the air of harmful emissions that cause global warming.\nThe technology mimics, in accelerated format, a natural process that can take thousands of years, injecting CO2 into porous basalt rock where it mineralises, capturing it forever.\n""With this method we have actually changed the time scale dramatically,"" says geologist Sandra Osk Snaebjornsdottir.\nCarbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas emitted in large quantities by Iceland\'s transport sector, industries and volcanoes.\nThe UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is promoting various carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods in a bid to limit the rise in average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nSnaebjornsdottir is working on Iceland\'s CarbFix project with researchers and engineers from utility company Reykjavik Energy, the University of Iceland, France\'s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and Columbia University in the United States.\nPETRIFIED IN TWO YEARS\nIn Iceland, a country of geysers, glaciers and volcanoes, at least half of the energy produced comes from geothermal sources.\nThat\'s a bonanza for CarbFix researchers, who\'ve turned the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant -\xa0one of the world\'s biggest - into their own laboratory.\nThe plant, located on the Hengill volcano in southwestern Iceland, sits on a layer of basalt rock formed from cooled lava, and has access to virtually unlimited amounts of water.\nThe plant pumps up the water underneath the volcano to run six turbines providing electricity and heat to the capital, Reykjavik, about 30 kilometres\xa0away.\nThe CO2 from the plant is meanwhile captured from the steam, liquified into condensate, then dissolved in large amounts of water.\n""So basically we are just making soda water out of the CO2,"" says project director Edda Sif Aradottir.\nThe fizzy water is piped several kilometres to an area where grey, igloo-shaped domes dot a lunar-like landscape.\nHere the fizzy water is injected under high pressure into the rock 1,000 metres\xa0under the ground.\nThe solution fills the rock\'s cavities and begins the solidification process - a chemical reaction that occurs when the gas comes in contact with the calcium, magnesium and iron in the basalt.\n""Almost all of the injected CO2 was mineralised within two years in our pilot injection,"" Snaebjornsdottir says.\nOnce the CO2 is turned to rock, it\'s pretty much captured there for good.\n""If you have a volcanic eruption ... and you heat up the rock to very high temperatures, then some of the mineral will break down and maybe dissolve in water,"" says University of Iceland geochemist Sigurdur Gislason.\nBut, he noted, ""this is the safest and most stable form of storing carbon"".\nThe last volcanic eruption here was a thousand years ago.\nTHIRSTY METHOD\nThe CarbFix project reduces the plant\'s carbon dioxide emissions by a third, which amounts to 12,000 tonnes of CO2 captured and stored at a cost of about US$25 a tonne.\nBy comparison, Iceland\'s volcanoes spew out between one and two million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.\nThe main drawback of the method is that it requires large volumes of desalinated water, which, while abundant in Iceland, is rare in many other parts of the planet.\nAround 25 tonnes of water are needed for each tonne of carbon dioxide injected.\n""That is the Achilles\' heel of this method,"" says Snaebjornsdottir.\n""I agree that the process uses a lot of water, but we gain a lot by permanently getting rid of CO2 that otherwise would be floating around the atmosphere,"" says Aradottir.\nExperiments are currently under way to adapt the method to saltwater.\nUnder the Paris climate agreement, Iceland has agreed to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030.\nYet its emissions rose by 2.2 per cent from 2016 to 2017, and have risen by 85 per cent since 1990, according to a report by Iceland\'s Environment Agency.\nA third of its emissions come from air transport, which is vital to the island for its tourism sector. Its aluminium and silicon plants account for another third.\nIceland\'s Environment and Natural Resources Minister Gudmundur Ingi Gudbrandsson said he has ""encouraged"" those plants to also develop carbon capture and storage mechanisms.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      Cute or creepy: Why humans love some species, loathe others
  </h1>, 'text': '\nPARIS: The Chinese giant salamander, the largest amphibian in the world, is not cute.\nWeighing as much as an adult human, it has slimy brown skin, a giant mouth curled to a gormless grin, and puny, mistrustful eyes.\nIt is also one of the world\'s most endangered species.\nAnd yet, unlike its compatriot the giant panda, the giant salamander rarely makes the news.\nWhy do some animals strike a chord with humans, prompting them to donate millions towards their conservation, while others draw little more than disgust?\nAnd is a sad-eyed panda really worth saving more than a slimy salamander?\nSize, intelligence, behaviour, rarity, how closely an animal resembles the human form -\xa0all play a part in our reaction to various endangered creatures.\n""One of the biggest factors is \'cuteness\': physical characteristics such as big eyes and soft features that elicit our parental instincts because they remind us of human infants,"" Hal Herzog, emeritus professor at West Carolina University\'s Department of Psychology, told AFP.\nAn expert in human-animal relationships, Herzog said the dark rings around pandas\' eyes triggered humans nurturing instincts.\n""Compare that to the Chinese giant salamander,"" he said. ""Google it. It looks like a six-foot-long, 150-pound bag of brown slime with beady little eyes.""\nThe salamanders are a vital part of their ecosystem, just as worms are essential to soil health around the steams and lakes they live in - which is just about everywhere.\nYet, like maggots, rats and snakes, the main instinct they inspire in humans is revulsion.\n""LEARNED"" DISGUST?\nAccording to Graham Davey, a specialist in phobias from the University of Sussex\'s School of Psychology, we learn to revile certain creatures at a young age.\n""Disgust is a learned emotion. Babies are not born with it ... it\'s probably transmitted socially, culturally and within families,"" he said.\nSome animals are reviled due to their resemblance to ""primary disgusting things"" such as mucus or faeces, Davey said, while others are perceived - rightly or wrongly - to pose a direct danger to the beholder.\n""In terms of threat to humankind, disease and illness are bigger than being attacked by an animal,"" he said.\nThis might explain why most of us don\'t find lions and bears repellant -\xa0they are covered with the same type of soft fur that coat cuddly toys for children, even if it might be better to avoid one in real life.\nAN ORCA BY ANY OTHER NAME\xa0\nAs with most things, popular culture has a huge effect on how society perceives animals.\nWhereas the movie Free Willy\xa0prompted a wave of sympathy for the protection of endangered orcas, ""Arachnophobia"" hardly helped spiders\' cause.\nSee also: ""Jaws"" for sharks.\nEven the depiction of fictional creatures can have a knock-on effect on public perception towards certain animals.\nTake the main being in Alien, for example.\n""Seeing the one from the first film that had that mucus-y drawl dripping from the alien\'s mouth ... sensitises people to disgusting things,"" Davey said.\nNor is it just the public at large who are liable to ""speciesism"", or discrimination against other species in favour of our own.\nA study in 2017 found a strong correlation between society\'s preferred animals and those most studied in scientific research.\n""Maybe that\'s because it\'s easier to get money"" to study well-known animals, said Frederic Legendre, a researcher at France\'s National History Museum.\nAnd popular species make money in return, according to Christo Fabricius from WWF - a conservation group indelibly linked to its panda logo.\n""Reptiles, for example, are not very marketable,"" he said.\n""PROTECT SPECIES, PROTECT HABITAT""\nNot that favouring certain cute or charismatic species is necessarily a bad thing for conservation.\n""When we protect an iconic species, we protect their habitat and therefore all the organisms within it also benefit,"" said Legendre.\nBut such species can become a victim of their own popularity.\nOne recent study suggested that a ""virtual"" presence of wild animals such as elephants and tigers -\xa0be that on computer screens, T-shirts or in children\'s books -\xa0can fool people into thinking they are more common in the wild than they really are.\nThe populations of most megafauna - from hippos to giraffes and gorillas - remain in peril.\nThen there\'s the risk of poaching.\nThe rarer the species ""the more value they provide for traditional medicine, for trophy hunting, and therefore they are poached more often,"" said Franck Courchamp, an ecologist at France\'s National Centre for Scientific Research.\nSo the next time you see a picture of a Giant Chinese Salamander, remember that there\'s more to saving Earth\'s wild species than looks.\n', 'related_topics': ['     wildlife ', '     environment ']}"

      60% of Singaporean households recycle regularly, but many not doing it right: Surveys
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Can plastic toys, clothes and glass pots be recycled? If you say yes, you\'re not alone, but these items do not belong in a recycling bin,\xa0according to authorities.\nAround 60 per cent of Singaporean households recycle regularly, but many still find it difficult to identify contaminants and non-recyclables, surveys conducted by the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have found.\nThe two surveys, which were conducted between June 2018 and February 2019, covered different aspects of household recycling, said the agencies in a joint media release on Monday (Apr 29).\nAccording to the findings, the top items recycled were paper materials like newspapers, magazines, junk mail, brochures and writing paper.\nClothes, shoes and bags were also among the top items recycled. However, these items should be donated – if in good condition – instead of being recycled, said the agencies.\xa0\n“These wrongly recycled items contribute to the high contamination rate of the recyclables collected from the blue recycling bins,” said MEWR and NEA.\nAnother category of items which were also regularly recycled were plastic drink bottles, aluminum cans and glass beer/wine bottles.\n“While these items can be recycled, they should be emptied and rinsed clean wherever possible,” reminded the agencies.\nThe most common channel used for recycling was the blue recycling bins, with 56 per cent of regular recyclers using the bins at least once a week, the findings showed.\nConvenience was one of the most commonly cited reasons for those who\xa0recycled regularly, according to MEWR\'s survey.\nNEA\'s survey also found that this group of households found recycling\xa0to be ""second nature"" and part of their daily routine.\xa0\n67% THOUGHT SOILED FOOD PACKAGING CAN BE RECYCLED\nEven though the findings showed that respondents were generally capable of identifying recyclable items, they\xa0had difficulty identifying contaminants and non-recyclables, said MEWR and NEA.\nAccording to MEWR’s survey, 67 per cent of respondents thought that soiled paper food packaging can be recycled, while another 62 per cent thought that glass cookware or porcelain/ceramics can be recycled.\nOther items that were wrongly identified as recyclables were plastic toys, tissue paper and Styrofoam.\nAround 60 per cent of respondents also mistakenly thought that recyclables had to be sorted by type before being deposited into recycling bins, said the agencies.\xa0\n""There is no need to pre-sort items that are deposited into the blue recycling bins, because the contents of the blue recycling bins will be transported to the MRF (Material Recovery Facilities) where the sorting takes place.""\xa0\nTOO BUSY, INCONVENIENT TO RECYCLE \nAs for households who did not recycle regularly, the most common reasons were related to convenience.\xa0\nSome of the reasons included having too few items to recycle, being too busy or tired, as well as not having enough space to accumulate recyclables in their homes.\n“Barriers cited by households who did not recycle regularly suggest that recycling was perceived as inconvenient and secondary in their daily routine,” said the agencies.\xa0\n“Hence, helping Singaporeans to see that recycling is easy and helping with habit formation are important in improving Singapore’s household recycling rate.”\nIn 2017, it was announced\xa0that dual chutes for refuse and recyclables will be installed at all new non-landed residential developments.\xa0\nAll new Build-To-Order Housing and Development Board flats have installed recycling chutes adjacent to centralised refuse chutes at every level since January 2014.\nThis requirement has also been extended to buildings taller than four storeys in all new non-landed private residential developments since Apr 1 last year.\xa0\nFor the two surveys, MEWR and NEA surveyed 2,003 and 3,445 randomly-selected households respectively through face-to-face interviews.\n', 'related_topics': ['     NEA ', '     environment ']}"

      Explainer: What are the implications of dry dams and polluted rivers in Johor?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Over the last two months, the state of Johor has been hit by a series of environmental problems, impacting its rivers and water treatment facilities. This has shone the spotlight on the issue of water sustainability.\nThe problems have affected thousands of local residents, causing some to fall ill while disrupting water supply to homes.\nThe water levels at major dams have fallen below the critical mark due to dry weather while some rivers, including the Johor River, have been polluted by chemicals.\nThe federal government and Johor Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar have called for action from the state government to resolve the issues.\nThe various episodes have also resulted in Singapore raising concerns over water sustainability.\nOn Apr 9, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said during a joint press conference with his counterpart, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, that Singapore has raised with the Malaysian government its concerns about pollution in the Johor River as well as its long-term yield.\nUnder the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore is entitled to draw up to 250 million gallons a day (mgd) of water from the Johor River.\nHere’s a breakdown of the environmental issues that have surfaced since March:\nTHREE DAMS BELOW CRITICAL LEVELS \nLast week, the Johor state government announced that three dams, which supply raw water to treatment plants, have fallen below the critical mark due to hot weather.\nAs of Apr 18, the water levels at the Lebam dam, Upper Layang dam and the Pulai 2 dam were at 15.9 per cent, 21.8 per cent and 36.1 per cent respectively.\nThe treatment plants serve about one\xa0million people, including residents in Kota Tinggi, Tanjung Balau, Teluk Ramunia, Pengarang, Bandar Penawar and Pasir Gudang.\nThe Johor state government had earlier stated that it will consider cloud seeding in April if the dry spell persists.\nCloud seeding is the induction of rain by introducing chemicals into clouds. Silver iodide or dry ice is dispersed into the clouds to provide nuclei for moisture to condense around.\nOn Wednesday, Johor International Trade, Investments and Utilities Committee Chairman Jimmy Puah told CNA that the low water level situation at major dams is improving and that things are expected to be back to normal in six weeks when more rain is expected.\nPASIR GUDANG CHEMICAL POISONING INCIDENT\xa0\xa0\nBeside hot weather, environmental pollution has also been a problem.\nWhat started out as an isolated incident of illegally dumping chemicals into a Johor river escalated into a wave of chemical poisoning cases, with\xa0more than 2,700 people taken ill.\nIn early March, a tanker lorry believed to be from an illegal tyre recycling factory dumped oil waste and sludge into Sungai Kim Kim in Pasir Gudang.\nThousands later fell ill after breathing in fumes from the toxic chemicals and more than 100 schools were ordered shut as\xa0a result. Four\xa0people have pleaded not guilty in relation to the case.\nInitial cleaning works inadvertently worsened the chemical reaction, as the contractor engaged was not experienced in dealing with chemical waste.\nSubsequently, the federal government allocated RM6.4 million (US$1.56 million) to clean up a 1.5-km stretch of the river.\nThe crown prince of Johor, Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, later\xa0hit out at the authorities\xa0over their handling of the incident.\nIn a series of tweets, he said: “Since the first day (Mar 7), an emergency should have been declared and residents temporarily evacuated elsewhere, until it was guaranteed safe.”\xa0\nThe federal parliament had debated a motion on whether to declare a state of emergency over the incident, only to later decide against it.\nDr Mahathir\xa0told reporters that there was no need to declare an emergency.\nAMMONIA POLLUTION\nIn early April,\xa0ammonia pollution in Sungai Sayong\xa0disrupted water supply to about 17,000 households in Kulai, a town in southern Johor.\nThe pollution occurred when a reservoir at a bio-composite centre next to an oil palm mill in Sedenak burst, causing water containing ammonia to flow into Sungai Sayong, which supplies raw water to the Johor River.\nSeveral water treatment plants in the area suspended operations on Apr 3.\nOn Apr 4, Singapore's national water agency PUB said its Johor River Waterworks plant halted treatment operations due to the high levels of ammonia in the river. It resumed operations on Apr 6.\nOn Tuesday, a water treatment plant at Simpang Renggam, near Ayer Hitem, was shut down due to high ammonia content readings, exceeding the level permitted by the Health Ministry.\nThe ammonia pollution was believed to have occurred as leachate seeped when the embankments of a discharge pond broke due to heavy rain.\nOn Apr 9, PM Lee said if the Johor River suffers an incident like the recent one at Sungai Kim Kim, the effects “will be disastrous for both countries”.\nHOW THIS AFFECTS SINGAPORE\nBeside drawing up to 250 mgd\xa0of water daily,\xa0Singapore is also required to supply Johor with 5 mgd of treated water. However, in practice, Singapore has been supplying 16 mgd of treated water to Johor at its\xa0request.\nIn 1990, PUB and Johor had signed an agreement to construct the Linggiu Dam to increase the yield of the Johor River.\nJohor owns the Linggiu Dam, but Singapore has paid more than S$300 million for its construction and operational costs, as well as compensation for the land used for the Linggiu Reservoir, the potential loss of revenue from logging activities, and as a one-time payment of the lease of that land for the remaining tenure of the 1962 agreement.\nAs Mr Lee noted on Apr 9, Johor has built water plants on the Johor River, upstream of PUB’s waterworks at Kota Tinggi. These plants, together with PUB's Kota Tinggi water works, could possibly draw more water than the river can sustain.\nMr Lee noted that it is in both countries' interests to work together to ensure sustainable water supply.\nThere is also a potential environment dimension for Singapore.\nAt the height of the Sungai Kim Kim incident, there were concerns over how transnational pollution might affect the water quality of fish farms in Singapore.\nHowever, the authorities said no anomalies or fish mortality had been observed at Singapore’s fish farms.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Johor ', '     environment ', '     Singapore ', '     Malaysia ']}"

      A walk on the wild side: Singapore’s upcoming nature attractions
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Singapore may be known as a thriving modern city, but it is also home to a diverse, rich ecosystem.\xa0\nIn January, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced a 10-year action plan to strengthen Singapore's rainforests and facilitate regeneration in secondary forests in buffer nature parks.\nAdditionally, more green spaces will be introduced across the island and a series of new park connectors and trails will make these areas more accessible than ever.\nIf you're looking for an adventure in nature or a mere change in scenery, away from the bustling cityscape, you may want to plan a visit to these new and\xa0upcoming sites.\nCOAST TO COAST (C2C) TRAIL\nOpened on Mar 30, this trail stretches from Jurong Lake Gardens in the west to Coney Island Park in the north-east.\nThe\xa036km trek will see you traverse\xa0parks and nature areas such as the Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Jurong Lake Gardens.\nSome highlights of the trail include Adam Road Food Centre, Punggol Waterway Park’s Adventure Bridge and the upcoming water facilities at the Jurong Lake Gardens. And you'll be happy to note that are also numerous\xa0shelters and restrooms\xa0along the way.\xa0\nVisitors can choose to follow NParks’ trail guide or download the Coast to Coast (C2C) app, NPark’s first augmented reality (AR) app, to explore the parks and nature areas with a DIY trail guide.\nUsing the AR scanning mode at various checkpoints will launch 3D animated animal characters that gives visitors information on the native flora and fauna that can be found along the trail, as well as surrounding places of interest.\nAdditionally, visitors can take part in activities within the app to earn points, which can be used to redeem rewards such as F&B vouchers, products and services.\nRIFLE RANGE NATURE PARK\nLocated south of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, this 67ha park will serve as a buffer to reduce edge effects on the nature reserve, as well as an alternative venue for visitors to connect with nature.\nA ramble\xa0through this forest habitat may see you\xa0chancing\xa0upon its eclectic inhabitants – native fauna species such as the Sunda pangolin and Horsfield’s flying squirrel can be found here. Crabs, frogs, fish and snakes can also be seen in the streams.\nRestoration works on habitats in the park began in January this year, to be completed in 2020.\xa0\nAs part of the Forest Restoration Action Plan, the regenerating secondary rainforests will be “enhanced with native plants to improve the habitat for native biodiversity in the area”, said NParks in a press release.\nTo help animals cross to neighbouring parks safely and aid their chances of long-term survival, aerial rope bridges and underground culverts will be installed across Rifle Range Road. Nest-boxes for flying squirrels will also be set up as part of habitat enhancement works.\nIn addition to these, the former Sin Seng Quarry\xa0will be restored.\xa0\nThis is to allow visitors to learn more about Singapore’s native biodiversity, said NParks. Visitors will be able to access the quarry via an elevated walkway, which will be “sensitively implemented”, the authority added.\nExisting trails will also be improved to stop soil erosion and compaction. Designated trails will be bordered by railings to discourage visitors from straying away. Doing so can help prevent footpath widening into the forest, as well as minimise soil impaction on tree roots and trampling on leaf litter organisms.\nRAIL CORRIDOR \nIf heritage sites interest you, take a walk along the 24km Rail Corridor, which runs from Woodlands in the north to Tanjong Pagar in the south.\nEnhancement works on the railway will be completed in phases by 2021, starting with Rail Corridor (Central), located between the Hillview and King Albert Park MRT stations on the Downtown Line.\nThis area is known for lush natural landscapes and elements of rich wildlife heritage.\nFollowing the handover of the railway land to Singapore authorities in 2011, the Urban Redevelopment Authority has been collecting feedback from the community on how it could be improved to suit their needs.\nA number of landmarks along the trail, including the Bukit Timah Railway Station, have been gazetted for conservation.\xa0\nThe railway station will be converted into a heritage gallery and visitor centre, while an F&B outlet will be housed at the nearby station master’s quarters. Railway artefacts will also be restored and adapted for reuse.\nWant more than just a nice selfie along the tracks? The railway can also be used for activities such as learning journeys, heritage walks and nature walks.\nHere you can also find a diverse cast of animals, from birds such as the Sunda Scops Owl and Laced Woodpecker to pangolins.\nFlora complementing the existing vegetation around the nearby Bukit Timah Nature Reserve will also be planted on the Rail Corridor (Central)’s landscape.\xa0 Additionally, habitats of existing flora and fauna will be enhanced to create an environment that would help them thrive.\nMANDAI MANGROVE AND MUDFLAT\nBird watchers will want to break out their gear and make a stop at this upcoming site, located about 3km east of Sungei Buloh Wildlife Reserve.\nMandai Mangrove and Mudflat is one of the richest wetlands in Singapore, and one of the few mangrove habitats left in Singapore with an extensive mudflat exposed at low tide.\xa0\nIn 2018, NParks announced that it will be conserved as a nature park that will act as an outdoor education, learning and research centre. This is slated to open in mid-2022.\nAccording to NParks, this site is home to 20 mangrove plant species, of which 16 is threatened, as well as threatened species of seagrass and horseshoe crabs.\nVisitors can expect to see migratory shorebirds feed on the diverse and abundant supply of mollusks, crustaceans and worms found on the mudflat.\nTo minimise impact on the mudflat, visitor amenities at the site will be kept to a minimum. These include bicycle racks, a nature trail and bird hides, which will be strategically placed so that visitors can watch these migratory birds without disturbing them.\nThe 72.8ha nature park is ecologically linked to the wildlife reserve. These two sites, together with the Kranji Marshes, safeguard a variety of complementary wetland habitats to strengthen the conservation of wetland biodiversity in north-western Singapore, said NParks.\xa0\nThese habitats include mangroves, freshwater marshes and mudflats.\nNParks added that it will “sensitively provide opportunities for research and education” in the park, to allow visitors to learn more about the biodiversity in the wetland and to play a part in its conservation.\nAs part of the upcoming Round Island Route (RIR) and Rail Corridor, the park will be accessible to users exploring both routes.\xa0\nThose keen to explore more of the area can make their way along the RIR, as the park will be located at a section designated as an eco-discovery corridor. This corridor highlights lesser known ecological locations in Singapore.\nROUND ISLAND ROUTE\nEver wanted to walk from one end of Singapore to another?\nThe\xa0Round Island Route (RIR) is a continuous\xa0park connector that goes around the island. It\xa0will link existing sites and provide opportunities for recreational activities such as cycling, jogging and skating, said NParks. This, it added, will enhance the “City in a Garden” experience for residents.\nThe 150km route was conceptualised in 2011, after members of the public suggested a green corridor that goes around Singapore that will link parks and park connectors. The next year, plans to develop the route were announced.\nOn Mar 30, NParks launched Rower’s Bay, part of the route’s first phase of works. Rower’s Bay features a wetland, lookout pavilion and a boardwalk.\nThree heritage trees and a shelter with charging points are located along a 3km path connecting this area to Seletar Aerospace Park. When completed by 2020, this phase will connect Rower’s Bay to Gardens by the Bay via Changi Beach Park and East Coast Park.\nBy the following year, another 60km of paths between Rower’s Bay and Gardens by the Bay will be connected, making a loop of 120km. Part of this will run along the upcoming Rail Corridor.\nThe RIR is expected to be progressively fully completed by 2035.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     NParks ', '     environment ']}"

      The whale shark guardians of the Philippines and the case of the missing big fish
  </h1>, 'text': 'DONSOL, Philippines: For such enormous creatures, whale sharks tend not to reveal much of themselves. They know how to hide.\nIt is one the reasons an encounter with the world’s biggest fish is so highly prized.\nWaters around Donsol in southern Luzon in the Philippines are\xa0where many whale sharks reveal themselves, underwater foragers drawn from the depths towards where fishermen\xa0eye smaller catches.\xa0\nThis is a bountiful hunting ground for the sharks, a nutrient-rich passage where rivers meet the sea and favourable currents encourage the growth of plankton.\nLocal fishermen say their ancestors always knew about the presence of the whale sharks. But they never understood much about them.\nThese underwater giants were not being caught, nor were they the subjects of folklore. They were nuisances, though, feasting on the riches of plankton in the area but often at the expense of fishermen’s netting.\nAlan Amanse remembers fear coming over him too as a young boy, spotting the drifting shadow below his boat.\n“The first time I saw a whale shark was when I was seven years old. A friend invited me to catch fish that day. When we saw it, we screamed,” he said.\n“I had no idea what a whale shark was.”\nHe\xa0knows about them now. Amanse is the president of the group charged with the guardianship of the creatures, known as buntanding in the Philippines. The Buntanding Interaction Officers Association is a motley collection of local men who have helped carve out a tourism business on the backs of their visiting marine friends.\nDozens of tourists each day descend on the previously unknown village for boat trips in the hope of spotting and swimming with the sharks - up to 18-metres long in Donsol - in their natural habitat.\nWith conservation at its core, not profit, the program is lauded throughout the country as a successful marriage between humans and nature.\n“I saw them take pride in it and that worked wonders for conservation of the whale sharks. It’s one of the most successful awareness campaigns ever in conservation in the Philippines,” said AA Yaptinchay, the director of Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines.\nThe sea around Donsol is murky and with poor visibility of between three and five metres - a dilemma only for snorkellers, not the marine life. It means a glimpse of a whale shark is instant, fleeting and precious.\nLocals have been forced to garner new skills in the\xa0increasingly challenging effort\xa0to showcase the wildlife that people now travel from across the world to witness.\nRandy Radana is a whale shark spotter. He stands on the canopy of the boat for three hours each outing, scanning the distant waters for any sign of whale shark activity. It is a precise and unique task; a fraught search for a dorsal fin, a shadow or a disturbance in the water.\nIt has also changed his life.\n“We love and care for the whale sharks because we get our income from them. We get our funds for our children’s schooling and our everyday budget from whale shark tourism,” he said. “We didn’t know that these large creatures would become a big blessing for us.”\nTourism is a boon for Donsol now, but it was not always a guaranteed endeavour. Some 20 years ago it was not even on the radar.\nFROM HUNTED TO HONOURED\nIn the mid to late 1990s, the hunting of whale sharks was hitting its peak in the Philippines. While sharks were traditionally caught in some communities,\xa0cultural activities, particularly around Bohol, began to turn commercial, sparking concern among environmentalists.\nAA Yaptinchay, formerly of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), was on the ground in communities at that time. He watched the hunts increase as foreign buyers became involved.\n“Initially it was a traditional fishery to serve the local markets but somehow it became this exportable thing. They were shipping out fresh meat to Taiwan. It was developing into a big business,” he said.\nIt was around the same time that an abundance of whale sharks began to be noticed around Donsol. Sensing an ecological opportunity, quick action was launched to try and create new protection\xa0for the whale sharks in the area.\n“We were worried that the buyers of whale sharks in Bohol would relocate there.” Yaptinchay said. The spotting of the sharks grew to national prominence almost instantly, and it prompted then president Fidel Ramos, a keen diver, to proclaim them a protected species.\nIt was a milestone moment, beyond the hopes of what WWF was calling for. And according to Amanse, the ruling came just in time.\n“There were outsiders from Balatan who were able to hunt four whale sharks. The problem was the hunters were able to run free because there was no law penalising such acts during the time they were caught,” he said.\n“The law was only enacted three days after the hunters were caught.”\nWhat followed was an unprecedented and unexpected tourism surge in the local area. “Donsol boomed. When we first went there, they had never seen anyone in a bathing suit,” Yaptinchay said.\n“No one knew about the whale sharks. Even us, in science field, they were meant to be rare animals. We were shocked that Donsol had been there forever, and locals had been seeing whale sharks forever.”\nWHERE ART THOU, WHALE SHARK?\nWhile poachers’ ambitions of capturing whale sharks in Philippine waters have been eviscerated, there is still something going wrong.\nThe number of whale shark sightings in Donsol is on a dramatic slide. During the 2018 season, the number of individual fish\xa0encountered fell to just 46. In comparison, that number was 211 in 2009.\nThe total number of encounters last year, including repeat sightings of the same shark, was just one-third of the number in 2017.\n“The trend is going downwards,” said Andrea Pimentel, an assistant researcher on whale sharks for WWF in Donsol.\nAt the same time, sharks are being drawn in sizeable numbers to a tourism-focused operation in Oslob in Cebu province. They are lured close to shore to an “interaction zone” using food, an experience compared to a “theme park” by AA Yaptinchay.\nOn any given day, Oslob can expect more than a dozen sharks to appear for feeding. Their season runs 364 days a year. In Donsol, spotting just one or two wild sharks looking for natural sources of food each day, during a migration period lasting about two months, is the new normal.\n“These are migratory animals so they’re used to roaming around but in the other place (Oslob) they stay there because there’s food for them. The nature of being migratory is gone for some whale sharks,” said Manul Narvadez, WWF Donsol’s project manager.\nBut, for now, no research has proven the Oslob operation has directly affected the sharks appearing in Donsol.\nThe economics for the respective communities are on vastly different scales. Donsol receives just a small fraction of tourists in comparison with Oslob’s half a million visitors last year.\nWhile operators in Donsol refuse to turn to feeding whale sharks themselves, it is evident that the shrinking sightings has seen them start bending their own regulations. There are fewer visitors. But they have high expectations.\nOut on the water, the pursuit of the sharks has become desperate. “No-one is following the rules,” says Alan Amanse. \xa0\nThere is a growing pressure on the buntanding officers to ensure sightings. It means up to 30 boats, the maximum allowed each day, can each follow and circle the same animal once it is located.\n“In the interaction, there is a policy of one boat, one shark but it is seldom followed. The interaction operated more smoothly when there were still few tourists and there were many whale sharks,” he said.\n“Most of the guests are nice, but there are those who are hardheaded. They say a lot of mean things when they fail to see a whale shark.” The guaranteed experience in Oslob and pursuits of whale shark selfies have contributed to the pressure, he believes.\nThere are environmental issues at play too. And not all of that can be controlled by Donsol’s whale shark stakeholders. Climate change is looming as the number one threat to the whale shark population in the Philippines.\nThey are one rather large component of a delicate ecosystem.\n“Temperature of the sea plays an important role in the presence of whale sharks. If the temperature will rise probably there will be a change in the composition of our plankton,” Pimentel said.\nThe WWF, which is a founding partner and supporter of the conservation-tourism project concedes that some of the rules needs to change to better ensure its sustainability. What worked 15 years ago when whale sharks could be spotted with ease needs adjusting during these leaner days.\n“It’s about balancing our economy and also the conservation of our resources. It is the challenging part. But we need to address a sustainable means of tourism so the whale shark will be preserved for the future,” she said.\nDonsoleños understand the precariousness of the environmental situation. The local government is still reliant on its big ticket but is eager to expand its offerings to visitors.\nThe off-season is long in Donsol and the tourism dollar is hard fought but enticing.\nThere is a communal hope that the current downturn is temporary and the sea will turn bountiful like it always was, in the days when whale sharks would bump their noses against small boats before diving away into the mysterious blue.\n“We take pride in our role as protectors of the sea, tourists, and whale sharks,” said Amanse, his boatmate Randy Randana in agreement.\n“I hope that someday the whale sharks will return like before.”\nThis is the second in a two-part series looking at the plight of whale sharks in the Philippines.

      Sheep nibble Madrid's largest park into shape
  </h1>, 'text': 'MADRID: It\'s a rustic scene: sheep graze placidly on grass as a shepherd keeps watch. But this is Madrid\'s largest public park, not the tranquil countryside.\nMadrid city hall has since February employed 500 sheep to munch undergrowth at the Casa de Campo, a former royal hunting ground with pines and scrubland stretching over 1,722 hectares - an area about five times the size of New York\'s Central Park.\nThe goal is to reduce the risk of wildfires by clearing vegetation in an environmentally-friendly way while also helping to educate the Spanish capital\'s roughly 3.2 million residents about rural life.\n""It\'s a very efficient method to prevent wildfires in a much more natural way,"" said Beatriz Garcia San Gabino, 46, who is in charge of managing Madrid\'s green spaces.\n""Instead of clearing scrub with machines, you use sheep which don\'t consume fuel and don\'t erode or contaminate the soil.""\nManure from the sheep also helps to fertilise the soil and spread seeds across the park, she added.\nMost of the sheep belong to a breed indigenous to Spain which is vulnerable to extinction, the Rubia del Molar which are mainly white with pale brown faces and legs.\nPeople are ""delighted"" to come across the sheep in the park, said Alvaro Martin, 45, one of two shepherds who look after the flock full time.\n""Everyone approaches then, a lot of people understand the work that the sheep do in the park, to clean and reap the grass. Children approach them immediately and ask \'can I touch them?\',"" he said as he guarded over the sheep with the aid of a dog as they grazed on grass while cyclists raced by on a nearby trail.\nThe park\'s attractions include an artificial lake, a zoo, an amusement park with more than 50 rides, a cable car line and a public swimming pool.\nWhen the sun sets the sheep sleep inside a large white tent set up on top of a hill which offers sweeping views of Madrid\'s Royal Palace.\nAs temperatures rise in mid-June, the sheep will return to their home at a ranch run by the Los Apisquillos farm cooperative in the Puebla de la Sierra, a mountain village located about 110km north of Madrid.\nThe flock will move back to the park in mid-October to spend winter in the city where it is warmer and there is more vegetation.\nPeople can ""sponsor"" one of the sheep by paying €30 to €90\xa0(US$34 to US$100) a year to help support the project as Madrid\'s left-wing mayor Manuela Carmena, a 75-year-old former judge, has already done.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Spain ', '     Madrid ', '     environment ']}"

      Whale shark selfies in the Philippines’ seaside ‘theme park’: A tourist experience that's out of control?
  </h1>, 'text': 'OSLOB, Philippines: The effortless glide of the whale shark is a spectacular sight. Close to the surface of the water, the spotted skin of each passing giant shimmers in the refracting sunlight.\nA fleeting glimpse of the world’s biggest fish - a rare and mysterious creature - would be special. In Oslob, though, a small fishing village in the central Philippines, they appear in a procession.\nOn this day, some 15 sharks, most of them male juveniles, have made their way into the so-called “interaction zone”. About 2,000 people will join them, and for five hours the sharks will perform lap after lap along their underwater catwalk.\nThese are hungry beasts, constant feeders\xa0being lured from their wild hunting grounds. They raise their colossal mouths to the surface, searching out\xa0the slow-moving feeding boats and\xa0scoffing the handfuls of food being tossed their way.\nOrbiting their calmness is the chaos of hundreds of snorkellers, scuba divers and boat passengers. A flurry of flippers, selfie sticks, and frenetic splashing trail and surround the majestic creatures.\n“Oslob is really a feeding frenzy,” said AA Yaptinchay, the director of Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines. “Now it’s become part of bucket lists. People need to do it. Everyone wants a whale shark now.”\nThe spectacle begins as the sun rises with the day’s first tourist boats assembling, barely 100 metres from the shore.\nThe visitors out early on the water have won out in the predawn hustle for a number in the first come, first served queue. About half of the daily contingent are foreign tourists - mostly from China, Korea and Japan - and they scramble for prime position in the tightly managed schedule to get their chance to see the sharks up close.\nThirty boats are allowed in the feeding zone at any given time, for only 30 minutes each. Though in principle there are rules designed to protect the welfare of the sharks, such as a three-metre buffer zone, the reality is akin to an aquarium with no barriers.\nTourists test the boundaries of what is allowed, unable or unwilling to resist touching the sharks as they pass.\nA study in 2014 showed non-compliance rates with keeping a minimum distance from the sharks was 97 per cent. It is behaviour described as a “guilty pleasure” by environmental researchers.\nThere is nowhere else on earth where this happens.\nThe Oslob practice has been controversial since its inception in 2012. The industry was born by chance on the supposed request of a Korean diver who wanted to see the sharks, which are regular visitors to the food-rich waters, closer to shore.\nFishermen had always considered whale sharks pests, disruptive to their work as they tangled in their nets. Recently, they\'ve been seen as valuable generators of cash.\nFor about 15 years, another eco-tourism project allowing visitors to swim with wild whale sharks had been operating with huge success in Donsol, a small fishing village in southern Luzon.\nOslob locals seized their chance to not only replicate that success but take it to whole new levels. They started feeding the whale sharks - a practice strictly prohibited in Donsol and elsewhere - and watched as the business exploded.\nNow, hundreds of thousands of people are drawn to the small fishing town every year. Whale shark interaction is a 364-day-a-year activity - they only rest on Good Friday. In 2012, the attraction was visited by nearly 63,000 tourists. In 2018, that number soared to more than half a million.\nOn busy days, more than 2,000 people are ferried out to interact with the animals. Even off-peak, the number can reach a thousand. The notion of seasonal whale shark appearances - they are migratory creatures - is over here.\n""We love whale sharks so much, we’re loving them to death,"" Yaptinchay said.\nWhile the Donsol project began with shark conservation as its core function, Oslob is purely and unashamedly economic. And this multi-million dollar industry has deeply divided the country.\n‘A LEARNING EXPERIENCE’\n“Before, Oslob was a sleepy town. It was a quiet town,” said\xa0municipal tourism officer Elizabeth Benologa. At\xa0the advent of the whale shark enterprise, neither she nor the town’s locals expected it to grow in popularity - or notoriety - like it has.\n“We were just imagining having 100 or 200 visitors each day. Maybe 500.”\nIt was a gross underestimation of the wonder people from around the world would find in these unique encounters. The community impact was sudden but mostly positive.\nThe transformation that subsequently came over Oslob has been dramatic. Hundreds of people have directly found new livelihoods, particularly outside of traditional fishing practices.\nThe daily incomes for those inside the union-like group that runs the whale shark operation are secretive, but understandably believed to be staggeringly high. Each foreign visitor pays around US$19 for the experience, with locals paying half that amount.\n“After several years the fishermen can now send their children to school and can have beautiful houses and cars. The lifestyle has improved,” Benologa said.\nMuch-needed infrastructure has slowly been catching up to demand, including guesthouses, restaurants and alternative tourism sites. Shopping malls and a five-star resort are the next big-ticket items earmarked for the area.\nIt is on this basis that stakeholders in the business argue for its uninterrupted continuation.\nAmong those is one of the key national government groups tasked with oversight of environmental impacts of marine activities like this one, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR).\nJohann Tejada, a BFAR fishing regulation officer and marine biologist is an unabashed cheerleader for the whale shark interactions.\n“No whale sharks have ever been killed during the entire operation. No tourists were harmed,” he said. “So why would you say it’s a bad thing?”\nNonetheless, there is a long queue\xa0of environmental groups and researchers producing evidence that greater care needs to be taken to prevent unknown long-term impacts on what is an endangered and protected species.\nUnderstanding of whale sharks, their behaviour, breeding and resilience is still far from complete. But already there are warning symptoms.\nThe Large Marine Invertebrates Research Institute Philippines (LAMAVE) is one the leading groups studying the what is happening in Oslob. Their field studies have raised ethical and environmental questions around the feeding of the sharks.\nResearch showed the potential for the annual movements of whale sharks to be modified, their hunting habits to be altered and their reliance on humans to increase. Already, sharks in the Oslob area associate boats with food and have adopted a vertical feeding position directly below them to more easily reach the shrimp being thrown by human feeders.\nIt is unusual and worrying, according to AA Yaptinchay. “They’re not meant to be in that shallow depth. It affects body temperature regulation, causing stress to the animal making them more susceptible to disease and reproduction could be affected,” he said.\nSome of the sharks are also showing “anticipatory behaviour”, arriving within five minutes of the feeding boats every single morning, without fail.\nThese\xa0are concerns that Tejada says are overhyped and unconfirmed. “Until now it has never been proven,” he said.\n“I’m not saying it’s perfect. Because it\'s the first time, it’s a learning experience. There’s nowhere else to compare.”\nHe says the local community “should take advantage of the opportunity” to change their lives now, knowing that whale sharks could be “gone in the blink of an eye”.\n“It’s meant to be adaptive management. If it’s not working, then let’s try to look for another solution.”\n‘WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DINOSAURS?’\nOperators certainly do not have carte blanche in Oslob. Over the past year, Philippine authorities have had unsustainable tourism operations in their crosshairs.\nThe highest profile case saw the six-month closure of the holiday resort island of Boracay, labelled a “cesspool” by President Rodrigo Duterte and held to more strictly enforced environmental standards.\nTourism officer Elizabeth Benologa says Oslob is “absolutely” concerned about a future shutdown affecting their community. In response, a multi-stakeholder task force is in place to monitor the whale shark situation and recommend any needed changes. \xa0\nBut she is already convinced that by “showing love” to the whale sharks they are actually being helped and possibly saved from threats like climate change.\n“As long as they are here, we make them feel like they are really loved,” she said.\n“What happened to the dinosaurs? Why did they not survive? It’s because nobody cared for them. Nobody had a relationship with them. We are always just afraid of the animals. Why don’t we let the animals love us and we will love them too?\n“Dinosaurs didn’t know where to go or who would be their knight in shining armour during climate change so they died. But here we can help these animals. If they cannot adapt, they will die,” she suggested.\n“I want the environmentalists to open their minds, open their hearts, not just for the animals but the people around them. “\nMeantime, legislation is being pushed through at a national level that could fundamentally alter the future of shark protection in the Philippines. The Philippine Shark Conservation Bill, which could be passed in 2019, would support more shark conservation programs on a national scale.\nCrucially, new laws would outlaw the feeding of sharks, although Yaptinchay concedes that Oslob is likely to be exempt from the restriction. He says he can live with that, as it would still mean no new sites could start operating.\n“I don’t think all the stakeholders know what is hitting them. It’s a good year for sharks.”\nIn many ways, the plight of whale sharks in the country is both a conservation success story and a cautionary tale. Awareness and pride is high in the Philippines - the whale shark even features prominently on the 100 peso banknote. \xa0\nThe country stands tall and strong on marine conservation issues compared to its neighbours, particularly around species like whale sharks. It is the sole Southeast Asian party to the Convention on Migratory Species, and has proposed better marine protection networks around the region, where cases of whale sharks being hunted remain.\nStill, operations in Oslob remain a blip on its ambitions.\nFor their part, the local fishermen say they do care about the whale sharks and their sustainable future. They have promised to keep improving their practices; indeed, they need to.\n“This is a huge blessing. It is because of them that we have food on our tables, so it is just fair that we take good care of them and conserve them so they live longer,” said Oslob Sea Warden\xa0Mark Rendon.\nIt is an acknowledgment of a duty of care that appears to be ignored by many of the tourists in overloaded boats who pursue the whale sharks in their snorkelling equipment.\nOn their interaction tours, there is no environmental or learning information about whale sharks provided, and the rules and safety briefing is conducted in English -\xa0a problem for scores of the visitors.\nRegardless of best intentions, organised chaos ensues as a result.\n“I wouldn’t label Oslob sustainable. It’s like a theme park ride,” Yaptinchay said.\n“I wish people would care more about the animal, rather than their selfie.""\xa0\nThis is the first in a two-part series looking at the plight of whale sharks in the Philippines.

      Fukushima contaminants found as far north as Alaska's Bering Strait
  </h1>, 'text': 'ANCHORAGE, Alaska:\xa0Radioactive contamination from Japan\'s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant hit by a tsunami in 2011 has drifted as far north as waters off a remote Alaska island in the Bering Strait, scientists said on Wednesday (Mar 27).\nAnalysis of seawater collected last year near St. Lawrence Island revealed a slight elevation in levels of radioactive cesium-137 attributable to the Fukushima disaster, the University of Alaska Fairbanks Sea Grant program said.\n""This is the northern edge of the plume,"" said Gay Sheffield, a Sea Grant marine advisory agent based in the Bering Sea town of Nome, Alaska.\nThe newly detected Fukushima radiation was minute. The level of cesium-137, a byproduct of nuclear fission, in seawater was just four-tenths as high as traces of the isotope naturally found in the Pacific Ocean.\nThose levels are far too low to pose a health concern, an important point for people living on the Bering Sea coast who subsist on food caught in the ocean, Sheffield said.\nCesium-137 levels some 3,000-times higher than those found in the Bering Sea are considered safe for human consumption under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards, officials said.\nA 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered meltdowns at three of the Fukushima Daiichi plant\'s six reactors, spewing radiation into the air, soil and ocean and forcing 160,000 residents to flee.\nIt was the world\'s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier.\nLONG-TERM STUDY\nThe results reported on Wednesday came from a long-term but small-scale testing program.\nWater was sampled for several years by Eddie Ungott, a resident of Gambell village on the northwestern tip of St. Lawrence Island.

Along such a corridor, more space can be allocated for buses, cycling paths and pedestrian walkways.\nIn addition, URA said that it is planning to introduce more homes in the CBD and Marina Bay to increase the vibrancy of the office-dominated Downtown.\nMore mixed-used urban neighbourhoods that combine amenities, residential and commercial buildings will be brought in to liven up the neighbourhood, similar to what has been done in Tanjong Pagar.\nAnother way of injecting life to familiar places could be through letting vacant state properties or land for short-term uses, such as around Marina Bay, said URA. This will create opportunities to try out new lifestyle offerings.\xa0\n""The adaptive reuse of existing buildings is about creating opportunities for new users to go in to some of these old buildings there are not yet ready for rejuvenation or redevelopment. So some of these adaptive reuse could add new interests to different precincts and bring in new life to the places,""\xa0said Ms Hwang Yu-Ning, URA’s chief planner.\xa0\nSingapore’s main shopping belt Orchard Road will undergo a facelift as well.\xa0\n""Differentiated experiences""\xa0are planned for each sub-precinct, namely Tanglin, Orchard, Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut. They will be linked by a green corridor between two parks, Singapore Botanic Gardens in Tanglin and Fort Canning Park in Dhoby Ghaut, that flank the shopping street.\nMORE PLAY SPACES IN NATURE\nThe 24km Rail Corridor which runs from Woodlands in the north to Tanjong Pagar in the south will be fully linked up by 2021.\xa0\nSome areas around the railway will be conserved for its heritage value such as the Bukit Timah Railway Station and Station Master’s Quarters. Both buildings will be refurbished and re-purposed with suitable amenities.\xa0\nNearby, the former Bukit Timah Fire Station and Beauty World will be transformed into gateways for the surrounding nature and heritage attractions such as the Coast-to-Coast trail, Rifle Range Nature Park and the Rail Corridor.\xa0\nThe former fire station building will be conserved and turned into a visitor centre and a central point for the network of attractions in the area.\xa0\nLikewise, street-level activities and landscaping will be added to improve the walking experience and access from Beauty World to the Rail Corridor.\xa0\nTo the north, a 50km belt of parks, beaches and nature attractions will line the northern coast.\xa0\nCalled the Greater Rustic Coast, it will run from Changi to Lim Chu Kang. Visitors will get to see places of military and industrial heritage such as the area formerly occupied by the RAF Seletar, and nature reserves teeming with biodiversity like the Kranji Marshes and Mandai Mangrove and Mudflats.\xa0\nURA is also exploring recreational options in Kranji, specifically at the Singapore Racecourse, and assessing if it can be turned into a family-friendly and communal spot.\nINDUSTRIAL HERITAGE SPOTS\nThe former Pasir Panjang Power District will be rejuvenated as a new lifestyle and heritage spot highlighting its industrial heritage.\nURA said that it is exploring different ways to realise this, including the adaptive reuse of the former power station buildings and opening up the grounds for public access.\xa0\nIt added that it will be sensitive to the adjacent Labrador Nature Reserve as it explore new uses of the spot.\xa0\nAs part of the Greater Southern Waterfront, URA and the Singapore Land Authority will be launching a competition in April for members of public to contribute ideas on how the precinct can be transformed.\n""The idea competition is targeted at not just the so-called design professionals or the real estate professionals but it\'s really for the community to get on board and give us ideas on how they see the different areas and what potential they see in the different buildings and locations,""\xa0said Ms Hwang.\xa0\nSimilarly, the URA will be holding an ideas competition later this year to seek the public\'s views for the transformation of Paya Lebar Air Base.\xa0\nURA said that some of the preliminary ideas include repurposing the former airport buildings and part of the runway into community spaces to retain the area\'s rich aviation heritage, building a network of parks and open spaces, as well as building a mixed-used neighbourhood for future residents.\nThe public can look through the Draft Master Plan 2019 at an exhibition at the URA Centre Atrium from Mar 27 to May 24. Members of the public can also provide feedback and proposals to the URA and Ministry of National Development.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Urban Redevelopment Authority ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Air purifiers may be doing more harm than good
  </h1>, 'text': 'YORK, England: I recently found myself in the surreal world of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas discussing the next generation of pollution sensors that one day you might find inside your phone.\xa0\nThe exhibits I saw suggested the next big thing in home technology could be anything from intelligent cat litters to internet-enabled teapots, with everything powered by mysterious machine learning and the unfathomable blockchain.\nBut there was no escaping that air quality and air purification is now a seriously big thing in the consumer products world.\xa0\nMost major white goods manufacturers have a range of products. There are also plenty of start-ups offering new variants – including purifying robots that wander forlornly around your home and bizarre bio-inspired devices that blow air over the leaves of poor unsuspecting houseplants.\nIf you live in Europe it could be easy to dismiss these as tech gadgets that may never catch on, but that would be badly misjudging the ever-expanding user base for home air filtration that already exists in Asia and beyond. These devices are for sale because people want them, and the market could be worth in excess of US$30 billion per year by 2023.\nINDOOR AIR\nIn some regards, indoor air purification is an individually empowering technology. In a well-sealed home, filtration-based purifiers clearly make a difference and can noticeably reduce concentrations of tiny harmful particles, particularly if the home is somewhere with lots of pollution outdoors, such as central Beijing or Delhi.\nThe evidence for the removal of harmful gases indoors, including\xa0volatile organic compounds\xa0from paints and glues, is sketchier. Some systems get the gases to stick to a charcoal-based filter, but there is little independent data that shows these actually work.\xa0\nIn other types of purifiers, UV radiation is used to accelerate a chemical reaction that turns those gases into carbon dioxide and water.\xa0\nHowever, manufacturers have not yet published data to show that this process doesn’t actually end up converting relatively benign compounds into something more harmful.\nOutdoor air filtration demonstrators have so far proved ineffective, simply because\xa0the atmosphere is so huge\xa0relative to the size of the filtering system.\xa0\nHowever, indoors, the balance shifts. Homes have internal volumes measured in the hundreds to maybe several thousands of cubic metres and, simply due to natural drafts and leaks, the indoor air is swapped with outdoor air perhaps once per hour. That is still a lot of cubic metres of air to clean, but the maths begins to stack up.\nYet the costs of filtration are possibly larger than they first appear. Most air purifiers use cellulose or polymer membranes that are replaced every month or so, often as part of a regular service contract.\xa0\nThe air is pushed through the filters with fans and pumps which use energy, perhaps anywhere between 100 watts (equivalent to a bright lightbulb) and 1,000 watts (a microwave), depending on the size of the air cleaner and home.\nPoor air quality in this sense then impacts on climate by increasing energy demand in the home and the city, and of course it adds directly to the user’s electricity bill.\xa0\nThe power demands of air filtration are not as great as air cooling, but would potentially run 365 days a year, not just in the summer months. If you add 500 watts of continuous demand to millions of homes, this becomes a big deal.\nCONCENTRATING CHEMICALS\nThen there is the elephant in the room. What happens to all those millions of microfibre particle filters or traps full of activated carbon? I asked that question more than 20 times in Las Vegas and the answer was always the same – you put them in the bin.\nShould we care? Possibly, yes. Filters in the home that collect particles end up concentrating some rather unpleasant toxic chemicals gathered from air outside – heavy metals from brake wear, polycyclic aromatic compounds from wood and coal fires, nitrosamines from cigarette smoke, the list goes on.\xa0\nA filter may end up holding milligrams (and maybe more) of individual chemicals that were initially found in air at very diluted concentrations, and whose previous fate was probably to deposit as a very thin layer over huge areas of land.\nIf hundreds of millions of filters from millions of homes are then all dumped in the same few city landfills, we double\xa0the concentration process. Are we simply shifting a problem from the air into a problem of those same chemicals now leaching out into the soil and water?\xa0\nIt’s unclear how much thinking has gone into this, or the energy demand consequences should hundreds of millions of people start purifying their own air at home.\nThere are some obvious conclusions to be drawn, the most striking being that there is a financial opportunity for someone in every crisis. But this particular solution comes with costs that we haven’t yet well quantified.\xa0\nAir filtration adds electricity demand for sure, it needs raw materials and resources to build, maintain and support and it is possibly creating chemical disposal problems we\xa0haven’t yet evaluated. It does however reinforce the well-trodden scientific principle that it’s always more efficient to stop pollution at source than try to clean up afterwards.\nAlastair Lewis is\xa0Science Director at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science in the\xa0University of York.

      Commentary: As temperatures rise, Indonesia's water-sharing can prevent transboundary haze
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0With 2019 expected to bring hotter and drier-than-usual El Nino weather conditions to Southeast Asia, concerns are heightened about a recurrence of the 2015 haze crisis. The episode of chronic transboundary air pollution that choked the region in a blanket of acrid smoke had severe health, economic and environmental impacts.\nIndonesia, a major haze-producing country, claims to be better prepared for the next intense dry season, expected to start in June this year. Indonesia’s confidence is linked to major land reforms undertaken in the aftermath of the 2015 haze crisis.\xa0\nIn 2016, President Joko Widodo introduced a moratorium on burning, draining and deforesting 4.9 million hectares of peatlands, amending a 2014 regulation.\nThe primary source of transboundary haze comes from biomass burning in peat swamps. When naturally saturated peat swamps are drained for plantation agriculture, they become highly flammable in the dry season months of June to September, increasing the risk of biomass fires that release massive quantities of carbon into the atmosphere.\nWhile Indonesia is taking strides to restore the health of degraded peat ecosystems, current legislation contains major oversights that are igniting new problems in government efforts to combat transboundary haze. There is a critical lack of knowledge about the role of water in preventing and suppressing deep peat fires.\xa0\nAt the same time, the government’s zero-burning policy invalidates indigenous knowledge of controlled burning practices that is needed to adapt to the rapidly changing hydrological conditions of Indonesia’s peatlands.\nHAZE-INDUCING WILDFIRE\nIndonesia’s Riau province on the central east coast of Sumatra is a leading perpetrator and victim of transboundary haze. Half of the province is composed of peatlands. Riau also hosts two-thirds of Indonesia’s pulp and paper production, covering around 1.7 million hectares, along with more than 2.4 million hectares of palm oil plantations.\nWhen companies with global operations build dams upstream of communities, they often expose neighbouring peatland communities to harsher seasonal variations in the form of droughts and floods.\xa0\nThe closure of company dam sluice gates in the dry season to\xa0retain\xa0water on their concessions reduces the flow of water to smallholder farmers and communities, creating localised hotspots of heightened fire risk.\xa0\nWithout readily available water, many peatland communities are left unprepared to effectively respond to haze-inducing wildfires. In the rainy season, when plantation companies open their dam gates, they release excessive rainwater that floods surrounding communities.\nInter-seasonal changes in water availability are encouraging fishermen to work in the dry season. Their discarded cigarettes on combustible biomass have become a commonly cited cause of haze-belching wildfires.\nWATER-SHARING\nThe government has so far adopted a hands-off approach in dealing with water-sharing issues between companies and communities.\xa0\nNo big plantation company has been prosecuted for withholding water from adjacent communities.\xa0Nor have major perpetrators of groundwater pollution been brought to justice for leaking pesticides and fertilisers into communities that bear the cumulative burden of public health problems.\nOverlooking the underlying problem of water sharing will exacerbate existing tensions between companies and communities. If water-sharing arrangements cannot be fairly resolved, the use of fire as a weapon to express grievances is likely to contribute to future episodes of transboundary haze.\nThe inability of peatland communities to optimally function under conditions of dry season water shortages fuels government and company narratives that local people are incapable of managing their own resources. Yet the current government ban on the use of fire for clearing land has delegitimised traditional controlled burning practices, which are now punishable by jail terms and hefty fines.\nFor generations, indigenous groups such as the Dayaks of Central and West Kalimantan have practiced controlled burning to remove excess biomass, destroy pests and prepare land for planting.\xa0\nLikewise, farmers in Riau’s Bengkalis Regency used to create fire breaks before the fire ban by felling trees within a given perimeter and herding fire into the centre of an enclosure to contain it.\xa0\nBefore and during burning in the late wet season, farmers knew that they needed to remain mindful of wind strength and direction to minimise the chance of uncontrolled flames.\nFailure to distinguish between safe burning and uncontrolled or accidental fires impedes the capacity of communities to sustainably adapt to the rapidly changing hydrological landscape of Indonesia’s drained peat swamps.\xa0\nBy targeting peatland communities, Indonesia’s current anti-haze legislation is missing the root cause of the problem, which rests heavily on unequal water-sharing arrangements.\nBoth water and fire knowledge must be shared in ways that are inclusive of peatland communities if governance efforts to deal with predicted El Nino conditions are to succeed. As a starting point, existing water-sharing arrangements between companies and communities that incubate dry season hotspots must be pushed toward fairer resolution.\nWithout greater attention to the nuances in how peatland communities manage their own fire and water resources, government efforts to combat transboundary haze are unlikely to succeed in the longer term.\nMichelle Ann Miller is Senior Research Fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore.

      New S$20 million lab to develop less toxic e-waste recycling methods
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A S$20-million research centre\xa0which aims to develop greener ways of recycling electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) was launched on Wednesday (Mar 13) by the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).\nThe centre focusing solely on e-waste recycling is believed to be a world-first.\nAmong its goals: To extract substantially more valuable metals from lithium-ion batteries\xa0and to recycle silicon from solar panels.\nThe centre, called the NTU Singapore-CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy, also wants to make the process of recycling printed circuit boards cheaper and more environmentally friendly, and to detoxify more plastic parts in e-waste, given that plastics form a major part of devices like printers and flat screens.\nTo\xa0recycle lithium-ion batteries more efficiently, the centre has developed a shredder which can crush the batteries in an oxygen-less environment, necessary to prevent them from\xa0burning up.\nCurrent industrial methods involve incineration, which is costly and energy-intensive, producing toxic fumes that might pollute the environment.\nWith the new method, researchers can extract valuable metals\xa0from the crushed material by\xa0dissolving it in\xa0a chemical solution and then letting it precipitate in a process called hydrometallurgy.\nThe centre aims to extract up to 75 per cent by weight of valuable materials like\xa0lithium, cobalt and manganese - 15 times more than the current 5 per cent. These can be used to produce new lithium-ion batteries,\xa0commonly found in laptops, smartphones and electric vehicles.\nHydrometallurgy can also be used to detoxify plastic parts in e-waste. Currently, only a small amount of this plastic is recycled as it is difficult to separate and remove. It also contains flame retardants that are toxic to human health and the environment.\nAfter detoxifying the plastic, the plastic is put through an\xa0advanced process which involves heating it using microwaves and\xa0breaking it down into fuel.\nIn addition, the centre is exploring how this high-grade plastic can be used for ""novel applications"", like filaments for 3D printing and as a base to grow stem cells.\nIt is also looking into\xa0new ways of recycling printed circuit boards to replace current industrial methods, which emit harmful pollutants\xa0that have to go through costly treatment processes before they can be safely released into the environment.\nInstead, researchers first use X-ray sorting to separate components into different groups based on their metal content. This allows them to choose the best chemical method of recycling, reducing costs by about 20 to 30 per cent.\nOne new method involves the use of a\xa0carbon dioxide-based fluid to ""trap""\xa0the metals; the carbon dioxide\xa0is then re-converted into recyclable gas, leaving behind only the metals.\nFor silicon-based solar panels, the centre aims to extract the silicon from the panel. This silicon, which requires a lot of energy to make, can be used to produce new panels and reduce the costs involved.\nCurrently, industries only recycle the metal frame, glass surface and silver components in a solar panel as it is difficult to separate the thin\xa0silicon, which is glued tightly to the rest of the layers.\nTo overcome this, researchers use a technique called delamination, which involves dislodging\xa0the glue using benign means - as opposed to\xa0heating - that will not destroy the silicon. These include the use of environmentally friendly solvents, and bacteria or microorganisms to ""eat"" the glue.\nARE THESE TECHNOLOGIES SCALABLE?\nThe two organisations and the National Environment Agency (NEA) will pour S$20 million into the collaboration, which comes after the Government identified e-waste as a major stream of trash under its\xa0zero waste masterplan.\nThe Government will also implement a mandatory e-waste management system by 2021.\nSingapore generates about 60,000 tonnes of e-waste a year, equivalent to the weight of 220 Airbus A380 airplanes.\n""This is a significant and timely development,"" Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said at the launch of the centre. ""We are investing in research and development (R&D) in close partnership with industry and research institutions to overcome technological barriers.""\nCo-director of the centre, Professor Madhavi Srinivasan, said the aim is for a majority of these technologies to be scalable within the next three years. This means ensuring it can work with\xa010kg to 100kg of e-waste, before partnering with the industry\xa0for larger-scale testing.\nOn Wednesday, the centre also signed a letter of intent with four companies - battery\xa0producer Durapower, chemicals company Arkema, electric car sharing firm BlueSG and e-waste recycler Virogreen - to kickstart research with\xa0industry.\nNEA\'s director of environment technology Patrick Pang said he was impressed by the progress made by the centre, which was first\xa0announced last August.\n""(The Government\'s) interest in this is to make sure the R&D\xa0results in options (that are)\xa0proven to be cost-effective and of course environmentally safe,"" he said.\nMr Pang added that the Government can\xa0adjust its\xa0infrastructure plans, which can include setting up purpose-built plants to treat e-waste.\n""The actual data of e-waste collected and recycled will allow us to size the appropriate facilities,"" he said.\nHowever, Mr Pang added that it was too early to commit to a timeline, or tell how many of such facilities there will be.\n""As R&D powers our enterprises and creates new opportunities for (the centre and the companies), it will also create highly skilled jobs for our citizens,"" Dr Khor said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Change how you wash your hair to help save the environment
  </h1>, 'text': 'SOUTHAMPTON:\xa0When you hear about businesses with a high environmental impact or activities with a high carbon footprint, you are probably more likely to imagine heavy machinery, engines and oil rather than hairdressing. Yet hairdressing, both as a sector and as an individual activity, can have a massive carbon footprint.\nHairdressing uses high levels of hot water, energy and chemicals. Similarly, in our homes, heating hot water is typically the most energy intensive activity. For the cost of a 10-minute shower that uses an electric immersion heater, you could leave a typical television on for 20 hours.\nSo while it helps to turn lights and appliances off, the real gains in terms of reducing energy usage are in slashing our use of hot water.\nIn\xa0the UK, a\xa0quarter of\xa0emissions are residential and, of those, the vast majority come from running hot water. The longer it runs and the hotter it is, the more energy intensive (and costly) it is.\nLITTLE CHANGES, BIG RESULTS\nMost people use too much shampoo and wash their hair too often.\xa0\nA daily routine of shampooing your hair twice followed by a wash out conditioner uses annually about 14,222 litres of water and 1,252 kWh of energy, costs about £245 (US$316)\xa0and has a carbon footprint of 500 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents.\nOn the other hand, if you shampoo your hair twice a week (supplementing that with a dry shampoo if needed) and use a leave-in conditioner, you will use annually just 613 litres of water and 55 kWh of energy, produce a carbon footprint of 25 kg of CO2e, and cost yourself about £27 a year.\nResearch has also revealed how shampoo can contribute to pollution. Maybe this in part explains why sales of shampoo have fallen over the past few years in the UK – with many people choosing to wash their hair less often.\nWashing your hair less doesn’t just save you money, it’s also much better for your hair condition. It can also help to limit the ageing effects of over exposure to hot water and chemicals on your skin.\nINCREASED AWARENESS\nMy latest research project looks at the issue of sustainability across the hairdressing sector. Not only is the hair sector a high user of resources, but hairdressers probably talk to more people than any other occupation – and are in a great position to pass on advice about lower resource hair care.\nFrom speaking with hairdressers, it seems that ever since the episode of Blue Planet II in which David Attenborough explained how a whale mother was still carrying her dead baby which, it was claimed, had been poisoned by plastics (though scientists working on the show have confirmed there was no actual evidence to prove this) salons have been seeing a massive increase in clients wanting to know that their hairdresser is doing their bit.\n\n\nOur research has found that many hairdressers are keen to make changes that are better for the environment. The opportunity to present their industry as part of the solution rather than part of the problem is very attractive to hairdressers, as it boosts their sense of professional identity and pride in offering a well informed service.\nSUSTAINABLE STYLISTS\nA large focus of the project has been on equipping hairdressers with the skills and knowledge required for them to talk to their clients about sustainable hair care. There are many products out there that are better for the environment, not because they have “organic” or “eco” on the label, but because they reduce the need for hot water.\nDry shampoo is a great example. It is fast, convenient, and great at festivals and on the move. It also makes hair easier to style, is cheap and avoids the need for any hot water.\xa0\n\n\nSimilarly, leave-in conditioner avoids the need for an extra rinse and again makes hair easier to style. It is also fantastic at giving body to fine hair, and saves water, energy, money and time.\nThe salon owner can also obtain a sustainable salon certificate to let customers know these things are important to their business.\nGetting certified as a sustainable salon has numerous benefits, and not just in terms of reputation. Adopting the changes as part of the scheme saves the typical salon 286,000 litres of water, 24,150 kWh of energy and £5,300 a year.\nAnd with new research showing the increased threat of climate change and the need for urgent behavioural change, it is great that simple alterations to our hair care routines – and where we choose to get our hair cut (you can find sustainable salons here) – can make such a difference to the planet we call home.\nDenise Baden is associate professor in Business Ethics at the University of Southampton.

      ‘Out of hand’ haze over Bangkok a symptom of invisible killer pollution in city every day
  </h1>, 'text': ""BANGKOK: Khemmaporn Kaewpong, a wholesale mask seller, can hardly keep up with demand for his products these days.\nAs a thick grey grime hangs over Bangkok’s skyline, Khemmaporn has moved his business from an online marketplace to the streets, as his fellow city residents scramble for clean air.\nEarlier this week, he said\xa0he sold a box of 400 N95 masks in less than an hour, each one fetching THB100 (US$3.15). As air pollution levels have soared, stocks of masks online and in pharmacies have depleted quickly.\nPerched next to a cardboard box full of new supplies at a skytrain station in the\xa0busy business district of the Thai capital, the 41-year-old laments the decline of Bangkok’s air quality.\n“It’s become worse. It’s clearly different from previous years,” he said. “In the past two weeks, I can feel that I have a sore throat. I can physically feel the pollution and know that this is abnormal.”\nBangkok has been gripped by a prolonged, suffocating period of dire air pollution over recent weeks. Seasonal atmospheric conditions, unfavourable winds and the city’s significant self-generated fumes have formed a toxic combination.\nCrop burning outside Bangkok and in neighbouring countries -\xa0Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar - is\xa0partly to blame. A weather phenomenon called thermal inversion is causing the pollution to be trapped close to ground level and prevented from dispersing.\n“The low pressure comes from China and basically the air mass is not moving. The air mass is stagnant and it traps everything. Second, there’s no rainfall,” said Prof Siwatt Pongpiachan, director of NIDA Center for Research and\xa0Development of Disaster Prevention and Management.\nBangkok typically experiences annual events similar to this year, where meteorological conditions conspire to prolong pollution.\n“You cannot control the weather,” said Dr Supat Wangwongwatana, the former director general of Thailand’s Pollution Control Department. “The trends of air quality in Bangkok actually are improving overall over the year. Pollution is declining. It’s just when you look at the short term peaks that is due to the meteorological conditions.”\nBut where countries like China take preemptive measures like closing power plants and reducing vehicles on the roads during high-risk months of the years, Thailand continues to react to the problem, prompting alarm among residents every year.\nThe Thai government was swift in its response to the situation this year, but only implemented localised short-term solutions, like spraying water on roads and attempting cloud seeding to induce rain.\nWith an election looming, Prof Siwatt believes the government lacks the will to enforce stricter measures,\xa0such as\xa0restrictions on private car usage, which could prove unpopular with voters.\n“It’s purely politics.\xa0They’re trying to do things that have short-term solutions and that’s why you’re seeing the spraying of water on the roads, like a Songkran festival, happen very quickly,” he said.\nOn Monday, an emergency government meeting to consider declaring Bangkok a 'pollution control zone'\xa0failed to result in definitive action. Doing so would have induced multiple government agencies to take steps to tackle the problem.\nTara Buakamsri, the country director for Greenpeace, said\xa0it is a sign\xa0the government is refusing to acknowledge the crisis that has unfolded again, with residents only being encouraged to wear face masks and use public transport.\n“We see year after year, up to now, the government is still doing business as usual even though they say there is bad air in Bangkok,” he said.\n“At the end of the day, the government is not taking a drastic action to look at immediate-term and long-term management of air pollution in Bangkok. The government refuses to accept that this is a crisis for people in Bangkok.”\nDr Supat, however, argued\xa0the government is far more alert to the problem this year than in the past. Citizens’ easy access to information about air quality levels through reliable mobile applications, for example, has raised awareness and triggered individuals to take remedial action themselves.\nIn addition, he said\xa0the government has been gradually rolling out measures to reduce emissions, like improving fuel quality and strengthening emission standards.\nBut he added that\xa0more visionary thinking needs to be done to change behaviours, principally to reduce the number of cars on Bangkok roads. Nearly one million new vehicles were registered in Bangkok in 2018 alone, taking the city’s number to more than 10 million in total.\nIn Bangkok, about 70 per cent of the dangerous PM2.5 emissions, which can penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream, are generated by vehicles. The risks are serious: the World Health Organisation asserts that one-third of the world’s deaths from lung cancer, heart disease and stroke are the result of breathing dirty air.\xa0\nMore than 25,000 deaths were attributed to PM2.5 exposure in Thailand in 2016, according to a State of Global Air report.\n“Congestion makes it worse. You have to prepare people and have good public transport. But Bangkok, can you imagine? We don’t have good infrastructure,” Dr Supat said.\n“If you ask people to leave their car right now during this episode, what do you want them to do? Takes buses or take trains? It won’t happen.”\nEven when the thick and highly-visual haze hanging over Bangkok eventually moves on, the risks facing residents,\xa0namely from fine PM2.5 particles caused by high pressure combustion, from factories and vehicles, will remain.\nIn fact, the levels of PM2.5 emissions during the pollution-heavy months are very similar to the summer months and wet season when skies are clearer. But during those times, favourable winds tend to take care of the issue.\nBangkok is “lucky” most of the time, Prof Siwatt said, but it should not be\xa0cause for ongoing complacency.\n“People just believe in what they see. PM2.5, we have been experiencing it for more than 10 years. It’s just not been happening these past three months,” he said.\n“Now, people are scared because they can see the air, that the visibility is so poor. They say, ‘I can’t breathe’. But it’s a silent killer. It comes secretly.”\nThe acute health effects are already being felt. At least three major schools in Bangkok announced they would close for the rest of the the week in response to an alarming number of students falling ill in recent days.\nLaura Tanaka, an expatriate worker from Canada, ensures her children wear N95 masks to school, but is constantly worried about their welfare living in Bangkok.\n“As a mother, you have to consider the long-term impact on your child's health. Some trade offs are expected living in a big city, but this has gotten well out of hand,” she said.\n“The air quality is becoming a real deciding factor whether to stay longer or not.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Bangkok ', '     Thailand ', '     environment ']}"

      A made-in-Singapore solution to the world's plastic waste problem
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Imagine there’s a way to turn the plastic waste that ends up in oceans and landfills into a life-saving material, say, for making cheap fire-resistant jackets for all people.\nIt isn’t hard to do – at least, not any more – for a team of researchers in Singapore dreaming of reducing environmental waste and sharing their breakthrough with the world.\nThese scientists from the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology have converted polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into a highly insulating and absorbent material called aerogel.\nAerogels, the lightest and most porous materials known to man, have existed since the 1930s – and were used to insulate the Mars Pathfinder rover in the 1990s.\nBut this is the first time an aerogel has been made from PET, the same plastic used for water and soft drink bottles.\nAnd with an estimated eight million tonnes of plastic waste entering the world’s oceans each year, there is no shortage of material that could be recycled into aerogel products instead.\nTheir possible real-life applications include: As a lining for fire-retardant coats and carbon dioxide absorption masks that could be used during a fire; better heat and sound insulation in buildings; and cleaning oil spills.\nNUS Associate Professor Hai Minh Duong, the co-leader of the research team, once used to wonder when he saw oil and plastic waste on the beach: “Can we use the rubbish on the beach to clean the oil spills?”\nFellow co-leader, Prof Nhan Phan-Thien, wanted to come up with a real product for everyone, after a lifetime of producing theories.\n“We want everyone to have a (fire-resistant) jacket. For example, we all live in high-rise buildings, and the first thing is safety. And if there’s a fire … everyone can be safe,” he cites.\nNow they have found a solution to these issues and more.\nBETTER THAN WHAT’S OUT THERE\nOver 95 per cent of an aerogel’s volume is made of air, hence the material’s high internal surface area and absorbent qualities.\nBased on the team’s experiments, when their aerogel is coated with certain water-repellent chemicals, it absorbs up to seven times more oil than existing commercial sorbents can – and at a faster rate.\nOwing to its insulating properties, it reduces sound more than any conventional insulation foam can, and insulates against heat many times better than fibreglass.\nWhen coated with flame retardants, it can withstand temperatures of up to 620 degrees Celsius – seven times more fireproof than the thermal lining in conventional fire-fighting suits, but at about 10 per cent of the weight.\nTo explain why aerogels are given different coatings, or surface modifications, Dr Duong uses the metaphor of a video game. “That’s like an expansion pack when you buy the game,” says the 44-year-old.\n“With the surface modification, you can get the wide range of applications, like if you coat the aerogels … with an amine chemical, they can absorb the toxic gases and carbon dioxide.”\nThe most common type of commercially available aerogel is silica aerogel, which he says sells for about S$40 per sheet (A4 size) and is used mainly in the aviation, car, gas and petroleum industries.\nBut his PET aerogel would cost about 50 cents to manufacture, with one recycled bottle producing one sheet.\nBesides devising a more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective aerogel, his team has also shortened the production process – which typically takes up to seven days – to about eight to 10 hours instead.\nIt is all about the recipe used for “cooking” the materials. And Dr Duong has another metaphor handy for a complex process that starts with rendering PET down into fibres: It is like the chemistry between two people.\n“It’s very similar to fibre and fibre. If you’d like (the bonding to be) strong and to hold, they need … the chemical reaction between them,” he says.\nAfter swelling up the fibres with water and then freeze-drying them, the result is “one of the most promising materials in the 21st century”.\nA SERIES OF WORLD’S FIRSTS\nThis is not the first time his team has created a new aerogel. Nearly three years ago, NUS announced their “world’s first” cellulose aerogel, made of paper waste.\nIn January, it was reported that the researchers had, in another pioneering development, turned unwanted cotton-based fabric into an even stronger aerogel.\nThe three aerogels have overlapping applications, although cellulose and cotton aerogels are more skin-friendly and thus could be used for personal care products like diapers, as well as in medical and battlefield settings, such as for rapid haemorrhage control.\nOf the three, the PET version is the strongest and has the fastest absorption capacity. But Dr Duong’s team is not done yet with recycling environmental waste into “amazing” engineering applications.\nIn future, they hope to do the same with rubber waste, for example from tyres, food waste like coffee grounds and soya bean pulp, and even metal or electric waste.\nPeople tend not to recycle now because they think waste cannot be more than low-value material, believes Dr Duong, who has been working at NUS for eight years.\n“As long as they know the value of the waste, (that) they can convert it into a very high value, (then) they’d recycle,” he says.\nBut for now, before his team can get the world to really sit up and take notice, they must commercialise the technology for mass production.\nThey recently published their PET aerogel research in the scientific journal Colloids and Surfaces A, and filed for a global patent.\nThey had earlier licensed the cellulose aerogel technology, through the NUS Industry Liaison Office, to materials and engineering company Bronxculture, based in Singapore.\nBut it may still take three to five years before any commercial product is in the market, reckon Dr Duong and Prof Phan-Thien, 65.\nEager for that to happen sooner, they are in the process of starting their own company to manage their cotton and PET aerogels.\nThe aim is to get it up and running by the end of next year, with some 20 companies worldwide interested in partnering them already.\nIt is an unusual step for university professors, but on Prof Phan-Thien’s part, he is “fascinated” by this project.\n“As an engineer, you need to focus on the products,” he says. “It’s good to lay your hand on something real, and this is it.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     science ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      In South Korea, a lesson to be learned from a plastic waste crisis
  </h1>, 'text': ""SOUTH KOREA: When China – for years the world's largest importer of recyclable materials – banned the import of plastic waste from this year, South Korea was left in a bind.\nThe latter had one of the world’s highest rates of recycling municipal waste – at more than 50 per cent – but following the loss of its biggest buyer of plastic scrap, the country found itself with excess amounts of plastics.\nWith the plunge in prices of plastic waste caused by Beijing’s ban, 48 of South Korea’s recycling firms even halted the collection of plastic and foam wastes, claiming unprofitability and leaving the trash to pile up on pavements.\n“All of a sudden, that whole (recycling) process was gone,” Green Korea activist Bae Sunyoung told the series Coming Clean About Green.\n“We were able to see it for ourselves – we threw out so much trash. And to see it directly was a shock for us.” (Watch the episode here.)\nThe crisis lasted for close to two weeks in April until a compromise was reached, with the government promising financial help to the recycling companies.\nMore than that, however, the problem is forcing South Korea to move away from simply exporting its plastic waste to a more sustainable model of domestic recycling and reduced plastic consumption.\nINDUSTRY DISRUPTED\nThe financial troubles of waste sorting facility Meerae Enterprises are typical of South Korea’s recycling industry this year. For example, it had to reduce manpower and deduct wages, said its owner Jung Namgyu.\nHe now keeps his business afloat through the subsidy provided after the authorities intervened. Under a three-month contract, his company is obliged to continue plastic waste collection, whereby the city government will pay US$0.22 (S$0.30) per kilogramme of waste collected.\nThis is helping his city of Cheongju, about 110 km from Seoul, to remain clean. But that might change when the subsidy ends. “The situation will worsen … There’ll be a situation where the waste collection won’t take place,” he said.\nOne of the things his facility processes is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles, which are compressed and packed for delivery to domestic recyclers for washing and shredding.\nAnd if companies cannot sustain themselves without a subsidy, he is worried that there would be “a big problem environmentally”.\n“If we don’t collect the PET bottles, the PET bottle would be classified as regular trash, and it would be burnt,” he said.\n“This would lower the recycling rate of our country as a whole and negatively affect recycling around the world.”\nREDUCING WASTE\nIn the wake of the industry strike, the Ministry of Environment unveiled tougher regulations in May in order to reduce plastic waste by half and lift the domestic recycling rate from 34 per cent to 70 per cent by 2030.\nEnvironment Minister Kim Eun-kyung said: “To resolve the plastic waste crisis, society as a whole needs to change its ways of production, consumption, recycling and even the culture.”\nTo this end, beverage makers will be banned from using coloured plastic bottles from 2020 because these are more expensive to process for recycling compared with colourless ones.\nThere are also plans to crack down on excessive packaging. And any products containing harmful components such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) will be banned, while other plastic products that are difficult to recycle are set to be phased out.\nPlastic bag usage will also be reduced, while disposable cups and plastic straws at coffee shops and other public places are being phased out gradually by 2027, the government said last month.\nMs Bae agreed that it was time to rethink recycling as a solution to overconsumption. “We have to think about how to reduce trash in the first place. There is already too much plastic that we consume,” she said.\n“Of course it’s important to recycle, but recycling is not the final answer.”\nFED UP WITH CUSTOMERS\nThe government started off by banning the use of plastic cups inside all cafes from August. Plastic cups can be used only for take-out drinks, while in-store customers must be served with non-plastic mugs.\nIn Seoul alone, there are over 18,000 cafes in operation, more than the number of cafes in Seattle and New York combined. So millions of South Koreans are affected.\nAn annoyed 23-year-old university student working in a Seoul cafe said she almost quit her job a few times because of the new rule and customers who harass her about it and lie to her.\n“Many are just not used to using glass mugs at cafes. Some want their drinks in plastic cups in case they want to leave the cafe before finishing their drinks,” she told the Korea Herald.\n“There are many reasons why people lie, and I’m so fed up with having to deal with them.”\nCoffee business owners who violate the new rule is subject to a fine of up to two million won (S$2,400).\nFollowing the national government’s push to cut down on plastic materials, the Seoul city government also pledged last month to halve usage in the capital by 2022.\n“The Seoul city government will also phase out the use of plastic cups and bottles in the city government, and it will forbid the use of disposable plastic cups within the City Hall compounds this year,” the city government said.\nBusinesses including hospitals, movie theatres and even funeral houses will be discouraged from providing disposable plastic products, including cups and bags.\nNO MORE UMBRELLA SLEEVES\nEven plastic umbrella sleeves, traditionally provided at building entrances and subway stations, were not spared. They were replaced with umbrella dryers or water-absorbent carpets.\nThese plastic sleeves were previously incinerated or buried after use because the moisture left on them meant they could not be reused.\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government also plans to crack down on stores that hand out free plastic bags after purchase, as plastic bags make up more than one-third of the city’s recyclable waste.\nCustomers are encouraged to use paper bags or boxes, and business owners violating the rule face a fine of up to 300,000 won.\nSouth Korea is the biggest consumer of disposable plastic products globally, coming out tops at 98.2 kg per person annually, according to a 2016 government report.\nEnvironmental activist Kim Hyun-kyung from the Seoul Korean Federation for Environmental Movement pointed out that the ongoing change is necessary, despite complaints from some consumers and business owners.\n“We’re in a phase where people are still getting used to the change,” she told the Korea Herald. “We eventually have to get to the point where people don’t even have to be informed that they have to use non-plastic mugs in cafes.\n“We need more educational programmes to inform the public that we’re all connected on this planet, and what we consume and discard affects the lives of others.”\nThe series Coming Clean About Green looks at the complex realities of green solutions being pursued across Asia.

But are such measures really benefiting the environment?\nIn January, nearly 70 organisations and individuals criticised the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the dominant seafood sustainability certifier, for failing to uphold standards to reduce overfishing.\nIn a joint letter, they said “an increasing number of controversial fisheries” had been certified despite destroying the environment and having unsustainable practices.\nAt a time when efforts like eco-dining – eating food harvested in a responsible way – ditching plastic straws and switching to electric cars are growing trends, a new Channel NewsAsia series is questioning things that green advocates might take for granted.\nComing Clean About Green looks at how impactful some of these green solutions, from cycling to clean coal, really are. And in the case of eating sustainably, it will take much more than that to make a world of difference. (Watch the episode here.)\nFISHING FOR SOME ANSWERS\nWhen it comes to sustainable seafood labels, there are few options. The Aquaculture Stewardship Council is one, and the Global Aquaculture Alliance’s Best Aquaculture Practice is another.\nAs for the MSC, its Asia-Pacific director Patrick Caleo disputed that his organisation is not doing enough. “If it’s MSC-certified, it’s sustainable,” he said.\nConservation groups would rather the bar be raised much higher, and the industry would rather see it lower.\n“MSC’s bar is set at a very high level: 50 per cent of fisheries that initially go for a pre-assessment don’t go on to achieve MSC certification. We’ve got to be careful that we don’t set the bar too high,"" he added.\nThere are annual surveillance audits of fisheries, he said, and “every point in the supply chain has taken ownership” of products with the MSC label. “The wholesale processes, right back to the fishery, have a chain of custody in place.”\nStill, seafood is a fast-moving industry. Things can go wrong, and one of the risks is mislabelling. In 2016, advocacy group Oceana reported that one in five seafood samples it tested worldwide was mislabelled.\nIn Singapore, this would constitute food fraud under the Wholesome Meat and Fish Act, punishable by a fine of up to S$50,000 and/or a maximum jail term of two years for a first conviction, said the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority.\nBut it still happens. When the CNA team sent eight samples of certified sustainable fish to a laboratory, the results showed that one product did not match its packaging label, which had stated Pacific cod.\nWhen the supplier and the MSC were alerted to this finding, they said they would investigate the matter.\nBUYING ORGANICS\nSustainable fish is not the only food that might not be what it seems. People may take a leap of faith when it comes to organic farm products too.\nAt eco-grocery chain Little Farms, its most popular products are organic. Head of operations Fred Moujalli noted, however, that “being organic doesn’t necessarily mean it’s pesticide-free”.\nThere are, for example, natural pesticides. But that is the shady side of the organic food industry because producers “may not be honest”, according to Thai-Pesticide Alert Network (Thai-Pan) adviser Kingkorn Narintarakul Na Ayutdhaya.\n“We can’t guarantee that they’d use only light pesticides. They might use dangerous ones,” said the activist.\nForty per cent of the world’s organic producers are in Asia. And in Thailand, the amount of organic farmland nearly doubled between 2009 and 2016, backed by government support and growing demand.\nThai-Pan’s tests in 2016, however, found that two in 10 samples of fruits and vegetables certified as organic by the Thai government contained chemical residues.\n“We’d like to advise consumers not to believe or trust it (certification) 100 per cent,” said Ms Kingkorn.\nOne vegetable farm that uses organic fertilisers, and more workers than in conventional farms to get rid of pests and weeds, is Monkey Organic Farm in Chiang Mai. And owner Nives Pirarak bemoans the “fake” organic products of some farmers.\n“As you know, organic products are more expensive than general ones. They’d mix them up and label them all as organic,” he said. His farm took two years to be certified as organic, and he feels “cheated” by such mislabelling.\nI’ve tried very hard, made a lot of effort and spent a lot of time and money.\nSo how does a grocer like Little Farms back its claim that its sells produce which is good for the environment?\n“It’s trust and relationship … If you trust your supplier, and we know where it comes from, that’s enough for me to serve to my customers,” said Mr Moujalli, 43.\n“If I can ring up the supplier and say, ‘you’re stating a 100 per cent organic ingredients – can you please send over your certs, and that’ll be fine’, the minute they start to hesitate, we know there’s something going on.”\nFARM-TO-TABLE EATING\nIt is not just the organic movement that is gaining traction in Singapore. So too are farm-to-table restaurants, which are classified as those using fresh locally grown food.\nOne of them is Open Farm Community, in Dempsey. And head chef Oliver Truesdale-Jutras affirmed that the restaurant “tries to source locally as much as we can”. “We’re trying to shave food miles off our food,” he said.\n“If you’re using organic produce in Singapore from the Netherlands, the miles you’re adding on, in terms of … how much energy gets used, pretty much equate to a standard product from nearby or even a very badly farmed product from nearby.\n“We’re saving a lot of fuel for the world, I guess.”\nThe question of where your ingredients are from is a reminder of the environmental cost of transporting produce. But how much difference would a reduction in food miles make?\nAccording to the study “Food-miles and the relative climate impacts of food choices in the United States”, transport represents only 11 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food, based on an average supply chain of 6,760 kilometres.\nThe production phase contributed 83 per cent of the average household\'s carbon footprint for food consumption, with red meat being around 150 per cent more carbon-intensive than chicken or fish.\nHence the study’s authors, from Carnegie Mellon University, suggested that dietary shifts could be a more effective means of lowering one’s food-related climate footprint than “buying local”.\nIn Singapore, to help consumers when it comes to eating fish, WWF has a sustainable seafood guide, notwithstanding the arguments about certification. There is, however, another question here – about feasibility.\nFor example, cod from Japan and Hokkaido scallops are sustainable but expensive, as with a good number of the other recommended foods, like rock lobster and sea cucumber.\nFood vendors may also have no idea whether their fish is sustainable and where it comes from, or even what is in a product such as fish balls.\nUltimately, consumers can still play a part in eco-dining, but it also takes healthy scepticism and a lot more work to make a real environmental impact.\nThe series Coming Clean About Green looks at the complex realities of green solutions being pursued across Asia.

      7 in 10 people in Singapore do not know what plastics to recycle: SEC report
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: About 70 per cent of people in Singapore do not fully understand what plastics to recycle, resulting in the majority of plastic products being disposed of as general waste, according to a report released by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) on Thursday (Aug 30).\nThe report, which includes a survey of more than 1,000 people in Singapore on their plastic usage habits and attitudes towards recycling, is the culmination of an eight-month study, SEC said in a media release.\xa0\nIt was commissioned jointly by Deloitte & Touche Enterprise Risk Services.\nExplaining the findings, SEC chairman Isabella Loh pointed out that some consumers are under the impression that some single-use plastics cannot be recycled.\n“Take the single-use plastics at the hawker centres ... When people buy takeaway food to eat at home, and they throw the container down the rubbish chute because it is contaminated. But some of these single-use plastics can actually be recycled,” she said, citing the poor markings on recyclables as a possible reason for the mistaken belief.\n“This is something we have to look at in terms of standardising markings,” she added.\nAccording to the report, 45 per cent of respondents said they needed more information on the different types of plastics, and what can and cannot be recycled.\xa0\nAs for why they do not recycle, 42 per cent of respondents cited inconvenience as a reason.\nSEC executive director Jen Teo noted that one way to help people improve their recycling habits is to have companies print recyclability information on their packaging products.\xa0\nThis, she said, will “facilitate upstream sorting and recycling”, making the collection of recyclable plastic items more efficient.\n“This initiative would go together with a new education campaign to teach the public what and how to recycle their plastic waste,” she said.\nPointing out that Singapore’s plastics recycling rate stood at just 6 per cent last year, SEC’s Ms Loh added that the findings were not surprising.\n“This was a call for action ... Are we throwing away the future of Singapore, and are we throwing away valuable fuel that could be diverted for another industry? That’s basically the question we are asking,” she said.\n""NEW CIRCULAR ECONOMY"" FOR PLASTICS NEEDED: SEC \nThe report also suggests that the creation of a “new circular economy” for plastics could improve Singapore’s plastic recycling rates, said SEC.\nMs Loh explained that currently, Singapore’s plastic ecosystem is “mostly linear”. This means that plastic goes from producers\xa0to consumers and then to the waste bin.\n“We need to connect producers, consumers and downstream users to form a circular economy for plastics so they are collected, recycled and reused to generate other products,” she said. “This will reduce the pressure on Singapore’s waste stream as well as conserve natural resources.\n“Singapore has the knowledge and the talent to develop innovative methods to reintroduce recycled plastic into the economy to aid growth and build a circular plastics economy,” she added.\nSeveral recommendations to help improve Singapore’s plastics ecosystem were made in the report.\nOne of them is to build a market for recycled plastic through innovation.\nSEC suggested that governments and public sector organisations could step in to support existing markets in Singapore that are using specific types of plastics for manufacturing recycled plastic pellets.\nIt explained that recycled plastic can be used to support major manufacturing segments in Singapore, particularly biomedical manufacturing, electronics and general manufacturing industries.\n“For example, several start-up companies around the world are devising machines to produce plastic filaments to be used for 3D printing machines,” said SEC. “Singapore’s plastic waste stream could be directed towards recycling for biomedicine companies for 3D printing.\n“Similarly, recycled plastics can be used for flat-panel displays and ink and toner cartridges for the electronics manufacturing sector, as well as the use of artificial intelligence for waste management.”\nThe report was launched at SEC’s conference on Thursday, which was also held in conjunction with the annual Singapore Environmental Achievement Awards.\xa0\nA total of 14 companies and organisations were honoured at the ceremony for their sustainable business practices.\nNEED FOR INDIVIDUALS TO DO THEIR PART, MORE PUBLIC EDUCATION\nSpeaking at the conference, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli stressed the importance of raising awareness among the public and encouraging people to love and take care of the environment.\n“Government and businesses can only do so much,” he said. “We cannot legislate desirable behaviour – we need to change societal norms and people’s mindsets, so that individuals are personally committed to living a “zero waste 3R lifestyle.”\nThe minister added that civil society plays a critical role in this area.\n“SEC’s effort to fight plastic waste, and its call for individuals to use one less plastic item a day, is commendable,” he said. “I hope the public will rise to the challenge.”\n“Collectively, we can make a difference in reducing the amount of plastic waste we generate every month.”\nBuilding a mindset of shared responsibility was also a topic highlighted during a panel discussion at the conference. Manufacturers, said one panellist, are but one part of the value chain, and cannot force members of the public to return items to them.\nThe panellists and audience members also agreed on the need for educating consumers in this area, with a straw poll indicating that most believed public education and running campaigns would help increase the recycling rate in Singapore.\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      Investment in water treatment plants needed to ensure ‘good flow of water’ for Singaporeans: DPM Teo
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0It is necessary to plan long-term and expand Singapore’s network of water treatment plants to ensure that the country always has “a good flow of water”, said Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on Tuesday (Aug 28).\nHe spoke during a visit to Changi Water Reclamation Plant, one of three such facilities which collects and treats water from the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS).\nThe DTSS, an underground sewage “superhighway”, conveys used water islandwide to water reclamation plants where it will be treated and purified into NEWater.\nPhase 1 of the project was completed in 2008 and phase 2 is expected to be finished in 2025.\n“When it is completed in 2025, it would have taken more than 25 years and S$10 billion,” Mr Teo noted. “This is a very important project for us because our water needs continue to grow so we need to plan very very long term.”\nMr Teo also said “steady investment” and new technologies are required in order to meet Singapore’s water needs.\nHe cited the example of the Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) technology, which was retrofitted in existing tanks to allow water to be treated more efficiently.\nAccording to Changi plant’s general manager Low Pei Chin, the new technology\xa0allows waste water to be treated in fewer steps compared to conventional methods, and also produces better quality water.\n“Bringing in this MBR will increase the flow of the plant as well as provide much cleaner, much better inputs to our NEWater plant, achieving savings in energy and efficiency as well,” said Mr Teo.\n“These are some of the things we do on a long-term basis to make sure that we are able to ensure that Singaporeans always have a good flow of water.”\nWATER DEAL WITH MALAYSIA\nThe issue of water security has been in the spotlight recently after Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that the price of raw water being sold to Singapore is “ridiculous”.\nIn an exclusive interview with Channel NewsAsia in June, Dr Mahathir added that Malaysia will study the matter and renegotiate the terms of the\xa0water supply deal with Singapore.\nWhen asked on Tuesday if Malaysia has officially approached Singapore regarding the water agreement, Mr Teo said no.\nHe added that Singapore is not in any talks with Malaysia regarding the water deal.\nUnder the current water agreement, signed in 1962, Singapore has the right to draw up to 250 million gallons (mgd) of raw water per day from the Johor River for 3 sen per 1,000 gallons of raw water.

      A 71-year-old and her grandchild on a green journey together, to find closeness again
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mildred Chong and her granddaughter Emma Yoon used to live together and were very close. But when Emma turned six, her family moved out. And once the girl went to school, everything changed, lamented Mdm Chong.\n“Sometimes I’d go to her house, and she’d either be on the laptop or in her room doing her work. We’d just say hello and ask, ‘Had your lunch?’ That’s all,” said the 71-year-old former army staff sergeant.\n“I feel lonely sometimes because I’m away from them. It’s quite sad. I’ve missed her.”\nNot only has there been less of a connection, but also little common ground.\nEmma, now 15, is an eager environmentalist who has sworn off meat and is ditching single-use plastics, while her grandmother’s first thought on the issue is that reducing waste is “ma fan” (troublesome) and recycling is a waste of time.\n“There’s a generation gap between me and Emma. She likes … saving the Earth and all that,” admitted Mdm Chong. “But our generation doesn’t do these types of things … I’d just dump (waste) in the plastic bag and down the chute.”\nHaving resisted any attempts to make her live a greener life, what would it take to bring them closer now?\nThat was the challenge faced by Emma and her when they had to work together on the programme On The Red Dot, in a series about four pairs of grandmothers and teenage grandchildren hoping to bridge their generation divide.\nIt meant confronting their different attitudes, trying to find a common goal and making discoveries about each other. (Watch the episode here.)\nA BIG CHALLENGE\nIn Emma’s case, one thing she was determined to change was her grandmother’s non-green lifestyle, which is why she got Mdm Chong to embark on a zero-waste challenge together.\nThis involved each of them having to limit their rubbish over seven days to fit into a 500-millilitre glass jar, with the teenager inspired by the zero-waste movement she has seen on YouTube.\nShe brings a reusable lunchbox and cutlery to school, and has a recycling area set up at home, where she encourages her family to do their part. So she already sees such actions as a duty.\nBut even broaching the topic with Mdm Chong, on the other hand, was not easy. “How can all the trash go into (the jar)? Seven days is a lot,” she said. “Why are we doing this?”\n“It’s to make us conscious of how much waste we’re producing,” replied her granddaughter, who cited the eight million kilogrammes of waste produced in Singapore each day.\nWhile that figure surprised Mdm Chong, her response to Emma’s next point – that, at this rate, Singapore’s one landfill will run out of space for incinerated waste by 2035 – did not go down well with the girl. Said the senior:\nIt’s still far away. I don’t know if I’ll still be alive … So that’s your problem, not my problem.\nIt was a “frustrating” conversation, admitted her granddaughter. “At my every answer, she’d have a reaction to that. Trying to convince her to do it was the toughest thing I’ve ever had to do.\n“It made me feel quite sad that she wasn’t really bothered.”\nNonetheless, her grandmother agreed to the challenge. Said Mdm Chong: “It’s a good chance for me to get closer to her. I hope I can understand what Emma wants.”\nRUNNING INTO A PROBLEM\nBut the complaints began as soon as day one, when she started to cook for Emma and herself.\n“Every day, I throw at least three bags of waste, sometimes more than that, depending on how much I cook. All this waste inside a small 500ml container? I don’t think I can do it,” she said.\nWhen her granddaughter advised her to let the food rot, she replied: “We don’t have any (plant) around here … Throwing it into the dustbin is easier.”\nPointing to her full jar, she added: “What am I going to do with this now?”\nSeeing there was that much waste from making one meal, Emma admitted: “This challenge is a bit harder than I thought it would be.”\nBut she found a solution: Singapore’s first insect farm, Insectta, where the larvae of black soldier flies are used to break down discarded food. And the next day, she took her grandmother to the farm in Margaret Drive.\nAt first, Mdm Chong found the maggots creepy. But then she was intrigued, wondering why the food waste they were feeding on was not smelly (they eat it before it decomposes), and how long it takes to become compost (two weeks).\nShe also asked Insectta co-founder Ng Jia Quan, 29, why he went into this business at his “very young” age (because, he said, food waste is a “very big issue” here).\nAnd it dawned on her that food waste used to be fed to pigs when Singapore had pig farms, while the young generation are letting insects do the job now.\nAnother thing she learnt was that the larvae can feed on okara – soya bean residue – which caught her interest because she helps out regularly at her son-in-law’s soya bean shop.\n“We’ve been throwing it away for at least 10 years,” she said. “If you want, you can (come) and collect it.”\nA GROWING REALISATION\nAnd so her gradual awakening began. When she met Emma the next day, she said: “Good thing we managed to recycle our food waste yesterday.”\nWhile her granddaughter recognised her receptiveness to the issue as a “good step forward”, there was another thing the girl wanted to do: Wean her off single-use plastics. And looking at Mdm Chong’s jar, she saw two straws.\n“That’s a lot of straws in such a short time,” she remarked. “Maybe you should consider using fewer straws … because they can’t be recycled.”\nWATCH: Can Emma convince Mdm Chong to go plastic-fee? (Dur 5:43)\nAs part of her action plan, she had decided to take her grandmother to Unpackt, Singapore’s first zero-waste grocery store, in Sembawang Hills Estate.\nThat meant bringing their own containers. And when Mdm Chong bought soya sauce, she was surprised that it cost only 45 cents, as the store’s food is sold by weight, without the packaging.\nEmma was quick to highlight this, saying: “See, so there are the plus points of not using packaging.”\nHer grandmother was reminded of the past once more. She said:\nA shop like this is quite interesting to me. It’s like going back to the olden times, when we bought things using our own containers.\nAgain she also asked the co-founder of the enterprise, 36-year-old Florence Tay, her reason for being in this line of work.\nThe reply – that packaging ends up as rubbish and “what we’re leaving for the next generation isn’t wealth and health but plastic pollution for them to handle” – left her looking thoughtful.\nTurning to her, Emma asked if she thought the waste issue was still not her problem, to which she said: “Now I understand. A bit.”\nWhat she realised also was that young people like her granddaughter were genuinely concerned about the state of the environment.\nNEGLECTED, AND APPRECIATED AGAIN\nFor Emma’s part, she made a discovery of her own after their visit. When she asked her grandmother how the zero-waste week had been so far, Mdm Chong said: “I’m happy because I got a chance to spend time with you.\n“That’s why I took up the challenge. We used to have time together … Nowadays, sometimes I don’t even see you.”\nThat “really touched” the teenager, who had “no idea” that her grandmother felt neglected. “She never did voice those feelings to me,” said Emma, who tried to reciprocate by expressing happiness about Mdm Chong’s receptiveness to the challenge.\n“You’re putting in effort to learn, and you’re asking very good questions,” she told her. “What counts is that you’ve tried.”\nThe week was not over, however, and on the fifth day, they went to the Love Life Carnival, which aimed to teach visitors how to live a sustainable life.\nEmma was hoping that her grandmother would see that “it’s not just young people who are protecting the environment, but people of all ages because it’s everyone’s responsibility”.\nThat message sank in when Mdm Chong learnt from the exhibits that Singapore’s recycling rate was way below that of other countries – and that plastic could take 100 to 1,000 years to decompose.\n“Now I think the environment needs protection because there is a lot of wastage, like food waste and disposable items,” she said.\nJust as clear was that both of them had grown closer. And what made Emma “really proud” of her grandmother was the latter’s initiative the next day to display stainless steel straws and reusable mugs for sale at their family’s soya bean shop.\nWhen the week was up, they both also managed to fit their non-recyclable rubbish into their jars. Mdm Chong, however, had one last surprise for her granddaughter.\nHaving noticed that the girl had been putting mainly tissue in her jar, she gave her a handkerchief to help her “cut down more” on her waste.\nSaid Emma: “I was definitely not expecting this much enthusiasm and participation from my grandmother … This is one of the best weeks we’ve spent together.\n“Now that I know she wants to spend time with me, I’ll definitely make more time for her because our time on this earth is limited. So we should make the best of what we have.”\nMildred\xa0and Emma are one of four pairs of grandmothers and grandchildren featured on On The Red Dot. Watch the episode here.

      The monstrous scale of plastic bag wastage in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: If each person in Singapore uses 1.6 plastic bags a day, the country would guzzle enough petroleum in a year to drive 8,555 cars round the world.\nThat is not a hypothetical situation.\nIt takes 37 million kg of crude oil and 12 million kg of natural gas to produce three billion plastic bags – the amount the Republic was already consuming in a year by 2011.\nAnd the 1.6 bags that comes to per person per day is twice as many as the average Malaysian uses and thrice the figure in Australia.\n“A lot of Singaporeans see plastic bag usage as a right, not a privilege,” said Ms Jessica Cheam, the founder of online publication Eco-Business. “The problem is that people take far more bags than they need.”\nThis issue of wastage came up in Parliament last month when the Government said that imposing a charge or ban on disposable plastic bags and substituting them with other types of disposable bags is unlikely to improve environmental outcomes.\nBut as Talking Point discovered, people are still shocked when they hear how many plastic bags are being disposed of: About 420 tonnes every day last year, or 2,640 bags every three seconds.\nNOT RECYCLED\nWorldwide, a plastic bag is used, on average, for 12 minutes before being discarded. And this is damaging the environment.\n“Many of them just go into the incinerators, and worse, they end up in oceans,” said Ms Cheam.\n“If we don’t do anything about it, then there are going to be more plastics than fish in the ocean by 2050.”\nWhile plastic bags have many uses, from carrying groceries to bagging up refuse, they add to the mountain of rubbish Singapore produces.\nLast year, 94 per cent of plastic waste was not recycled, and plastic bags are estimated to constitute around a fifth of this.\nBut even most of the bags sent for recycling are typically discarded. For example, shredding and recycling company Impetus Conceptus ends up recycling about 30 to 40 per cent of the bags it receives because the rest would be contaminated.\n“Food contamination, oil contamination, stuff like that,” said its business development director Thomas Wong.\n“Once it’s contaminated, we’re not able to do anything else because it deteriorates the quality of the pellets.”\nHe advises those who want to recycle plastic bags to fold them in old clothing, books or glass containers, which can all be put in the blue recycling bin at every public apartment block and, from August, every condominium block.\nMost of all, he urged: “Don’t ask for a plastic bag. Bring your own bag.”\nWATCH: Why the waste adds up (2:30)\nWASTE IN THE MAKING\nTo begin with, the production of plastic bags not only requires a huge amount of resources, but also entails wastage in the process.\nOver at Union Packaging Industries, which supplies 30 tonnes of bags monthly to retailers in Singapore, about 20 per cent of the plastic resins are wasted because of the adjustments needed in the different stages of manufacturing.\n“There’s a lot of manpower and hard work involved (at each stage),” said its director Lam Chun Seng.\nWith supermarkets holding off on imposing a plastic bag levy, and the government not planning to make them do so, the ball is in the consumer’s court.\nIn 2013, the Singapore Environment Council found that some 26 per cent of households have more than 20 bags lying around at home. And non-profit organisation Zero Waste SG wants to reduce this kind of “excessive” usage.\nWhile its call for a mandatory charge for plastic bag use has been rebuffed, Zero Waste SG manager Pek Hai Lin hopes that will change in future, even as she stressed that her group is not pushing for a ban.\n“The government is dealing with other environmental issues as well: It’s increasing the water price; it’s implementing the carbon tax,” she said.\n“So it’s looking at different aspects of responsibility to the environment. And I hope it’ll look at this sooner rather than later.”\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      From trash to treasure: Myanmar start-up spins rubbish into handicrafts in fight against waste
  </h1>, 'text': ""YANGON: Cut off from downtown Yangon by a river, Dala is a world apart from the rest of Myanmar’s commercial capital. It is poor, underdeveloped and run-down with bad roads, limited\xa0power supply and a water shortage.\nFor travellers, this former shipyard dating back to colonial times offers an unusual experience of the country's old capital – a more rural facade with time-weary wooden houses, corner shops layered with decades of dirt and dust, and distinct echoes of its agricultural foundation.\nBut for its 172,000 residents, many of whom are low-income earners, there is little nostalgic charm here. Instead, the shabby surroundings are a reminder of decades of neglect. The only thing the area shares with its bustling downtown neighbour is waste.\nYangon produces 2,800 tonnes of rubbish every day. Much of it ends up on the streets and in waterways – such as the river separating Dala from the rest of the capital - as waste management struggles to catch up with rapid urbanisation.\nIn the township of Dala, garbage is everywhere – piled up by the roadside, floating in murky water and strewn over the ground. The situation is critical enough to prompt the birth of Chu Chu Design, a green start-up that turns trash into eco-friendly craft products while also creating jobs.\n“Although so much waste is left to die at dump sites, we give it a new life at Chu Chu Design,” said manager Wendy Neampui.\xa0\nThe 66-year-old lives and works at the company, where she teaches 30 local women about recycling waste into handicrafts.\nThe two-storey building stands out in the dilapidated neighbourhood, with its colourful walls, small cafe\xa0and workshop full of merchandise. It is here where 20kg of rubbish are transformed into useful items every month.\nVisitors can find anything from yoga mat bags to laundry baskets, wine bottle jackets and wallets. They are all made from recycled materials and up for sale.\nA COMPANY NAMED AFTER PLASTIC BAGS\nThe company got its name from a Burmese word “Chu Chu”, which means plastic bag.\n“When you touch a plastic bag, the sound it makes is like ‘chu chu’. So that’s how we came up with the name,” Wendy explained.\xa0\nChu Chu Design was originally a three-year project of Cesvi, an Italian non-profit organisation that strives to protect the environment and eradicate poverty through sustainable development worldwide. After the project came to an end in 2016, the concept continues to operate and generate income for its artisans.\nTheir products are sold at established social-enterprises in downtown Yangon, where they fetch decent prices that reflect the hard work behind the production.\nVillagers who work for Chu Chu Design get paid 1,000 kyats (US$0.75) per hour for turning rubbish into goods. Every process is done manually, from selecting usable parts to cleaning and making artistic, eco-friendly products out of them.\xa0\n“Our products are made with recycled materials and that’s why we have to brainstorm to make them stand out from others. By using different colours to create a harmonious blend, we can make something that’s unique for our customers,” said one of its designers, Sen Sen.\nThe 22-year-old has always been interested in handicrafts, even before joining Chu Chu Design in 2013. However, she said her current job is much more rewarding than previous ones because she takes pride in her work.\n“I feel so fulfilled each time I create something. My work doesn’t only give me income but also lets me help keep the environment clean. That’s one thing I’m really proud of.”\nFROM TRASH TO TREASURE\nOne man’s trash is another man’s treasure. This is the mantra that sums up Chu Chu Design. Besides pride and stable income, the green start-up also provides its artisans with a new perspective on rubbish.\nSen Sen admitted she used to be careless when disposing of garbage. She never thought of its environmental impact until joining the company. Today, the designer not only recycles waste but also encourages other villagers to be environmentally conscious before throwing anything away.\n“Some people want to recycle rubbish themselves. So I teach them how to do it. More have realised waste can be turned into new things. Hopefully what we’re doing will inspire them to recycle more,” the designer said.\nFor those who have been paying attention, the little neighbourhood where she works has become a little cleaner each day. Instant coffee packets, old car tyres and plastic bags are harder to find on the streets. They have value and the villagers know it. Many sell them to Chu Chu Design, which no longer serves only as a workshop for recycling, but also a popular tourist attraction in Dala.\nStill, most visitors are foreigners. Wendy said Myanmar people have a different view of recycled materials and cannot understand why they should pay for something that is made from rubbish.\n“Only foreigners are interested in these recycled handicrafts. Locals, never. They look down on the products because they’re made from rubbish. They’ll buy goods that say ‘made in Thailand’ and ‘made in China’,” she said.\nThis is their mind-set. It’s very difficult to change. And this is a very big challenge for us.\nHowever, change is slowly taking place across the Yangon River. At a well-known retail outlet with a social mantra, a wide range of products from Chu Chu Design have found fans.\n“I can’t imagine to see trash and see this is the end product,” said Nancy Lutz from the US, holding a colourful rubbish bin made from recycled waste.\n“This would make me want to look at it again, think about it more carefully, and buy it probably. It adds a positive aspect. It’s so important for us, for our planet, to do this. And I’d accept paying a little bit more – shop for a cause.”\nAlthough most of the customers are expats and foreign tourists, the social enterprise has started to see some local visitors.\nIts project designer Randi Wagner said the store hopes to reframe people’s perception of waste by showing them rubbish on the streets can be turned into something useful, desirable and contemporary.\xa0\nGREEN CRAFTS FOR CLEAN\xa0MYANMAR\nBack across the river, Dala is bustling with people. Its jetty is packed with commuters flowing in and out of the ferry. Hovering around them are fruit sellers in colourful sarongs, balancing large trays of fresh watermelons and pomelos on their heads.\nThrough narrow lanes and littered streets, a few tourists have arrived at Chu Chu Design. Two teenage boys are collecting rubbish on the street; their wooden pushcart is filling up with colourful plastic bags.\nThet Tun, 13, and Khan Khant. 18, are two participants in Wendy’s new campaign. It employs students to clean the streets afterschool and earn 4,000 kyats (US$3) for a cartful of recyclable waste. Customers can take part in protecting the environment and supporting children’s education by paying US$3 for a bracelet made from recycled materials.\n“This way, they don’t need to ask their parents for money,” Wendy said. She is standing in front of the shop and looking at a clean street dotted with rubbish bins.\n“We need to spread the knowledge of recycling further to reach our goal of protecting the environment.”\nFor more on this and other projects around Southeast Asia, tune in to Tapestry: The Heart of ASEAN on Channel NewsAsia every Tuesday from Feb 27 to Mar 27 at 11pm.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     ASEAN ', '     Myanmar ', '     environment ']}"

      Commentary: Our hawkers deserve more
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Readers responded with an outpouring of appreciation and admiration for local hawkers to a recent story written by my Channel NewsAsia colleague,\xa0Lianne Chia. However, my conversations with observers and hawkers show that many consumers are not willing to put their money where their mouths are.\nLianne spent three days as a hawker assistant and had vividly conveyed the challenges involved.\nIt takes immense skill to make a bowl of bak chor mee or any number of our favourite hawker fare. The job obviously goes beyond cooking well. It requires preparing the ingredients, managing orders and money, among other things.\nIt is back-breaking work, yet hawker food is often undervalued in our society as Lianne’s story pointed out.\xa0\nFood blogger, Leslie Tay of ieatishootipost said, “People are unwilling to pay more just because you’re at a hawker centre.”\nSome hawkers have managed to earn handsome incomes for their food and even recipes, but observers say many continue to toil and their cuisine might be eventually lost to us altogether if no one learns from them.\nThis has been a long-standing problem.\nIn an “On the Record” interview two years ago, Tay said Singaporeans have been “spoilt by cheap food.”\n“Nowhere else in the world, in any developed first-world country, can you get a S$3 meal that’s substantive,” he said.\nTay believes we have a “culinary prejudice against our food.”\n“Why are people so happy paying S$15 for a bowl of ramen, and complain when the bowl of\xa0bak chor mee\xa0goes up by another S$0.50 to S$4.50?” he asked.\nHe pointed out how many of us expect a plate of expertly-fried hokkien mee or char kway teow to be cheaper than a plate of pasta at a hawker centre, even though pasta is a less complex dish.\n“Just put a little bit of pasta, a bit of sauce together and I can sell it for S$6 at the same hawker centre.”\xa0\nChef and restaurateur, Violet Oon, said in another edition of “On the Record”, “Customers are not a charity home that they (hawkers) have to support with their blood, sweat and tears. They have to make a profit too. Every year, you want a pay rise, I think the hawker also must have a pay rise, right?”\nHIGHER COSTS FOR ALL, INCLUDING HAWKERS\nHawker food is meant to be affordable food for the masses, but\xa0we have to accept that just as we deal with the higher costs of living, so do our hawkers.\nHawkers, just like other business people, have had to deal with higher business costs as well - rents, manpower costs and the costs of\xa0raw ingredients\xa0among other things.\xa0\nSo why are consumers, even those who can afford it, often unwilling to pay more for hawker fare?\xa0\nHAWKER FOOD IN SWANKY SURROUNDINGS\nWe are more understanding if a plate of char kway teow costs more in an air-conditioned food court. It makes sense to pay more because it’s served in a more comfortable environment and where we know rents are higher.\nBut many, even affluent Singaporeans, will complain about price increases by hawker stalls even if the cost of that bowl of bak chor mee is still lower than the one\xa0at the food court and the quality of the food is superior.\xa0\nHawkers such as 2016 Michelin Bib Gourmand award winner, Douglas Ng of The Fishball Story, have been vocal about this issue in the last few years.\xa0\nAbout four years ago, he set up a stall at Golden Mile Food Centre selling each bowl of his fishball noodles for S$3.\nHe said only 15 per cent of what he earned went to him. The rest went to paying for the cost\xa0of raw ingredients, rent and operating costs.\nHe claimed that when he raised the price of his noodles to S$3.50 a bowl, business dropped by 30 per cent.\nIt was only when he moved to Timbre+, a new-generation hawker centre at one-north, was he able to use premium ingredients and sell a bowl for S$6.\nOne could argue that the acceptance of higher prices is dependent on\xa0the clientele in the area and of course, the swanky surroundings. \xa0\nBut we should remember that even a hawker at a regular hawker centre has to grapple with higher costs especially if he makes an effort to use the best ingredients. Cooking superior food also requires skill that should be rewarded.\nMany hawkers say price increases based on those factors alone often result in a backlash.\nCATERING TO LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS\nOne must not\xa0blame low-income individuals and families for whom affordability is vital.\nThe National Environment Agency’s project to engage “socially conscious” operators has created many venues for such groups.\nThese operators have managed to improve operational efficiency and are able to offer food at lower prices.\nStallholders at these centres are required to sell at least two low-cost main courses. \xa0\nAmong the measures in place to enable this are lower rents, the bulk-buying of ingredients, and self-payment kiosks to reduce a reliance on manpower.\nPerhaps some of these measures could be introduced to all hawker centres to reduce costs.\nHowever, hawkers elsewhere take issue with the bulk-buying of ingredients to reduce costs, saying that it could compromise the quality of the dish.\nUltimately though, we have to acknowledge that there is a need for lower-priced hawker food in spite of the compromises. In fact, some have suggested introducing food vouchers for the poor so that hawkers can price premium food fairly and customers with the means to pay will just have to pay for quality while the poor are shielded.\nWhile low-cost venues for the lower-income continue to be created and high-priced hawker food is served at air-conditioned food courts in malls, high-quality hawker food in non-air conditioned coffee-shops and hawkers centres needs to be preserved too.\nAfter all, aside from the food itself, an intrinsic part of our hawker heritage is the good old market hawker centre ambience.\nIf we still enjoy these foods in such settings as part of our culinary heritage, would we\xa0be open to paying a little more for dishes with undeniable quality?\nRENTAL DISPARITIES\nSome have asked how it is that some first-generation hawkers are able to continue offering quality food at low prices.\nThese hawkers, who were resettled from the streets to hawker centres in the 1970s, enjoy high rental subsidies from the government. They pay an average of S$200 a month.\nNewer entrants pay an average of over S$1,000 at hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA). This is despite the government introducing measures such as putting a stop to sub-letting in order to moderate rents.\nIn July this year, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, Amy Khor said that a recent bid of S$10,000 for a hawker stall was an ""exceptional case”. It was reported that the bidder, in fact, terminated his contract before even commencing operations.\nThe average successful bid over the last three years has been S$1,370 a month according to Dr Khor.\nThe disparity is an issue nevertheless.\nFood blogger Leslie Tay said, “If you\'re talking about a pioneer hawker, he\'s already paid off his house, his kids are already grown up. They don\'t need much. And they\'re quite happy to sell something for S$2, S$2.50 also because their rental for the stall is so low. Right next to him, you have a young, aspiring hawker who has a family to feed and his rent is higher. That’s not fair.”\nTay suggested levelling the playing field by subsidising all hawkers equally. But if consumers who can afford it pay a fair price for hawker food, are the subsidies really necessary?\nThey might help to some extent.\nBut according to a survey released in 2015 by the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the National Environment Agency, rent makes up only 12 per cent of the total costs of running a stall. Raw materials are the biggest cost for most, coming up to about 59 per cent of expenses.\nPAYING OUR HAWKERS THEIR DUE\nSo what is the road ahead?\nIf profit margins are low, fewer people would want to enter the trade.\nAccording to the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources’ multi-disciplinary Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee, the median age of existing hawkers is 59. If more and younger people don’t want to go into the trade and learn to cook like our pioneer hawkers, our culinary heritage will be in danger.\nIn addition to introducing hawker centres run by social enterprises and price caps, the government can step in with equal rent subsidies as some experts have suggested.\nBut subsidies can’t be the answer to everything. Consumers should be open to doing their part to strike a balance between quality and price and pay quality hawkers their due.\nObservers note that more are now considering joining the trade. Douglas Ng of The Fishball Story is one such example.\nMany are also serving up innovative fusion cuisine at hawker stalls.\nThere’s certainly a place for such players, but there must be an effort to preserve heritage hawker food too.\nThe Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee’s recommendations which include a hawker course and incubation stalls will help.\nUltimately, people need to know they can make a decent living as a hawker anywhere if they serve high-quality food.\nSkilled hawkers who make the effort to procure quality ingredients, have honed their craft and continue to do so ought to be rewarded.\nThose of us who can afford it should not\xa0complain when they raise their prices due to rising costs especially when so many of us recognise the skill and the hard work that goes into making a good hawker dish\nCheap and good may not always be a realistic expectation. \xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      On The Job as a heartland waste collector: A rancid, repulsive and sobering experience
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: I don\'t\xa0know which was worse: The smell or the creepy crawlies. The stench of rotting food was like vomit mixed with dank, dirty laundry. I struggled not to retch. Then\xa0there were\xa0the bugs which scuttled everywhere as I bent down to pick up the trash.\nSuch working conditions are the norm for Zuwel, a Bangladeshi worker who clears trash from 29 blocks in Bukit Panjang every day.\nI stepped into his shoes for a couple of days last month, labouring in the sweltering heat and dashing from one rubbish chute to another in an electric cart to empty the bins.\nAccording to a 2012 World Bank report, each person in Singapore generates 1.49kg of municipal waste every day. This figure – on par with Malaysia, but higher than Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea – is expected to grow to 1.8kg by 2025.\nZuwel’s job is to help keep the constant, relentless flow of\xa0waste under control. The work day begins at seven in the morning for the\xa027-year-old. He breaks for lunch at noon,\xa0finishes up the remaining blocks by seven in the evening, and heads home\xa0for dinner, which is usually chicken curry bought\xa0from a nearby coffee shop.\nTHE MEN BEHIND THE JOB\nI walked into the Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council office at\xa0Bangkit Road on my first morning on the job,\xa0where Tay Chin Chye, RS Facilities Services\'\xa0contractor boss, was waiting.\nAh Chye is a short, snappy man. He is\xa0often on the phone. When he is not, he is cussing in Hokkien or barking instructions to his subordinates.\nUntil slightly more than a year ago, trash collection in Bukit Panjang was a two-man job, Ah Chye said. Two workers would place six empty bins on an electric cart before driving to each refuse chute, manually swapping them for the full ones.\nThis was a heavy task, literally. When full, a 250-litre trash bin can weigh around 50kg. Hauling it onto the raised platform of the\xa0cart required some physical effort.\nNow with the help of technology, it\xa0requires just\xa0one worker and an electric cart\xa0that goes by the name of OMO -\xa0or one-man operator, to give the vehicle its full name. The cart has a series of levers that operate a\xa0mechanical arm which\xa0lifts a bin to tip\xa0out its contents.\xa0\nThe contractor rents five of these carts from a company called Waste Management at S$1,200 a month each.\n“We designed this to cater to Singaporeans,” the company\'s\xa0general manager Loo Teck Lim told me. It made the job less back-breaking\xa0but Singaporeans still shunned the job, complaining about the stench, he said.\nAs a result, the waste management industry has to rely on foreign workers to keep Singapore clean.\nTo put that into context, last year only around 20,000 Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, or less than one per cent of Singapore’s employed residents, worked in industries classified as “others”, according to the Department of Statistics.\nThis category includes agriculture, fishing, quarrying, utilities, and sewage and waste management.\nThe Ministry of Manpower does not break down data\xa0according to industry or nationality when it comes to the foreign workforce. As of June this year, there were about 436,000 semi-skilled foreign workers in Singapore, excluding those working in construction and as foreign domestic workers. Some of them are on the front line of dealing with Singapore\'s waste.\nAh Chye said his waste collectors are all from Bangladesh. I’ll be a Singaporean pioneer, I thought to myself.\nWe walked across Bangkit Road to Block 252, where I was greeted by supervisor Ronny, sporting a Bluetooth headset and a town council polo tee.\nThe portly Bangladeshi has been a supervisor for two years and directs his workers in fluent Bengali. But he spoke to me in perfect Singlish, complete with the accent and the lahs.\nRonny handed me a plastic bag. In it was a blue and orange uniform, work gloves, masks and a yellow hard hat.\n""Why the need for a helmet?"" I asked.\xa0\nGlass bottles and other hard objects might come flying down the chute when workers are cleaning it, Ronny said.\xa0\n“So it’s good if people tie up their trash properly?” I asked, half-thinking of the advice my mum always gives me. Ronny shot me an incredulous look. “Where got people think of that? They just throw.”\nLEVERS, ROACHES AND THE STENCH\nI put on the uniform and equipment in the bin centre. That is where all trash collected goes to before it is picked up by public waste collectors. The\xa0centre was cavernous but spartan. There was an old black sofa, a couple of toilets and a room for my belongings. Cockroach wings were scattered across the floor. When fresh trash is brought in, the place stinks.\nDespite the smell, Zuwel did not put on a mask. I\xa0followed suit, trying to overcome my disgust. He was armed with impossibly simple tools: A\xa0broom, a shovel and a small dustpan made out of a plastic cup attached to a wooden pole.\nZuwel skilfully manoeuvred\xa0the cart through void deck pillars and shelter stands to get to the refuse chutes. From afar, a toddler saw us and waddled quickly into his mother’s arms.\nAs I opened my very first refuse chute, three cockroaches scurried out. The stench assaulted my nostrils. Thick, green grime coated the floor.\nI dragged the bin out and stuck my hand in the chute to sweep out trash which landed on the floor. The bin had cracked through wear and tear. Filth oozed out from the cracks. Zuwel used the shovel to scrape grime off the floor. I rinsed it clean using water from the cart.\nHe looked on as I did things too slowly, moving gingerly with a grimace etched across my face. Zuwel had many blocks to cover and had little time to indulge my reluctance to get stuck in.\nFortunately, I did not have to manually lift the heavy bin to empty it into the cart. I pushed some levers on the cart and with the hissing of hydraulics, the mechanical arm unfolds, lifts the bin and tips it over.\nThe trash hit the cart with crashes and bangs. Some missed the target and\xa0I got foul liquid splashed on me.\nI lowered the bin and swept the floor. The waiting mynahs watched on in disappointment. But when another family of roaches darted out, they swooped in, cawing in delight.\nAt another refuse chute,\xa0a few bags of trash crashed on the floor with a loud thud, just after I pulled the bin out. Zuwel pulled me aside and waited a minute to make sure no more trash was making its way down the chute.\nFew residents secured their trash in plastic bags.\xa0So, I\xa0was privy to the discarded items, which included leftover rice, empty containers, used sanitary pads, handbags, a Smurf figurine, and an old birthday photo. Centipedes and millipedes, their gazillion legs in full glory, wriggled among the waste.\nTHE SPIRALLING TRASH PROBLEM\nThe rubbish is cleared daily, yet the bins are almost always filled to the brim.\nIn 2016, Singapore generated 7.81 million tonnes of waste – enough to fill 3,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This figure is a 140,000-tonne increase from 2015, and hovers close to the record 7.85 million tonnes thrown out in 2013.\nPlastics (762,700 tonnes) and food (679,900 tonnes) made up the largest chunks of the three million tonnes of waste that is disposed, and most of this\xa0goes to the incinerators.\nAccording to the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, 200,000 tonnes of solid waste and incineration ash are sent to the Semakau landfill each year. At this rate, the landfill is expected to run out of space by 2035.\nWhile the National Environment Agency (NEA) said the rise in generated waste is “in tandem with Singapore\'s economic growth and increase in population”, the Government is trying hard to turn the country into a zero-waste nation.\nOne way is encouraging recycling through dual chutes for refuse and recyclables, with the target for Singapore’s household recycling rate set at 30 per cent by 2030. However, the rate has remained stagnant at around 20 per cent for the past few years.\n""From surveys, apart from citing lack of time and not knowing what and how to recycle,\xa0many residents said that they would recycle if it is convenient to do so,"" NEA said.\nThere are some improvements, though. The household recycling rate increased from 19 per cent in 2015 to 21 per cent in 2016. This is due to a two per cent drop in domestic waste generated and an eight per cent increase in domestic waste recycled, NEA said.\n“Zero-waste nation is a big word,” interim director of the Residues and Resource Reclamation Centre Grzegorz Lisak told me, pointing to Singaporeans’ desire for high quality and fresh products.\nWaste reducing attitudes should be instilled from a young age, he added. This should come in kindergartens and primary schools, and through the use of social media. A pay-as-you-throw scheme and vending machines that ""buy"" recyclables would help too.\nAnd to achieve recycling targets, NEA said, it is crucial to involve the industrial and commercial sector. This involves getting large hotels and shopping malls to report waste data and waste reduction plans, and recognising companies that made ""notable efforts and achievements in reducing packaging waste"".\n“Step by step, we are moving in this direction,” Dr Lisak said. “With the implementation of circular economy and national policy, Singapore will be a smart nation that efficiently and effectively controls its waste.”\nOne smart technology is the pneumatic waste conveyance system, which transports rubbish from a refuse chamber to a centralised bin through underground pipes using air. This cuts manpower needs and minimises odour and pests.\nThe Housing and Development Board (HDB) piloted the system in Yuhua, with more than 100 condominiums – like Palette at Pasir Ris and Sky Habitat at Bishan – following suit.\nHDB will also install the system in upcoming estates like Tampines North and Bidadari, and existing ones like Teck Ghee and Ang Mo Kio, where 40 blocks – comprising 5,800 households – will be retrofitted.\nMore recently, NEA announced on Dec 11 plans for the cleaning and waste management industry\xa0to use technology to ease manpower shortage. Under a new skills framework, workers can also undergo training for these higher-skilled jobs.\nThe technology includes\xa0autonomous vehicles that clean the streets, robots that scrub floors and sensors that tell if a rubbish bin is full. NEA hopes the automation will benefit\xa030,000 workers by 2025.\nZUWEL AND FAREWELL\nBut back in Bukit Panjang, Zuwel and I still had\xa0to use our hands.\nWe repeated the routine on the second day. After each block – which usually has six chutes – was cleared, we unloaded our cargo into a compacter in the bin centre.\nThe compacter was\xa0a monster with a mouth that opens and closes, gobbling up trash with an automated lifter and compressing it for the garbage truck that pulls by every morning.\nAnd it was during these back-and-forth trips to the bin centre that I got to know my mentor better.\nZuwel spoke softly in halting English. Before coming here, he told me, he worked in construction in Brunei. So he knows a bit of Malay as well.\nWhich is better, Brunei or Singapore? They’re the same, he replied, because the Brunei ringgit and Singapore dollar are equal. That’s when I understood his priorities.\nZuwel told me he got married barely half a year ago. The wedding was in Bangladesh, in his hometown of Tangail. He earns S$700 a month, he said. It’s too expensive to get married here.\xa0Not everyone is able to get a decent-paying, comfortable job, but it is an honest living.\nBy the third block, I was exhausted from the bending over, the heavy pulling and the smells. I was also struck by the monotony.\nZuwel had no such complaints. He let cockroaches run up his shoes. He used his hands to gather the trash when it could not fit into the dust pan. He laughed and took over when I hesitated to pull out a bin.\nI tried my hand at driving the cart. It wasn’t easy. The steering was stiff and the pedals\xa0were sensitive.\nMore than halfway through our shift, the skies grew dark. “If it rains, it’s a problem,” Zuwel told me. Thankfully, it only drizzled. I could only imagine what he goes through when it pours – being battered by the rain while picking up soggy trash.\nI\xa0had experienced enough by lunchtime. I found the work tiring, repetitive\xa0and revolting. At the same time,\xa0I\xa0felt a deep sense of gratitude for men like Zuwel. It is easy to forget about these near-invisible workers who do what many Singaporeans shun.\nBack at the bin centre, I laid my equipment on the sofa, washed my smelly, sweaty hands and tried to hug Zuwel. He didn’t reciprocate, so I backed off.\n“Boss, I go eat first,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     environment ']}"

      A plastic solution for the Philippines' trash dilemma
  </h1>, 'text': ""MANILA: Ziggie Gonzales’ disdain for plastic was born in the sea.\nThe keen surfer grew tired of sharing his waves with rubbish, the polluted products of the Philippines’ plastic addiction.\n“When I’m in the water, I collect whatever trash is floating about,” he said. “I think at one point I collected so much trash I was fed up and I was thinking ‘What can I do?'”\nGonzales, the co-owner of a chain of surf hostels around the Philippines, saw an opportunity to mobilise people in Metro Manila to not only prevent extensive environmental damage, but also make the plastic they consume every day useful.\n\n\nHe is leading a drive in the country to create eco-bricks, essentially an ordinary plastic bottle stuffed with non-biodegradable trash. Anyone can make one at home and use the bottle as a proxy recycling system of all kinds of waste that could otherwise end up on the streets or in the waterways, from crisp packets to plastic take-out cutlery.\nThe bottle might take a few months to totally fill and once completed can become a surprisingly strong and useful construction material.\nAlready, a shower area and perimeter wall at The Circle Hostel in Zambales has been built using the eco-bricks. In the future, Gonzales wants to build shower blocks in the city that could be used by commuting cyclists.\nLatching onto Filipinos' propensity for social media trends, he figures that a viral campaign that requires just a little investment in time but makes a potentially big impact is the way to go.\nIndeed, the Philippine is in real need of action when it comes to plastic waste.\nA 2015 report by Ocean Conservancy and McKinsey Center for Business and Environment found the country was ranked as the world’s third biggest source of plastic leaking into the ocean.\n“In the Philippines, people don’t think about where the trash goes,” Gonzales said. “It’s really a cultural thing that’s become very evident – it’s a very tribal attitude, people don’t realise the bigger picture and it’s very difficult to get that message across.”\nEconomic growth and falling levels of poverty are seen as key causes of the increased use of plastic. Fast consumption is overwhelming the ability of authorities to manage waste and heaving open dumpsites adjacent to waterways spill over into the environment.\nWhy does it happen? “Some people are really thick-headed,” said Maricris Ramos, a resident of Navotas, a poor and crowded city within Metro Manila. “Filipinos are really lazy. They will just throw their trash anywhere. That’s a big headache for us.”\nGonzales knows he cannot solve the monumental problem, but he has a specific initial goal. “I want to get to a tonne of plastic – removed from the system. Real impact,” he said. “You know how light plastic is. Imagine how much plastic that is.”\nHe is already addicted to filling his own bottles and believes behaviours can change quickly.\n“If you start the habit, you’ll find it very hard to stop because you’re going to realise your own impact on the environment.” \n"", 'related_topics': ['     environment ', '     Manila ', '     social media ', '     Indonesia ', '     Philippines ', '     Thailand ']}"

      Cambodia’s large-scale illegal logging is ‘done’
  </h1>, 'text': 'In the final part of a special series on Cambodia\'s endangered forests, Environment Minister Say Samal tells Channel NewsAsia that large-scale illegal logging in Cambodia has been stopped. This is despite a report that said the timber flow continues between Cambodia and Vietnam even though a ban has been put in place. \nPHNOM PENH: The Government of Cambodia is serious about tackling deforestation and “no more wood” has travelled to Vietnam since Prime Minister Hun Sen introduced a timber export ban earlier this year, Environment Minister Say Samal said in an interview with Channel NewsAsia.\n“The ban is effective. No more wood is flowing out. Large-scale illegal logging has been stopped. It’s done,” he said.\nIn January, the Cambodian prime minister imposed a ban on all timber exports to Vietnam and ordered the closure of border crossings to prevent timber smuggling. The move is part of the government’s nationwide crackdown on illegal deforestation.\n“Processed wood, for example, which you turn into furniture or finished products, you can take it out. But for semi-finished products, you aren’t allowed to take them out anymore,” Samal explained.\nHis comment came after US environmental group Forest Trends reported the timber flow still continues despite the ban. The group said 15,000 cubic metres worth about US$12 million still made it through border crossings in February and March, citing the General Department of Vietnam Customs’ statistics.\n“Timber still finds its way across the border into Vietnam months after the ban was announced. These are mostly small-scale operators avoiding official channels altogether,” said Kerstin Canby, Forest Policy, Trade and Finance Program Director at Forest Trends.\nBut the environment minister brushed off the report, claiming it was driven by politics.\n“I doubt that it’s true. Some of these reports are politically motivated. It’s groundless. They never come and talk to us or ask us to verify. The majority of these reports are just false,” he said.\nThe nationwide crackdown on illegal timber trade has been “quite successful”, according to the Cambodian minister, although illegal logging still continues among small-scale operators.\n“This is very hard for us to crack down. We admit that this still occurs. But on a large-scale that we used to see, we’ve been able to put a stop to that.”\n‘WE HAD PROBLEMS’\nIn 1990, Cambodia’s forest covered 12.94 million hectares, or about 73 per cent of its total land, according to the World Bank. In a steady downward trend, it shrank to 9.46 million hectares, or 53.6 per cent in 2015.\nDeforestation in the country is influenced by several factors. But among the main ones is economic land concessions (ELC), a long-term lease that allows investors to use private state land for large-scale agriculture. The government introduced the scheme to boost the economy and create jobs for local people, resulting in more than 270 ELCs covering at least 1.2 million hectares nationwide.\nConcessionaires are allowed to clear forest land for industrial agriculture. They can harvest trees in the premises, process the wood and export it legally. However, many have simply left after depleting the trees. Others allegedly continue using the land to launder timber from outside the permitted area.\n“We had problems,” Samal admitted while maintaining the government’s commitment to preserve the country’s biodiversity. “We’re going step by step in protecting our forests.”\nAnd that, he claims, includes conducting land registration, reducing the maximum lease duration from 90 years to 50 years, cracking down on illegal logging, banning timber exports and reviewing all the ELCs to ensure everyone follows the rules.\n“For those that didn’t abide by the rules and regulations, we cancelled the investments altogether. We’ve been very strict but fair,” Samal said.\n“No more ELCs are to be given out. The timber export ban is going to be effective forever from now on. We don’t allow any timber to flow out of the country.”\nThousands of tonnes of wood confiscated during the nationwide crackdown will be sold in public auctions, he added, with the income generated to be used to improve Cambodia’s education sector.\nCOMMUNITY FORESTRY\nBesides ELCs, the environment minister argued ordinary citizens themselves have also contributed to deforestation due to the rich rewards on offer.\n“With one hectare of rice, they probably won’t earn US$1,000 per year. But if they go into the forest and cut down a few trees, they might earn that much in a very short time. So that’s the economic incentive that makes things very difficult,” Samal explained, adding a severe lack of forest rangers also means many illegal activities continue unchecked.\n""I\'m not denying that there are problems. We\'re on it,"" he said.\nIn its battle against deforestation, the environment ministry is planning to turn more land into national parks and wildlife sanctuaries and combine the existing protected forests into one biological unit.\nIt is also gearing up for co-management of protected forests, which covers about 6 million hectares nationwide. More civil societies and local communities will be invited to safeguard their local forest through the Community Forestry (CF) programme.\nThere are more than 400 CF communities in Cambodia, formed voluntarily by local residents. Members can use forest resources in a sustainable manner while participating in decentralised management as well as protection of forest resources. But according to Samal, the ministry is also pushing for some of them to become tourist attractions.\n“We’ve seen people who used to hunt become tour guides, taking tourists out for bush walking around national parks. That’s the result we want to see and spread to other parts of Cambodia,” he said.\n“It is a strategy to move them away, step by step, from the forest in a sustainable manner.”\nThis is the final part of a series of special reports on Cambodia\'s forests.\nPart 1 looked at claims that timber is still finding its way into Vietnam despite a ban earlier this year. Part 2 investigated how communities have seen forests disappear under a reforestation programme. Part 3 profiled the armed rangers tasked with protecting Cambodia\'s forests.\nFollow Pichayada Promchertchoo on Twitter @PichayadaCNA\n', 'related_topics': ['     dining ', '     environment ', '     Cambodia ', '     Vietnam ']}"
