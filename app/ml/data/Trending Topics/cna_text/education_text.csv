      Pace of acquiring skills and knowledge must intensify, continual learning will help people remain relevant: Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The pace of acquiring skills and knowledge must intensify, with individuals changing jobs every four to five years,\xa0said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Thursday (Feb 10).\xa0\nStressing the importance of continual learning, Mr Chan said: ""If the half-life of skills and knowledge has shrunk, then it must follow that the pace of acquiring skills and new knowledge must intensify.\n“It used to be said that we may use almost 20 years to prepare for our first job and maybe the only job for life. That’s our parents’ generation.\xa0But what if we need to do 10 different jobs for life, changing every five years on average? That’s our generation.”\xa0\nIf Singapore needs to “top up” the knowledge and skills of individuals as they take on new jobs every four to five years, this means half a million adult workers need to go through upgrading every year, he added.\nSpeaking at The Straits Times Education Forum on Thursday, Mr Chan said that the definition of success for Singapore’s education system cannot be defined by just how well it produces a cohort of 30,000 to 40,000 students each year for the job market, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“It should be how well we do that plus retraining and upgrading about half a million adult learners each year,” he added.\nInstead of focusing on the challenges of falling cohort sizes, Singapore should “actively seize the opportunity” arising from an increasing number of workers who need retraining and upskilling.\xa0\nPreparing a course, training the faculty and seeing the students graduate typically takes a few years, said Mr Chan. This could also mean that the material may be obsolete by the time students graduate from the course.\xa0\n“We need to jettison the concept that we can ever be done with learning,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“No amount of education frontloading can prepare us for life. Only continual learning can help us remain current and relevant for the rest of our lives.”\xa0\nThere is also no pre-defined pathway to success, he said.\xa0\nIt matters less how many students go to universities, polytechnics or Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs), and matters more how many students can get the appropriate degrees, diplomas and\xa0modules or micro-credentials throughout their lives, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThe skills to “learn, learn fast, unlearn and relearn” are now more important than getting a particular grade at a particular\xa0point in life, he added.\xa0\n“To this end, flexible modules across multi-disciplines that allow our students to pivot and flex across the evolving sectors have become even more important.”\xa0\nResponding to a question about how the higher education landscape will change over the next few years, Mr Chan said during a question and answer session that universities should instead see themselves as institutes of continuous learning.\xa0\n“At the individual level, the most straightforward change that we have to bear in mind is this - we are not going to be able to learn everything and then transit to what we call working life,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“There is no end, and there should not be a clear sharp division between the learning phase of our life and the working phase of life.”\xa0\nAdding that this is a “significant mindset change”, the Education Minister noted this means that people must take responsibility for growing their own skills and expanding their knowledge, even if their employees do not actively pursue training for them.\xa0\n“This is especially important in a gig economy where many individuals are taking responsibility for their own employment terms. And this is a mindset shift that we must have ... especially in the gig economy but also for conventional traditional employees in the industry.”\xa0\nInstead of “going back to school”, the school should have\xa0micro modules available for individuals to learn and to keep themselves updated, he added.\xa0\nAt the institution level, the way universities, polytechnics and ITE is structured must also change, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“We are not just talking about preparing the 18 to 22-year-olds who will come to class religiously, sit down, listen to us. We are talking about working with adult learners that have varying time schedules, different commitments, different responsibilities,” he added.\xa0\n“How do we have a blended learning model whereby we can push our knowledge model to them in a just in time fashion?”\xa0\nClass time can then be spent collaborating and creating solutions to solve new challenges for the industry, said the Education Minister.\xa0\nMr Chan also encouraged companies across industries to work with the institutes to help prepare students, instead of “waiting for the students to come”.\xa0\n“They ... get the ideas from the young people, and this co-creation process shortens the industry and academia cycle,” he said, adding that this will define Singapore’s competitive advantage.\xa0\nThe connection between academia and industry also needs to be tightened, and this applies to both students and faculty, said Mr Chan in his speech.\nAs students go through universities, polytechnics and\xa0ITEs, they must have access to “quality internships”, he added.\xa0\nFor example, at the National University of Singapore (NUS), a recent initiative allows students to intern with the industry without being constrained by time and subject of study.\xa0\n“Students in future should even be able to complete such programmes at their own time, if they have the desire and opportunity to intersperse their internship and studies,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThe Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) has also pioneered the applied learning model, he added. This “brings the university into the workplace” and allows students to learn by working with real-life tools to solve real-life industry problems.\xa0\n“Faculty is critical for this relationship between industry and universities. Universities must create more opportunities for faculty to keep pace with the latest industry innovations, and create free-flowing exchanges of ideas and personnel between industry and universities,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\nSingapore’s autonomous universities already have a range of educators and researchers, from full-time faculty to those involved in the industry and academia, to adjunct lecturers, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“We must step up efforts to grow this diversity, including tapping more industry experts to serve as adjuncts and practice-track faculty,” he added.\xa0\nAs the universities “rebalance” their pre-employment training (PET)\xa0and focus on continuing education and training (CET), they will review their staffing composition accordingly, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“This is necessary to better cater to the more diverse learner profiles and needs, including tailoring pedagogy and especially andragogy, for our adult learners each year.\n“PET methods cannot be applied to CET learners without appreciating the different opportunities and challenges of adult learners,” he added.\xa0\nUniversities are “strongly” encouraged to ""connect and reconnect"" with the world through exchange and internship programmes, even\xa0amid\xa0the COVID-19 pandemic, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“Send our students abroad to learn. Welcome foreign students to add diversity to our campuses and help our students enhance their understanding of the world,” he said.\xa0\n“Build a uniquely Singapore brand of being a trusted and principled partner that others can rely on and want to work with.”\xa0\nSingapore can distinguish itself as a platform for people to connect, collaborate and create, as the world “threatens to fragment along geopolitical, ideological, cultural and technological lines”, he added.\xa0\n“This is why we need to renew our push to have our young people grow up understanding and interacting with the world,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“Therefore, I strongly encourage our universities to connect and reconnect with the world through their exchange and internship programmes, even as COVID-19 wears on.”\nMr Chan also stressed the importance of confidence, adding that it is as important as literacy and numeracy in foundational years.\xa0\nOn the international stage, Singaporeans are often admired for our values and competencies, he added.\xa0\n“However, many have also commented that we can better help our students express themselves so that their talents are better appreciated, and help our students to better understand and appreciate the diversity of the world,” he said.\xa0\n“We will continue to increase opportunities for our people to be exposed to such skills and perspectives, beyond formal education or the university system.”\xa0\nIn a world of contesting ideas and values, Singapore must have the confidence to “chart our own destiny” based on a “pragmatic and disciplined search” for what works best for the people in context, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“While we learn from the world, we must never relegate ourselves to just copying other people’s ideas without context. We learn from others’ successes. We also learn from others’ failures,” he added.\xa0\n“But ultimately, we must have the confidence to develop our own solutions to our own unique challenges - be it in the economic or social spheres. On the other hand, we must remain humble and recognise that we cannot stop learning and improving, as individuals and as a country.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      Remember what brought you together: Marriage tips from couple behind Lil' but Mighty tuition centres
  </h1>, 'text': 'Lenard and Lily Chew, both 36, were classmates in junior college. They were friends and even did project work together (although that didn’t go so well). Now married, the duo is working on what appears to be the biggest group project of their lives – their shared business, a tuition company called Lil’ but Mighty with five centres islandwide – and that too, with three sons aged four, six and eight in tow.\nIn the second of CNA Women’s Valentine’s Day series about couples in business, we find out why they chose to not only be partners at home, but at work too, and what it takes to do well at both.\nFIRST THINGS FIRST – TELL US A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU GOT TOGETHER.\nLily: Lenard and I first met in junior college. We had always been good friends, and after graduation, we kept in touch. It was only later when we were both working (Lily taught at Rulang Primary School, while Lenard was an associate at auditing firm KPMG) and met up again that we decided to get to know each other a little more. At 27, we got married and around three years later, we opened our first tuition centre.\nWHY START A BUSINESS TOGETHER AND SPECIFICALLY, A SCHOOL? \xa0\nLily: Lil’ but Mighty is a boutique English education centre. I have always loved teaching and thinking of creative ways to help students understand what they are learning better.\xa0\nWhen we were dating, Lenard casually asked me if we wanted to do business together in the future. At that time, he wanted to build a business so that we could have a legacy to leave behind to our future children.\xa0\nAfter the arrival of our first child, we felt that it was time for us to take the leap of faith and pursue our passion while still having an arrangement that allows us to be present for our children.\nWHAT HAS CAUSED TENSION FOR YOU IN THE PAST AND HOW DID YOU OVERCOME IT?\xa0\xa0\xa0\nLily: We have very different working styles. Lenard is someone who plans ahead and is very structured with his timelines. I am more free-spirited and am quite flexible with my time. I have the tendency to take it slow when it comes to deadlines and fight until the last minute.\xa0\nDO YOU THINK THERE ARE SPECIFIC FIELDS OF BUSINESS THAT ARE MORE CONDUCIVE FOR PARTNERS WHO ARE COUPLES?\nLily: I feel it is possible for a couple to become partners in all fields of business. The bigger question should be what field they are both passionate about and can see a goal with.\xa0\nLenard’s background is in accounting, whereas mine has always been in education. It is important that both parties are able to find fulfilment in what they do.\nThat being said, I’ve always been grateful that Lenard was willing to take the leap of faith with me and venture into education to support my passion.\nTELL US MORE ABOUT THE GUIDELINES YOU’VE LAID DOWN TO ENSURE SUCCESS IN BOTH YOUR BUSINESS AND MARRIAGE.\nLily: I think every couple has its own dynamics – what makes them click. It’s important to remember what it is that brought you together, and to make the time and effort to grow the relationship.\xa0\nOne of the things we do is to make sure we show appreciation for each other at work and at home. Another thing is to always try something new together, whether it’s a new gym or skincare routine. \xa0\nOver the years, we have learned to agree on the times when we will not talk about work, for example, when we’re putting the kids to bed or during family dinners. If one of us starts talking about work at these times, the other person may remind them that we can continue the conversation later.\xa0\nWHAT ARE SOME QUALITIES YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR COUPLES WHO WORK TOGETHER?\nLily: I would say that a couple needs to have the mutual willingness to compromise, and to not be prideful. We are committed to each other and to our business, which means we want to do what is best for it.\xa0\nWe also recognise that our relationship is the most important and that guides us in a lot of our decisions. There will be times when we disagree and are upset with each other, but we will talk it out and own the final decision together.\xa0\nWHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT EACH OTHER ON THIS JOURNEY?\xa0\nLily: The Lenard I am running the race with today is very different from that version of Lenard I met in junior college, when we were both in the same group for our Project Work module.\nI still remember how we would meet to discuss the project at the old National Library and he would suddenly stand up before the meeting was over and say, “Okay, my mum’s here! Bye guys!” and he would just leave.\xa0\nHe is very structured and forward-looking now, and constantly shows how he leads with gentleness. He cares deeply for his team.\xa0\nLenard: I’ve learned that Lily is capable of sleeping no matter how stressful things are at work or at home. Once her head touches the pillow, she is fast asleep. I think she just has this ability to trust that things will work out.\nI also love that she’s consistent in character. Even in junior college, she wasn’t the sort to judge – she always accepted me for who I was. It’s something I’m very thankful for and that I will never take for granted. That’s what keeps this marriage going, I think.\xa0\nWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON GENDER ROLES AT HOME AND AT THE WORKPLACE?\xa0\xa0\nLily: At the workplace, no one should be judged by their gender when it comes to performance but by their ability. A male teacher and a female teacher should both be well-versed in classroom strategies to deliver an effective lesson. I believe that in any line of work, there will always be a place for someone who is passionate and has a spirit of excellence.\nAt home, I let my husband take the lead while I play more of a support role. However, playing a supportive role does not mean that I am submissive and do not have a voice. The “supporter” has the great task of providing counsel to her husband, and she is very much empowered to speak and lead with confidence. I think a couple should respect and love each other to build each other up.\nIt is important that our boys grow up with respect for others, including women, from a young age, and to see that a man can do what a woman does and vice versa. However, there may be a difference in the approach, and there is a need to respect the differences.\nCNA Women is a new section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

      7 in 10 primary school students expected to receive second dose of COVID-19 vaccine by end-February
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: By the end of the month, at least seven in 10 primary school students are expected to get their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Friday (Feb 4).\nThis is based on bookings already made, said MOE, adding that a similar number have already received the first jab, with around\xa075 per cent of primary school students having\xa0signed up for vaccination.\nAs of Feb 3, more than 192,000 children aged five to 11 have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. More\xa0than 56,000 children have received their second dose.\xa0\n“In total, we have delivered close to 250,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines, with a record number of almost 60,000 doses delivered in the most recent week of 24 to 30 January 2022,” said the Education Ministry.\nAmong those born between 2016 and 2017 - children who are or will turn five or six this year\xa0- nearly\xa013,000\xa0have already received at least their first dose, with almost\xa018,500 registrations received so far, said MOE.

      Indonesian government urged to mandate hybrid learning for all amid Omicron; anxious parents keep kids at home
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: The Indonesian government has placed more schools under hybrid learning to reduce the number of students in class, but experts and interest groups worried about the Omicron wave said the rules should be tightened further.\xa0\nThe Indonesian Educators and Teachers Association (P2G) said all schools across the country should introduce hybrid learning.\xa0\n“It is not stringent enough because (a school) can still have 100 per cent in-person classes.\xa0\n“(The government) should have been firmer by having all schools apply hybrid learning at least until we see a drop in the number of COVID-19 cases,” P2G national coordinator Satriwan Salim said in a statement.\nThe Indonesian government earlier required all students in areas with low and moderate COVID-19 infection risks to attend in-person classes, saying that such classes would help students catch up on their studies which were hindered during the pandemic.\nThe risk assessments corresponded to the level of Community Activity Restriction known as PPKM, a policy to curb the spread of COVID-19. PPKM is divided into four levels, with Level 4 being the most stringent.\nPreviously, only schools in Level 3 areas were allowed to adopt hybrid classes, in which half of the students study remotely and the other half attend physical classes. Under such an arrangement, students take turns to study at school but parents can opt for home-based learning for their children.\xa0\xa0\nSchools in Level 4 were barred from staging physical classes, while in-person classes were held for schools in Level 1 and 2.\nOn Thursday (Feb 3), the Education Ministry said that they have modified the instruction to allow schools in Level 2 PPKM to adopt hybrid classes as well.\n“Starting (Thursday), areas in Level 2 PPKM will be given the ability to adjust in-person classes from the capacity of 100 per cent to 50 per cent,” Education Ministry secretary general Suharti said in a statement.\nMdm Suharti, who like many Indonesians goes with one name, added that schools in Level 2 PPKM areas can still have all of its students attend physical classes with permission from the parents.\xa0\nThe decision came after Indonesia saw a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases with more than 10,000 infections recorded daily.\xa0\nAmid the rising cases, President Joko Widodo expressed his concerns about the health risk\xa0amid the rising number of confirmed cases.\n“I want an evaluation on in-person learning, particularly in West Java, Jakarta and Banten,” he told a Cabinet meeting on Jan 31. The president, known popularly as Jokowi, was referring to the three provinces which have recently become the epicentres for COVID-19 transmission.\nPublic health expert Hermawan Saputra said the Education Ministry should consider repealing its revised policy and extend hybrid learning to all schools.\xa0\xa0\n“No one should be forced to send their children to attend in-person classes,” he told CNA.\nThe Indonesian government began rolling out COVID-19 vaccines to children aged between six and 11 on Dec 14.\nAs of Thursday, only 3.3 million children or 12.6 per cent of the age group have been completely vaccinated, according to Health Ministry figures. Slightly over 10 million children or 40.5 per cent have not received their first vaccination dose.\xa0\nMeanwhile, there were 2.4 million or 9.2 per cent of children aged between 12 and 17 who have not been vaccinated.\nThe Education Ministry’s previous policy which mandated schools under Level 1 and 2 of PPKM to have physical classes from Jan 3 onwards was problematic as it forced students in most areas to go to schools, Dr Saputra said.\xa0\n“This puts children, teachers and their families at risk of contracting COVID-19,” he added.\nThe advisor at the Indonesian Public Health Expert Association said not all schools are suited to stage in-person classes in the middle of the pandemic. Some schools are not well ventilated while others are so small that it is impossible to practise safe distancing, he added.\xa0\n“Even if the schools comply with proper health protocols, students can still contract COVID-19 on the way to school or inside public transportation. They might carry the virus home and infect other members of their families, including their elderly grandparents who might have comorbidities,” he said.\xa0\nIndonesia reported its first case of Omicron variant on Dec 8. Since then, the number of COVID-19 infections has risen dramatically.\nOn Jan 3, when students returned to school for physical classes, Indonesia recorded just 174 confirmed COVID-19 cases over a 24-hour period. On Feb 3, the number of daily infections skyrocketed to 27,197.\n“The revision (to the previous policy) is long overdue. Offices had already told their employees to work from home for weeks but children were still being forced to go to school,” one parent from Jakarta, Mdm Santi Handayani, told CNA.\n“Many parents were against this policy but the school said they had no choice but to follow the central government’s instruction. I am glad that the government finally came to its senses.”\nCurrently, around half of COVID-19 infections in Indonesia were recorded in Jakarta.\nFor the past one month, the city had closed down at least 99 schools after more than 200 students and teachers were infected. Affected schools were required to shut for five days.\xa0\xa0\nDespite the high number of cases, the Indonesian capital and surrounding cities and regencies are still imposing Level 2 PPKM.\xa0\nJakarta governor Anies Baswedan said on Wednesday that he has proposed a tighter activity restriction to the central government, which has the final say on a region’s PPKM status.\nWiku Adisasmito, spokesman of the government’s COVID-19 Mitigation Task Force said on Thursday that the government assesses a region’s PPKM status based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospital bed occupancy and the percentage of people vaccinated.\nDr Saputra, the public health expert, said areas like Jakarta should be placed under Level 3 PPKM.\xa0\n“I think Indonesia is trying to avoid a tighter lockdown particularly as Indonesia prepares to host the MotoGP race (in March) and the G20 Summit (in October). A lockdown might destroy the international community’s confidence in Indonesia,” he said.\xa0\nWith the latest school policy permitting schools in Level 2 PPKM to practise hybrid learning, parents in Jakarta said they would keep their children at home for now.\xa0\nMdm Fira Ruswandi said her daughter tested positive for COVID-19 last month after a classmate was infected.\xa0\n“The school was closed for five days, after which the school reopened like nothing had happened.\n“I was really anxious about my daughter going back to school. I still am. That’s why the new policy is a huge relief for me,” the 39-year-old mother of two told CNA.\xa0\nSimilarly, Mr Thomas Liem, who lives in the Jakarta suburb of Bogor, was relieved that his children would no longer be forced to go to school.\n“For the past one month, I have been very anxious about my two children going back to school. They imposed the (previous) policy when the Omicron (variant) began to hit Indonesia. As cases began to rise, my anxiousness slowly turned to fear,” the 40-year-old marketing manager said.\n“They decided to change the policy when the situation has already worsened. But it is better late than never.""\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     education ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      5G: Empowering classrooms of the future
  </h1>, 'text': 'As students start the new school year, they are also charging their devices and looking forward to an expanded definition of learning – one that takes place in the digital realm.\nOnce viewed as an additional resource, digital learning solutions are now considered a necessity, thanks in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Newly developed augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) resources for education look set to revolutionise the learning process, making it more interactive, exciting and hands-on.\nA fast, stable and secure Internet connection is essential for learning technologies to bear fruit. It can be distressing for students when the Internet connection drops and causes a livestreamed class discussion to be interrupted or a video call consultation with a teacher to be cut short.\n""Given the\xa0current pandemic, interactive technologies and video-based applications like Zoom have made\xa0learning safer.\xa0But for the learning experience to be optimal, a stable and speedy Internet connection is crucial,""\xa0said first-year polytechnic student Ho Nhat Tien, 17.\xa0\nEMPOWERING STUDENTS WITH 5G\nWith excellent connectivity, however, the potential for the application of digital tools in education is vast. Having a powerful 5G network, for example, enables unprecedented advances in AR and VR, which were previously hampered by the limitations of 4G technology.\n\nA common problem with VR is the nausea caused by the lag in motion. When the user moves his hand, for example, there may be a time lag before he sees his VR avatar’s hand move. This lag is the result of high latency – the time taken for data to be decoded at its destination after transmission. According to Ericsson.com, a lag can be perceived when latency reaches somewhere between 75 and 100 milliseconds. The lower latency of 5G networks can greatly minimise the mismatch in action and response – and the resulting discomfort – allowing students to fully benefit from learning via VR. With VR, textbooks can come to life, taking students into the heart of a volcano or allowing them to interact with historical figures.\nIn addition, 5G allows the burden of processing and rendering visuals to be moved from the VR headset to the cloud. This reduces costs, enables the development of smaller and lighter headsets, and empowers educational content developers to be more creative without the shackles of hardware limitations.\nCollaborative tasks, such as working together remotely on editing a video for school or participating in online team-based competitions, is another important aspect of education that can be empowered by 5G connectivity.\nWhile current online learning encourages collaboration via breakout rooms, this can again be thwarted by bandwidth and speed issues. Students who constantly experience lag or get disconnected from video calls will find participation to be a frustrating and unproductive experience.\n\nThe consistency and lower latency of a 5G network like Singtel’s ensure\xa0that students have a smooth and seamless collaboration experience. Whether they are working on a group science presentation or painting a digital mural as a team, they can work just as closely as if they were in a real-life classroom.\nESSENTIAL FEATURES THAT SUPPORT ONLINE LEARNING\nSingtel’s 5G network is defined by five key qualities: Ultra-fast, ultra-smooth, ultra-responsive, ultra-consistent and ultra-secure. Given that many students are young, security is especially important for parents’ peace of mind while their children use their own or the family’s devices. 5G harnesses the defensive technologies of 4G while adding features such as stronger data encryption.\n\nSpeed, of course, is crucial. In an analysis of Speedtest Intelligence data from the third and fourth quarters of 2021 by Ookla, Singtel had consistently come in tops for the speed of its 5G network in Singapore, which reaches up to a blazing 1.2Gbps.\nThe network’s consistency and responsiveness also ensure that students enjoy a lag-free, continuous connection whenever and wherever they need it, so they can focus on their learning and not have to deal with disruptions caused by a spotty connection.

      Some pre-schools to screen kids for developmental needs from 2 months old as part of pilot programme
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Sixteen pre-schools in Punggol and Sengkang, run by\xa0PAP Community Foundation (PCF), will be involved in a pilot programme to screen children for\xa0developmental issues from as young as two months old.\nThe programme, called Mission I’mPossible 2, will be trialled over four years.\nIt builds on an earlier pilot that screens children aged five to six. That pilot, now known as the Development Support and Learning Support Programme (DS-LS), has since been\xa0adopted by the Government and is available at more than\xa0600 pre-schools, covering about 40 per cent of students aged five to six.\nThere are plans for DS-LS to be expanded to cover\xa060 per cent\xa0of pre-schoolers by 2025, and for this to be increased to 80 per cent\xa0at ""steady-state"", according to a press release.\nThe new pilot\xa0seeks to provide support for children with\xa0developmental needs at an earlier stage.\nA school-based Child Development Unit will be established at PCF, comprising an interdisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, early interventionists, social workers, nutritionists and curriculum specialists who will rove around the pre-schools.\nA support network run by the pre-school’s social workers will also be set up, and new\xa0processes for the systematic screening of growth and development in children will be introduced.\nPCF, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) and the Lien Foundation are jointly organising the pilot, with the Lien Foundation sponsoring S$9.27 million of the S$12.1 million costs. The balance will be\xa0funded by PCF and KKH.\nThe programme seeks to demonstrate ""how education, healthcare and social services can be integrated and delivered within the community"", said\xa0PCF, KKH and Lien Foundation in their press release.\nFor children with developmental needs, support can be provided as part of the programme or they can be referred to an\xa0existing government-funded programme.\n“By going upstream, MIP2 aims to reduce costs,"" said programme director of Lien Foundation Ng Tze Yong.\n""Not just financial costs through lowering downstream demand for early intervention and disability services but more importantly, the emotional costs to families and societal costs of lost human potential incurred when intervention comes too late for children to catch up.”\nStudies have shown that a high-quality pre-school programme and attention to a child’s development in early childhood are linked with ""better metabolic and mental health, as well as academic and socioeconomic outcomes later in life"", said the programme director of MIP2, Associate Professor Chan Yoke Hwee.\n“Early childhood is a period of vulnerability and also opportunity ...\xa0It is therefore imperative that children with developmental needs are identified early and be provided early intervention and support,"" said\xa0Assoc\xa0Prof\xa0Chan, who chairs the Division of Medicine at KKH.\n""To enable this, KKH will leverage our expertise to support the delivery of integrated education, health and social services through the preschools under Mission I’mPossible 2.”\nAn evaluation study will be conducted at the end of the four-year pilot.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     health ', '     social service ', '     pre-school ']}"

      National digital literacy programme has enabled students to have access to digital devices amid COVID-19: Halimah Yacob
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Education Ministry\'s (MOE) National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)\xa0has enabled students to have access to digital devices amid the COVID-19 pandemic, President Halimah Yacob said on Tuesday (Jan 25).\nSpeaking during a visit to Pasir Ris Secondary School, she said the personal learning devices have helped students ""greatly"" to access digital information in ""so many different ways"".\nOn her visit to the school, Madam Halimah was given an overview of its technology plan, cyber-wellness programmes and rollout of the NDLP.\xa0\nUnder the NDLP, all secondary school students became owners of a personal learning device in 2021. This was rolled out in two phases, at 86 schools in Term 2 and 66 schools in Term 3.\nThe roll-out was made seven years ahead of the original target announced by former Education Minister Ong Ye Kung at 2020’s committee of supply debates.\xa0\n“And the good thing is also for students who can’t afford it, they’re able to access (it). Their financial prohibitions are not an area where it will affect their ability to access digital programmes. I think that’s really very good,” said Mdm Halimah.\xa0\nDigital literacy is “very important” not only for the learning, development and growth of students, but for them to integrate into society after they leave school, she added.\xa0\nWith technology, students can also seek help online for their mental well-being, said Mdm Halimah.\xa0\nStressing the importance of mental resilience throughout life, the President said the COVID-19 pandemic has “exacerbated” the situation, particularly for students who are studying and struggling with other issues in their lives.\xa0\n“Because of isolation, the fact that you cannot tap on your usual social networks physically –\xa0it does have an impact. (For) mental resilience through technology, when students have any problems, they can go online, then they can get someone to respond to the problems that they have,” said Mdm Halimah.\xa0\n“I think that\'s really important, because there is then someone they can talk to, they can relate to, someone they can seek help from. So that in a way helped them to get through this period.”\xa0\nShe also stressed the growing importance of cyber wellness.\xa0\nMOE rolled out a new character and citizenship education curriculum to lower secondary students in 2021. It was extended to upper secondary students this year.\n“It\'s not just a question of knowing how to access the different apps, use the computer to access information, but also it’s to know what is the information that is out there,” said Mdm Halimah.\nOnline users need to process this information, and may need people who can tell them that some of this information is not safe or may be detrimental, she added.\xa0\nFor example, one of the activities at Pasir Ris Secondary School helps students to identify problems they may face when they share information on websites or social networking platforms like Instagram and Facebook “without thinking carefully”, she noted.\xa0\nExcessive gaming has also “become quite a serious problem” globally and in Singapore, said Mdm Halimah.\xa0\nChildren and students should be taught about the dangers of excessive gaming, which “can become a problem”, she added.\xa0\n“Teaching our students or young people about the importance of accessing information, being on social media, Internet, but yet using it safely and responsibly, is important,” said Mdm Halimah.\xa0\n“Being a responsible user, you know that you don\'t want to use that platform in order to cause harm to others.\n""And raising your awareness to the potential of causing that harm is important so you become more responsible, so the place that you\'re leveraging on the Internet is safe for others as well as for you.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     cybersecurity ']}"

      New year, new skills: Transform your career with upGrad
  </h1>, 'text': 'If there’s one thing we’ve learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s that digital transformation can help industries and sectors emerge stronger despite the significant challenges of the past two years.\xa0\nWith giants like\xa0China and\xa0India looking to power their future economies with technology, fields such as data science, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are gaining prominence as in-demand skillsets. As industries transform and businesses scale up, they require more workers with the right know-how. In addition, the talent gap for management roles is widening, leading to more opportunities for professionals to rise up the ranks with the help of upskilling.\nIn the wake of the pandemic, the unprecedented slowdown of industries like tourism and hospitality has resulted in many professionals transitioning into new careers. At the same time, online learning has become more accessible and sophisticated, as learning institutions adapted and found new ways to harness technology to deliver content. Gaining new competencies and exploring new skillsets has never been easier.\xa0\nARM YOURSELF WITH IN-DEMAND SKILLS\xa0\nCognisant of this trajectory, Temasek-backed edtech platform upGrad is poised to enrich professionals looking to fast-track their careers in an evolving job market through the acquisition of relevant skills.\xa0\nMr Liviu Nedef, upGrad’s vice president and head of marketing, Asia Pacific, said that today’s dynamic economic environment has led to a need for working professionals to develop new skills in order to access roles in the tech, data and digital domains.\xa0\nSome of upGrad’s most popular courses are those in innovative technologies such as data science and AI, both of which are critical to Southeast Asia’s economic transformation. Industries as diverse as entertainment, education, banking and manufacturing are tapping the power of data science to drive growth, while the use of AI has been ramping up throughout the region.\nAccording to Mr Nedef, data science-related career pathways have become very popular in the last five years. “Data has become the fuel that powers all types of businesses across industries, helping organisations better understand their customers, facilitating decision-making throughout companies and driving business strategy forward. Data science enables companies to efficiently generate and leverage data from multiple sources to derive valuable insights that inform the next set of management actions,” he explained.\nFor professionals who want to learn new data analytics skills and lay a solid foundation for their career, upGrad offers a comprehensive nine-month fully online Professional Certificate in Data Science and Business Analytics from University of Maryland, a top 100 global university; and a six-month online Data Analytics Certificate from Caltech, a renowned university ranked sixth in the QS Global World Rankings 2022.\xa0\nThose who wish to deepen their experience and knowledge in data science may benefit from pursuing the 18-month fully online Master of Science in Data Science from Liverpool John Moores University – ranked among the top 1 per cent of global universities, or the University of Arizona’s MSc in Data Science. The latter counts as one of the top 100 universities globally.\xa0\nAlso from Liverpool John Moores University is the Master of Science in Machine Learning and AI, which gives students the opportunity to work on more than 15 industry projects, multiple programming tools and a dissertation, along with the acquisition of natural language processing, reinforcement learning and deep learning skills.\nAdditionally, learners will gain full alumni status from the universities upon graduation.\nLEARNING WITH EASE AND FLEXIBILITY\nThe approach that upGrad adopts ensures that users benefit from real learning for the real world – the platform’s 100 per cent digital in-house content, pedagogy and research harness deep knowledge from global industry experts, who also conduct 70 per cent of the teaching.\xa0\nIn total, upGrad has close to 100 courses across management, data, technology and information technology. Courses last between two months and three years, with credentials ranging from certificates to doctorates. The upGrad learning experience comprises online modules, projects and assignments, master classes and live sessions that feature industry-driven case studies.\xa0\nAccording to Mr Nedef, upGrad offers working professionals the flexibility to learn and earn at the same time, with no need to put their current jobs on pause.\xa0\nMr Nedef said: “On average, our degrees require 10 to 15 hours of study time a week. One of the great advantages of our digital platform is the flexibility of learning. We make this convenient for our learners by providing plenty of options to learn anytime, anywhere.” \xa0\nWhat further differentiates upGrad is what Mr Nedef calls ‘upGrad buddies’ who coach and help learners throughout the duration of their courses. Participants have access to one-to-one mentorship sessions with senior industry professionals, career counselling by experts and end-to-end career support service.\xa0\xa0\n“With two million learners across the world having used our platform and programmes, 80 per cent of our learners are experiencing positive career outcomes – a statistic that was recently audited and confirmed by business management consultancy Deloitte,” said Mr Nedef.\xa0\nFounded in 2015 in India, upGrad is one of the pioneers in the online education space, and has since expanded globally with a presence in Europe, the United States, Middle East and most recently, in Asia Pacific.\xa0\nONWARDS AND UPWARDS\nAs we enter the new year, this could be the opportune time for workers to consider professional pathways and equip themselves with knowledge and skills that could bring their career to the next level.\xa0\n“UpGrad offers future-ready courses that combine the best university-style processes with the wonders of online technology and industry-relevant content,” said Mr Nedef. “Our purpose is to change the lives of millions of working professionals in our region for the better, by helping them to accelerate their careers and shape the workforce of the future.”\nLearn more about upGrad’s courses on data science and technology, and its other offerings.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     upGrad ', '     upskilling ', '     education ', '     skills upgrading ']}"

Students will work with companies to develop AI solutions to address business needs, said the college in a press release.\xa0\nThis will provide ITE students with “a suite of AI capabilities” for the future, said Minister of Education Chan Chun Sing at the launch.\xa0\n“Students will be exposed to skillsets in computer vision, pattern recognition and data analytics, and trained to support AI applications in predictive maintenance, industrial inspection and video analytics,” he added.\xa0\nClose to 400 students will benefit from this partnership each year, said ITE.\nNvidia will also train ITE lecturers as its certified instructors, who will then deliver the company’s AI curriculum to students.\xa0\nThis refers to Nvidia’s “industry-standard” deep learning institute programme, said Mr Dennis Ang, Nvidia’s senior director for enterprise business in Southeast Asia and Australia-New Zealand.\xa0\n“These are programmes that are widely adopted by the industry, and they provide the students here in ITE a very good grasp of what AI technology is and also this is very hands-on, very practice-oriented, which basically suits the curriculum the ITE students will endeavour to learn,” he added. \xa0\nSingapore has set a target to be a leader in developing and deploying AI solutions by 2030, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“To achieve this target of adopting AI in our economy, a wide spectrum of complementary skill sets and job roles are required.\n“This ranges from tech-heavy roles focused on more complex functions and innovation and require more advanced IT skills in technology development and data engineering, and roles focusing on operating and applying AI, such as digital marketing executives where skills such as technology application and data analytics are important.”\xa0\nSingapore’s education system is key to developing talent\xa0in this area, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nAlthough universities will continue to train students to meet the growing demand for AI talent, the “full suite” of AI professionals cannot be fulfilled by a “single pipeline” of university graduates, he added.\xa0\n“There is a growing range of job roles required to deploy and integrate AI systems. Examples include business analyst and AI translators, user experience designers, quality assurance managers and marketing analysts,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“Our polytechnics and ITE provide an important source of talent for these roles.”\xa0\nNvidia has a “strong” partner ecosystem, and the intention is for students to work with these start-ups\xa0on real-world problems, said Nvidia’s Mr Ang.\xa0\nNvidia’s supercomputing platform is also “very critical” for students who want to work on AI projects, and it will allow them to learn how to use real-world tools when they secure jobs in the AI industry,\xa0he added.\xa0\n“In terms of the opportunities for ITE (students), many of the partners that we have with industries and with the partner ecosystem, they’re always looking for AI skillsets. So ITE students would play very well in terms of being able to fulfil some of the gaps in the skillsets,” said Mr Ang.\xa0\n“In terms of Nvidia, we do have an office here, and from time to time we do take in interns. So part of the opportunity that was presented with this engagement with ITE is the ability for some of the ITE students to join us as interns and then be able to pick up more technology skills.”\xa0\nEditor’s note: An earlier version of this story said that a new AI training facility was launched. ITE has clarified that it was the AI programme that was launched, and that the training facility under the programme is in the works.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     ITE ', '     artificial intelligence ', '     Nvidia Corp ']}"

      Influencers, hate comments and more: Updated CCE syllabus tackles ‘contemporary’ issues like cyber wellness
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: What would you do if you were bombarded by hate comments after saying something positive online?\xa0\nResponding to hate comments in such situations, getting ""cancelled"" and the influencer industry were among the topics Secondary 4 students at Compassvale Secondary School discussed on Tuesday morning (Jan 18).\xa0\nThis morning’s lesson on cyber wellness is part of the new character and citizenship education (CCE) curriculum that was rolled out to lower secondary students in 2021. It was extended to upper secondary students\xa0this year.\xa0\n“During the CCE lessons, we surface contemporary issues, we surface authentic scenarios. And when they are faced with this kind of scenario, they get to hear what their peers feel or\xa0believe in. And then they will learn from each other and learn about how to manage,” said Madam Wan Fazithahariani, a senior teacher at the school.\xa0\n“What we do is we facilitate this discussion and we bring up some interesting points or management skills that they can use. Hopefully when they’re out there on their own they will be able to manage that.”\xa0\nThe lessons put students in “contemporary” scenarios that students “can connect with”, said Mdm Wan, a specialised CCE teacher.\xa0\nFor example, in Tuesday\'s\xa0lesson, the students discussed negative comments received by an influencer who pivoted to TikTok content due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\xa0\nWhen asked how they would respond or whether they would choose to respond at all, the class decided after some discussion that they would leave a positive comment in reply to a negative one.\xa0\nThey then discussed their choice, how they felt about the comments and how they would respond when their positive comment garnered even more backlash.\xa0\n“They were very surprised that even though they chose a comment that was quite positive, the backlash they received from the comments was quite strong. We asked them, \'How does that make you feel? Did you regret choosing the positive comment?\'” said Mdm Wan.\xa0\n“And we were really pleased to note that they said that even though they received negative comments and all that, they stood by what they believed in and they would still continue to have that positive impact on the cyber community. Because they know that if they chose the negative comments they will perpetuate that negativity on the cyber community.”\nAdding that she was “heartened” by the updated\xa0CCE curriculum, Mdm Wan said students are now “very enthusiastic” and “very candid and open” about sharing their experiences in class.\xa0\n“As opposed to five years ago, the students right now are online a lot more. And so they are facing a lot of pressure online,” she said, adding that it was “imperative” to introduce these new situations.\xa0\n“It could be image or self-esteem pressures, wanting to be like the people who are featured online. It could be getting hurtful comments or responses to their posts. (They have) many many challenges that students in the past did not face.”\xa0\nFor Secondary 4 student Gautham Karthik, although he does not have any social media accounts yet, he scrolls through Twitter regularly and reads the news online.\xa0\nOne of the main challenges he faces is managing his screen time, he said.\xa0He used to spend a lot of time playing games on the computer, and his parents constantly advised him to spend more time on his studies instead.\xa0\n“If you don’t really manage your time properly, you may end up being addicted, or end up spending a lot of time (online). Prolonged exposure to screens will also affect your eyesight,” said the 15-year-old.\xa0\n“Unlike the previous curriculum, the scenarios today is very helpful. For example, it puts the students into the victim’s shoes, connect with what they’re feeling and allows us to understand what they’re going through, and allows us to empathise with them.""\nGautham has also seen his share of hateful comments online, albeit directed at other people.\xa0\n“I’ve always read articles surrounding these situations. I kind of feel bad for whoever’s going through this because they don’t really deserve all this type of negativity shown against them,” he said.\xa0\n“We should all ensure that people are well aware of what to do in cyberspace, how to be socially responsible in social media platforms and be respectful to one another to get a more positive cyberspace. I think that’s important.”\xa0\nSpeaking to journalists after observing the lesson on Tuesday morning, Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling said the Ministry of Education recognises that while technology has brought a “positive impact” to students, excessive use of social media can fuel mental health concerns.\xa0\n“We recognise that our students may come across\xa0a variety of cyber threats as well as cyber risks online. For instance, they may be subject to cyber bullying;\xa0they may also suffer from gaming addiction;\xa0they may also come across fake news and scams,” said Ms Sun.\xa0\nTeachers make use of real-life examples with videos and screenshots to show students the material they may come across online, she added.\xa0\n“But what’s important is that they process their emotions, their feelings and they know that there is a peer support culture that is available in schools whereby they can talk though these situations that they have come across, process their emotions - and\xa0where necessary, talk to a trusted adult if they should need further help such as counselling or follow-up with the parents.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     cybersecurity ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'While studying for her Master of Arts in Music in Hong Kong, Dr Natalie Alexandra Tse drew on her natural affinity for kids by working as an early childhood music and movement educator, teaching babies as young as six months old to seven-year-old children. “The music lessons were fun, engaging and playful,” she recounted. “It was a very different experience from my own childhood learning music.”\nUpon her return to Singapore, however, she was dismayed to find that such classes for children were few and far between. While working as a music educator for kids in a private setting, Dr Tse decided to develop her own artistic practice as a guzheng improviser and experimenter, exploring the use of technology like guitar and bass pedals on the traditional Chinese instrument. This led to her co-founding the arts organisation SAtheCollective – a non-profit, multicultural performing arts company. Embarking on this venture also made her realise that audiences were best captured at a young age.\n“We need to develop our audiences young, so that they can be receptive and responsive to a diversity of sounds,” she explained. “This has to do with having a keen ear for mindful, active or deep listening, where one listens to sonic qualities of objects with some level of criticality.”\nFINDING HER PASSION, AND A RESEARCH TOPIC\nWith this goal in mind, Dr Tse went on to co-found LittleCr3atures, where she serves as artistic director. LittleCr3atures offers a safe and immersive space for young ones to experience playing with and exploring sound and sonic objects.\n“Initially, I was thinking about children at nursery level and how culturally diverse music and instruments could be brought to preschools,” she said. “As I experimented with different experiential designs for the early years, I found myself drawn to the natural competence of babies to explore sensorially.”\nThis developing fascination eventually became the subject of her research thesis. While setting up LittleCr3atures, Dr Tse was also enrolled in her PhD studies from August 2016 to June 2021 at the Visual and Performing Arts Academic Group at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University (NIE NTU, Singapore).\nDr Tse’s thesis centred around research into babies’ sonic play. “My PhD and work are intertwined,” she said. “It’s a symbiotic relationship. My work is my artistic practice, which informs the research, as much as my research informs my artistic practice.”\nA MENTOR BEYOND HER PHD\n\nDr Tse chose to enrol in NIE NTU, Singapore primarily because of her mentor, Associate Professor Lum Chee Hoo, who coordinates the Master of Education (Music) programme and is head of the UNESCO-NIE Centre for Arts Research in Education. Earlier in her studies, Dr Tse had encountered many papers either written or edited by Assoc Prof Lum, and she reached out to him for advice on pursuing further education in her areas of interest.\n“I wanted to learn and better myself,” said Dr Tse. “NIE was a natural choice of institution for me as I already knew Dr Lum and our research interests aligned. Even though I’ve since graduated, Dr Lum remains my mentor figure and our mentor-mentee relationship continues. He supports my initiatives by being a third eye and ear for the programmes I run, which are aligned to my research interests.”\nBesides the influence of Dr Lum, she recalled an open-minded culture and receptiveness to new ideas as being part of NIE’s Visual and Performing Arts Academic Group. “The academic staff across the art forms of theatre, visual arts and music are critical ideating bouncing boards for any subject matter,” she explained. “The culture of research is rigorous and supports open discussion for the consideration of progressive ways of working.”\nCOMBINING WORK, FAMILY AND LEARNING\n\nRunning two arts organisations and juggling her PhD studies were made more intense for Dr Tse with the birth of her two children, one in the second year of her PhD and another in her fourth year.\nWhile challenging, she says that her children are also her greatest blessing – one that extends to her work and studies, as the arrival of her firstborn spurred her research into the creation of sonic experiences for babies. For instance, she delved into Chinese and Indian philosophies that relate to concepts of nature in experimental music. This resulted in the creation of her baby-oriented sonic experience Nadam, which means “sound” in Sanskrit.\xa0\nFor Dr Tse, family, work and research are all simply different facets of her lifelong interest in music, play and sound. “I don’t think we ever stop learning,” she reflected. “In research, one needs to truly be passionate, critically inquiring and curious. Resonating with my own work with and about children, I think learning is really about being able to have a sense of wonder and a playful attitude towards life.”\nShe added: “In a society like ours, perhaps many have forgotten this sense of wonder and play. Lifelong learning may be a way to rekindle some of those moments in our lives where our hearts felt full because we acquired new knowledge.”\nApplication for NIE’s August 2022 intake is open from now till Jan 31, 2022.\n', 'related_topics': ['     National Institute of Education ', '     Nanyang Technological University ', '     NIE NTU ', '     education ']}"

      Morning school run woes: Frustrated parents say traffic jams, queue-cutting are a daily affair
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For many parents who drive their children to school, traffic snarls and frayed tempers are everyday occurrences.\nInconsiderate behaviour like blocking the way,\xa0cutting queues and parents taking their time at drop-off points are just some of the instances that contribute to the all-around stress, parents told CNA.\xa0\n“It’s not the part going from your home to the school. It’s always the last 500m outside any school in Singapore. You end up probably spending more time there than you do on half your journey. It’s always that portion which can get a bit hairy,” said Mrs Karen Goh.\xa0\n“There’s always a golden window. So if you arrive during the golden window, you probably don’t get stuck in the jam very much, it’s very minimal. If you arrive past 7am, traffic just builds up exponentially so then you get stuck for 10 minutes.""\nAnd if you miss the window or leave home just a few minutes late?\n""You just have to pray,"" Mrs Goh said with a chuckle.\nThe mother-of-two and her husband have worked out that making separate trips to\xa0Methodist Girls’ School and Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), which their daughter and son attend, is the best way to handle the daily school run.\n“If we have to take them together, which we have before, one arrives very early and the other one is on the verge of being late. So we figured maybe it’s less stressful for everybody in the morning if we take them separately,” said Mrs Goh.\xa0\nOn Tuesday (Jan 11), a 61-year-old man was arrested for a rash act causing hurt after an incident outside Red Swastika School.\xa0\nIn the video widely circulated\xa0online, a white car was stopped from entering the primary school. The car then inched\xa0forward several times, pushing against the security officer standing in front of it.\xa0\nAccording to the Union of Security Employees (USE), the car had a valid label to enter the school, but had cut the queue of cars waiting to enter, and moved his vehicle dangerously even when the security officer was standing in front of it.\xa0\nThe 62-year-old security officer Mr Neo Ah Whatt sustained “minor injuries” and police investigations are ongoing.\xa0\nMr Neo is “quite well-liked” by students and parents, executive secretary of USE Steve\xa0Tan told CNA on Wednesday.\xa0\n“We asked him whether there are people who abuse him or scold him, is this the first time and so on. Broadly speaking, his recollection was that he’s very happy working at the school. You have the odd occasion of people challenging the rules, but this is his first time encountering something as egregious as this,” he added.\xa0\nThe parents of Primary 1 and 2 students at Red Swastika School have car labels indicating that they are allowed to enter the school to drop off their children, said Mr Aylwin Lam, whose two children attend the school.\xa0\nAll the other parents are expected to use the\xa0HDB car park next to the school, where children enter by\xa0the school\'s back gate, he told CNA.\xa0There are typically two security officers at the school gate and one more at the exit to help pedestrians and children cross the road safely and signal to cars to move off.\xa0\nMr Lam described the 61-year-old driver’s actions in jumping the line as\xa0an “everyday occurrence”.\xa0\n“There are people who will take the chance, use the yellow box to come in from the second lane,” he said.\xa0\n“And the worst thing is when they try to come in from the second lane, people like me who won’t let them come in because they didn’t queue, (these cars) will (create a) jam. They will just wait there for their chance to turn, and they will block the entire lane,” said Mr Lam, adding that he saw someone do the same thing just two days ago.\xa0\n“Just before the area where the Bentley turned in yesterday, one of these cars actually did that. He blocked the entire lane because he was trying to filter into our lane to get into the school.”\xa0\nWhen CNA visited Red Swastika School on Wednesday morning, the line of cars along Bedok North Avenue 3\xa0started to build at 7am. The main gates to Bedok Green Secondary School, Red Swastika School, and the entrance and exit of the HDB car park where parents drop off their children are all located along that road.\xa0\nRed Swastika School only allows parents to start entering the school gates at around 7.10am and by then, CNA observed that the innermost lane was already packed with cars waiting to turn into the HDB car park or the schools along Bedok North Avenue 3.\nCNA also spotted several cars cutting into the first lane from other lanes, similar to what the 61-year-old driver did on Tuesday morning.\xa0\nAfter exiting from the HDB car park, several drivers used the yellow box at the exit to cut across several lanes to the U-turn on the outermost lane of Bedok North Avenue 3.\xa0\nIn some instances, they even stopped in the boxes although there were no cars in front of them, sometimes occupying two lanes and holding up traffic.\xa0\nStopping in a yellow box is considered a traffic offence outside Silver Zones and School Zones. Owners of light vehicles and heavy vehicles can face fines of S$100 and S$150 respectively.\xa0\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in response to CNA queries in 2020 that markings like yellow boxes are used to deter vehicles from stopping and obstructing traffic along a section of the road “where appropriate”.\xa0\nLTA has also introduced different traffic management and road safety measures, like traffic signs, road humps and road markings to remind motorists to slow down near schools.\xa0\nTo manage traffic flow, some schools deploy their own traffic marshals and adopt staggered reporting or dismissal times where possible, said LTA at the time.\xa0\n“Where necessary, LTA deploys parking wardens to guide traffic during the affected hours, to complement these measures,” said the authorities in the statement.\xa0\nIn response to CNA queries, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Thursday that schools have protocols in place to manage “vehicular movement” within the campus during assembly and dismissal periods.\xa0\nFor example, schools may deploy traffic marshals to direct cars coming into schools during peak periods and have designated places for drivers to pick up or drop off students, said the ministry in its response.\xa0\n“At schools’ discretion, school staff may be deployed at locations such as signalised pedestrian crossings and drop-off points to ensure students’ safe commuting. Parent volunteers may also help to encourage good road safety habits by reminding students to look out for traffic.”\xa0\nSchools encourage students to use public transport or school buses for primary schools to travel to and from school, said MOE in its statement.\xa0\nThey also inform parents of traffic management policies and the enforcement actions that could be imposed on errant motorists.\xa0\nA parent who only wanted to be known as Ms Seah, who has been sending her three children to Red Swastika School in the mornings for seven years, said the traffic situation worsened\xa0over the years.\xa0\nDespite living nearby, the family has had to leave the house about 10 minutes earlier than in previous years.\xa0\n“Last year, as long as we reach the Bedok Reservoir stretch before 7.10am, we will be able to get into the school by 7.20am. But for this year onwards, I have to be at the Bedok Reservoir stretch by 7am, because the queue is already very long,” she told CNA.\xa0\n“Ever since the school changed to (a) single session, the traffic has worsened.”\xa0\nEven though she has a son who is in Primary 2, which means she is allowed to\xa0drive into\xa0the school, she chooses to drop her children off at the HDB car park where the traffic is slightly better.\xa0\n“We have the car decal, but the queue is really horrible,” she added.\n“(In the) worst case, sometimes we’re in the jam for about 20 to 25 minutes, and then my kids will arrive at school at 7.26am or 7.27am.”\xa0\nThen there are those who are especially affectionate.\xa0\n“Sometimes parents will drop off their kids, open the door, take their school bag for them, give them a big hug, stuff like that. Then it will just jam up everybody.”\xa0\nSuch delays\xa0stress\xa0her children out as well.\xa0\n“They will always look at the time, ‘Mummy, so late already.’ Sometimes, before the entrance, they say they want to get off because they need to run to school, they don’t want to be late,” she added.\n“I told them ‘Just be late, just let the teacher know you were late’\xa0because I don’t think it’s worth taking the risk.”\xa0\nOther parents choose to leave home even earlier. To get his three children to school on time, Mr Camilius Yang sets off at 6.25am.\xa0\nHis three children, who attend St Patrick’s School, CHIJ Katong Convent and St Joseph’s Institute Junior, are in school by 7am.\xa0\nAdding that he could identify with the frustration of the 61-year-old driver, Mr Yang said many parents sometimes find themselves stuck outside when a queue has already formed.\xa0\n“But obviously if I’m blocked by someone I will make a U-turn ... or I will get my kids to drop off at the bus stop and then they walk in. It’s about how you handle it right? I cannot drop you at the doorstep every time because I need to wait in the queue for 15 minutes or so,” he added.\xa0\nSchools see similar traffic jams at dismissal time. When CNA visited Methodist Girls’ School on Wednesday afternoon, there were many cars parked illegally opposite the school, waiting for students to be released.\xa0\nAt about 12.40pm, snaking lines filled most of Blackmore Drive and spilt onto Bukit Timah Road.\xa0\n“I think that if you are a regular driver, you kind of know which lane to take, and when you have to keep to your lane. Having said that, I think that in general you just need to employ a bit of graciousness to your fellow co-drivers. Everybody’s trying to get their kids to school,” said Mrs Goh, the mother-of-two.\n“I think that if there’s a bit of give-and-take .... the morning ride is a bit more bearable.”\xa0\nOnce, her car broke down at the school gate\xa0at 7am - a\xa0line of cars waiting behind her. The school sent staff members and security officers to manage and control the traffic.\n“You could really see a whole range of human responses, from the understanding ones to the very unpleasant ones. I felt so bad for them (the staff) because it was my fault that the car broke down but they were getting scolded for the traffic,” she said, urging parents to be more understanding.\xa0\nParents who drive should also be more patient, not least because there are children using the roads,\xa0said Ms Seah, the parent of three Red Swastika students.\n“I know everybody’s stressed out and rushing in the morning, sometimes they might just miss the children. So actually (I hope) they pay more attention to the road,” she said.\xa0\nShe also hopes that the authorities will look into improving the traffic conditions along Bedok North Road, adding that parents have written to the authorities “countless times”.\xa0\nMost schools generally have “very strict” procedures for parents to comply with, said\xa0USE’s Mr Tan.\xa0\n“With every P1 cohort, there will be new parents coming to the school. And apparently, from all the facts that have surfaced so far, it seems like this vehicle was new to this morning drop-off phenomenon,” he added, referencing the incident on Tuesday morning.\nBut rules are there to be followed, he said, pointing to how the\xa0driver was not allowed to enter the school after cutting the queue. ""Imagine if you allow one to not follow the queue ... other parents (may) do the same.”\xa0\nFeedback from security officers in the union show that instances of rule-flouting are\xa0more common in the first two weeks of a new school term, said Mr Tan.\xa0\nIn his experience, “very rarely” are there “very egregious” altercations between parents and security officers at schools. Such\xa0cases are referred to the police immediately, he said.\xa0\nIn closing, however, he gave short shrift to drivers who break obvious traffic rules.\n""As long as you’re a motorist, you’re expected to know (the rules),” he said.\xa0\n“To tell you not to drive against the flow of traffic, I think there’s no necessity for anyone to have to remind anyone not to do so.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     transport ']}"

      Uganda's schools reopen, ending world's longest lockdown 
  </h1>, 'text': 'KAMPALA, Uganda:\xa0Uganda\'s schools reopened to students on Monday (Jan 10), ending the world\'s longest school disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe reopening caused traffic congestion in some areas of the capital, Kampala, and students can be seen carrying their mattresses in the streets, a back-to-boarding school phenomenon not witnessed here for nearly two years.\nUganda’s schools have been fully or partially shut for more than 83 weeks, the world\'s longest disruption, according to figures from the UN\xa0cultural agency. The shutdown affected more than 10 million learners.\nThe East African country of 44 million people first shut down its schools in March 2020, shortly after the first COVID-19\xa0case was confirmed on the African continent.\nSome classes were reopened to students in Feb 2021, but a total lockdown was imposed again in June as the country faced its first major surge.\nFor many parents, the reopening was long overdue.\n“Inevitably, we have to open up schools,” said Felix Okot, the father of a 6-year-old kindergartner. “The future of our kids, the future of our nation, is at stake”.\nThe country\'s schools cannot “wait forever” for the pandemic\'s end, he warned.\nThe protracted school lockdown proved controversial in a country where measures aimed at stemming the spread of the virus were ignored by many.\nVaccine skepticism, even among health workers, remains a problem, with growing reports of fake COVID-19 vaccination cards sold in downtown Kampala.\nMany students returning to school are believed to have had no help during the lockdown.\nMost public schools, which serve the vast majority of children in Uganda, were unable to offer virtual schooling.\nThe Associated Press reported\xa0in November on students in a remote Ugandan town where weeds grew in classrooms and some students worked in a swamp as gold miners.\nSome critics pointed out that the government of President Yoweri Museveni, an authoritarian who has held power for 36 years and whose wife is the education minister, did little to support home-based learning.\nMuseveni justified the lockdown by insisting that infected students were a danger to their parents and others.\n“There are many things which can\'t be predicted right now. The turnout of students is unpredictable, the turnout of teachers is unpredictable,"" said Fagil Mandy, a former government inspector of schools now working as an independent consultant.\n“I am more worried that many children will not return to school for various reasons, including school fees”.\nMandy also noted concern that a virus outbreak “will spread very fast” in crowded schools, urging close monitoring by school administrators.\nWelcoming the reopening of Uganda\'s schools, Save the Children warned that “lost learning may lead to high dropout rates in the coming weeks without urgent action"", including what it described as catch-up clubs.\nThe aid group warned in a statement on Monday of a wave of dropouts “as returning students who have fallen behind in their learning fear they have no chance of catching up”.\nIt remains to be seen how long Uganda\'s schools will remain open, with an alarming rise in virus cases in recent days.\nIn the past week, health authorities have been reporting a daily positivity rate in excess of 10 per cent, up from virtually zero in December. Museveni has warned of a possible new lockdown if intensive care units reach 50 per cent occupancy.\nHoping for a smooth return to school, authorities waived any COVID-19 test requirements for students. An abridged curriculum also has been approved under an arrangement to automatically promote all students to the next class.\nUganda has received foreign support toward the reopening of schools.\nThe UN\xa0children\'s agency and the governments of the UK\xa0and Ireland announced financial support focusing on virus surveillance and the mental health of students and teachers in 40,000 schools.\nThey said their support was key for Uganda\'s school system to remain open.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Uganda ', '     education ', '     lockdown ']}"

      Singapore's autonomous universities 'committed' to safeguarding academic freedom: Maliki Osman
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore’s autonomous universities are committed to safeguarding academic freedom for their faculty and students, and their academics do not “shy away” from politically sensitive topics, said Second Minister for Education Maliki Osman on Monday (Jan 10).\nResponding to a question from Member of Parliament Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) about a recent\xa0survey on academic freedom in Singapore, Dr Maliki cautioned against generalising the findings as representative of all academics given the survey’s low response rate.\nThe Academic Freedom Survey 2021, published by AcademiaSG, found that faculty who worked on “politically sensitive” topics were more likely to feel constrained in their ability to research or engage the public compared to those who worked on other topics, among other findings.\nAcademia.sg is\xa0a website that was started in 2019 reflecting concerns by academics about the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).\xa0\nDr Maliki highlighted that the survey’s response rate was only about 10 per cent, with about 198 out of 2,061 contacted academics in the social sciences, humanities, business and law schools at Singapore’s autonomous universities replying to the survey.\nAmong those who responded, only a minority reported significant concerns about academic freedom in Singapore, he noted.\n“Our autonomous universities or AUs are committed to safeguarding academic freedom for their faculty and students,” Dr Maliki said.\n“Doing so has allowed them to attract top talent as well as create new knowledge, innovate and contribute to Singapore’s development over the past decades. The quality of education and research done by the AUs is also well regarded internationally.\n“I would therefore advise some caution in generalising the findings from the survey as representative of how all academics in Singapore feel.”\nAcademics in the autonomous universities have also been able to teach engage in discourse, research and publish on a wide range of topics including domestic politics, race, religion and gender issues, he said.\n“It would be unfair to our academics to assume that they self-censor or feel inhibited. The AUs’ work on Singapore studies is evidence that academics do not shy away from politically sensitive topics,” said Dr Maliki.\nHe added that the NUS Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences has a public listing of more than 8,000 Singapore-related publications, with more being added over time.\nDr Maliki cited titles such as\xa0""Is the People\'s Action Party here to stay?""\xa0and\xa0""Super-diversity and the biopolitics of migrant worker exclusion in Singapore""\xa0as work that contributes to\xa0""public discourse on governance and public policy and also informs teaching curriculum"".\nDr Maliki said that the Ministry of Education has also funded projects on topics that may be considered sensitive. He added that researchers in the autonomous universities also work with government agencies to study complex issues such as the integration of bi-national families in Singapore, coping strategies among low-income households and the development of racial attitudes during early childhood.\n“These projects in turn can be used or adapted as teaching materials for the students,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     university ', '     academic freedom ', '     education ', '     parliament ', '     Singapore Parliament ']}"

      'Currently no plans' to make COVID-19 vaccination compulsory for primary school, pre-school attendance: Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: There are “currently no plans” to make COVID-19 vaccination a requirement for physical attendance in pre-schools or primary schools, said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Jan 10).\xa0\nResponding to parliamentary questions about vaccination-differentiated safe management measures for children, Mr Chan said: “The focus at this time is to ensure our children are well-protected against COVID-19 as we begin vaccination for those aged five to 11 years.”\xa0\nThe Government has seen an “encouraging start” to the vaccination exercise for children, and will continue to work with parents to achieve a high vaccination rate so that as many school activities as possible can resume, he added.\xa0\n“The pace, extent and approach towards resuming these school activities would depend on various factors, including vaccination rates as well as the overall national posture.”\xa0\nSpeaking in Parliament, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung also said that there are “presently no plans” to introduce vaccination-differentiated safe management measures for children aged 12 and below in the community, and public, pre-school and school settings.\xa0\n“This is due to a combination of reasons, namely, children are less likely to develop severe illnesses when infected, and we want to preserve as much as possible universal access to holistic education for children,” he added.\xa0\nWhile Singapore has a “strict” system for vaccination-differentiated safe management measures in place, the rules are “much less strict” for children, said the Health Minister.\xa0\nResponding to a supplementary question from Member of Parliament Darryl David (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) on whether there will be vaccination-differentiated measures for activities beyond school, Mr Chan said that all measures will take the “prevailing national posture” into account.\n“We would very much like to have all our children be able to attend school and participate in as many of the core activities as much as possible. Now having said that, of course there are also activities beyond the core curriculum that may pose a higher risk to our students,” he added.\xa0\n“And for those higher-risk activities, we will then have to consider if differentiated measures will be required.”\xa0\nAdditional measures are currently in place for some activities at the secondary school, junior college or Millennia Institute level, said the Education Minister.\xa0\nUnder the pilot for team sports activities, only fully vaccinated students who have taken an onsite antigen rapid test will be allowed to participate in team sports in groups of up to 10, he said.\xa0\nStudents who participate in the band or the choir also have to take “some other additional measures” to keep themselves and fellow students safe, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“So this is how we will go about considering the participation of our students in some of these particularly higher-risk activities in the sense that they have a higher risk of transmission.\xa0\n“But as far as possible, we would like to have our students participate in the core curriculum all together because this adds to their overall social-emotional development beyond their academic development.”\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     MOE ', '     education ', '     parliament ', '     Singapore Parliament ']}"

      More industry exposure, flexible curriculum for polytechnic and ITE students among proposals by review panel
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students can look forward to gaining deeper industry exposure and having more flexible curriculums from this year.\xa0\nThese are some of the recommendations announced on Friday (Jan 7) by the committee reviewing opportunities and pathways in applied education.\nThe committee, led by Second Minister for Education Dr Maliki Osman, sought views from more than 2,000 stakeholders during the review, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a press release.\xa0\nThe institutions will progressively implement the recommendations from the 2022 academic year, it added.\nThe six recommendations cover three areas - enhancing students’ career readiness and resilience for the future economy, providing more flexibility and opportunities, as well as building stronger and more integrated support systems, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\n""With these recommendations, polytechnic\xa0and ITE students can look forward to a more fulfilling applied education journey and graduating with deeper industry-relevant skills and broader life skills, and be better primed for future opportunities,"" said Dr Maliki on Friday.\xa0\n""Students can also look forward to an improved student experience, with a stronger and more holistic support system.""\nITE’s Nitec and Higher Nitec programmes will be streamlined into a three-year pathway, starting with eight ITE courses from the 2022 intake, MOE said.\nAs previously announced in April 2021, students under this curriculum will go through a three-year course for a Higher Nitec qualification, instead of four years.\xa0\nThe committee also made recommendations to expand opportunities for industry exposure, which is a “key feature” of applied education, said the ministry.\nUnder ITE’s enhanced curricular structure, students will have two linked industry attachments, comprising a three-month stint in their second year and another in their third year for six months.\n“ITE will also engage employers to play a more active role in training students by appointing experienced workplace mentors,” the press release read.\xa0\nThe polytechnics will explore job shadowing and short job stints for students before their third year or during the school holidays, said MOE.\xa0\nThis is in addition to the current compulsory third-year internship for industry exposure.\xa0\n“The polytechnics and ITE recognise the importance of strong industry partnerships and will continue to engage industry partners to curate quality workplace exposure opportunities for students,” said MOE in its press release.\nFrom focus group discussions, MOE also received feedback that students would benefit from more opportunities to apply their skills in real-world settings, said the ministry at a briefing.\nThe polytechnics will also explore having a more flexible curriculum for selected students, such as those who are weaker academically, “who would benefit from spreading out their learning over more than three years”.\xa0\nThis means that students can take the same number of modules as others, but spread out over more semesters, up to five years.\xa0\nThere are also students today who have to take leave of absence from school to pursue entrepreneurial ventures or their sports interests, said MOE.\xa0\n“In the future, with this flexibility, they will be able to then continue with a more reduced modular load, so it’s less binary in that sense,” it added.\nCurrently, about 7 per cent of polytechnic students take up extended candidature, said MOE at the briefing.\xa0\nFees are paid on a semester basis. There will be no change to that and the government subsidies that students receive, said the ministry.\nAfter students complete six semesters and move on to the reduced modular load, the fees will be pro-rated, said the ministry.\xa0\nThe LifeSkills curriculum in polytechnics and ITE will also be revised, following the committee’s recommendation that it be strengthened.\xa0\n“In an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world, it is important that students are equipped with non-technical skills to navigate work and life,” said MOE at the briefing.\xa0\nAlthough the institutions already have a suite of programmes for students in areas like financial and digital literacy, feedback from engagement sessions indicate that there is scope for areas like self-awareness and resilience, said the ministry.\xa0\nWith students’ needs growing and becoming more complex as educational pathways are enhanced, the “ecosystem of support” also needs to be strengthened, said MOE.\xa0\nThe polytechnics and ITE will study how to enhance coordination of care and support so these students can receive what they need in a “more timely and effective manner”.\xa0\nThis would include coordination across academic staff, counsellors and financial aid offices, and with external community partners, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nTraining for personal tutors in the polytechnics and ITE will be rolled out to enhance pastoral care support for students.\xa0\nThese tutors will then be better equipped to identify early signs of distress and provide timely support, said MOE in the press release.\xa0\nThe institutions will also look into providing more dedicated time for the tutors to check in with students, it added.\nOn the committee’s recommendation, post-graduation career guidance will also be enhanced as students enter the workforce or pursue further studies, said the ministry.\nThe institutions will improve outreach to graduates who would benefit from more support, including students who have completed National Service.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     polytechnics ', '     ITE ']}"

      Commentary: Getting kids involved with preparing meals helps expand their vocabulary and appetite to learn more
  </h1>, 'text': 'PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania: Reading, writing and maths are often thought of as subjects that children learn in school.\nBut as a psychologist who researches how families can help support learning at home, I have found that children can also learn those skills through everyday tasks and chores.\nOne of these chores is preparing a meal – everything from grocery shopping and cooking to setting the table and enjoying the meal.\nOur research shows this is especially true for Latino families living in the US, many of whom are new to school systems in the US but for whom family dinners are a central part of the day.\nOur study included 248 Latino parents with kids in kindergarten. Some parents were given a set of tips – described below – on how to support children’s language, literacy and maths at home while selecting, preparing and eating food.\nParents were asked to use these tips for at least a month. Other parents were not given these tips.\nOur study found that the children whose parents were given these tips had larger vocabularies and more motivation to learn both one month after using the tips and even five months later.\nThese children were also better storytellers and were better able to control their behaviour and pay better attention compared with children whose parents were not given these tips.\nBusy parents in particular loved these tips because they were easy to follow and to fit into their regular schedules and did not require extra work or special materials.\nParents can ask their children to write out the grocery list before they go food shopping.\nWhile older children can use letters and numbers – for example, “2 cereal boxes, 10 bananas,” younger children might be encouraged to draw pictures of the items their parents want to buy or to use a combination of letters, numbers and pictures.\nA 2017 study found that the more parents let their children try out writing and reading letters and numbers on their own while making grocery lists, the better the children’s reading and maths skills are later.\nOnce back from the store, parents can ask children to use their grocery list to check whether the parents bought everything on the list. This is a great way for children to practise writing, reading and maths.\nGathering and mixing the ingredients for cooking or setting the table are opportunities for kids to practice maths in a playful and familiar way.\nWe found that practising maths with children during these household chores can also increase kids’ motivation to learn maths.\nAsk your child questions such as: Can you get five apples from the fridge? I added four cups of milk plus one more – how many are there in total? How many plates and forks do we need today?\nParents can use family dinner and other meals to encourage children to tell stories about their day. Telling stories about past or future events is a great way to build skills like vocabulary and story comprehension that are needed to read.\nTo get children to talk, parents should use lots of questions that require children to come up with their own answer rather than simply responding with a “yes” or a “no.”\nFor example: Who came with you to the party? Where did you go with Grandma? Why were you scared?\nTalking about topics that the child cares about can also help parents get children to talk.\nTo keep the child engaged in the conversation, parents can ask follow-up questions like “And then what happened?” They can also repeat back what the child says.\nFor example, if the child says “We went to the park,” the parent might respond “That’s right, we went to the park!” and use phrases such as “Uh-huh,” “Oh,” “I didn’t know that” and “Really?” to keep the conversation going.\nParents should feel free to talk in the language they know best. Many parents might feel pressured to speak in one language - such as English – at home because this is the language used in school.\nHowever, when parents speak in the language they are most familiar with, they are better able to express their thoughts and feelings while also preserving their culture.\nSpeaking a native language at home is not detrimental to children’s learning.\nWhen children have strong foundations in one language – such as Spanish – they can use that knowledge as a building block for learning a second language – such as English.\nOur research is based primarily on Latino families, who place particular value on family meals.\nLatino families tend to eat together more often than families from other ethnicities. They are also more likely to cook at home and involve children in kitchen chores.\nHowever, these tips apply to all families who regularly cook, eat and shop for food together. And they can help busy parents support their young children’s learning without much added burden or spending.\nDiana Leyva is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh.

      A foundation programme for university and beyond
  </h1>, 'text': 'With over 40 years of experience in education, Ms Gandhimathi Sundrum’s depth of knowledge is well-matched by the breadth of her experience: She has taught in both public and private institutions in Singapore as well as in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.\nWhile she was teaching in Dubai, Ms Sundrum was impressed by the diverse perspectives of her international students, who hailed from a wide variety of races, worldviews and cultures.\n“It was a most enriching experience,” she recounted. “It broadened my own perspectives as to why people behaved the way they did, while exposing me to an array of cultural practices and norms.”\nShe cited her overseas stint as the reason why she decided to take up a position as a business lecturer at the Singapore campus of James Cook University (JCU), where she is now the head of department of JCU’s Pathways School (Foundation & Diploma Programmes). Launched in 2009, the eight-month-long, full-time Pre-University Foundation Programme is designed to make university education accessible and achievable for a wider range of students in the region with special entrance schemes.\nSaid Ms Sundrum: “I was drawn to JCU because it attracts a similarly diverse pool of students and allows me to continue to enhance my cultural knowledge and broaden my experiences while contributing meaningfully. Moreover, JCU is a highly reputable institution that provides high-quality education.”\nA CURRICULUM DESIGNED FOR SUCCESS\nAccording to Ms Sundrum, JCU’s Pre-University Foundation Programme has a specially designed curriculum that equips students with the necessary skills and orientation to seamlessly progress to JCU Band 1 undergraduate degree programmes in Business, Business and Environmental Science, Psychology and Information Technology.\nThe 10 subjects of the Foundation curriculum were developed with the requirements of the degree programmes in mind. They include key subjects such as Economics, Statistics and Information Technology.\n“Subjects that are more broadly oriented like Critical Thinking prepare students for academic performance in disciplined, self-directed thought,” added Ms Sundrum. “Students acquire skills to recognise and avoid common pitfalls in reasoning, and to state, explain and apply criteria for writing analytical and persuasive pieces. This combined approach, which focuses on building subject-specific competencies while inculcating broader skills such as critical thinking, prepares students with the necessary knowledge and capabilities for a smooth transition to the undergraduate programmes.”\nMs Sundrum acknowledged that transitioning from a traditional high-stakes exam-based system to a module-based Australian system that uses a variety of assessment methodologies – which JCU is known for – can be challenging for some students. The Pre-University Foundation Programme offers support where it is needed.\n“We often find that students might initially need more motivation and encouragement to speak up in class or submit their assignments,” she said. “We understand that it is a new system for them and make it a point to speak to all of them as individuals to express the importance of their submissions.”\nIn addition, students who are struggling to cope have access to JCU’s Learning Centre, where a specialist team of lecturers and student mentors is able to guide them in their studies.\nEMPOWERING STUDENTS HOLISTICALLY\n\nAs students in the Pre-University Foundation Programme come from a wide range of academic backgrounds, Ms Sundrum and her team – which she describes as “highly skilled and motivated” – work hard to get to know each student and understand their individual challenges.\n“My lecturers and I keep an eye out for those we feel might have difficulty keeping pace with the syllabus and take time out of our schedules to help them,” she explained. “We take pains to dispel the notion that preferring a slower academic pace is something to be ashamed of – I prefer to focus on the learning process rather than its outcomes. I believe that a programme that encourages students to learn to enjoy the academic process is the key to enhancing their success in tertiary education.”\nMs Sundrum added that as ardent supporters of mental health, she and her team make it a point to introduce students to the multitude of support options available at JCU. Occasionally, students open up to her and share how their mental health struggles cause difficulties with their studies.\n“My staff and I are always prepared to work closely with these students to set realistic and deliverable goals with regards to their learning. I strongly believe that this supportive process helps to alleviate anxieties associated with moving on to a degree programme and allows some of these students to tackle tertiary education with more confidence and relish,” she said.\nThe personalised support they receive under her care also helps them as they progress through their degree programmes. “We are proud that about 90 per cent of our Foundation students complete the degree programmes successfully.”\nSeeing her students graduate from the Pre-University Foundation Programme and move on to their undergraduate studies is her biggest reward, said Ms Gandhimathi.\nMs Sundrum advises students who are considering JCU’s Pre-University Foundation Programme to come with an open mind, in order to ready themselves for new subjects like Communication Across Cultures. She also had this to say: “Be motivated and take responsibility for your own learning. Be engaged in the learning and teaching process, be curious and ask questions, and don’t be shy to share your opinions or any issues you may have. We are here to help you.”\nVisit the James Cook University website for more information on the Pre-University Foundation Programme.\n', 'related_topics': ['     James Cook University ', '     education ', '     Students ']}"

      Mental health lessons to be progressively rolled out to primary, secondary and pre-university students over next 2 years
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mental health lessons will be progressively rolled out to students at the primary, secondary and pre-university levels over the next two years, announced Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Saturday (Dec 11).\xa0\nAs part of the refreshed character and citizenship education curriculum this year, mental health lessons have already been introduced to all lower secondary students.\xa0\n""We aim to equip students with the knowledge and skills to build their resilience,\xa0strengthen their mental well-being and resolve their challenges,"" said Mr Chan.\xa0\nSpeaking at the launch of an e-book collection of stories from youths of diverse backgrounds, Mr Chan gave an update on the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) efforts to strengthen students\' mental health following his ministerial statement in Parliament earlier this year.\xa0\n""Our youths face multiple pressures in their world today. They grapple with managing their social life while balancing their academic and professional pursuits,"" said Mr Chan.\xa0\n""They deal with expectations that are both self-imposed and imposed upon them\xa0by society and their families. They also need to learn to navigate and thrive in a competitive, high-performing environment.\xa0\n""On top of all this, our youths\' face unique challenges that the older generations have never experienced before,"" he added, citing how technology and social media have potentially fuelled feelings of anxiety and increased social pressure in many youths. \nBeyond mental health education lessons, all schools also have dedicated time and space at the start of every term for teachers to check in on students\' well-being since September, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nTeachers have been provided with ""practical pedagogical resources"" and tools to monitor and support students\' well-being, he added.\xa0\n""Lesson activities have also been designed to help teachers kick-start conversations with students to share and to discuss well-being issues, and to reinforce class commitment to look out for one another,"" said the Education Minister, adding that this will be a ""key feature"" in schools.\xa0\nA peer support structure is also in place at all schools, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n""We will continue to widen the outreach and deepen the capabilities of these\xa0peer-led self-help communities,"" he added.\xa0\nIn his ministerial statement in July following the incident at River Valley High School, Mr Chan had called for parent support groups to expand their role in helping parents whose children and family may need support.\xa0\nNow, 25 such groups are ""leading the charge"" in various ways, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n""Some are sharing resources and directing fellow parents to community helplines. Others are organising sessions to share parenting tips and advice on identifying signs of stresses and ways to seek help,"" he said.\xa0\nCiting the formation of the Interagency Taskforce for Mental Health and Well-being, he added that supporting youths in this area takes a whole-of-government approach. The taskforce is led by Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary.\n""This taskforce was set up to oversee mental health and well-being efforts on a national level, focusing on cross-cutting issues that require interagency collaborations,"" Mr Chan said.\xa0\nTogether, MOE and the Ministry of Social and Family Development lead a workstream that seeks to provide greater support to families, children and youths to enhance mental well-being.\xa0\n""Together with MOH (Ministry of Health) and\xa0other agencies, we are working on areas such as helping youths and parents to better access coordinated mental health services, partnering and empowering parents to strengthen and support their child\'s mental well-being, and harnessing the potential of digital technology and social media while addressing its negative impact on the mental well-being of our youths,"" said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThe issues that affect mental well-being are ""multi-faceted"", and all stakeholders need to work together to make a difference to the mental well-being of youths, said the Education Minister.\xa0\n""Together we must find ways to make the digital world safer for our youths so that they can fully harness the benefits of technology,"" he added.\xa0\nAs a start, this could include working with social media platforms to enhance online protection mechanisms for youths, exploring age verification requirements and addressing hurtful anonymous comments from users online.\xa0\nAs a society, Singapore also needs to ""find a way"" to ""broaden our definitions of success"".\xa0\n""This is a fundamental cultural change that we need to bring about. We need to let our children know that success is not based just on how well they do in examinations,"" said Mr Chan.\xa0\n""As a society, we want to embrace a diversity of talents that will strengthen our country\'s resilience.""\xa0\nMOE has made ""some structural shifts"" in recent years to reduce the overemphasis on academics as a measure of success, he added, noting the new Primary School Leaving Examination scoring system.\xa0\nThere is also education and career guidance in every school to help students discover their strengths and interests to guide their choice of future schools and careers.\xa0\n""But we still have a long way to go,” he said. “In spite of recent efforts, the prevailing skewed perspective remains that getting a good degree is the failproof way to secure a good future.""\xa0\nAnd that is why Singapore needs to remove the ""artificial and incomplete yardsticks of success prescribed by others”.\xa0\n""In its place, we must recognise and value the intrinsic worth of each and every\xa0youth and empower them to find their own path forward and to chart their own destiny,"" he added.\xa0\n""We want to strive for multiple pathways of success, not just multiple pathways to success, as if there is only one definition for success.\xa0\n""Ultimately, we want to see a culture where our young people learn to strive, not just to surpass others, but more importantly, to surpass themselves. This is the true benchmark they ought to have and it\xa0is within themselves.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     mental health ']}"

      Personalised worksheets, live classes and chats to power your child’s learning
  </h1>, 'text': 'The learning process can be tough for more than just students. Parents often find it difficult to motivate their young learners, assess how well their children understand the assigned academic concepts, or even help answer complicated homework questions.\xa0\nAmid new ways of learning, more families are turning to education technology, also known as edtech, to help their children improve. One such enterprise Geniebook, harnesses proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide an effective, engaging and personalised approach to learning. The fast-growing platform offers online learning for primary- and secondary-level English, Mathematics and Science.\xa0\nAccording to Mr Neo Zhizhong, chief executive officer and co-founder of Geniebook, in addition to encouraging independent self-directed learning, remote enrichment \xa0saves parents time and effort usually spent on shuttling children to and from physical learning centres. Amid the current climate, online learning also addresses safety concerns related to COVID-19.\xa0\n“With Geniebook, there is no more tedious manual marking of assessment books and explaining errors, since students receive instant solutions along with teachers’ feedback,” he said.\xa0\nGeniebook’s suite of three products – GenieSmart, GenieClass and GenieAsk – works in tandem to accelerate students’ learning by offering AI-personalised worksheets to identify strong and weak areas of understanding, live online classes that reinforce key concepts, and real-time teacher chats where students can seek clarification on schoolwork.\xa0\n“Based on internal data analysis, an estimated 90 per cent of Geniebook students showed improvement after completing eight worksheets,” said Mr Neo. “Geniebook instils confidence in students as they work on their strengths and weaknesses, while building mastery and positive learning habits over time. Gamification features like Geniebook’s learning rewards and leaderboards serve to encourage consistent practice, revision and participation.”\xa0\nONLINE LEARNING WITH GENIESMART, GENIECLASS AND GENIEASK\nGeniebook’s products for English, Mathematics and Science have each been carefully designed to provide an effective learning experience for students.\xa0\nGenieSmart, which creates personalised worksheets via AI for each learner, is aimed at ensuring targeted improvement. AI is used to identify learning capabilities and gaps before building a worksheet using the Ministry of Education (MOE)-aligned GenieSmart question bank, ensuring that students are given just the right amount of academic challenge. With GenieSmart, students are able to engage in focused revision, with instant answers marked by teachers.\xa0\n“Students are given the opportunity to improve their thought processes as they become more aware of why and how they learn. These deliberate actions on GenieSmart build up positive and sustainable learning habits that can be applied to other subjects,” explained Mr Neo. \xa0\nStudents who use Geniebook can also attend GenieClass, which comprises live online classes run by the company’s dedicated in-house teachers, many of whom have graduated from notable universities and have had experience teaching at MOE schools.\xa0\nThe lively classes are packed with demonstrations, animations and quizzes that serve to reinforce key academic concepts without being dull or overly complex.\xa0\nLearning can often be a lonely experience, especially during periods of home-based learning. To bring about a more interactive learning experience, Geniebook students have access to GenieAsk, a real-time teacher chat that is available from Monday to Friday between 3pm and 9pm.\xa0\nStudents can ask questions or seek help with homework not just from teachers but also their peers. Sessions are conducted in moderated learning communities that are grouped by academic level and subject and supervised by two teachers. Within the communities, students can take quizzes or trade study tips, making the learning experience more social and communal, which serves as a source of motivation.\xa0\nRecalling the wave of student appreciation during this year’s Teachers’ Day, Ms Alicia Cheong, Geniebook’s chief operating officer and co-founder, said: “With our GenieAsk communities, we see how some students jump at the opportunity to help others when they see a question. This is wonderful as each time they ‘teach’, it reinforces their learning. Of course, our teachers are always on hand to moderate and provide the final solutions.”\xa0\nADVANCED TECH AND EXPERIENCED EDUCATORS\nFounded in 2017, Geniebook comprises a team of experienced teachers, tech experts and designers who have spent years teaching and pioneering programmes to help students improve academically.\xa0\nIts proprietary AI software was developed with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and patented for education, with a bank of over 150,000 questions aligned to the current MOE syllabus in English, Mathematics and Science. \xa0\nWith the right assistance, Geniebook believes that students can grow into confident learners and succeed in education and beyond. Its unique, tech-driven approach is gaining ground with over 150,000 users regionally – a number that is growing by the day.\nMr Neo believes that the future of learning uses a blended approach and Geniebook aims to incorporate the best of technology and learning into its products. “When GenieSmart, GenieClass and our newest product GenieAsk are used together, they form an unstoppable flywheel of improvement made possible by technology and proven learning pedagogies, to boost students’ learning and improvement.”\xa0\nGet a complimentary academic Strengths Analysis by Geniebook.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     online learning ', '     online class ', '     Advertorial ']}"

      Enabling staff to be more
  </h1>, 'text': 'Ms Rita Lim, Ms Dawn Hu and Ms Wu Yingshan each has a different job scope and unique experiences within NTUC First Campus (NFC), but they all have something in common: A satisfying and rewarding career.\xa0 \nTheir workplace was recognised as one of the best companies to work for in Asia at The HR Asia Awards in 2019 and 2020. Scoring above the Singapore average across measures, the company was acknowledged as an organisation that creates purposeful job opportunities and one that encourages continual learning.\nWith four decades of experience in the early childhood care and education sector, NFC currently supports over 20,000 children and their families. Even as it creates a nurturing learning environment for young children during their formative years, the organisation places a strong emphasis on building an engaging and enjoyable workplace through various initiatives. Coupled with NFC’s vision that every child deserves equal opportunities to a good start in life, these efforts have kept the passion for work going strong for its team of staff comprising early childhood and corporate professionals.\nWORKING AS A FAMILY\n“There is no ‘I’ but more of ‘we’ moments,” Ms Hu, principal of The Little Skool-House At-Kent-Vale, said of the work culture at NFC. “Teachers support one another when they have difficulties in coping with a challenging child by sharing ideas and checking in with one another. Teachers share their teaching experiences and collaborate to find better ways to deliver lessons.”\nMs Hu first joined NFC as an English teacher in 2010. Interning at My First Skool and The Little Skool-House while pursuing a diploma course in early childhood education sealed her decision to join the organisation, she said. \n“The positive experiences I had with my mentors and centre principals led me to view NFC as a company that values the importance of working with parents, staff and children,” recalled Ms Hu, who shared\xa0that NFC’s work culture is collaborative and everyone works towards a common goal.\nEchoing this sentiment, Ms Wu, 40, an assistant director of marketing, said NFC functions like a “big family” where communication takes centre stage.\n“Such a culture has encouraged me to grow in a professional capacity because it sends the message that each of us is important. Staff feedback gathered through surveys and townhalls is taken seriously and is acted on once the results are collated,” Ms Hu said. \nALWAYS LEARNING AND GROWING\nMs Lim, 35, joined NFC as an English teacher in 2009 as she was drawn to its mission to make quality child development and care services accessible to working families, including those from disadvantage backgrounds.\n\xa0\nShe has since experienced an exciting, progressive and varied career. In 2013, she helmed My First Skool as a principal for six years before joining NFC’s headquarters, where she now works as a manager at the child support services department.\nPart of Ms Lim’s work involves managing a joint three-year research project with the National Institute of Education to study the effects of NFC’s Child Support Model, a testament to the wide range of professional development opportunities available for staff. The NFC Child Support Model is a three-pronged approach aimed at supporting the well-being and learning of children from low-income families and children with learning needs.\nMs Lim said: “When I first joined NFC, I never thought I would one day be doing research management. Initially, I was a bit worried about managing the project as I wasn’t sure if I was up to mark.\xa0However, I was given support and guidance as the project went along, which was very helpful.”\nFor Ms Hu, the exposure to various learning and training opportunities at every stage of her career has enabled her to grow professionally from a teacher to a centre principal.\n“I am always learning and growing. I have benefitted from many learning opportunities in Singapore and beyond,” she shared, citing a training stint in Hungary when she was a senior teacher.\n“I also attended overseas learning trips to Bali and Australia to gain more insights into sustainable education and nature pedagogy, which are in line with Early Childhood Development Agency’s focus on outdoor learning,” she added.\nHer appointment as a vice-principal years ago opened her eyes to her role in maintaining a positive work environment and influencing her colleagues to continually improve. To support her development as a leader, she joined the three-year Professional Development Programme (Leaders) with support from NFC. “I learnt to apply different leadership styles and engage in meaningful conversations with my colleagues. Through engaging in conversations with my team, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to align their personal goals to the centre’s,” Ms Hu explained. \n\xa0\nFor Ms Wu, having the opportunity to lead and champion new initiatives at work has been immensely fulfilling. Not only did she have the chance to pick up digital marketing skills, but she was also tasked to lead a digital marketing automation project to better engage different customer segments.\n“NFC has a conducive environment where staff can try new ideas, which leads to a greater sense of achievement and empowerment. Working with NFC has truly been a fulfilling journey for me,” said Ms Wu.\nPROMOTING HOLISTIC WELL-BEING\nBeyond work and professional skills, NFC also offers support for employees’ personal self-improvement and well-being.\nAs a working mother of three children aged seven months, five years and seven years, Ms Lim said NFC’s family-friendly policies have helped her maintain good work-life balance. Besides child care leave, the family care leave scheme allows her to care for family members when the need arises. \nIn the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, NFC stepped up efforts to make sure its staff were well taken care of. Ms Lim recounted how touched she was when her boss expressed concern after sensing she was pushing herself too hard during the circuit breaker period. “My boss was very understanding and encouraged me to take some days off to spend time with my children. I appreciate that she takes an interest in my family life and has the view that life is not only about work,” she said.\nDuring the circuit breaker, the company conducted exercise workshops to motivate staff to stay physically healthy as well as other free\xa0workshops to encourage staff to explore interests such as leather crafting. These efforts have continued even as the COVID-19 situation in Singapore stabilises. \nBesides workshops, NFC provides its staff with articles, videos and podcasts on physical and mental well-being through its website to equip them for better self-care. On top of that, employees can tap on the resources available in the employee portal and call the dedicated counselling hotline NFC had set up in conjunction with Singapore Counselling Centre to support their mental well-being.\n“Being a part of the NFC family is not just about work. The company looks into our physical well-being and finds ways to motivate us to stay healthy. This makes me feel treasured,” Ms Hu said.\nBe part of the NFC family and get more out of your early childhood career. \n', 'related_topics': ['     early childhood ', '     pre-school ', '     education ', '     career development ']}"

      How a creative soul sharpened her mind for business
  </h1>, 'text': ""Throughout her childhood, Ms Bella Han was – in her words – “always the most artistic person in the classroom”.\nHowever, when it was time for tertiary education, she found that studying design did not suit her at all. In addition, she was uncertain if she would be able to make a living with her art. With the support of her parents, she left her native Taiwan for Singapore, where she completed a diploma in business marketing before enrolling in the Singapore campus of James Cook University (JCU) in 2017.\n“Every industry, every brand and every product needs marketing,” she said of her decision to take up a Bachelor of Business in Marketing at JCU. “When you understand marketing principles, it creates a shortcut for you.”\nJCU was a choice Ms Han arrived at after thorough research. One of the university’s pull factors is the unique JCU trimester system, which ensures that Ms Han was able to complete her degree in less than two years without compromising on the quality of her education.\n“I am career-oriented and having a degree from a university with a good reputation is important for landing a job in Singapore,” she said. “Moreover, JCU provides career-centric courses that get students ready for the workplace.”\nJCU recently became one of only four universities and business schools in Singapore to be accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Less than 6 per cent of the world’s tertiary institutions offering business degree programmes are AACSB-accredited.\nSKILLS TO SUCCEED IN THE WORKPLACE\n\nToday, Ms Han works for game developer and publisher Wargaming as a digital content creator for its multiple award-winning military online game World of Tanks. Her job requires both creativity and marketing savvy, as she works on videos, infographics, storytelling and memes aimed at driving user growth in the Asia market.\nAccording to Ms Han, the knowledge and skills she acquired at JCU have been immensely useful to her job. For one, the numerous opportunities to conduct presentations at her JCU classes taught her to organise her thoughts and speak confidently.\n“In addition, the Principles of Marketing and Consumer Behaviour courses have trained me to think efficiently for new projects,” she recounted. “They helped me hone my creativity, which is beneficial for marketing.”\nShe is also more confident with the non-creative aspects of her role. “Part of my job is to monitor social media platforms daily and there are a lot of numbers to track. After studying data analysis, the numbers on the screen are no longer intimidating, but fun to interpret.”\nMs Han didn’t stop learning once she stepped out of the classroom. She added: “My experience as vice-president of communication in the JCU student council added colour to my resume. Organising events at JCU was not only fun, but also improved my marketing and event planning skills.”\nA COMMUNITY TO BE INSPIRED BY\nBeyond the academic learning she acquired at JCU, it was the people who truly inspired Ms Han.\n“I still remember the Hospitality, Cultures and People course with Ms Virginia Wu,” she said. “Her accomplishments in the hospitality industry make her very competent in teaching – I could ask her not only about things in the textbook, but also about real workplace experiences.”\nFondly recalling that Ms Wu was always dressed elegantly in a neckerchief, Ms Han described how the lecturer taught students to always be disciplined and conscientious at work. “I respect her serious work attitude, and I still apply her teachings to my career now.”\nMs Han’s former schoolmates are also a source of inspiration and interest. “The international atmosphere at JCU helped me to broaden my network. Years after graduation, I still enjoy following my schoolmates on social media. It is fascinating to see their lives on the other side of the planet, working in different industries or running their own businesses. I know I can always learn something new from them and be constantly inspired. Without studying at JCU, I don’t think I could have built a diverse network in such a short period.”\nLooking back on her fulfilling time at JCU, Ms Han has some words of advice for those about to embark on their studies: “Practise building connections and growing your network at university. Talk to people; even small talk can be useful. You will always learn something new.”\nVisit\xa0JCU's Virtual Open House\xa0for more information on the Bachelor of Business programme.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     James Cook University ', '     education ', '     marketing ']}"

      All set for school merger: Pioneer Primary and Juying Primary mark new beginning
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With a 3km walk, a new school song, uniform and crest, students and staff from Pioneer Primary School and Juying Primary School marked the start of a new chapter on Thursday morning (Nov 25).\xa0\nThe two schools will merge from 2022, the first of nine pairs of schools that will do so\xa0as announced earlier this year.\xa0\xa0\nAbout 10 students from Pioneer Primary took a symbolic 30-minute walk from their current school building\xa0to the Juying Primary campus at about 8.30am.\nAccompanied by their teachers, the Pioneer Primary students met five Juying Primary students midway.\xa0\nTogether, they crossed the last stretch to where Juying Primary is located, at 31 Jurong West St 91, welcomed with drums and fanfare.\xa0\nThis is where the merged school will be located until it moves to the new\xa0Tengah district from 2025, becoming the first primary school there.\xa0\nWhile it will be known as Pioneer Primary School, it will retain Juying as its Chinese name.\xa0\nThe current Pioneer Primary campus at 23 Jurong West Street 81 will make way for the Jurong Region Line.\xa0\n“I feel kind of sad because I’ve been there four years, seeing that the school has grown from strength to strength and they did very well in many aspects. We will miss it, it’s very spacious and airy,” said principal\xa0Loke Wai Ling, who will lead the new school.\xa0\n“And we will miss the food also because Pioneer Primary is next to Gek Poh market,” she added with a chuckle.\xa0\n“But I think we know why we need to merge, and we know that the JRL (Jurong Region Line) has to cut through it. So, things have to move on.”\xa0\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) announced in April that four pairs of primary schools and five pairs of secondary schools will be merged between 2022 and 2024.\xa0\nSome schools have seen falling enrolment due to declining birth rates and changing demographics in housing estates, although MOE also noted that there is rising demand for school places in newer estates with younger families.\nBoth Juying Primary and Pioneer Primary are located in mature housing areas, and enrolment in both schools has been “falling consistently” in recent years, MOE said in April.\xa0\nThe reasons for the merger are “sound”, and the Juying Primary team had expected the news, its principal Mrs Sroya Jaswant said, adding that it was “a matter of time”.\nThe enrolment rates at Juying Primary were falling “fast and furious” in recent years, she said.\xa0\n“Because you can’t possibly run a school with the enrolment dwindling to the point that you are unable to provide them with rich experiences. So actually, my staff and I, we were quite prepared for it,” she said.\xa0\n“But just that we didn’t expect it so soon, like within nine months or a year we’ll merge.”\xa0\nMrs Jaswant and the Juying Primary teachers welcome the merger because it will benefit students. Juying Primary, for instance, had about 10\xa0co-curricular activities. The new school will have 17.\nThere will be about 700 students from Pioneer Primary and more than 400 students from Juying Primary, bringing the total number of the students in the new school to about 1,100, said Mdm Loke. \xa0\nBoth schools did not have a Primary 1 intake this year, and the new school will only accept Primary 1 pupils after it moves to the new Tengah campus.\xa0\nMore than 80 staff members, a mix from both schools, will continue working at the new Pioneer Primary. Those who will not join the new school are either moving on to other schools or retiring.\xa0\nIn planning for the merger in the short nine months since it was announced, Mdm Loke recounted the hard work put in by staff and teachers of both schools.\xa0\xa0\n“We all know that we have to go over to the merged school, and we know that it\'s important to have this new identity,” she said.\xa0\n“Because we want to have that sense of belonging, so it\'s very important that we are able to share with the students and staff, this is the school that you\'re going to, it\'s something for you to look forward to. So with that in mind, I think we were all able to pull together.”\n“What really mattered to me was to ensure that the good work, the good programmes that we built upon would somehow carry on,” said Mrs Jaswant.\xa0\n“Of course maybe not in total, but at least part of these programmes can be married to some of the good programmes that Pioneer has, and the good work can continue.”\xa0\nThe two schools found common ground in their approach to integrating environmental sustainability in the curriculum and students’ learning, and the new school will have an applied learning programme centred around it.\xa0\nAll students from both schools also contributed a unique doodle, combined to make an art piece that hangs in the foyer at Juying Primary. Taking the form of a boat with its sails covered in doodles, the piece represents sailing towards a glorious future.\xa0\nStudents CNA spoke to on Thursday said they are looking forward to making new friends and\xa0the new CCAs. In particular, the Pioneer Primary students said they are excited about the new facilities in the Juying Primary campus, which is the bigger of the two.\xa0\nPrimary 5 student Vihaan Reddy Nalla said he was “quite sad” when he first learnt of the merger.\xa0\n“I spent five years at the Pioneer building, and then now it’s going to be demolished. And then some of my friends also, because of the distance, they have changed schools, so I was quite sad,” he added.\xa0\nBut as part of the student leaders executive committee of his school, he got the chance to meet his counterparts over Zoom a few months ago, to discuss the names of the four houses at\xa0the new school.\n“They were very friendly, very welcoming, and I was open to making new friends,” said Vihaan.\xa0\nThe students on the committee were excited to meet each other in person, and they were finally able to do so on Monday, while rehearsing for Thursday’s ceremony.\xa0\nWhen school reopens, there will also be\xa0week-long orientation activities for students\xa0to get to know each other.\nBut before that, students got a physical tour of the campus earlier in November.\nWith the bigger campus, Vihaan foresees getting lost in his first week there. The new students will get name tags stating their classes, so they can approach teachers for help in navigating the new campus.\xa0\n“I like the library because it’s very beautiful and I\'m excited for the new play areas, and the different eco gardens as well. Their school is way bigger compared to ours,” said Primary 5 Pioneer Primary student Ryhanna Suzaini.\xa0\nEven though she is excited about the new facilities, Ryhanna is sad to see one of her favourite teachers go.\xa0\n“\u200b\u200bI\'m kind of upset that they’re not coming. I only know one that is not coming to Juying, which really upsets me because she\'s my favourite teacher,” she said, speaking fondly of her social studies teacher.\xa0\nIt will be an adjustment for most students. Recalling the merger announcement this year, Mrs Jaswant said: “After a few days, as I talked to them, the first thing was, you mean (there are) more people coming into the school?\xa0\n“Their first thought was, it\'s like somebody is coming in to invade.”\xa0\nShe explained to the students that this meant they would have more new friends, which helped them become more accepting of the news.\xa0\n“There was a lot of talking to them, telling them how important it is to welcome people and to make them feel at home,” she added.\xa0\n“Because I told them, whatever it is, the school grounds are not going to change. It\'s going to be here. So when your new friends come in, we’ve got to be welcoming. We’ve got to show them around.”\xa0\nLike Ryhanna, some students were bothered by the fact that some of their teachers would not be moving to the new school with them, Mrs Jaswant noted.\xa0\n“That was quite easy to address because I shared with them the rationale as to why some teachers did not stay. It was because of the distance that they had to travel, and this was a good time to make the change so that they can meet the needs of their families too.\xa0\n“And when they saw it from that angle, they realised that there are reasons for these teachers to move on. It\'s not because they\'ve been asked to move or it\'s not because they don\'t care.”\xa0\nMrs Jaswant herself will be retiring after 10 years at Juying Primary. She plans to contribute in any way she can on a “part-time basis”.\xa0\n“My wish for the new school is that I hope that these cohorts of students that come in, they will embrace this sense of inclusivity. They will also enjoy the diversity because more people have come in,"" she said.\n“I want them to be inclusive about the diversity and thereby make good friends, learn from one another and as a new family, forge that family spirit and move forward.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      Commentary: After PSLE, the big headache is choosing a secondary school
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When the final paper for this year’s Primary School Leaving Examination\xa0(PSLE) was done and dusted, all 12-year-olds in Singapore and their parents did a little dance of joy.\xa0\nI was close to tears of joy after my son completed his. No more enrichment class expenses, no more chauffeuring to-and-fro his Chinese tutor and no more incessant reminders to get off his games and get on with his revision.\nThis batch will be the first group to go through a new aggregate system replacing the T-score in place all these years.\nThe intention is to move away from chasing every single mark\xa0and students are marked based purely on individual ability, instead of a bell curve.\nBut a new system brings uncertainties over where the cards will fall and this has some parents worried, especially those whose children are weak in one subject and unlikely to get a good band for it.\nSo now, the fretting begins on what secondary school to choose once results are in.\nOne common strategy for most parents begins when they choose a primary school for their children. We picked one with a secondary school affiliation because entry requirements are lower compared to a child trying to get into the same secondary school without affiliation.\nFor example, St Patrick’s School has an indicative cut-off point of 10 to 14 for non-affiliated primary school graduates to get into the Express programme. A student from an affiliated primary school (say St Stephen’s School) would only require 12 to 20.\nThere are about 27 affiliated secondary schools in Singapore so parents with children in this track will pray their kids make the cut-off points.\nThere is also the Direct School Admission\xa0(DSA) route which allow students to get “early entry” into a secondary school, even before they sit for the PSLE.\xa0 \nStudents apply based on their talent in sports, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)\xa0and specific academic areas, go for tests or auditions and are offered spots if they qualify. \nA friend of mine has a daughter who is talented in synchronised swimming, and she got two offers.\nThis year, there is an increase in the number of DSA applications and parents interviewed by the media say they would rather “chope” a place for their children instead of waiting for results and having to scramble for a school they are not sure about. \nFor those without an affiliation to rely on and are not using the DSA route, it is time for some strategising.\nStudents are given seven days from the release of PSLE results to shortlist six secondary schools in preferential order.\nTo give everyone a better idea of how to choose, the Ministry of Education (MOE) released the entry and cut-off points for all secondary schools in April based on simulated scores modelled on last year\'s PSLE scores.\nFor a school like Nanyang Girls’ High School, the projected Achievement Level (AL) is between 4 to 7 (non-affiliated), based on the new T-score system.\xa0\nThat means scoring at least 90 per cent for each of the four subjects. Obviously, the better the overall scores, the better the chance to enter the school of choice.\nIn that sense, how students are funnelled hasn’t changed. Those who do well, get their pick and those in the middle must think more carefully.\nMOE has said the sequence of choices is critical.\nAssuming all things being equal, the school will give the spots to students who selected them as their first choice (and qualify). \nThis is where it can get challenging for parents who wish for their children to go to a “good school”. In a way, they are working blind.\nSome of my friends tell me some parents call the school and inundate the administrators with questions of what their chances are. This is a pointless exercise because the system must wait for all the information to be sorted before anyone knows anything.\nThe best thing parents can do is to be realistic and work on how the child did during their prelim exams. \nBut heed some caution. Just as adults don’t want to be stuck in an unsuitable company, our children shouldn’t be forced into a school – after all, they are the ones who must go through the next four years while parents watch from the sidelines.\nYet it is not uncommon to hear of parents wanting very desperately to pick a\xa0“good\xa0school"" despite the child’s score being out of the suggested range. This idea of “let’s just try for first choice” isn’t prudent.\nI know of friends who tried and then failed – ignoring the fact that mathematically speaking, the sorting will already push your child out. Sticking to a score and choice within reasonable expectations works better.\nMy advice is to involve your kids in choosing a secondary school. Our children are no longer the same people we hovered over during their Primary 1 recess. At their age, they are far more aware of who they are and what they want.\nLook too at their personalities and their strengths.\xa0\nMOE’s Education and Career Guidance unit came up with a guidebook with checklists on how parents can set up conversations with their kids around this topic. \nEven if the child might be completely clueless on what they want in a secondary school, asking questions such as three positive words that describe them, the things they are most proud of and the types of activities they enjoy both in and out of school could provide a direction.\nSkillsFuture even has a Career Quest microsite showcasing a game helping children discover their career interests and values.\nSchools should be viewed holistically, based on the environment, their niche CCAs, culture, and style of learning. \nBut despite our best effort, all the information we get are still secondary sources. You cannot completely know if or how your kid will benefit from a school until they start their secondary school education.\nA friend’s daughter joined a well-known secondary school touting creativity as a core value. But she soon found out that the school was stricter than they let on and felt stifled – so everyone’s experience can be different too.\nFinally, don’t forget the distance between the school and home. Time spent on long commutes can be better spent on other more productive stuff.\nWherever your child is placed – whether in a top school of your choice, or a little-known neighbourhood school just two stops away from your HDB flat – what matters is how you support them in the next leg of their journey.\nAs a student, my cut-off points were not enough to get into the Express Stream for my first-choice secondary school. So I went to my second-choice school but struggled there too, having to repeat a year in Secondary 3.\nIt was a tough time but looking back at my journey, did the secondary school really decide the career path I would take or who I eventually became? \nOf course not. \nIt really isn’t about the school but the student’s individual’s ability to make the best of the deck of cards he or she has been dealt with.\nFor wherever they are placed, they will learn about the world, about themselves, friendships\xa0and the most important lesson of all – that life is what you make of it.\nAdrian Tan is the Future of Work Strategist at the\xa0Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) which aims to professionalise and strengthen the HR practice in Singapore and a father of four.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     PSLE ', '     Parenting ', '     Secondary 1 ']}"

      'A different element of stress', say parents of first batch of PSLE students under new scoring system
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Parents of this year\'s Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) cohort said on Wednesday (Nov 24) that the new scoring system is more beneficial for average students, but introduces a ""different element of stress"" for those aiming for grades at the top end of the Achievement Level (AL) band.\nThe PSLE results released on Wednesday showed that 98.4 per cent of students who sat for the exams this year will progress to secondary school, with a higher proportion of pupils qualifying for the Express course.\xa0\nThis is the first cohort of students under the new AL scoring system. Under the new system, PSLE students are given AL scores of 1 to 8 for each of their four subjects, with 1 being the best score and 8 the lowest.\xa0\nTheir overall score will be the sum of these ALs. The system produces 29 possible scores, compared to the previous T-score system, which has about 200 variations.\xa0\nIn announcing the new scoring system over the past few years, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has repeatedly said that the new system would make the PSLE scores less finely differentiated.\xa0\n“We made a deliberate shift away from the old T-score system so students do not chase the last mark. An obsessive over-emphasis on exam results is not healthy for the development of our children,” said MOE\'s director-general of education Mr Wong Siew Hoong on Wednesday.\xa0\nWhen asked about this, parents had mixed opinions about whether the new system would achieve this.\xa0\nMs Kanniakumari, whose youngest daughter sat for the exam this year, told CNA that her daughter was “really very stressed” after receiving her prelim results, leading up to the actual exams.\xa0\nThe mother-of-three noted that the top few\xa0AL bands have\xa0a narrower scoring range compared to lower AL bands, and that one mark could have a major impact on their overall aggregate score.\nFor example, a student who scores between 45 to 64 marks in a subject will receive an AL6. However, a student who scores 80 to 84 marks will receive an AL3, while a student who scores 85 to 89 marks will receive an AL2. Students have to score 90 marks to receive AL1.\nMs Kanniakumari’s daughter scored 83 marks for her mother tongue language prelim exams, and came home and told her that she had done badly.\xa0\n“I asked why, she said ‘I got an AL3, it’s not good\',” she added.\xa0\n“It did add a lot of stress to my daughter. She came home and she was really upset ... I was thinking 83 isn’t even bad, but she’s telling me she did badly.”\xa0\nThe bands ""just introduce a different element of stress,"" added Ms Kanniakumari.\nHer daughter, who eventually achieved an overall PSLE score of 6 for all subjects, is aiming to enter National Junior College, which has an indicative score range of 5 to 7.\nIf Ms Kanniakumari\'s daughter had scored AL3 for all four subjects, she would have obtained an overall PSLE score of 12, and missed the mark for the school she was aiming for.\xa0\n“The good thing is you won’t actually see someone being the top scorer. No one will say this person has scored 289, and this person is the best student. Anyone who does well will be getting 4 points,” said Ms Kanniakumari.\xa0\n“But this makes it more difficult to get into schools. More people aim for the schools with 4 to 6 points (indicative score range), and how are they going to differentiate them?”\nMr Adrian Wee’s daughter had a similar experience. At prelims, she was one mark away from dropping into the next band for two subjects.\xa0\n“I have a kid whose prelim results look like a 10, but in reality is two marks away from a 12, it tells me nothing,” he told CNA.\xa0\nFor students like her who might have been aiming for schools based on their prelim results, the potential two-point difference could be “calamitous”, he added.\xa0\n“To me, this whole thing just didn’t work. It led to greater anxiety. That’s the arbitrary nature of the banding system. I guess it’s the same for O-Levels, but with the four subjects as opposed to a six-subject aggregate, the difference is just much more stark,” said Mr Wee.\xa0\n“If my kid is trying to get into a school of her choice, and that cut-off is 10. And she’s sitting on 10, knowing that she needs to not lose a single mark, it’s tough and unnecessary.”\xa0\nThe new system is “an attempt to differentiate less between schools”, said Mr Wee.\xa0\n“In other words, it is an attempt to show that schools are comparable. Because a kid who has 9 points can choose to go to a school that’s 6 to 10, or choose to go to a school that takes 9 to 15. But that has always been the case, so I don’t know how this is supposed to help anybody,” he added.\xa0\nOther parents felt that the new scoring system benefited average students the most.\nWhen the new AL system was first announced, Mdm Gina Lai said she was “quite negative” about it and “wasn’t very happy”.\xa0\n“Why four subjects you have to break down into so much banding? But as we go along, and we understand the system more, actually, it benefits those that are average learners at this point in time, because some kids develop slower” she said.\xa0\nDescribing her daughter as an “average learner”, Mdm Lai said her child had a higher chance of getting a better score under the new system.\xa0\n“If based on the T-score, chances are she would 100 per cent (go) into the Normal stream,” she added.\xa0\nHer daughter ended up with a PSLE score of 17, but the family was preparing for a score of 19 to 20 based on her mid-year and prelim scores, said Mdm Lai.\xa0\n“With this new system, when we see the subjects, although her science and maths (scores) pulled her down, her language (scores) actually pulled her up,” she added.\xa0\nComparing the new system to a pyramid, she said: “The broad base, the bottom ones get to be escalated a little bit higher. The top will still remain on the top, but I think it benefits more of the average learners.”\xa0\nWhile her daughter’s overall score falls within the indicative range of the school she is aiming for, Ms Kanniakumari said her child is still uncertain about the competition she will face when applying for the school.\xa0\n“(In the previous system), there won’t be that many 250s, but there will be 250, 251, 252. But here now everybody is scoring 6, and we’re not only fighting with all the 6s, we’re also fighting with the 5s and the 4s who are going to apply. So it’s going to be tough for her.”\xa0\nWith the T-score system, it was “clear cut” when one student did better than another, she said. But with the new system, there’s “too many of them” in the same band.\xa0\n“And this being the first year, I think it might be a little chaotic as well, we’re the guinea pig batch.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     PSLE ', '     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      Bilingualism more ‘important, pertinent and salient’ than ever, says Education Minister
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In a fragmented world, bilingualism will be more “important, pertinent and salient than ever before”, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said on Wednesday (Nov 24).\nMr Chan was speaking at an event commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism. The fund, which was started by former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, has committed S$27 million for close to 200 projects over a decade.\nThese include workshops, performances, books and multimedia resources for pre-schoolers and young adults.\n“In a world that threatens to bifurcate or\xa0fragment according to competition or differences in ideology, cultures or system of governance, it is more important than ever for us to distinguish ourselves by being able to bridge these differences to connect with different parts of the world, with different people of different perspectives,” Mr Chan said.\nAs China, India and Southeast Asia grow in their economic, political and cultural heft, Singapore’s ability to be bilingual will help in understanding these different cultures, connecting with them and staying relevant to them, he added.\nHe said that bilingualism goes beyond the understanding of languages, offering Singaporeans “a set of shared values and perspectives to define our national identities”.\n“Otherwise, we may unwittingly be drawn into cultural contests happening in other parts of the world, or we may be influenced by external forces and lured into simply applying a plug-and-play model here without proper understanding of our own needs and context,” he said.\nHe emphasised that bilingualism “goes to the core” of Singaporeans’ national identity, with English as a common language for all, while staying connected to the rich and diverse heritage of different ethnicities through the bilingual policy.\n“Our commitment to bilingualism goes beyond encouraging and enabling our people to learn, use and master English as a working language together with our mother tongues,” he said.\n“It is a commitment to build our distinctive identity as Singaporeans who can understand and bridge differences across cultures, competing perspectives and contesting ideologies.”\nMr Chan concluded that being able to appreciate more than one language, bridge different perspectives and value systems is a great advantage, and that this should continue to “distinguish us as Singaporeans”.\nThe Education Minister also announced that the fund committee wants to explore and encourage more user-generated content that is accessible through more channels, and welcomes collaboration with more diverse partners to reach a wider community.\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered a pre-recorded message at the event.\xa0\n“The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism was set up by Mr Lee himself. He wholeheartedly believed that bilingualism was crucial to Singapore’s success, that every child should start bilingual learning early, and that the Fund would play a catalytic role in promoting a love for language learning,” he said.\n“Over the years, the fund has kept true to its vision and mission. It has supported many worthy projects … Let me congratulate the fund for 10 years of promoting bilingualism.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Chan Chun Sing ']}"

      PSLE results: 98.4% of students can progress to secondary school under new scoring system

An obsessive over-emphasis on exam results is not healthy for the development of our children.”\xa0\nThe course eligibility of this year’s Primary 6 cohort is “largely comparable” to that of the previous cohort under the T-score system, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a press release.\xa0\nA total of 39,119 Primary 6 students sat for the PSLE this year, with\xa098.4 per cent eligible to enter secondary school, said MOE.\nStudents eligible for the Express course made up 68.4 per cent of the cohort, with\xa018.9 per cent for the Normal (Academic) course\xa0and 11.1 per cent for the Normal (Technical) course.\xa0\nA larger proportion of students in 2021 made it to the\xa0Express course, compared to 66.3 per cent in 2020. For the Normal (Academic) course, the number of students eligible fell from last year's 21.2 per cent.\xa0\nThis decrease corresponds with the “slightly higher” proportion of students qualifying for the Express course, said MOE at the briefing.\xa0\nStudents with a PSLE score between 4 and 20 are eligible for the Express course.\xa0\nStudents who receive a score of 21 or 22 are offered an option between the Express course and Normal (Academic) course, while those with scores of 23 or 24 are eligible for the Normal (Academic) course.\xa0\nThis year, 11.1 per cent of students are eligible for the Normal (Technical) course, similar to last year’s 11 per cent.\xa0\nStudents with a PSLE score of 25 are offered an option between the Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) courses. Those who scored between 26 and 30 and achieved AL7 or better in English and Mathematics\xa0are eligible for the Normal (Technical) course.\xa0\nAbout 65 per cent of students who qualified for the Normal courses are eligible to take at least one subject at a more demanding level, an increase from 47 per cent of students in the Normal courses in the 2021 cohort.\xa0\nThis is due to the change in the subject-based banding eligibility criteria under the achievement level system, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nUnder the new AL scoring system, students in the Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) courses can take subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 1, depending on their AL scores for the individual subjects.\xa0\nIf they score AL5 or below for a certain subject, they have the option to take that subject in secondary school at the Express level.\xa0\nCandidates who did not qualify for entry to secondary school can choose to retake the PSLE next year, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nThey can also apply to Assumption Pathway School and NorthLight School, which offer programmes with a more “experiential and hands-on learning” approach, with a recommendation from their primary school principal, said MOE.\xa0\nSimilar to last year’s proceedings, PSLE candidates received their results in their classrooms, instead of as a cohort in the school hall like in previous years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMOE released the indicative score range of every secondary school in April this year, which serves as a “starting point” for students and parents in choosing the secondary schools to apply for.\xa0\nThese are the scores of the first and last student admitted into each school under the new scoring system. The score of the last student would be the cut-off point for that school.\nStudents eligible for secondary school can apply for their choices on the MOE Secondary 1 posting website\xa0from 11.30am on Wednesday to 3pm on Nov 30, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nThe Secondary 1 posting results will be released between Dec 22 and 24.\xa0\n“The new AL scoring system means students have a wider range of secondary schools to choose\xa0from, as schools will be less differentiated by cut-off points,” said Mr Wong.\xa0\n“Do consider the schools' distinctive programmes, the co-curricular activities, their ethos, culture, and of course the student's daily commute to and from school.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     PSLE ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     education ']}"

      ‘Radical’ suggestions to level the playing field in Primary 1 registration
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Some parents prefer a school based on its perceived academic prowess; for others, based on its programmes and values. But it is almost always the same few schools that are hotly contested during the Primary 1 registration process.\nEven with the changes announced recently to make schools more accessible to all, the framework can be fairer, believes Jason Tan, an associate professor in policy, curriculum and leadership at the National Institute of Education.\n“Fair means that everyone gets a more level playing field. There’s less time and energy spent strategising by parents,” he told the programme Talking Point.\nThe changes announced in September, which will kick in next year, combines Phase 2A1 with 2A2 — which cover alumni priority — and doubles the places reserved for Phase 2C, the category open to all.\nBut alumni privilege or having a parent who is a member of a school advisory and management committee, for example, are “inherited” parental privileges that should be removed, said Tan.\nHe thinks this also applies to children whose parents are staff members of a school. “Some might argue it’s similar to having a sibling studying in the school — it’s convenient for this particular group of parents,” he said. “If you think of this as a kind of employment perk, we should say no to this.”\nHe would keep Phase 2A only for children from a Ministry of Education (MOE) Kindergarten affiliated to a school, because this criterion “doesn’t privilege any particular group of parents” and since these MOE Kindergartens are “affiliated to non-elite primary schools”.\nWATCH: Primary school registration — can it be fairer for all? (22:53)\nAs for Phase 2B, for children of a parent who volunteers in a school or is an active community leader, he noted that “not every parent has the time or the resources to be a volunteer”.\nPhase 2B is also for members of a church or clan affiliated to a school, which he said is for a minority of schools, whereas Primary 1 registration criteria should be “consistent” across all the schools.\n“The entire primary school registration exercise is trying to accomplish too many competing objectives,” he said, citing the building of ties with alumni, the church or clan, perks for parents working or volunteering in the school and community leadership.\nIt would “probably be much fairer … in terms of opening up access” if these groups compete for registration in Phase 2C along with other parents, he argued.\nThe Primary 1 registration process also can seem complex to some parents. In a survey commissioned by Talking Point, 48 per cent of 210 parents say they find the process confusing.\nAbout 54 per cent are anxious that their child cannot get into their preferred school, especially parents with pre-school children only: 66 per cent of them feel anxious compared to parents with primary school children already (43 per cent).\nThe competition can be intense, and Tan is not the only one concerned about accessibility. Cheung Hoi Shan, an assistant professor of psychology at the Yale-National University of Singapore College, believes the registration process perpetuates educational inequalities.\nWhile every school has adequate facilities, and teaching quality is not a problem since teachers are centrally deployed, she said the more popular schools have “stronger alumni”, who can better support the pupils in “diverse activities”.\n“There’ll be also differences in … the kind of social capital (students) bring with them. So that in itself is quite important in tipping the balance, because it’s also about who you hang out with in school,” she added. “And some schools are more capable in attracting a certain profile of students.\n“The way that our registration system was organised at some of the phases really served to benefit families with resources.”\nParent volunteers and community leaders are one group. Among alumni, however, she noted that the recent changes removed the distinction between parents who are “able to pay an alumni association fee” and those who cannot afford it — they will all be alumni by default.\n“That’s great because it also serves to make the originally very complicated system less complicated,” she said.\nIt is also important, she noted, that 40 places instead of 20\xa0will now be reserved for Phase 2C, which is open to all children who did not get a place in the earlier phases.\nThe change comes after years of increasing demand at popular schools and more children not getting into a school near home.\nIn 2017, only Nanyang Primary had 20 places in Phase 2C — while all other schools had 25 or more — cited parenting forum KiasuParents co-founder William Toh.\nThis year, six schools including Nanyang Primary had only 20 places, and five schools had 21 places left, he pointed out.\nA school like Northland Primary, in the middle of a housing estate in Yishun, had 6.82 applicants per vacancy in Phase 2C this year, up from 3.92 applicants per vacancy in 2017, he noted.\nThe school had one of the top three pupils in the 2006 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), which is why Toh thinks it is so oversubscribed and must choose pupils by ballot.\n“MOE has stopped publishing PSLE results (of top scorers — since 2012), so most parents are dependent on hearsay,” he said.\n“Despite the MOE’s attempts … over the last 10 years, for example, we see that the same schools keep appearing as the most popular schools.”\nWhile Toh thinks parents will “most likely” choose a school that will give their children the “highest chance” of doing well academically, parents themselves do not seem to consider a school’s PSLE performance as a top-five factor.\nFrom the Talking Point survey, their most common consideration factors are whether the school has a wide range of programmes and co-curricular activities as well as the distance to the school.\nAbout 56 per cent agree that every school is a good school. Whichever their choice, however, the vast majority (81 per cent) have done or signed up for activities to increase their children’s chances of entering that school.\nBesides those who volunteer or join the alumni, church or clan group, 31 per cent of parents say they have bought or rented a property near the school or would do so.\nTake, for example, the “Teos”, whose first child was born in the year of the dragon, and their second was an SG50 baby. The number of children competing for places in primary school was higher than average in both cohorts.\nThe parents, who wished to remain anonymous, were former pupils at Catholic High School (Primary) and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School (SCGS) respectively.\n“Being in that alumni phase, we thought that we’d be quite comfortable. And then … our son didn’t get into the school. That’s when our whole world basically collapsed,” said the father.\nFor the next phase, 2B, the parents looked at renting a place within the one-kilometre radius, “so that it’d be a shoo-in”.\n“But we were still contemplating between Catholic High and (another) school. We got rental agreements in place for two separate locations so on the day itself we could decide which school our son should go for,” recounted the father.\nWith a rented apartment, the boy secured a place at the other school in Phase 2B. He eventually entered his father’s alma mater after a pupil dropped out ahead of the school year.\nHis sister got into SCGS in Phase 2A this year. “Traditionally, my school isn’t as crazy popular as his school,” said the mother.\n“We did contemplate having to move and to rent another place. But looking at the past figures and the population census, it was quite safe.”\nThey spent S$20,000 on property rental and S$605 on alumni fees. “We did think like, ‘Wow, we did so much.’ But when we went to talk to other people, we realised that we weren’t the only ones,” she added.\n“There are schools that are deemed better than others, so I feel that most parents, if they have the means, would still choose to send their child to a good school.”\nAs home-school distance is still a feature of the registration process — except in Phase 1, for siblings — Cheung questions whether schools are accessible to more people even with more places in Phase 2C.\n“Parents with the means to buy a home within one kilometre would want to buy an additional layer of insurance,” she said. “They could apply for Phase 2A; if they don’t get it, they’d try 2C.”\nThis calls for a rethink of the proximity factor, according to Tan, who noted that “some of the more popular primary schools aren’t exactly distributed evenly across Singapore”. He cited schools in Bukit Timah, an area “dominated by upper-class housing”.\n“So why don’t we think beyond the confines of one or two kilometres and draw a wider net?” he suggested.\nBy wider, he means clustering towns like Bukit Timah, Bukit Merah, Clementi and Queenstown together, or Sembawang, Woodlands and Yishun as one cluster\xa0or Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Sengkang and Serangoon as another cluster.\nThis would require in-depth study, he added, as there are many factors to consider, such as the number of school-going children and types of schools in those areas.\nWhile this may go against the idea of going to a school in one’s neighbourhood, he doubts that all parents are\xa0“dead set on getting their child into a branded primary school”.\n“This is to provide a greater chance of access,” he said.\nWATCH:\xa0Asia First encore: Talking Point discusses parents’ efforts to get children into popular schools (7:09)\nTo parents who may feel that what he is suggesting is “radical”, as Talking Point host Steven Chia put it, Tan acknowledged that there may never be a system that does not privilege a particular group of parents.\n“We’re not trying to make everyone happy,” he said. “There’s always, I guess, that tricky business of weighing up pros and cons … I don’t think any country in the world has gotten it right.”\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      Commentary: Parents and students are anxious over the release of the PSLE results. So are teachers
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Thousands of parents and students are anxiously awaiting the release of this year’s Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results due today. \nWhile Singaporeans are used to this annual rite of passage, how many pause to consider how teachers feel?\nTeachers who have been preparing students for the PSLE are probably just as jittery too. Their students’ results in this high-stakes examination will determine their eligibility for a variety of secondary schools, academic programmes and subject bands. \nEmotions, normally running high on the day the results are released, have been exacerbated by the widespread effects of the pandemic.\nThere is nervousness each year about the release of the PSLE results, when they can feel like a report on teachers’ effectiveness in examination preparation. \nBut teachers of this year’s PSLE cohort have had an especially trying time amid the turbulence engendered by the pandemic on school life.\nThey and their students, along with the students’ parents, have endured almost two years of disruption to pre-COVID school routines.\nEducation Minister Chan Chun Sing recently announced in Parliament that teachers’ workloads had more than doubled during the pandemic. Teachers had to juggle the work of preparing their students for the PSLE along with additional COVID-related duties.\nTeachers had to assume a multiplicity of roles. One is that of a healthcare worker guiding students through the observance of safe management measures.\nThese measures, both within and outside of schools, along with the curtailment of co-curricular activities, likely had adverse effects on students’ peer socialisation.\nPrimary schools have been more badly affected than secondary schools and pre-university institutions by the scaling back of co-curricular activities as most students were unvaccinated.\nConsequently, a key focus for teachers has been the monitoring of students’ mental and emotional well-being, especially in the lead-up to this major national examination. \nA second role that has preoccupied teachers is that of being healthcare ambassadors.\nNot only have they been contact tracing frontliners, they have also had to keep abreast of health protocols for the PSLE and communicate them to students and parents, while supporting the work of colleagues who may have been issued quarantine orders.\nThird, teachers had to adapt to the implementation of home-based learning (HBL). They had to become adept at preparing alternate sets of face-to-face and online learning materials.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) has acknowledged that HBL is an inadequate substitute for face-to-face lessons in school.\nTeachers had to engage in what it terms “curriculum recovery”, or the process of re-teaching topics covered during HBL, in a bid to catch up with the pace of curriculum coverage.\nThis despite “common last topics” being removed from the PSLE, as the MOE did last year, to relieve the stress on students, parents and teachers. \nAt the same time, teachers had to play the role of educational equity advocates by ensuring the learning needs of students from financially disadvantaged or emotionally vulnerable families are not unduly compromised.\nComplicating the situation even further for this year’s PSLE cohort is the fact that they are the first to experience the revised PSLE scoring system. \nTouted by the MOE as easing the pressure brought about by peer competition, this reform has yet to allay the apprehension felt by some students and parents, and teachers had to play a major role as ambassadors in explaining the scoring system.\nAmong teachers’ concerns will be how students will react to their examination results. A key focus will be dealing with students whose results fall short of their own, or their parents’, expectations. \nAnother will be how to celebrate with students who have done well without upsetting those who have not. In addition, teachers will be thinking of how to respond to parents’ varied emotions.\nIt is tricky for teachers to navigate these complex emotions with a degree of sensitivity, bearing in mind, for instance, that examination results that appear commendable to them might be viewed disappointingly by students and parents.\nAfter students have received their results, some may approach their teachers for advice on the choice of a secondary school. \nAs significant adults in their students’ lives for the better part of this year, and even longer in some instances, teachers are well-placed to offer suggestions to both parents and students on how to make well-informed decisions.\nHowever, as in the case of examination results, teachers need a similar degree of tact in respecting parents’ and students’ choices.\nTeachers’ little gestures, such as words of comfort or encouragement at these sorts of significant moments in students’ lives, may make all the difference in the world to students, and may stay in students’ memories long after they have graduated.\nTeachers’ anxieties surrounding the release of the examination results are understandable. This event represents the culmination of their investment in a great deal of work, not only in terms of lesson preparation, but also in terms of providing emotional support for their students. \nTheir hopes and dreams for their students’ futures have to finally face the reality of the examination results and this national sorting exercise.\nIf there is one thing that the past two years has taught us, it is the vital importance of teachers in students’ lives and the need to support their overall well-being.\nTeachers have been an integral part of their students’ lives. The arduous task of examination preparation has been made all the more challenging because of the numerous disruptions to school life. \nYet teachers have had to soldier on in order to maintain some semblance of normality for themselves and for their students amid abnormal times. \nThe issue of teachers’ mental well-being and the danger of burnout has been the subject of recent media coverage. The MOE has pledged its commitment to supporting teachers’ well-being.\nBut just as crucial today as PSLE results go out is how much students and parents extend understanding and appreciation towards teachers, which will undoubtedly be welcomed. \nIt is worth remembering that in the course of preparing their students for the PSLE, teachers also had to keep themselves healthy, while extending care to their own family members, all of whom have been affected by the pandemic in one way or another.\nJason Tan is an associate professor at the National Institute of Education.\n', 'related_topics': ['     PSLE ', '     education ', '     Chan Chun Sing ', '     Stress ', '     Anxiety ', '     school ', '     Students ', '     parents ']}"

      From Olympic glory to fleeing prostitution, these youths were realising their dreams. Now all hope may be lost
  </h1>, 'text': ""NEW DELHI: Brothers Sunil and Neeraj Chauhan were on their way to sporting glory — boxing for Sunil, 23, and archery for Neeraj, 19. It was what their father, Akshaylal Chauhan, had worked so hard for.\nAs a cook in a stadium in Meerut, India’s “sports city” in its most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, Akshaylal earned 12,000 rupees (S$220) a month.\nThe 51-year-old’s income from cooking for sportsmen and officials was barely enough to support his wife and three sons. So on most nights, he cooked at weddings and parties to earn extra. He worked up to 20 hours a day to help Sunil and Neeraj train and excel in sport.\nThe brothers progressed steadily over the years, winning medals at the junior, state and national levels. Neeraj, for instance, won silver in the 50-metre event in the Senior Archery Championship 2018. Sunil, meanwhile, won gold early last year at the Khelo India University Games, a national multi-sport event.\nThen COVID-19 struck, and their father lost his job when the stadium canteen closed during the lockdown.\n“First, the lockdown was for 12 days. We thought we’d manage somehow,” he told the programme Insight.\nBut the pandemic was only starting to play out. The family soon became desperate, and the brothers needed to keep up with practice. Akshaylal started a vegetable stall but struggled to provide two meals a day for the family.\nSunil and Neeraj had to stop training and help their father out.\nA lifeline came in October last year when the then sports minister, Kiren Rijiju, announced that owing to their “acute financial crisis”, the brothers would receive 500,000 rupees each under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay National Welfare Fund for Sportspersons.\nThis is where the brothers’ stories diverge.\nNeeraj, who completed Class 12 or the equivalent of A levels, has since found a job with the Indian paramilitary force known as the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. This month, he was declared the best male archer at the All India Police Archery Championship — part of the All India Police Games, the first to be held post-COVID.\nSunil, on the other hand, has not found a job that will allow him to continue training. He said the government grant the brothers had received last year was spent on sports equipment and family expenses following the lockdown. His dream of competing in the Olympics is almost over, he said.\n“To be an international boxer, one needs to strictly follow a proper diet, training and rest protocols … designed by a personal coach. Boxing is a difficult sport where injuries to the knee and shoulder are common, and the reason is not following a proper diet.\n“Without training, how can I perform in any tournament?” said the first-year college student, who is pursuing an arts degree and used to train for 10 hours a day. “Everything is finished.”\nTenacity is what some Indian youths have in spades, but that may not be enough in the face of the pandemic. And sporting dreams are not all that have been snuffed out.\nElsewhere in Uttar Pradesh, 20-year-old Avnish Kumar seemed to have beaten the odds in his village of Narayanpur when he aced his Class 12 exams and was admitted to the prestigious Delhi University to pursue an honours degree in history.\nHis achievement was remarkable, given that the literacy rate in his village is only about 60 per cent. But COVID-19 forced him to choose between family and getting an education to fulfil his ambition to become a civil servant.\nAfter his father caught the coronavirus and died in June, he dropped out of college and returned home. He set up a shack to sell some items to earn a few rupees. He has also put his academic skills to good use, teaching village children in the afternoons.\nHe wants his six young brothers and sisters to continue in school, but they need money to pay their fees. Since the pandemic, one of his brothers has already left school to look for a job, and a sister has also dropped out.\n“If I focus on my education, then my family will become unstable. If I leave my family for my education, then the family will be destroyed,” he said.\n“When I took admission to Delhi University, I had just one aim: To crack the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) examinations. I wanted to give my 100 per cent … But first, Father’s health deteriorated. Then the pandemic came, and my education was interrupted. Now I think it’s interrupted forever.”\nCOVID-19 has killed over 464,000 people in India, and its second wave from April to June left more orphans in its wake than the first, child rights activists have noted.\nSince then, India has had relative success in vaccinating its population of nearly 1.4 billion. It has administered over 1.14 billion doses, and 28 per cent of its population has been fully vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nBut according to anti-poverty charity Oxfam India’s chief executive Amitabh Behar, “beyond the vaccines, we’ve really not been able to handle the situation well”.\n“Apart from the vaccination, we’ve really fumbled all around,” he said.\nObservers also note that lockdowns and prolonged school closures have caused children to lose what they have learnt before. “It’s not just that they’ve lost these one or two years, but that they’ve gone back further,” said Amit Basole, an associate professor of economics at Azim Premji University.\n“Children who were, let’s say, in grade three or four at the beginning of the pandemic should now be in grade five or six. But in learning terms, they may actually be back to level two.”\nThis, said Behar, is a “massive crisis”. Many have likened the pandemic to an X-ray that has highlighted the country’s cleavages, inequality and poor health infrastructure, he added.\nWATCH:\xa0What COVID-19 Has Cost India's Youth: Of Lost Hopes & Broken Dreams (47:38)\nAmong the vulnerable members of Indian society is 19-year-old Rani (not her real name), born into a community where girls are forced into prostitution when they are in their early teens. Her mother and a sister are sex workers, but Rani resisted and ran away to Delhi with her younger sister.\nThe two girls managed to get into a school, and Rani, whose name has been withheld to protect her identity, performed well in her senior secondary school leaving exams. Then the hostel where she and her sister lived closed owing to the pandemic, and they had to return to their hometown.\nThey discovered that their mother had “sold everything”.\n“She said, ‘You don’t need to contact me again. To me, you all are dead,’” Rani recounted.\nWith their studies disrupted, the sisters are being put up by friends and civil society activists in Delhi and managing to avoid the path taken by their mother — for now.\n“We thought that after completing our education, we’d do something and secure our future,” Rani said. “Everything was so useless after lockdown. There was no motive in life. What to do? We were totally blank.”\nBehar said he hears these “heart-wrenching stories” from his Oxfam India colleagues “pretty much on a daily basis”.\nSex predators also turn up at red-light districts to tell mothers to give up their children in exchange for food, said Ruchira Gupta, founding president of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an organisation working to end sex trafficking.\n“They’d sometimes say, ‘We don’t want physical sex, but we want to use them to make porn videos, and it’s not going to harm the child … Why don’t you let us have your daughter? She’s doing nothing at home,’” said Gupta, who is also a professor at New York University.\nThe Indian government has announced socio-economic measures for youths, such as the PM CARES for Children scheme, which supports the education of children who have lost both parents or their surviving parent or legal guardian to COVID-19.\n“We’re absolutely confident that the younger generation will be put on a track where they become a citizen who can contribute both to the nation as well as to the globe,” said Member of Parliament Syed Zafar Islam, a national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.\nBut Gupta said “government programmes aren’t even reaching the last girl” — referring to the most disadvantaged children, such as teenage girls who are poor and very often from an oppressed caste.\nTabassum Jahan, 16, who lost her father, the sole breadwinner, to COVID-19 in May, has this plea to the authorities: “Help me and my younger siblings to continue our education.”\nAs the eldest of six girls and a boy, who is eight, she had to quit school to help the family earn some money by selling bangles or stitching clothes. Her aspirations have turned to ashes.\n“I wish to study, achieve something and help others poorer than me,” said Tabassum, who lives in Bhagwanpur, Uttarakhand. \nBut like Avnish, she faces a Hobson’s choice. “I can go to school only when the situation at home is better and my younger brother and sisters get two adequate meals a day,” she said ruefully.\nWatch this episode of Insight here.

      About 100 primary and secondary schools to get additional teachers over next few years
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: About 100 primary and secondary schools will get additional teachers to support students who “will benefit from this extra attention”, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Wednesday (Nov 10).\xa0\nThis enhanced resourcing will be expanded to an additional 24 primary and secondary schools from 2022, with plans to extend this to about 100 schools in the next few years, said the Education Ministry in the news release.\xa0\nThe UPLIFT Enhanced School Resourcing programme could see four to five additional teachers deployed to each of the 24 schools in the first phase.\xa0\nWhen fully rolled out, the programme is expected to support about 13,000 students from about 100 schools, said MOE in the release.\xa0\nUPLIFT, or the Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce, aims to strengthen support for underperforming students from disadvantaged families, in particular by tackling long-term absenteeism and drop-out rates in schools.\xa0\nSpeaking at a virtual appreciation event by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Mr Lee noted that the school environment plays “an even more crucial role” for children from troubled homes.\xa0\n“These children benefit from additional attention from teachers, who act as significant adults. Someone whom the children can relate to, can give\xa0them good advice\xa0and can sustain\xa0their interest in attending school. Someone to encourage them to discover their strengths and strive for their dreams,” he added.\xa0\n“It is thus particularly worrying when some of these children stop attending school regularly. We must do all we can to help them enrol in school, stay enrolled and do well in their studies.”\xa0\nMOE has piloted the programme in 23 schools since 2019, allocating additional resources to support “whole-school approaches” and targeted intervention for students with “greater needs”, the ministry said in a separate press release.\xa0\n“(MOE) gave the schools additional teachers and resources to better identify and support these kids, to reach out and mentor them, to develop customised programmes to keep them engaged after school and during the holidays, and to help them with their academic work and other socio-emotional challenges, so that these students feel supported and motivated to do well,” said Mr Lee.\xa0\nThe results from the pilot have been “encouraging”, he added.\xa0\nMore primary school students enrolled in their school’s student care centre, secondary school students got along better with their classmates and school attendance improved, said Mr Lee.\xa0\nThe additional teachers will provide each school with the capacity to establish structures, processes and customised programmes to support disadvantaged and at-risk students, said the Education Ministry in the news release.\xa0\n“For example, some teachers could be deployed to provide re-integration and academic support for students with absenteeism issues, while other teachers could be deployed to conduct after-school programmes,” the release read.\xa0\nMr Lee also announced the expansion of the UPLIFT Community pilot, which is currently active in four towns - Boon Lay, Bukit Merah, Kreta Ayer and Woodlands.\xa0\nThe pilot, which began in January 2020, supports disadvantaged students to help them attend school more regularly, and has reached more than 300 primary and secondary students since then.\xa0\nUnder the programme, support for these students and their families is coordinated at the town level. They are then referred to the appropriate agencies and community-based resources based on their needs.\xa0\nNoting that eight in 10 students in the pilot programme last year saw improvements in school attendance, Mr Lee said MOE intends to progressively expand the programme into a nationwide network.\xa0\nThe expansion of the UPLIFT Community Network will start with eight more towns next year, and more over the coming years, he announced.\xa0\nThe eight towns are: Bedok, Chua Chu Kang, Geylang Serai, Jalan Besar, Punggol, Sengkang, Toa Payoh and Yishun, said MOE in the news release.\xa0\n“In every generation, there will always be some who do better, and others who do less well. Crises like COVID-19 show up such social disparities more sharply,” said Mr Lee in his speech.\xa0\nFor example, switching to home-based learning during the pandemic was not smooth for every child, he noted.\xa0\n“Some children had limited access to laptops or fast internet connections at home. Others had to jostle for space with their siblings, parents or grandparents.

To help them close the gaps they started with as much as possible, to ensure they have more opportunities and choices than their parents and many more pathways to success.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     MOE ']}"

      School activities to gradually resume to support development, well-being of students: MOE
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Monday (Nov 8) that it would gradually resume more school activities, including Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), in schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs).\nThe move is to enrich the learning experiences and better support the long-term holistic development and well-being of students, said the ministry.\nIt cited high vaccination rates in the student population above the age of 12 as a ""good position"" to resume more elements of school life, with appropriate safeguards.\nFrom Nov 10, secondary schools and secondary/senior sections of Special Education (SPED) schools, Junior Colleges (JCs)/Millennia Institute (MI) and IHLs will be allowed to conduct masked activities in sub-groups of up to 5 people, subject to existing COVID-19 safe management measures.\nThe educational institutes will also pilot the resumption of team sports formats to allow a group of up to 10 fully vaccinated persons to play together, with participants required to produce a valid negative antigen rapid test (ART) result on-site prior to each game. \xa0\xa0\nThis is similar to the community team sports formats pilot run by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), said MOE.

      Commentary: How to raise a lifelong learner, rather than a child who simply aces exams
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It is common for parents and teachers to reward a child’s academic achievement with, say, a gift or treat. Praising a child and rewarding him or her for doing well in an exam comes from genuine affection and this can serve as a powerful motivation for children to want to do better.\nBut there is also a flip side to this argument – when learning is narrowly associated with external motivations and academic gains, children can become overly instrumental in how they perceive learning. They may fail to appreciate that learning in itself holds intrinsic value and pleasure. \nThe other issue has to do with seeing learning as cramming just before exams. Doing so risks surface understanding and short-term retention. Marathon runners do not expect to run a marathon with only a few days of training; likewise, learners should not expect results over a short period.\nWilliams College researcher\xa0Nate Kornell\xa0found that students retained information better through spaced practice - reviewing information at specific intervals, initially frequently, eventually less so once familiar -\xa0as opposed to cramming before exams.\nLearning scientists also recommend interleaving – mixing subjects (say, science and language), topics and different practice strategies. This enables children to recognise similarities and differences and apply what they learned in different contexts. \nTo illustrate, a child involved in baking at home draws on language and comprehension skills in understanding the recipe, mathematics when measuring ingredients,\xa0and science when mixing and baking ingredients at the right temperature. Additionally, this engages a child’s emotions, physical senses and planning skills, all of which create multiple pathways by which learning is deepened.\nIdeally, learning should be about self-improvement, personal growth, or enjoyment. But this requires a shift in the way we think. \nFor deep and long-term understanding, children need time to interact with concepts, find out how they relate to what they already know and apply concepts to the real world. \nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) has over the years tried to reshape our thinking about and relationship with learning. \nThe removal of mid-year examinations at some levels, the revised PSLE scoring system, implementation of Blended Learning with Home-Based Learning days scheduled regularly,\xa0and the refreshed Character and Citizenship Education curriculum are some examples of efforts made towards encouraging a reduced emphasis on academic performance and developing self-directed learners who find joy in learning. \nBut parents and teachers are critical in making this a reality. \nIn a 2013 study of more than 1,600 Secondary 3 students on the impact of parental involvement in learning, ex-National Institute of Education (NIE) researcher Luo Wenshu and her team found that when Singaporean parents were involved in their children’s learning by, for instance, discussing their homework and encouraging them to participate in co-curricular activities, children tended to exhibit more positive learning attitudes and outcomes.\nThat is, when parents engaged their children by talking and guiding - but not forcing or telling them what to do -\xa0children showed self-regulation in learning, low anxiety, high self-concept, persistence\xa0and performance.\nIn the same study, children with parents who were controlling and coercive - for instance, not allowing their children to make their own plans or depart from parental views - exhibited a maladaptive learning profile. They showed high anxiety, low task persistence and low academic performance.\nNIE Associate Professor Nie Youyan and her colleagues also found that in Singapore classrooms where teachers emphasised learning, task mastery and self-improvement, students showed greater interest, enjoyment\xa0and self-efficacy. \nConversely, data revealed that classrooms organised around mutual competition and tests - or external motivations - were negatively correlated with academic achievements.\nFor instance, when teachers talk about how it is important to persevere with learning multiplication tables so that students can count faster in all aspects of their lives, rather than saying they need it for their exams or to outcount their friends, students had more positive learning experiences and achievement. \xa0\nBesides parents and teachers, the larger society also forms the wider ecology around learning. Offhand remarks we make about learning to peers or a relative’s child - such as, “Wow, it’s great that you’re so interested in reading”, as opposed to, “exam is over, no need to read anymore” - implicitly contributes to the culture, or shared values and beliefs, about learning.\nWe need to believe that children have a sense of agency: They can direct their own learning. Before COVID-19 struck, few would believe that students would one day study online en masse, record themselves and upload video or voice clips for school assignments.\nGiven this start in self-directed learning, we can now do more to encourage metacognition, or thinking about one’s thinking. \nFor instance, in reviewing homework, instead of explaining how to rectify a mistake, enhance metacognition by asking the child to articulate the steps leading up to the mistake and what help they think they need to get it right. \nPossible questions include: What did you do to get here? How do you know you are stuck? What can you do next? What can you do in future if faced with similar issues? These questions prompt children to be more conscious about their own thinking. They also give insights into children’s thinking and learning.\nRather than offering solutions right away, we can help by providing space or support for children to seek solutions themselves and be patient about the learning process. When children ask for help - be it in opening a jammed cupboard door or clarifying an unfamiliar word - instead of giving them solutions, we can first ask them to suggest solutions. \nNext, we can provide some clues and encourage them to solve the problem themselves. \nThe final piece in the learning puzzle is that we mistakenly think that learning is just about school work. Parents may think children spending time with their toys or friends at the playground is not useful for learning.\nBut there is learning going on there too. They are creatively imagining new games, exploring how to make new friends or resisting peer pressure, watching out so they do not hurt themselves or others\xa0and picking themselves up when they fall, amongst other lessons. \nThese are dispositions and skills that will serve them well in unfamiliar circumstances and in the long run. \nRecently, someone in my class admitted her reluctance at letting her child learn knitting because it will not help her child academically. A lively discussion ensued with peers debating how both intellectual and personal growth can be derived from knitting. \nKnitting, someone said, requires perseverance and creativity. Indeed, this underscores the importance of adult support and open-mindedness to children’s pursuit of their interests in shaping their learning. \nEducational philosopher John Dewey wrote: “Give the pupils something to do, not something to learn; and the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking, or the intentional noting of connections; learning naturally results”.\nLearning, Dewey argues, is experiential in nature and one way we can do better is to vary the learning experiences of children beyond pen and paper practice. This would require creativity and a commitment to relearning learning on our parts.\nOnly in relearning our relationship with learning can we help ourselves and our children be prepared for life at large.\nHeng Tang Tang is an Assistant Professor in the Policy, Curriculum, and Leadership academic group in the National Institute of Education. \n', 'related_topics': ['     lifelong learning ', '     Parenting ', '     education ']}"

In this situation, I do not see my dreams coming true.""\nThe hardline Islamist Taliban movement, which stormed to power earlier this year after ousting the Western-backed government, has allowed all boys and younger girls back to class, but has not let girls attend secondary school.\nMost public universities are not functioning at all, or only partially.\nOfficials have tried to assure Afghans and foreign donors that people\'s rights will be honoured, including allowing girls to go to school and women to study and work once details on how to do so in accordance with Islamic law are thrashed out.\nThey have also blamed the international community for cutting off aid, making it harder to fund the reopening of schools and universities for all.\nMore than three months into their rule, that has not happened, and some are sceptical of a group that, when it was last in power from 1996 to 2001, banned all girls from school and women from paid employment.\nFewer than 40 per cent of Afghan girls attended secondary school in 2018 even though it was allowed then, according to the most recent figures from UNESCO.\nMuch of the country remains deeply conservative, despite 20 years of Western-backed rule and billions of dollars in foreign aid aimed partly at promoting equality and civil rights.\nBut in urban centres in particular, girls and women have enjoyed greater freedoms since 2001, and they are reluctant to let them go.\n""Those of us who went to university and also had jobs, were helping our families, of course nothing will come of us, because they (the Taliban) say that whatever we studied in the last 20 years is useless,"" Hawa said.\nAcross town, 17-year-old Sahar is also stuck at home.

      Workload for teachers ‘more than doubled’ during COVID-19 pandemic: Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The workload of teachers has\xa0“more than doubled” to keep the school system going during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (Nov 2).\xa0\nSpeaking in Parliament, Mr Chan was responding to a supplementary question from Member of Parliament (MP) Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) about further concrete steps that the Ministry of Education (MOE) could take to reduce pressures “from various stakeholders” on educators.\xa0\n“I think we should all thank our teachers and educators, because over the last two years, it has really been very tough on them,” said the Education MInister.\xa0\n“Not many of us realise that in order to keep our school system going, the workload for teachers has more than doubled.”\xa0\nTo switch seamlessly from in-person lessons to home-based learning, teachers need to spend “a lot of time” preparing more than two sets of lesson plans, he noted.\xa0\nThey also need to take care of students with higher needs, including those who need to return to school during home-based learning.\xa0\n“On top of all this, the school leaders and teachers also have to perform the role of contact tracing teams in case there are cases in the school. And we have to do this without additional manpower support,” he added.\xa0\nIf teachers are “not well taken care of” and “not in the best of conditions”, it is\xa0“very difficult” to expect them to take good care of the students, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nAbout 80 school staff sought support from MOE’s in-house counsellors in 2020, an increase from the annual average of 50 before the COVID-19 pandemic, he added.\xa0\nThe number of teaching staff from institutes of higher learning seeking counselling support has also increased, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nMOE does not have “more detailed data” as information from the counselling sessions are kept confidential, and staff are not required to report mental distress or psychiatric issues, he added.\xa0\nThe Education Ministry has adjusted various programmes in the short term to lighten the workload of teachers, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nFor example,\xa0MOE has “re-prioritised initiatives” and reduced schools’ involvement in the work from its headquarters and pilot programmes, said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“Schools have also been given greater flexibility to pace the implementation of selected initiatives, including deferring implementation if this helps to spread out staff workload,” he added.\xa0\nThis includes allowing secondary schools and JCs the option to defer the implementation of blended learning to 2022, instead of Term 3 of 2021 as originally planned, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“At the school level, we recognise that ground practices may vary. We have called on school leaders to re-prioritise school programmes, establish clear expectations on teachers’ availability and work hours, and encourage supervisors to check in with their officers regularly,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\nSchool leaders have been “providing guidance” to teachers on avoiding parent-staff communication after school operating hours except for urgent matters like student safety and well-being, he noted.\xa0\n“This can minimise the blurring of lines between work and personal time,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“In line with the streamlined health protocols, ringfencing policies and contact tracing processes in schools have now also been significantly simplified and teachers’ workload related to COVID-19 management is being reduced.”\xa0\nIn the longer term, MOE needs to “do much more” to help teachers cope. This could include using technology to scale up teaching resources so that teachers can apply their time more strategically to students who need the most help, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“I also would like to see our teachers systematically given a break or sabbatical, whereby they can go out and recharge themselves. Not just to recharge themselves, but also for them to acquire new perspectives, new skills, new connections to bring back to the school,” he added.\xa0\n“That is my wish over the long term. And we will progressively roll this out.”\xa0\nMr Chan urged parents and the rest of society to partner teachers to support students.\xa0\n“Let me say this, I think our teachers work very hard. They care a lot for our students, and I don’t think our teachers are afraid to work hard,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“But in working hard, they must be given a sense of agency, that they are in control, that they are doing things with conviction, and that it is important.”\xa0\nNoting that many teachers even give their handphone numbers to students in case they get into trouble outside of school hours, Mr Chan said he has heard of many stories of students calling teachers in the middle of the night because they were kicked out of the house due to family issues.\xa0\n“And our teachers respond. This is the extent to which our teachers go to to take care of their students beyond the curriculum time in school. But in giving out their handphone number to the families and the students, we also hope that the families would not abuse the trust,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“It is one thing for a child to call up the teacher at midnight to say that he’s in trouble. It is another thing for the parent to call up the teacher at midnight to ask whether the child has spelling, and should wear a red or blue t-shirt.”\xa0\nIf the child forgets about these things, it is part of their learning experience, Mr Chan stressed.\xa0\n“As parents, don’t need to overly protect our child and children and deprive them of the learning experience.\n“I think we need to establish this clear understanding of expectations of parents and society,” he said, adding that a lot of these expectations are also projected on teachers.\n', 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     education ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     parliament ', '     Singapore Parliament ']}"

      Crisis of a generation: Shuttered schools in the Philippines could mean a lifetime of poverty
  </h1>, 'text': ""MANILA: The Philippines, one of only two countries in the world that has not resumed face-to-face classes due to COVID-19, is gearing up for a limited re-opening of up to 120 schools next month.\nBut for 12-year-old Jonathan Mapa and around 2.3 million children said to have dropped out since March last year, it may be too late.\nWhen schools first closed, Jonathan used his sister’s phone to tune in to online classes. But that stopped after she had to relocate to another city for work, and the family could not afford another phone – not when they were surviving on water, rice and salt every time there was a lockdown. “We had no more money to buy more food,” said Jonathan.\n“I was envious of the other children. They owned cell phones,” he said, breaking down in tears.\nAnd to the dismay of his father, Jonathan took up hazardous work nine months ago to earn some income for his family.\nBut even for the luckier children who have been able to continue their education, learning has suffered. Surveys show that remote and modular learning outcomes have been dismal.\nThe cost of shuttered schools will mean decades of lost and reduced wages for these children as they remain trapped in the cycle of poverty, experts say. New data also shows that the learning crisis could hurt the Philippines’ productivity and economy for the next 40 years.\nThe current affairs programme Insight speaks to some struggling families and examines the troubling implications for the archipelago of 110 million people.\nBefore the pandemic, bicycle taxi rider Jonathan Mapa Senior earned enough to buy food, pay the bills and school fees, and give his son an allowance of 10 pesos (US$0.20) a day. Now, he cannot afford the rent or electricity and water.\nAlthough many children in his community in Tondo, Manila began scavenging for recyclable items during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 47-year-old had not wanted his son, also called Jonathan, to take on the dangerous work.\n“I only learned about it when I arrived home one day. I asked (my wife) about Jonathan’s whereabouts… he did not ask for permission because he knows I won’t allow it,” Mapa said. “He is too young. He might get into an accident, then he might get caught by the city government.”\nLockdowns caused the streets to be emptied of passengers and the government gave out an average of US$78 a month to families like theirs to compensate, but this was barely half of what Mapa used to earn.\nWhen the government was handing out electronic tablets, Mapa joined the long queue, his wife\xa0Normelita\xa0told Insight. But supplies ran out before he could secure one for his son.\nJonathan has not given up on school, although he does not know how he will find his way back. He had, in fact, started scavenging to save up so that he could study again. Often riding an old pedicab on an empty stomach, he might earn only US$0.40 from an afternoon’s effort.\nJust when he had saved up 1,500 pesos (US$29.50), the family ran into another setback. His mother, who has arthritis, fell ill and the money had to be used for her medical treatment.\xa0\nObservers say the government has overlooked the pandemic’s impact on the country’s youths, and the closure of schools will hurt an entire generation.\n“I don't want to sound overly pessimistic. But I think we have to recognise that we are really facing a crisis that is not only a learning crisis; it's a generational crisis that will affect all segments of the society,” said Dr Edilberto De Jesus, senior research fellow at the Ateneo School of Government.\nPhilippine president Rodrigo Duterte famously said in May last year that he would not allow students back to school until a vaccine was available. “If no one graduates, then so be it,” he had said.\nThe Philippines has logged over 2.7 million confirmed cases and over 40,000 deaths from the virus so far. It has vaccinated less than a quarter of its population.\nBesides the Philippines, Venezuela is the only other country in the world that has not resumed face-to-face classes.\nDe Jesus warned that if the government doesn’t look after the country’s 26 million or so students, more will drop out and later become “an even bigger drag on the society”.\nClosing all schools in the country was not the right approach to take, said Vincent Ramos, a PhD candidate in economic policy at the Hertie School in Berlin, Germany. This is because not all regions and provinces are affected in the same way by COVID-19.\nWATCH: Insight: The Hidden Cost Of COVID-19 On Philippines' Youth (48:22)\nDe Jesus said the country may have to, once again, rely on non-governmental (NGOs) and civil society organisations to supplement the government’s efforts to meet people’s basic needs.\nBut Elenita Reyes, village chairwoman of Barangay 105 in Manila, said the pandemic and movement restrictions have led to reduced aid from NGOs.\xa0\n“Before the pandemic, we were doing well. We get help. Children were given shoes, food, all kinds of vitamins by NGOs,” she said. “But now, they can only give us one-fourth or half of what they usually give.”\nEven for children who have managed to continue their education, remote learning outcomes have been dismal.\nCivil society group, the Movement for Safe, Equitable, Quality and Relevant Education (SEQuRe Education Movement), surveyed almost 6,000 respondents comprising teachers, students and parents between end-June and early July this year.\nSeventy-three per cent of 1,299 students surveyed confirmed that they have “been absent (from) online classes or failing to turn in modules on time”. The majority said they learned less than when they were going to school.\n“It is apparent that the lack of teaching and learning resources, as well as the ill-designed distance learning programme hindered effective remote learning,” the civil society group concluded.\nJudith Damiar, 14, has seen her grades slip during remote learning. As her family lives in Wawa, a barangay in Rizal province with poor or no internet connection, she opted for “modular distance learning” where teachers hand out and collect paper-based modules at least once a week.\nBut Judith has no one to ask when she doesn’t understand what she is reading. “With modules, the teacher can’t really explain them because they’re not here. The modules also can’t be explained by our parents because they weren’t able to study properly,” she said. Her father, Dionisio Damiar, 56, does odd jobs for a living.\n“The words used are kind of deep,” said Judith of the school materials. “Sometimes the questions would run in my brain in circles.”\nShe added: “It hurts to see your grades suffering while your parents are struggling for you.”\nSuch feelings can lead to mental health effects including stress, anxiety, depression and panic attacks in children, said Professor Lizamarie Campoamor-Olegario, SEQuRE’s lead researcher.\n“The students share these mental concerns were triggered by being overwhelmed with the class and household duties, limited or lack of social interaction and inability to understand the lessons for distance learning. Or they had difficulty in self-directed learning,” she said.\nThe authorities have produced data in an attempt to calculate the pandemic’s toll on the economy and its people.\nLast month, the Philippines’ National Economic and Development Authority estimated that the loss from reduction in future wages and productivity due to suspension of school, and lost wages of parents who accompanied their children for online classes, would amount to 11 trillion pesos (US$220 billion) over the next 40 years.\nLosses from premature deaths, sickness and inability to access treatment for COVID-19-associated illnesses would amount to 4.5 trillion pesos over the next 40 years, it estimated.\nBefore the pandemic, 19-year-old Juriel Natividad’s family was doing well enough for him to enrol in a private school. He should be a second-year film student in university, but is instead a drop-out. The reason: His mother Alma lost her job as a massage therapist in the United Arab Emirates.\nThe resident of Antipolo in Rizal province now spends his time tending to the family’s small store, and the income can only cover their daily needs. He wants to look for another role, but says the job market is tough.\nHis mother did not get angry when he dropped out, but Natividad said she is disappointed. “After all her years of sacrifice, after pouring in all her best efforts, in one moment, we ended up this way.”\nThe young man wishes the government would help children return to school, and give people like him a hand in finding a job. “Our generation is suffering from the worst mental instability, like me. I cannot avoid feeling anxious and depressed about our hardship,” he said.\nPhilippine news site Rappler reported this month that 59 public schools have passed the assessment by health officials to pilot limited face-to-face classes, but 29 later withdrew. Reasons include the local government units or parents not being in favour of face-to-face classes.\nSchools must have the written support of parents and students to take part. Up to 100 public schools and 20 private schools may participate in the pilot, which is scheduled to end on Jan 31 next year.\nIf the pilot run is found to be safe and effective, the number of schools on board could increase, Education Secretary Leonor Briones said in September.\nFor De Jesus, the importance of education cannot be over-emphasised. “Unless the kids are educated there is no hope for them to improve their standing in life,” he said.\nFor the children and their families, the future hangs in the balance.\n“If fate is kind, I wish Jonathan would earn a degree in teaching, to be a teacher, or as long as he finishes his education. That’s the only thing I could bequeath him,” said Mapa.\nJudith, who wants to be a police officer, put it simply: “I hope I can finish my studies. Then, I hope COVID will finally be eradicated.”\nWatch this episode of Insight: Asia's Lost Generation: The Philippines here.\xa0The programme airs on Thursdays at 9pm.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Philippines ', '     children ', '     education ', '     poverty ', '     Insight ', '     schools ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Illiterate in Singapore: When you can’t read or write English in one of Asia’s most English-literate countries 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: At first glance, 33-year-old Stephen Chng looks like any other professional you’d meet on the street – he works as a marine engineer, owns a car and is happily married to Faith, his wife of nearly five years.\nBut there’s a part of his life he’s guarded about: He struggles to read or write English.\nAssessed to have the\xa0reading level of an eight-year-old, Chng has trouble making out the signs and labels so prevalent in daily life: Road signs, food labels and\xa0even text messages. When he first started dating his wife, he would send her texts like “repple massage”, when he actually meant “reply message"",\xa0he remembers with a sheepish grin.\nHe has hidden his struggle\xa0well: In his job, which requires mainly practical work, he gets his wife to help him the few times he has to type out reports. When he drives, he relies on Google Maps to read the signs aloud for him. The few road signs he can read are the ones that are names of MRT stations he frequents, after seeing them repeatedly on his commutes.\xa0\nChng is one of the participants in the series Write of Passage, which features adult Singaporeans who have gone through life without knowing how to read or write English.\nEarlier this year, CNA put out a casting call for people interested in 12 weeks of intensive one-to-one coaching to join the programme. Chng was one of almost 100 people who responded.\nSingapore is known to be one of the most English-literate countries in Asia. But adult illiteracy may be more common than expected: According to the Department of Statistics, in 2020, there were about 283,000 Singapore residents aged 15-64 years old who are illiterate in\xa0English.\xa0\nWho are they?\nSome are school dropouts\xa0like 60-year-old Jimmy Tan, who left school in Primary Two. A former gang member who was in and out of prison for more than 20 years, he was determined to turn over a new leaf when he was released almost two years ago.\nBut he realised the world had passed him by. “All Singapore, a lot of places, all changed,” he said. “The signboards all English.”\nIn his previous life as a gangland “big boss”, everyone spoke in Mandarin or Cantonese – never English.\n“When you talk in English, people would say, ‘Wah, what a show-off. Arrogant\',” he said. “Now in Singapore, you talk to people, open the mouth… all in English.”\nHe was assessed to have the\xa0reading and writing level of a seven-year-old. By the end of his course, he wants to sing a song in English – Amazing Grace, as a testament to his decades-long journey of redemption.\xa0\xa0\nSome are individuals like 40-year-old Maya, who wished to be known only by her first name. Until three years ago, she could read, write and even speak normally. A stroke robbed her of the ability to do all this. Her condition, known as aphasia, means that the region of the brain that handles literacy is damaged.\nAbout one-third of all strokes result in this condition. While the damage cannot be reversed, speech therapy can help sufferers regain some ability to communicate.\nThere are also others who completed primary school and went on to higher education. According to the Ministry of Education’s syllabus, they should be able to read, interact, respond to and critically analyse a range of texts used in everyday life by Primary Six.\nWhy, then, are they still unable to read?\nChng remembers the sea of red in his exam papers in school. Numbed by the criticism from his teachers – one of whom, he said, made fun of him in front of the other students – he felt too embarrassed to stay in the classroom.\n“Every time the lessons started, I would automatically just walk out,” he said. This went on for eight to nine months in primary school. It was his maths grades which pulled him up and allowed him to graduate with a polytechnic diploma.\nStudents in school get regular practice in reading and spelling, and this will tide them through exams, said educational therapist Rachel Toh. But at home, she said, they may not have an environment which exposes them to the English language.\n“Not every home has magazines.\xa0You don’t have storybooks in every household,” she said. “So, the exposure isn’t there. When you’re not exposed to these words frequently, it just doesn’t stay in our long-term memory.”\nFrom there, reading becomes a chore. This means that even though they come across words in their daily lives, they might tend to just skip them, she added.\nIndividuals who cannot read and write may compensate with something else – their personality.\n“You can’t read, but you can be very eloquent, you can be very well-liked among your friends because you are generous and genuine as a person,” Toh said.\nTng Xiao Ling, 35, is one such person. She spoke Mandarin at home and said she never picked up a storybook and “never paid attention in school”.\nShe hides her lack of language ability behind a smile: She is jovial, often laughing at herself when she mispronounces a word.\n“If people laugh at my English, I just smile back at them,” she said. “It’s okay to let people laugh… Before they laugh at me, I laugh at myself first. Maybe then, it won’t hurt so much.”\nAssessed to have a reading age of seven, she joined the programme hoping to help her daughter in Primary Five, Yingxin, with her spelling test words.\n“I feel that it’s very hopeless when I don’t know how to teach my girl,” she said.\nAt the time the show aired, Tng worked at a call centre, where she had to type words on the computer. She found ways to cope. She remembers one incident where she wrote the letters “O” and “D”\xa0to indicate that a particular vehicle was an Audi.\nWATCH:\xa0Mum Learns English To Help 11-Year-Old Daughter With Spelling (4:21)\nIn the same way, Jegathasan Pushpangathan, 40, has found ways to cope with his inability to recognise even simple words. This is no mean feat for someone with a reading age of six. At the time the show aired, he had worked as a food and beverage executive at a hotel restaurant for 15 years and had to take orders and reservations regularly.\xa0\nHe has a “secret language”: When a customer orders waffles, for example, he will scribble “wewk” on his notepad.\n“I’ll write wrong English letters only I can understand,” he said. “That’s why I don’t share what I write.”\nHe does the best he can, asking his colleagues for help along the way. But there is one thing that makes him lose all confidence: Laying out nearly 100 food tags for the restaurant’s buffet line.\n“If you give me a table to carry, I will do it for you,” he said. “But if you ask me to take up a pen and paper… it’s very heavy.”\nHis supervisor described Jegathasan as a good worker and role model for his juniors, and would like to promote him. But Jegathasan himself is hesitant. ""If he wants to give me a promotion, I need to do emails… I can’t even do the food tags, how can I touch emails?”\nAs for Chng, it was perseverance that got him this far. He failed his driving theory test thrice. The fourth time, he practised for more than 36 hours, memorising almost 190 out of the more than 200 questions in his basic theory handbook, and more than 300 of the 400-odd questions for the final theory test.\xa0\xa0\nHe also learnt not to draw attention to his limited vocabulary by trying not to speak too much. “He worries that he might say something wrong,” said his wife, Faith. “I tend to speak up more so I can prevent misunderstandings with my family and relatives, to put his message across in another way.”\nAs part of the programme, participants were matched with teachers for one-on-one training for 12 weeks. They learnt the basics, like phonics and how to break words up to make reading easier.\nBut there were also challenges designed to help participants express themselves better and build confidence, such as a dramatic reading of the children\'s classic, Little Red Riding Hood, on stage in front of their loved ones.\nSome had to overcome self-doubt – and the doubt of those around them.\nAs the oldest participant, Tan struggled with classroom lessons and found it hard to practise on top of his day job as a cleaning supervisor.\nTng, on the other hand, faced resistance from her family when she joined the series. “My husband said… ‘Now then you learn English.\xa0At this age, what’s the use?’” she recalled. “I had to explain to him that if I know English, I can teach my girl in the future.”\nWATCH:\xa0Help, I Can\'t Read! Confronting English Illiteracy In Singapore (48:08)\nJegathasan, too, had for many years wondered “what (his) problem was”. Growing up, his mother had sent him for tuition and trusted that he would study hard. “But Jega didn’t study,” said Mageswari. “I was disappointed.”\nAs an adult, he had paid for English lessons to boost his literacy. But after seeing no improvement after six months, he gave up.\nDuring the programme, however, he made a discovery: He was dyslexic.\xa0\nThe diagnosis – from a series of tests during the initial assessment of his abilities – provided a much-needed answer to the question that had always bugged him. “I can tell myself I am not stupid,” he said.\nWhen series host Diana Ser accompanied Jegathasan to break the news to his family, his mother and sisters expressed only regret and sadness. “I blame myself,” his mother said.\xa0\xa0\n“If she had known that earlier… she might have put in extra help for him,” added his sister Gyathri.\nThe participants completed their last lessons in August, and the final episode of the series aired this month.\xa0\nBy the end of the series, they had showed a marked improvement and managed to achieve their goals. Chng wrote a letter to his wife and Tan sang Amazing Grace in front of an audience, for instance.\nWATCH:\xa0Our Last English Lesson: What\'s Our Progress? (47:24)\nThe final assessments showed that within the three-month period, Tan and Jegathasan had improved their reading ages by four months. Tng had jumped eight months. \nChng – who had to cut his training short by a month after being sent overseas for work – improved by a full year.\xa0He’s even been able to write work reports on his own while overseas, without having to call or send voice messages to his wife in Singapore for help.\nTan now takes pride in the fact that he can translate English news articles for his elderly mother.\nEven though the cameras have stopped rolling, the participants continue to make progress, some with the help of generous viewers.\nTng, who was able to successfully read out half of her daughter’s spelling list by the end of the series, is still continuing with her lessons. Her tutor has agreed to continue helping her for free, but the pair have shelved plans to meet until the pandemic eases.\nShe is now more confident using English in daily situations. When she ordered food in the past, she would ask the waitress to speak to her in Mandarin, she told CNA Insider in a follow-up interview.\xa0\n“After the lessons, I’ll make more effort to read the menu,” she said. “If the waitress speaks English to me, I will answer her in English.”\nJegathasan, who received 20 sessions of specialist help from the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) over the 12 weeks, was eager to continue his lessons.\nHis tutor estimated that he would need another 20 sessions to ride the momentum of his progress. But such specialist help can cost more than US$100 (S$135) per hour, and this was money he did not have.\nSeveral viewers wrote in to offer help. Many wanted to donate money to\xa0defray the cost of the lessons, while others offered to teach him for free.\nThis prompted the DAS to start a Giving.sg fundraiser to help Jegathasan. So far, more than 60 donors have contributed enough to cover 20 more sessions for him.\n“I am happy,” he said. “Thank you. Thank you so much.""\nThe positive response from viewers was, for series producer Tang Hui Huan, assurance that the team had done their jobs well.\n“We were always treading a thin line between encouraging empathy for these adults, and setting them up for mockery,” she recalled. “Some of our more camera-shy participants were quite open with the team about their fears from the first day of filming.”\nThey wondered: “If I reveal my weak point to the world, will people judge my ability to do my job properly? Will they mock me or criticise me?”\xa0\nTang said these were the very real concerns that her team worked hard to address. “I am glad we made it work,” she said.\nTang and fellow producer Sharifah Alshahab had set out to bust misconceptions about adult illiteracy. When they were looking for people to join the show, the team had come across “incredulous” reactions, with people passing comments such as “illiterate adults must have been lazy in school” and “I thought only old people can’t read and write English”.\n“Just because the majority of us are fine, doesn\'t mean we shouldn\'t pay attention to those who are struggling,” said Sharifah. “Through the series, we prove how much difference three months can make when we turn our focus to those who might need... suitable intervention.”\nWatch Part 1 of Write of Passage here. \nWatch Part 2 here, and Part 3 here.\nEditor\'s Note: This story has been edited following clarifications from the Department of Statistics on the number of Singapore residents who are illiterate in English. \n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     learning disabilities ', '     adult literacy ', '     dyslexia ']}"

      New S$4 million grant to help pre-schools adopt digital solutions in the next 3 years
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A S$4 million grant was launched on Saturday (Oct 16) to help pre-schools reduce the cost of adopting pre-approved digital solutions over the next three years.\xa0\nThe digital solutions include e-payment and e-enrolment systems, the use of data analytics to analyse and automate operations, as well as virtual training for pre-school educators.\xa0\nThese are covered under a three-stage industry digital plan, which lists the solutions pre-schools can adopt at each stage of growth, said the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) in a media release.\n“ECDA and IMDA have pre-approved solutions that will assist pre-schools in their operations at different stages of digital readiness,” said the agency.\n“These solutions are supported by certified vendors and have been curated to facilitate simple and quick adoption by pre-schools,” it added.\n“Apart from pre-school management, operators and educators can look forward to new solutions for e-enrolment and data analytics for centre operations from early November. More pre-approved solutions will be added progressively.”\nAnnouncing the Early Childhood Digitalisation Grant, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli said: “Under the IDP (industry digital plan), your pre-schools can find IT solutions that we have approved. These can help them reduce the time spent on routine tasks and even help them to update your parents more easily.\n“Pre-schools can also look out for new solutions to help them e-enrol children and use data analytics to make our pre-schools run better.”\xa0\nOperators can now submit their grant applications through the Business Grants Portal.\nECDA will also expand the development support - learning support programme to more pre-schools. The programme enables children who require low levels of early intervention support to access such services at their pre-schools.\nThe aim is for every pre-school to appoint one of its staff as an inclusion coordinator from the second half of 2023. They will partner early childhood educators to identify children with “potential developmental needs” for early assessment, said ECDA.\nThey will also connect educators and parents with “relevant early intervention resources and services”.\nPre-schools can look forward to\xa0training for their inclusion coordinators from the end of this year, said Mr Masagos.\n“Besides improving professional training and quality of pre-schools to benefit all children, we are making our pre-schools more inclusive and stepping up support for children with developmental needs,” said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nThe programme will cover 60 per cent of pre-schoolers aged five to six by 2025, and 80 per cent of them in the long term, said ECDA in its media release.\nMSF will also pilot a new Inclusive Support Programme at selected pre-schools for children that need medium levels of early intervention support, and will release more details later, said Mr Masagos.\xa0\nFor children from low-income families, yearly top-ups to child development accounts will be introduced as part of the Growing Together with KidSTART initiative.\nEach KidSTART child will receive S$100 for each year of regular attendance until they reach six-years-old, said an ECDA spokesperson in response to media queries.\xa0\nChildren will also be eligible for an additional one-time top-up when they enroll in pre-school, they said.\xa0\nThe one-time top-up will be more - S$200 - if they enroll between ages three and four, compared to S$100 for those who enroll at above age four, the spokesperson noted.\xa0\nThe Government recently also announced a S$200 top-up in the Child Development Accounts (CDA)\xa0of all Singaporean children aged six and below,\xa0said Mr Masagos.\xa0\n“This will benefit all families by helping to offset the costs of raising a child. But we will go further. We will provide more support for families and children who enrol and participate regularly in pre-school and KidSTART activities through yearly CDA\xa0top-ups.”\xa0\nThis is to encourage families towards early enrolment and regular attendance, said ECDA.\nA larger top-up amount would be given to families who enroll their children in pre-school earlier, between ages three and four, it added.\nThe Growing Together with KidSTART initiative was launched in 2019 to raise community support for children from low-income families. It has garnered S$4 million in cash donations and sponsorships from businesses and individuals, said ECDA.\n“We also want to enable every child to have the best chance to flourish in life. Regardless of their family background or resources,” said Mr Masagos.\n“I am hopeful that with these new moves, we can better support children with diverse needs in our pre-schools, so that every child can shine and achieve their fullest potential.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     MSF ', '     education ', '     ECDA ']}"

      ‘A sea of broken children’: COVID-19 leaves orphans, child labourers in its wake in India
  </h1>, 'text': 'BIHAR: When 10-year-old Shahbuddin’s* father died months ago, the weight of the world landed on his shoulders. The oldest of seven children, the burden of supporting the family fell to him.\nThe family had no land and no relatives to help with money. Shahbuddin’s mother was distraught and struggling. “My mom stays at home. She does not have money and she keeps on weeping. She begs for food and sometimes works as a daily wage worker in farms and feeds us,” he told CNA’s Insight programme.\nAn acquaintance from his village in India’s eastern Bihar state took advantage of his plight and lured him to leave home with the promise of a job.\nThis was how Shahbuddin found himself riding with 15 other children on a train towards Delhi, hundreds of kilometres away. They travelled 24 hours before arriving at the Anand Vihar station, where the acquaintance’s son left and Shahbuddin found himself alone and scared.\nWhat saved Shahbuddin from ending up as child labour like scores of his peers – for now, at least – was a police raid on June 29 this year. Twelve traffickers were arrested for luring the children to work in a garment factory.\nIndia made global headlines for its devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April and May. Many patients could not get hold of oxygen and crematoriums were overwhelmed. But another tragedy was also playing out.\nSonal Kapoor, founder of child rights group Protsahan India Foundation, calls it the “sea of broken children” – young ones who have lost their parents to the pandemic or have been forced to stop school, work as cheap labour or be married off as child brides.\nWhile these issues existed long before the pandemic, COVID-19 has aggravated the problems of children, said Amod Kanth, founder of the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Prayas.\nIn India, children below the age of 14 are not allowed to work in factories, mines or be engaged in hazardous employment.\nYet, the country’s 2011 census found that there were 10.1 million working children aged between five and 14. This figure was nearly 4 per cent of all children in the age group. In addition, the census found more than 42.7 million children to be out of school.\n“Every child who is on the streets is a manifestation of failure of state. Every child who is out of school, every child who is begging, every child who has ever been a victim of any violence, sexual or otherwise, is an example of failure of state,” said Anurag Kundu, chairperson of the Delhi Commission For Protection of Child Rights .\nJob losses and deaths caused by the pandemic have created fertile ground for child traffickers, as some families have “no choice but to push their children to labour, to begging”, he said.\n“The traffickers are from around the villages and they know about the situation around there. They target vulnerable families,” said Rakesh Senger, executive director of programmes at the Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation.\xa0\n“In the supply chain, the trafficker is connected to the locals, who identify and tell\xa0them about the vulnerable families and the children who can be taken away.”\nAnd where traffickers used to give about US$15 or 1,000 rupees as an advance to the children’s families, they now give US$150 to US$200 (11,255 to 15,000 rupees), Senger said. “So this way, the children become bonded labourers for a year.""\nLike Shahbuddin, 10-year-old Roshan* had to leave his home in Bihar to work in Delhi. His parents lost their livelihoods and borrowed from moneylenders. To repay the debts, Roshan worked in a bangle factory from 8am to 11pm for a monthly wage of US$30 to US$40.\xa0\nHis hands and legs ached from sitting and working in one position for long hours, and he was not given food on time. The chemicals used to make the bangles burned his face.\n“I tried to run away once but could not because of the lockdown,” he said.\nTo make things worse, the boss shortchanged Roshan. “The owner told me that he sent US$40 but when I called my parents and asked about money, they said they received only US$27,” he said.\nRoshan could get out only when Delhi-based Prayas raided the factory and rescued 45 children including him.\nVishal Kumar, Prayas’ child helpline coordinator, said rescuers saw children aged five to seven making bangles during their raid. “They were using harmful chemicals… and they would sit in the same position and work continuously for 10 to 12 hours,” he said.\nRaids require meticulous planning and can easily go awry, NGOs said. Traffickers also adjust the way they operate to evade law enforcers.\nAccording to Vishal, if Prayas’ raid on the bangle factory had happened even five minutes later, it would have been difficult to save the children as news would have spread in the slum area.\nTraffickers could make the children take longer bus routes and change buses to hoodwink enforcers, said Dhananjay Tingal, executive director of Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), another NGO that conducts undercover investigations and raids.\nBut BBA has its networks to counter their tactics, he said. In certain districts, trafficking and child labour survivors take the lead and gather information on children being trafficked, which can lead to rescue operations.\nInsight followed the team as it worked with district authorities to raid a garment factory using child labour in Seelampur in east Delhi. Earlier on, BBA had identified almost 30 children in four separate locations in the neighbourhood.\nDuring the raid, the team had to move swiftly to avoid getting outsmarted as word of police presence spread and traffickers tried to move the children away in small batches. The children would also be taught to lie when they came face-to-face with the police – claiming that they were with their “uncles” or that they were merely sightseeing, for instance.\nAfter 20 children were found, another obstacle surfaced: There was no sign of the traffickers or the children’s employer, and no one was divulging any information. The rescuers resorted to stern warnings – “you guys need a good slap, then you will straighten up” – and threats to seal up the premises to get a name from the workers.\nIn the end, it was a “good day” for the BBA team because the raid was successful. “You feel good that you have saved the life of a child,” said Tingal, who added that the children were aged 14 to 17 and two girls were among those rescued.\nWATCH:\xa0How COVID-19 Created India\'s Broken Generation Of Children (48:23)\nIndia’s Childline 1098, a 24-hour emergency number for children in need of help, received over 3.9 million calls about children between March and June 2020. It experienced a 50 per cent surge in calls in the three weeks from March 20 to April 10, 2020.\nFigures for this year are not available. But according to Kundu, India’s first COVID-19 wave affected more people who were above age 50 — who were more likely to be grandparents — whereas in the second wave, it was “largely the parental generation who got affected, and that, in turn, adversely affected the children far more than the first wave”.\nThe number of calls about children losing their parents was “heartbreaking”, said Kundu.\n“In one particular instance, there were two children inside a home with the dead bodies of their parents next to them and they were calling for cremation help.”\nAccording to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, over 101,000 children were orphaned or abandoned between April 1, 2020 and August 23 this year – children like siblings Shivam and Sakshi Gupta, who lost their father to the virus in April.\nEstranged from their mother, who left when they were much younger, the pair now live with an uncle.\nSakshi, 15, and Shivam, 12, were very close to their father. When he was infected, he could not get admitted to the hospital initially, so they brought him warm water and medicine for fever and cough in bed.\nHe got worse four days later and was finally admitted to the hospital, but eventually died. “I miss him a lot,” said Sakshi. “I miss him teasing us, scolding us.”\n“I used to be with my dad all the time. We’d go to the temple, or anywhere he had to go, I used to go along with him,” said Shivam.\nTheir uncle, Ravi, 41, told Insight he would look after the children even though he is a tailor who does not earn much – only about US$8 a day – and already has two children of his own. \n“Whatever I am giving to my kids, they will receive the same,” he said. “It would be good if I get some help for their upbringing and education.”\nIn May, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi announced the PM-CARES for Children scheme which will support the education of children who have lost both parents or their surviving parent, or legal guardians to COVID-19.\xa0\nBut child rights activists say the focus on “COVID orphans” is problematic.\n“It stigmatises one set of children who, for the rest of their lives, will now have to go around proving that they were orphaned by COVID-19 and therefore become eligible for certain benefits that the government has promised to them,” said Enakshi Ganguly, co-founder and advisor of the HAQ: Centre for Child Rights.\xa0\nAt the same time, it ignores the struggles of other vulnerable children, she added.\nWATCH: India’s Stolen Generation, a 2016 Insight episode on child slavery and exploitation (50:08)\nThe situation of girls like Pooja*, 13, shows that it isn’t easy to resume studies after a major disruption.\nSome 1.5 million schools in India were closed from March last year due to the pandemic. Some children dropped out to work, and some dropped out because they could not access online education, said Ganguly. More than a year later, there are children who will perhaps never return to school, she said.\nPooja\'s father, the sole breadwinner, died without savings. Her family’s rent piled up to over US$300 and the teenager stopped school to help her mother and work for some extra income.\n“If I continue my studies, then in the future I will be able to get a better salary, I could help others,” she said. “I want to continue my education, but it will take a lot to work and study at the same time.”\nShe added: “Now my dreams have been shattered. I have let them go, let them remain broken.”\nThere are little victories, however, such as of girls resisting early marriage in order to pursue their dreams. \nSisters Sapna, Suman and Monica Gujjar from Ajmer, Rajasthan, were due to be married off in May this year, but they vehemently refused. \nSapna, 16, said she wants to play football and is preparing for the civil service exams. The sisters’ resolve inspired their neighbour, Pinky Gujjar, to also refuse to become a child bride.\nAs for Shahbuddin, he was sent after the police raid to Mukti Ashram, a shelter for boys run by BBA. Although his family circumstances remain precarious, he has returned home and reunited with his siblings.\xa0\n“I miss home,” he said. “I’ll come to Delhi for work only after I am 18 years old.""\nThe successful rescues keep child rights activists fighting another day, but their work is always bittersweet.\n“The biggest challenge is we are not able to reach out to all the children who are being trafficked and who are being exploited,” said BBA’s Tingal.\n* denotes children whose full names have been withheld to protect their identities.\nEditor\'s note:\xa0This story has been updated with the correct number of calls received by India’s Childline 1098 helpline between March and June last year.\nWatch this episode of Insight: India’s Broken Generation here.

      Cancelling year-end exams means more time to overcome disruptions caused by COVID-19, say teachers
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Teachers are relieved that year-end examinations for Primary 3 and 4 students have been cancelled, but they told CNA that they still have concerns about catching up on the curriculum.\xa0\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) announced the cancellation on Thursday (Oct 7), explaining that the move will\xa0allow more time for “curriculum recovery” due to disruptions from COVID-19 .\xa0\nThere are about 79,000 students in Primary 3 and 4 in total.\nThe Government had earlier placed all primary and special education schools on home-based learning from Sep 27 to Oct 6 amid a rise in COVID-19 cases. This was later extended to Oct 7 as an ""added precaution"".\xa0\n“Actually (I felt) more of relief, because the HBL (home-based learning) is very near the exam period,” said a mathematics and English teacher to Primary 4 students. She\xa0only wanted to be known as Angeline*.\xa0\nLeading up to this period, as cases in Singapore spiked, so did the number of\xa0children on quarantine order or\xa0leave of absence. There were also those\xa0who received\xa0health risk warnings\xa0and needed to stay home.\nStudents would often be unable to attend school because of COVID-19 related reasons, she added.\xa0\n“There’s a lot of disruption in terms of their learning. And I find it a little unfair that these students didn’t get the whole learning experience. We send their work home, of course. For some students, their parents are able to go through it with them, but not all,” Angeline told CNA.\xa0\n“No exams is a good thing, so we can concentrate on the teaching, rather than on the testing.”\xa0\nAlthough the two-week period leading up to the year-end examinations is typically spent revising, teachers CNA spoke to said the disruptions throughout the year meant\xa0most of them are still trying to finish the syllabus.\xa0\nThe students were more unprepared for exams this year than previous\xa0batches, they said.\n“Sometimes even when there was no home-based learning, there were kids who were in and out of school, on leave of absence, and everything was so disruptive for all of the students,” said Matthew*, who teaches mathematics and English to Primary 3 and 4 students.\xa0\nAll his students, regardless of whether\xa0they were strong or weak in the subjects, or whether they had home support or not, were affected by these disruptions, he added.\xa0\n“And then there was the lingering fear from the kids, like\xa0oh, what will happen if I get COVID?” Matthew said.\xa0\n“Without the exams, I hope that we can use the time to recover content, and not just recover content but maybe bring back that little bit of joy of learning back into the students’ education,” he added.\xa0\n“It’s been quite a mad rush, the kids have been glued to their screens for quite a long time this year.\xa0\n“I hope that with the removal of the exams for the P3s and 4s maybe we can have a little bit more experiential learning in the class, instead of just teaching for the tests, which is what we would have had to do if they didn’t cancel the exams.”\xa0\nAlthough they agreed that cancelling the examinations was a beneficial\xa0move, there were\xa0concerns about finishing the syllabus.\nNicole*, who teaches mathematics, English and social studies to Primary 3 students, said that she and her colleagues were “really worried” about this. And that\'s\xa0even though her school had earlier decided to drop some topics from the end-of-year examinations.\xa0\n“When I first heard the news I was really happy that we wouldn\'t have to rush to cover the syllabus, and also the kids wouldn\'t have to be so stressed about being assessed for something that they are not prepared for,” she told CNA.\xa0\nShe gave an example of the\xa0students in her English class.\xa0\nShe said they did not manage to do any composition writing in the first semester, and she could tell they were very unprepared after recently assigning them\xa0a composition writing exercise.\xa0\n“So I could see that they were not ready for an exam. I think also coming out of the HBL, no one wants to come out and immediately go for an exam,” Nicole said.\xa0\nHer colleagues who taught the previous cohort\xa0of Primary 3 students, who are now in Primary 4, said that the home-based learning periods of 2020 also disrupted their learning and coverage of the syllabus.\xa0\n“What they found was that this batch of Primary 4 kids are very very weak, and they don’t have the foundations they would have had if HBL hadn’t occurred,” Nicole said.\xa0\nHer colleagues found themselves spending time teaching the Primary 4 students concepts that they should have learnt in Primary 3, from scratch. And this\xa0affected the amount of curriculum time left for this year’s topics, she added.\xa0\n“In that sense, calling off the year-end exams gives us the\xa0extra weeks to cover what we have to cover, and hopefully this batch of Primary 3 kids won’t have the same problem as the Primary 4s.”\xa0\nSome teachers were also worried about having to grade\xa0the students based on previous assessments instead.\xa0\nIn its announcement on Thursday, MOE had said that schools can draw on information from “a range of school-based assessments” conducted throughout the year to report students’ learning progress and provide feedback.\xa0\nThey can also use such assessments to make recommendations on students’ subject combinations where necessary, it added. For example, when students move from Primary 4 to Primary 5, they can decide whether to take Standard or Foundation level for specific subjects.\xa0\n“Though weighted assessments throughout the year are fair, they might not accurately reflect the progress the students have made over the year, said Rachel* who teaches Primary 5 students.\nIf the Primary 4 students enter Primary 5 next year and are differentiated according to the different kinds of learning support given, this may not cater closely to their learning progress, she added.\xa0\nTeachers who taught the students in Primary 4 and Primary 5 would have to have deeper conversations to properly assess the students’ aptitude and attitude for learning more accurately, Rachel said.\xa0\n“I think with fewer opportunities to take the full examination this year, students will be more overwhelmed when taking the full examination next year,” she added.\xa0\nPrimary 4 students may be affected by the year-end exam cancellations “to a certain extent” because there are elements in the exams that will decide whether they take a subject at the Standard or Foundation level in Primary 5, Rachel told CNA.\xa0\nBut teachers usually know the academic progress of their students, and would be able to advise parents with the student’s weighted assessment results, she stressed.\xa0\n“Ultimately, after the school’s recommendation, parents usually do have a final say on the level of subjects the students will be taking.”\xa0\nThe COVID-19 measures in schools cause a lot of stress for students, and this may have affected their weighted assessments as well, said Nicole.\xa0\nOther students may also have missed the assessments because they were on quarantine order, leave of\xa0absence, or had to stay home because a relative had acute respiratory symptoms, she added.\xa0\n“No matter how much the school tries to bridge that gap by having online lessons, and using SLS (student learning space) to assign stuff, I think it’s still very hard for the child to really learn in that kind of environment,” Nicole said.\xa0\n“It\'s really really sad. Every morning there\'s a series of questions that we have to ask, like any of your family members have to be swabbed, and so on. It\'s so overwhelming for them and during recess they cannot talk to their friends, they cannot play.”\xa0\nJane*, who teaches Primary 1 and\xa03 students, said there will probably be some form of informal assessments to see how well students have understood the topics and check whether they can be promoted to the next level.\xa0\n“It (grading students) will definitely be a challenge because this is not something that we have experienced before, we’ve always had the end-of-year exams, so as of now, we’re also not sure as to how we’ll be assessing the students,” she said, adding that she expects to find out more when students return to school next week.\xa0\nWith exams being cancelled, students were also “very happy” and even “overjoyed” at the news, teachers told CNA.\xa0\n“It’ll also give teachers more time to focus on the emotional aspects of our students… The HBL has impacted them in some ways, be it lack of social connection… or there may not be a conducive environment for HBL to take place,” Jane said.\xa0\n“The first thing we want to do as a school is of course check in with them, about how they are, how they’ve been dealing with home-based learning, how the situation is at home, so we’ll check in with them.”\xa0\nThere were\xa0groups of parents who were worried about their children losing steam and focus, and had pumped in more effort at home to prepare them for the year-end examinations, said Rachel.\xa0\n“Without the last assessment of the year, some of them may be disappointed that their efforts may not come to fruit as they may not be able to gauge their learning progress. Some students may even lose the motivation to study hard without a clear goal in mind for the year.\xa0\n“Nonetheless, I think students will generally be relieved that they do not have to face the stresses of further preparation and dealing with the results post-examinations.”\xa0\nParents may also be more concerned about the health and safety of their children, compared to whether they can take the examinations, Jane said.\xa0\n“I think at this point in time, many parents want to prioritise the emotional wellbeing and the health of their children, as compared to their academic progress. But of course, that’s not to say that they’re not bothered,” she added.\xa0\n“For children who have been studying, learning is a continuous thing, it shouldn’t just be for the exams. It’s fine if they’ve been revising because it will still be tested next year...It does not mean that there are\xa0no exams, learning should stop.”\n* Not their real names.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Commentary: Why are these PSLE maths questions so hard? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: This year’s Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) mathematics papers have been at the centre of controversy over the past few days. \nParents have reportedly claimed their children have burst into tears over the perceived toughness of the papers. Media stories speak of some students also requiring emotional support from school counsellors. \nThese complaints, some of which have been posted on Education Minister Chan Chun Sing’s Facebook page, have focused on the needless stress on students amid challenging times. \nSo widely talked about was this PSLE examination angst that local blogger Lee Kin Mun, popularly known as mrbrown, produced a video offering advice and urging students to remember their PSLE grades do not represent the totality of who they are as individuals, and that their parents love them unconditionally.\nWhy are these PSLE mathematics questions so hard? \nWe’re naturally inclined to feel huge empathy towards our 12-year-olds after a coronavirus-sized disruption over the past two years. \nStudents have had to cope with intermittent school closures\xa0and the imposition of home-based learning (HBL) since 2020.\nThen there is also the stress brought about by the curtailment of co-curricular activities and restrictions imposed on recess and other socialisation opportunities within schools and between households. \nStudents have also had to prepare themselves for the uncertainties associated with being the pioneer cohort for the revised PSLE scoring system.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) has publicly acknowledged that HBL is not an adequate substitute for the depth and variety of learning experiences students enjoy by being physically present in school.\nAnd in recognising the impact of HBL imposed over the past two years and to support the wellbeing of students, MOE removed what it terms “common last topics” from both last year’s and this year’s PSLE mathematics and science. \nDeputy Director-General of Education (Curriculum) Sng Chern Wei also took pains to assure parents in a forum letter over the weekend that MOE would take these disruptions into account to ensure that students would not be “disadvantaged by these exceptional circumstances”. \nWhy have some parents and students experienced such distress? And why despite MOE’s attempts over the past decade to reduce stress levels and nurture what it terms “the joy of learning” in students?\nThen Education Minister Ong Ye Kung had acknowledged back in 2018 the risk of schooling becoming overly stressful. \nFor that reason, beginning in 2019, all weighted assessments in Primary 1 and 2 were scrapped, with Primary 3 and 5 mid-year exams following suit in subsequent years. \nIn a similar vein, the revamped PSLE scoring system was touted as contributing to reducing the over-emphasis on academic achievement by reducing fine differentiation and eliminating peer comparisons of scores.\nYet, the fact that this year’s PSLE mathematics papers have yet again been a lightning rod for anxieties testifies to the practical difficulties in securing a match between MOE’s official policy goals on the one hand, and parents’ and students’ perceptions and behaviour on the other.\nPerhaps the reality for many parents and students is that PSLE remains a high-stakes examination that determines students’ chances for secondary school admission, notwithstanding recent reforms to the educational system. \nIn many ways, this year’s parental concerns over the PSLE maths papers are not new.\nSimilar anxieties had surfaced in previous years, like when in 2015, some parents took issue with a question that asked students to estimate the weight of eight one-dollar coins, and again in 2019 when a question about circles and distances got many scratching their heads.\nThe diagnostic element inherent in the PSLE understandably tends to be overlooked as many parents and students naturally focus instead on the powerful selection and sorting mechanism the PSLE represents. \nMost invest a considerable degree of money, time and energy in exam preparation, welcoming moves like the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) publishing PSLE examination papers since 1993 in a bid to acquaint parents and students with the examination format as well as expected standards.\nThe ubiquity of the private tutoring industry is both evidence and accelerant of the parental anxiety surrounding the PSLE. \nBy the time students sit for exams, most have gone through countless hours of revision and practice. The subsequent disappointment some feel when encountering questions they are unable to answer is then all the greater. \nIt can be difficult to come to terms with the reality that an exam like the PSLE, which serves as a means of differentiating among students, needs to have a system of setting examination papers lending themselves to this purpose. \nEven so, the SEAB has attempted to clarify over the last decade that exam papers have a range of questions – easy, average and more challenging – to cater to students with a wide range of abilities and maintain comparability of standards from year to year, with robust processes ensuring coherence between the exam, syllabus objectives and learning outcomes.\nThese worries remain despite MOE Curriculum Planning and Development’s public emphasis on the development of “thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving” in addition to the acquisition of mathematical concepts for everyday use and continuous learning.\nThe last thing anybody wants is for students to lose confidence in learning mathematics or to hate learning the subject because of their disappointment with the PSLE mathematics\xa0exams.\nIt would be regrettable if these larger aims were to be lost amid a public focus on the perceived toughness of some examination questions, even if they were designed precisely with the intention of sieving out top candidates.\nBut as long as the PSLE continues to play this role of determining a student’s subsequent educational pathways, it is unlikely these sorts of complaints that have emerged this year will disappear. \nA caveat is that less is known about how widespread these worries are when parents and students who might not feel similarly high levels of anxiety do not have their views widely highlighted. \nBut the irony is how such a controversy over mathematical assessment at the end of primary schooling continues locally when Singapore’s primary mathematics curriculum has been long been admired as a model producing top-ranked students in global comparisons and adopted by schools in other countries such as the UK and the US.\nFor now, the advice from mrbrown for all students and parents to remember PSLE is not the be all and end all seems prescient.\nJason Tan is an associate professor at the National Institute of Education.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     PSLE ', '     MOE ']}"

      560 quarantined students sat for first PSLE written paper; procedures 'can be improved', parents say
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: About 560 students on quarantine order sat for the first written paper of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)\xa0on Thursday (Sep 30), said the Ministry of Education (MOE).\xa0\nIn a statement on Thursday night, the ministry said that of the 39,300 students sitting for the PSLE this year, 99.4 per cent took the English written paper on Thursday.\xa0\nThe 560 students across 90 schools had met the testing requirements to be allowed leave from their quarantine orders to take the examinations, said MOE.\xa0\n“The necessary safe management measures were strictly adhered to in schools, to ensure the safe conduct of the examinations for all students and staff,” the statement read.\xa0\nMOE and the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) announced last Sunday that students who are on quarantine order may be allowed to sit for their national year-end examinations if they test negative for COVID-19.\nLast year, students on quarantine were not allowed to take the examinations. These new arrangements were made in view of the rising COVID-19 cases, said the authorities.\xa0\nMs Joan Tabinas, whose son was issued a quarantine order on Saturday after exposure to a classmate who tested positive for COVID-19, said he came home “happily” after the paper\xa0because it went better than he expected.\xa0\n“So we’re happy about that, but of course experiencing this around almost a week before his PSLE is not a good joke,” she told CNA, adding that her daughter, who is in Primary 4, was also served a quarantine order a few days prior.\xa0\nHer son was told to reach school at 7.50am, later than the children who were not under quarantine order or leave of absence, as he was not allowed to mingle with others.\xa0\n“All the QO kids, they put them in one room. (They arrived) at a different timing, and there’s a segregated room for (those) under QO or those kids that’s been affected by this pandemic surge last week,” said Ms Tabinas.\xa0\nThe children were seated 3m apart, and were also asked to prepare pre-packed food for their break.\xa0\n“There’s no such thing as ideal for now, but of course we need to adapt to the situation, what is happening today,” she said, adding that this arrangement was better than not being able to sit for the examinations at all.\xa0\nAccording to an MOE circular earlier this week, parents whose child\xa0has\xa0been placed on quarantine order must inform the\xa0school by noon, and the child’s plans to sit for the exam at least two days before the paper.\xa0\nStudents who want to sit for their papers must take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which will take at least 24 hours to be processed, and the results will be posted in the students’ HealthHub account.\n“If there is a paper scheduled the next day after the (quarantine order) is received, your child will not be able to sit for it. However, the child can apply for special consideration through the school,” said MOE in the circular.\xa0\nIf the PCR test comes back negative, the child should take an antigen rapid test (ART) that evening, and take a photo of the negative result. This must be done at 6pm the day before each paper.\nOn the day of the paper, the student’s negative PCR test result and a photograph of the ART result\xa0have to be presented in order for the student to take the PSLE paper.\nAnother parent who only wanted to be known as Mrs Tan told CNA that she was disappointed and “utterly appalled” at how the PSLE procedure for children serving quarantine orders was handled.\xa0\nHer son was unable to take the English paper as his quarantine order was issued on Wednesday morning, just a day before the paper. He managed to sit for the mathematics paper on Friday.\xa0\nThey were given one hour to decide whether her son would take the mathematics paper after they were informed of the quarantine order, she said.\xa0\nThe PCR test results could take up to 48 hours, and if he wanted to take the paper, the test should be taken as soon as possible to make sure the results were out before the paper on Friday, they were told.\xa0\n“The whole thing, I feel that it can be improved,” said Mrs Tan, adding that her son was the only one in his class who had to serve a quarantine order so she was unable to get help and guidance from other parents.\xa0\n“This is not the first year having COVID and PSLE. COVID started last year in March. Last year, there’s students taking the PSLE too. There’s ample time, from last year to this year, to think about it.”\xa0\nAfter two days of scrambling, Mrs Tan managed to submit her son’s entry PCR test and ART results the evening before the mathematics paper on Friday. She thought the family could “finally relax and have a peaceful dinner”, she said.\xa0\nBut half an hour later, the authorities called her again to request another PCR test for her son later that night.\xa0\n“I was like ‘Huh, why PCR test again when we did it yesterday with a negative report?’” said Mrs Tan. She insisted that her son had just taken his entry PCR test and refused a second test.\xa0\n“Today, he can take the maths paper after a great deal, after a good effort. We went through a lot of difficulties, but finally he got there, he can take the paper. But he can’t sleep well, he was troubled,” she said.\xa0\nAdding that she also did not manage to sleep, Mrs Tan said: “My mind is so active but my body is so tired, I’m drained out. I have to worry that he got COVID, on one hand about his health, at the same time I have to worry about his PSLE maths paper.”\xa0\nMrs Tan also worries about whether they will have to go through the same confusion for his next few papers, she said. She is also managing other household matters while serving a quarantine order herself.\xa0\n“I have to really struggle with all of these things. You don’t know how frustrated I am.”\xa0\nLike Mrs Tan, after the ministries announced the procedures for students on quarantine order who wanted to take the PSLE, Ms Tabina had to manage a flurry of calls from the authorities arranging for an entry PCR test.\xa0\n“(I received a call)\xa0from the MOH that the swabber is coming.\xa0Then suddenly the swabber will not come because the Government already cancelled it. Then suddenly the swabber is coming, then off again,” she told CNA.\xa0\nFinally, her son’s school told her she could decline the swabber’s visit because they would accept her son’s previous PCR test results for him to take the papers.\n“And then I said why, because that’s under the Government rules? My point is I need to decide if it is a yes or a no. The school says you can decline it, but of course we need to follow what the Government says,” said Ms Tabina.\xa0\n“We're happy at the end of the day, but the process and the procedure that we went through, it is not easy, to be honest,” said Ms Tabina, adding that she was still “feeling shaky” from the stress.\xa0\n“But at the end of the day, our kids are the champion, and we already won the battle ... because they experienced (getting to) sit down on the first day of PSLE.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     PSLE ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     schools ']}"

      Training progressive, innovative and open-minded clinicians
  </h1>, 'text': 'Even without the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare sector has already been undergoing numerous changes that are driven by scientific advances, technological breakthroughs and new approaches such as the advent of personalised medicine. To thrive in this rapidly transforming landscape, medical students need to embrace a growth mindset and look beyond their own specialisations to foster collaborations across disciplines and roles.\n“Many healthcare challenges are also intimately intertwined with national challenges, such as an aging population, economic restructuring, digital disruptions, societal trends and evolution, as well as rising population expectations,” said Clinical Professor Hsu Pon Poh, who is chairman of the SingHealth-Duke-NUS and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Clinicians-Innovators Programme, and associate dean of the Office of Academic and Clinical Development at Duke-NUS.\nThe close partnership between Duke-NUS Medical School and SingHealth, Singapore’s largest healthcare group, provides a broad range of opportunities for students to delve into research and innovation to address these challenges. Newly launched institutes like the Academic Medicine Innovation Institute and SingHealth Duke-NUS Regenerative Medicine Institute of Singapore enable students to work with emerging technologies and data, as well as new therapeutics and tools in a multidisciplinary environment – going beyond the traditional tenets of a medical education.\nSaid Prof Hsu: “Medicine was a mastery and combination of arts, science and even philosophy in the past, but in our future daily practice of medicine, we will need elements of cross-boundary collaboration, innovation, disruptive technology and an even larger dose of humanity.”\nHONING BOTH SKILL SETS AND MINDSETS\nClinical Associate Professor Phua Ghee Chee, who is the head and senior consultant of respiratory and critical care medicine at Singapore General Hospital and director of clinical services at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Lung Centre, has seen many changes in his career as a respiratory and intensive care physician.\n“In the past, we did not have the benefit of electronic medical records providing real-time patient data such as vital parameters, blood results and radiology. We also did not have online resources providing information at one’s fingertips. We had to manually trace results by calling the laboratories, retrieving X-ray films and memorising lots of medical information,” he recounted.\nProf Hsu agrees that medicine has changed greatly since the early days of his career: “With the tremendous advances in medicine over the past few decades, medical treatments and care plans for our patients have evolved to be more refined, more sophisticated, precise and complex.”\nTo address this growing complexity, Duke-NUS has built its Doctor of Medicine programme around its Clinicians First, Clinicians Plus vision. Clinicians First, Clinicians Plus aims to produce medical professionals who are competent clinicians first and foremost, and who also expand their capabilities to become clinician-scientists, educators, innovators and leaders.\nOne of its guiding principles lies in actively cultivating diversity in its student body. Duke-NUS seeks out students who hail from a variety of pathways and undergraduate academic disciplines. Building on a unique set of expertise, skills and experiences is essential when it comes to training progressive, innovative and open-minded clinicians who can blaze new paths while ensuring patients receive the best possible care.\nDIGITALLY-DRIVEN, PEOPLE-ORIENTED LEARNING\n\xa0\nDigitalisation in healthcare has been further accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Said Assoc Prof Phua: “The pandemic has provided a catalyst for innovation and transformation. In particular, technology and AI-assisted decision-making will have a major impact. New skill sets and mindsets are required.”\nDuke-NUS Medical School practises a progressive learning pedagogy known as TeamLEAD (Learn, Engage, Apply and Develop) to help its students gain hard and soft capabilities alongside medical knowledge. The pedagogy encourages students to develop critical thinking skills by reading supplemental materials before attending class to ensure that class sessions are more productive as students can engage in small group discussion and collaborative problem-solving.\n“TeamLEAD facilitates strong teamwork and communication,” explained Assoc Prof Phua. “I believe that in order to be future-ready, medical students should be exposed to electives such as innovation, technology, data science, translation research and medical humanities. Finally, strong values are the foundation of the medical profession and inculcating these through mentorship is imperative.”\nBesides offering students many mentorship opportunities in the course of their education, Duke-NUS also assists faculty in becoming impactful mentors through programmes like the AM-ETHOS (Academic Medicine-Enhancing Training, Healthcare, Outcomes & Standards) Academic Mentor Development Fellowship. Fellowship recipients are mentored by senior faculty from Duke Health in Durham, the United States. Subsequently, they will help implement a strong academic mentorship culture and support framework at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre.\nA SENSE OF MISSION, PURPOSE AND EMPATHY\n\xa0\nAccording to Prof Hsu, there are three baskets of skills that medical students have to embrace in order to be successful clinicians: Hardware, which refers to the latest clinical knowledge, technological breakthroughs and skills; software, which includes situational awareness, communication and collaborative skills; and perhaps the most important of all – heartware.\n“A moral compass with true-north values to serve humanity, coupled with a strong sense of mission, clarity of purpose and a lasting passion to serve, is imperative,” said Prof Hsu.\nAssoc Prof Phua agrees. “Technology has improved healthcare. However, I frequently remind students and young doctors to spend more time interacting with patients rather than their computers. Many things may change, but the human connection remains the same.”\nThis is why Duke-NUS students are encouraged to give back through community service projects that range from organising camps for children whose family members have cancer to promoting awareness of mental well-being through a Virtual Pet Therapy Day and volunteering at the Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) Clinic and SilverACE Senior Activity Centre. Beyond doing good, community service projects offer Duke-NUS students the chance to shape their personal values and put them into practice, so that they may be guided by these principles throughout their careers.\nSaid Assoc Prof Phua: “Medical students should take full advantage of the learning opportunities provided by the school to prepare them for the future. They should arm themselves with not just knowledge and skills, but also the attitude and values to be excellent doctors.”\nFind out more about Duke-NUS Medical School.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Duke-NUS Medical School ', '     medical school ', '     education ', '     healthcare ', '     clinicians ']}"

      Quarantined students taking PSLE must inform schools 2 days before paper, take daily COVID-19 tests
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Students who are quarantined and want to take their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) must take daily COVID-19 antigen rapid tests (ART) and inform their school two days before the paper.\nThe first PSLE written paper is scheduled for Thursday (Sep 30) morning.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) announced on Sunday that students who are on quarantine order may be allowed to sit for their national year-end examinations if they test negative for COVID-19.\nThey said that the arrangements for students on quarantine -\xa0a departure from the previous year’s measures\xa0- were made in view of the rising COVID-19 cases.\nAccording to a circular by MOE, parents must inform their child’s school of the quarantine order by noon\xa0and the child’s plans to sit for the paper. This must be done at least two days before the paper.\nAn MOE spokesperson said PSLE candidates on quarantine order who have indicated to their schools that they wish to sit for their papers should wait at their place of residence for their entry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\xa0\nThe test will be administered at their place of residence by swab providers appointed by the Ministry of Health (MOH).\nThe PCR test will take at least 24 hours to be processed and the results\xa0will be made available in the students' HealthHub account.\xa0\nThe MOE circular said students should wait at home for their entry PCR test, rather than “rush down to a clinic”.\nThe spokesperson added that ART kits for the candidate's subsequent use will be separately provided by another service provider appointed by MOH. These would be delivered to their place of residence by the following day after the entry PCR swab.\xa0\n“Once your child has received a (quarantine order), the earliest he or she can sit for the PSLE exam is two days after the day of the notification,” said MOE in the circular.\n“If there is a paper scheduled the next day after the (quarantine order) is received, your child will not be able to sit for it. However, the child can apply for special consideration through the school.”\nParents will not need to inform the school that their child intends to sit for any subsequent papers, said MOE.\nChildren must also do daily ARTs while waiting for the entry PCR test results at home.\nIf the PCR test comes back negative, the child should take an ART that evening, and take a photo of the negative result. This must be done at 6pm before each paper.\nOn the day of the paper, the student’s negative PCR and a photograph of the ART results have to be presented in order for the student to take the PSLE paper.\nStudents will have to continue to do the ARTs the day before the remaining papers.\nIf a student misses one paper while on quarantine order, they can still sit for the remaining papers if their PCR test is negative and the self-swab ART before each exam paper is negative.\n“Students are encouraged to go to school by themselves. Parents under quarantine may accompany their child to the school after satisfying the same testing requirements,” said MOE.\nSuch students should not take public transport. Instead, they should travel directly to the exam venue “by private transport or on foot, with no stops in between”, added the circular.\nMOE and SEAB said on Sunday that students who miss the exams with valid reasons can apply for special consideration.\n“Special consideration is a well-established procedure which awards candidates with projected grades through a fair and rigorous evidence-based methodology,” they said.\n“In awarding a grade for these affected candidates, SEAB will consider multiple sources of data, such as the candidate’s performance in the other papers for that affected subject in national and school-based examinations as well as the school cohort's performance in national and school-based examinations, to ensure a fair assessment for all candidates.\n“All special consideration applications are assessed on each case’s merit, to ensure that the grades awarded are as accurate and fair as possible.”\nFor candidates who miss all papers of a subject, their prelim results will be taken into consideration to determine their relative rank among their peers in the same school cohort.\nThis position will then be used to derive their grade.\nFor candidates who miss one or more papers in a subject, SEAB will use the candidate's performance in the papers they did take to derive a projected outcome for the subject. Their performance in the prelim examinations will also be taken into consideration.\nEditor’s note: An earlier version of this story said a Certis officer will administer the students’ PCR tests and provide ART kits for subsequent use.

      Commentary:  Thinking of pursuing a postgraduate degree to avoid a challenging job market? Think again
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: It is no secret that economic downturns tend to ignite a desire to return to the relatively safe confines of school.\nAs the pandemic rages on, UK universities reported seeing between 10 and 20 per cent more applications for postgraduate degrees, or “panic master’s”, for the fall semester of 2021 compared to 2020.\nIn an uncertain economic environment, fresh graduates have difficulty securing jobs or find their pay severely curtailed, making postgraduate school their last resort for avoiding unemployment, underemployment or intermittent employment.\nWhile the number of Singapore residents enrolled in local higher degree courses has been\xa0rising steadily over the decades (from 4,095 people in 1993 to 21,309 in 2019), there were perceptible spikes during the financial crisis: From 2007 to 2008, and again from 2008 to 2009.\nHowever, when it comes to employability and career progression, the value of a postgraduate degree may not be consistent across industries.\nIn some cases, short skills upgrading courses would suffice. Being open to alternative employment in the form of part-time, contract or project-based work can also help you gain experience and skills that could boost your employment prospects more than a postgraduate degree can.\nWe usually advise candidates to pursue postgraduate studies only if their\xa0current qualifications are limiting their career progression opportunities.\nIn fields such as academia, psychology, medicine and architecture, professional postgraduate degrees are necessary for individuals to gain domain knowledge in a structured manner, be accredited and achieve mobility.\nMaster's in Business Administration (MBA) programmes can also help professionals enhance their career opportunities and get salary raises and promotions. Not only does an MBA have the potential to provide skills and knowledge necessary to start a new business, some employers require an MBA for certain management or leadership positions.\nHowever, this too is fast changing as more hiring managers realise that out-of-the-box thinkers might be more valuable than those with advanced paper qualifications.\nPossessing an MBA no longer makes a candidate an automatic hire. The value of an MBA – along with what new doors it opens and how much more you can make out of it - also depends on which school it’s from.\nYet others pursue adjacent degrees to increase their domain knowledge and expertise in order to enter more specialised fields. For instance, someone with an undergraduate degree in mass communication may choose to specialise in journalism and take up a master’s degree accordingly.\nHowever, bear in mind that employers in this field could be quite happy to provide on-the-job training. Even when it comes to honing other forms of expertise such as leadership, more companies today are willing to provide support in the form of short executive education or in-house training and mentorship programmes \xa0to get you up to speed.\nThis is not to say there is no value in postgraduate degrees. Whether or not to embark on one requires careful consideration.\nIf you are doing so in the hopes that future employers will automatically offer you more money or more senior job roles, think again.\nA Ministry of Manpower report showed that academic qualifications were not the main consideration for employers hiring PMETs in 2018. \nThis applied to 52 per cent of PMET job vacancies and included occupations such as software, web and multimedia developers, systems analysts and commercial and marketing sales executives – a rise from the 42 per cent in 2017.\nInstead, employers were looking for candidates with relevant skills, work experience, soft skills and the right attitudes. \nThis is against a backdrop of more people having to pivot to job roles and fields that have very little to do with the degrees with which they graduated, especially if they were general degrees. \nNew methods of learning are certainly helping people pick up relevant skills more quickly and affordably. Certification courses from prestigious institutions also offer greater flexibility in terms of time and pace of completion, and often at a fraction of the cost of a full-time master’s programme.\nFor example, world-renowned institutes such as MIT offer short courses in various subjects including data analytics. The courses provide domain knowledge and expertise that are increasingly being accepted by employers.\nBoth local and global universities also offer quality executive education programmes for middle and senior-level executives to upskill without having to leave their jobs to pursue full-time postgraduate programmes. \nDespite these caveats, any form of learning is valuable, and most people will not be disappointed if they did it for the right reasons. \nWe have encountered candidates from engineering or science backgrounds who decided to pursue liberal arts postgraduate degrees just to experience and develop a new way of thinking.\nWhile on the surface, some of these programmes may not have a direct impact on career progression or remuneration, they do have the potential to inspire creativity or fresh\xa0thinking in an uncertain world – attributes\xa0much sought after by organisations these days.\xa0\nThe degree alone is not likely to help, but employees\xa0able to use these attributes to solve real-world business problems would be well on their way to a promotion or salary bump.\nOthers might pursue a postgraduate degree merely out of interest or passion for a particular subject. There’s really nothing wrong with this as long as you can afford it and are aware of and accept its limitations in terms of utility in the job market.\nAside from providing an environment and structure for learning, school settings allow you to easily grow your network and open doors to future learning and career opportunities. It beats bemoaning your fate while waiting for the economy to improve.\nHowever, taking on contract or project-based work in a bad economy could also help you achieve some of these objectives. Many have chosen this path while supplementing work with learning in the form of short courses.\nA candidate I met recently took a series of coding courses while doing project management work on a part-time basis. He is now working full-time as a coder in a start-up. \nThis shows that in the absence of full-time employment, taking refuge in school may not necessarily be the best way to spend your time and money.\nEven amid the current crisis, seasonally adjusted job vacancies in Singapore rose to an all-time high of 92,100 in June as ongoing border restrictions affected the availability of manpower in the construction and manufacturing sectors and sustained demand across growth sectors. \nAmong these roles, there could be opportunities to augment your skills, experience and network in full-time, part-time, project or short-term contract positions. \nDuring a period of prolonged uncertainty, being open to options is especially vital.\nJaime Lim is Group Business Leader of\xa0PeopleSearch, an executive search and outplacement services firm with a presence in six cities including Singapore.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     jobs ', '     careers ']}"

      Students on quarantine or health risk warning may sit for PSLE, national year-end exams: MOE
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Students who are on quarantine order or health risk warning may be allowed to sit for their national year-end examinations if they test negative for COVID-19, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) on Sunday (Sep 26).\nIn a joint press release, they said that the arrangements for students on quarantine - a departure from the previous year’s measures - were made in view of the rising COVID-19 cases.\nA set of procedures has been approved by the Ministry of Health (MOH) for students who have been placed on quarantine but are otherwise well, to be allowed to apply for leave from quarantine to sit for their exams, said MOE and SEAB.\n“While special consideration will be applied to cases with valid reasons, we recognise that there would still be instances where the candidate would still wish to have the opportunity to take their national year-end examination,” the press release said.\nThis option will be made available to all national examination candidates this year, starting from the PSLE examinations beginning on Sep 30 and the GCE N(A)/N(T), O-Level and A-Level examinations thereafter.\nThe candidates will have to test negative for their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) entry swab at the beginning of the quarantine order. They will also have to produce negative antigen rapid tests (ART) before each examination paper.\nThe arrangements exclude science practical examinations, where candidates may have to share lab equipment or move about the lab, and examinations with mask-off activities, such as music performing exams that require candidates to play wind instruments or sing.\nRooms used for candidates on quarantine will be thoroughly wiped down after the examinations. Candidates will also need to observe the following measures:\nMOE said that they will provide details of the requirements to candidates “in due course”, including the application procedure and the expected timelines for processing such applications.\nIn August 2021, MOH and SEAB announced that students on a leave of absence may sit for the year-end exams if they regularly test negative for COVID-19. They said then that students on quarantine could not sit for the year-end exams.\nStudents who are COVID-19 positive or on stay-home notices will continue to not be allowed to sit for the exams.\nFor PSLE candidates who have to be accompanied to the examination venue, a similar leave arrangement has been approved by the Health Ministry for an accompanying family member or caregiver, should they also be under quarantine.\nBoth the candidate and their accompanying family member must satisfy a rigorous testing requirement and follow the procedure as detailed below:\nMOE and SEAB added that they have updated arrangements for candidates who are on approved absence due to being placed on MOH's mandatory testing regime or health risk warning alert.\nIn addition to testing negative in their MOH-mandated entry PCR test, candidates must also perform self-swabs with ART kits at regular intervals and inform their schools of the outcome before their examination. This must be done until their approved absence is rescinded.\nThe remaining arrangements and prevailing safe management measures for the national year-end exams announced in August will continue to be in place, MOE and SEAB said.\nHere is an updated summary of the arrangements for the 2021 national year-end exams written examinations beginning from Sep 30:\nIn the release, MOE and SEAB said that students who miss the exams with valid reasons can apply for special consideration.\n“Special consideration is a well-established procedure which awards candidates with projected grades through a fair and rigorous evidence-based methodology,” they said.\n“In awarding a grade for these affected candidates, SEAB will consider multiple sources of data, such as the candidate’s performance in the other papers for that affected subject in national and school-based examinations as well as the school cohort's performance in national and school-based examinations, to ensure a fair assessment for all candidates.\n“All special consideration applications are assessed on each case’s merit, to ensure that the grades awarded are as accurate and fair as possible.”\nFor candidates who miss all papers of a subject, their prelim results will be taken into consideration to determine their relative rank among their peers in the same school cohort.\nThis position will then be used to derive their grade.\nFor candidates who miss one or more papers in a subject, SEAB will use the candidate's performance in the papers they did take to derive a projected outcome for the subject.

      Climate education still a ‘peripheral topic’ in Southeast Asia’s syllabus amid calls to make it compulsory
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: When children step into Green School Bali, their experience is designed to be intimately entwined with nature. From the bamboo classrooms and jungle surrounds, to lessons focused on solving the challenges facing the planet, the notions of what education has traditionally looked like and sought to achieve have been upended here.\n“A big part of educating for sustainability is finding that reconnection with nature that humans have lost over the years. It’s embedded in everything we do,” said Sal Gordon, the school’s head of teaching.\n“It’s the rain, it’s the mud, it’s the snakes, it’s the gardens, it’s the rice fields. Our campus and nature itself is part of our classroom.”\xa0\nThe curriculum here is focused on empowering young people to become community-minded citizens with the skills to make an impact now and into the future. Sustainability is at the heart of the school’s mission and the challenges of climate change take centre stage.\nLearning facts and taking tests, elements of schooling ingrained in classrooms across the globe, are replaced by projects with real-world applications and impact.\n“Our students are able to understand that their learning is connected to the natural world even if it’s just through the physical environment and that their learning can have a positive impact moving towards a sustainable environment as well,” Gordon said.\n“Education has been stuck in a time capsule for 200 years. It’s out of date but if you can change that model you will automatically start educating for a sustainable future.”\nModels like this one are rare anywhere in the world, let alone Southeast Asia, where the wider implementation of climate education has been challenging.But there is a push for action to make learning focused on climate change, the environment and civic engagement, a greater priority for governments.\xa0\xa0\nAt upcoming climate change talks in Glasgow next month, a coalition led by non-governmental organisation EARTHDAY.ORG will be pushing for climate change education to be made compulsory in every classroom in the world.\nHundreds of organisations have signed up to a letter to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the influential International Trades Union Confederation and Education International, both representing millions of teachers and workers.\nThey want new standards and ambitions that could end up resonating in classrooms across this region and the world.Nick\xa0Nuttall, the international strategic communications director for EARTHDAY.ORG said climate education as a concept has long been present in international doctrines but rarely been a priority for collective action and overshadowed by temperature rise targets and emissions accounting.\nRight now, it is largely absent from national curriculums and only taught piece-meal by enthusiastic teachers or forward thinking schools, the former spokesperson for the UNFCCC told CNA.\n“The fact is that only one country in the 20 years that governments have been talking about this under the climate change treaty has grasped the nettle and included climate change education and woven it right across their national curriculum. And that’s Italy,” Nuttall said.\xa0\nAt present, Italy is the only country to have placed climate change and sustainability at the core of its school curriculum. Beginning in September last year, students aged between 6 and 19 have had these topics engrained into their daily lessons.\nResearch shows that the impacts of such education can be significant globally when measured.The Brookings Institution found that if just 16 per cent of high school students in high and middle-income countries received climate change education, the result would be a nearly 19 gigaton reduction of carbon dioxide by 2050.\nThat number can be amplified by educating millions of girls who remain out of school in the developing world, the study found. It suggests that education could be a more powerful lever to combating climate change than increasing investments in solar or wind energy.\xa0\nIn addition, reductions in climate change vulnerability to extreme weather events and temperatures in the developing world could be realised simply by educating young women.\n“Technology will get you so far, but what you need is a behavioural change that comes through education. Because you need citizens to be able to hold governments to account for their inspiring actions or their failed decisions,” Nuttall said.\n“You need to build a green consumer movement and you also need to build the entrepreneurs and creative skills for the new kinds of technologies, policies, business models that some people broadly call the green economy,” he said.\n“This case is being made very clearly right now. Why are we educating young people about climate change? It’s their future and it’s going to be a very different future.”\nIn Southeast Asia, a region already feeling the impacts of climate change, the rollout of education programs with an emphasis on sustainability has been slow.\nWhile some countries have provisions for sustainability in their education plans, there are gaps, inconsistencies and inequities.\xa0\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) admits the hurdles are steep in this region, despite some positive signs of a willingness to take education on sustainable development (ESD) more seriously.\xa0\nIn a policy review report this year, it concluded that climate change education (CCE) “has not emerged as an independent field” and is “still very much in its infancy” in Southeast Asia.\n“CCE is still a peripheral topic in both educational research and practice. It is important to anticipate the possible scenarios under which this minor educational theme could develop into a central focus of education and become established as an independent concept and focus area,” the report stated.\nThe divide between urban and rural schools, international schools and state schools and those in national languages against ethnic dialects is a problem for education generally. But it widens when it comes to climate change topics.\n“Already there are deeply embedded inequalities in education where access to equitable education for the poor is a major challenge,” said Faryal Khan, a programme specialist for education, based at UNESCO in Bangkok.\n“Do they have access to climate change education? And are their teachers prepared? This is questionable. We can guess somewhat at the answers. It’s not a very equal situation.”\xa0\nBut Khan says there are signs of slow progress. The Adiwiyata Green Schools program in Indonesia tries to integrate ESD into the classroom and create an eco-friendly atmosphere for environmentally-conscious students.\nThailand and Vietnam both have sustainability built into their national education frameworks, while Philippine schools have largely focused on individual actions, with students taught to care for in-school gardens and understand waste management,\nActivists there are hoping to persuade regional education departments to include tailored lessons about climate adaptation and broader science about the man-made causes of climate change.\xa0\n“Some teachers are very open to changing their ways of teaching. But as of right now, it’s very outdated and focused more on the individuals rather than holding the major polluters accountable,” said Xian Guevarra, the national coordinator for Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines (YACAP).\xa0\n“People have always been saying, ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’, and ‘live a zero waste lifestyle’. And while we’re not saying that’s bad, it’s not actually the solution. We need to change the system to fix the climate crisis that we’re currently facing,” he said.\nWhile frameworks and guidelines are in place, UNESCO wants to see improved national level policies that filter down to schools of all kinds.\n“While countries are making advances, some of the challenges that remain are at the policy level,” Khan said.\n“ESD is interpreted with a very narrow focus on topical issues rather than with a holistic view and there are gaps between governments’ initial policy commitments and implementation.\n“Teachers are really at the heart of ESD, but often they are not prepared. They have to sometimes scramble to find resources, because most of the in-service training that teachers have does not include education for sustainable development or climate change,” she said\nHOW CAN SCHOOL SYSTEMS MOVE FASTER?\nWhile institutions like Green School Bali can move dynamically, adjusting their curriculum to changing world events and situations, the sometimes slow moving nature of national ministries makes it hard for learning materials to stay modern and relevant.\nSunita Rajakumar, the founder of Climate Governance Malaysia, spends her working days speaking with top company leaders. She says even private businesses are struggling to keep pace.She has backed the plans to make climate education compulsory, but worries about the ability of large government ministries in Malaysia to make systemic changes fast enough to contend with the urgency of climate change.\xa0\n“The Ministry of Education is one of the largest in the government. It’s this huge aircraft carrier. It’s not going to be able to pivot on a dime,” she said.“When there’s something disruptive, it really takes a lot to have this paradigm shift. The measure to increase resilience has to be educating this next generation.”\nCOVID-19 has hampered progress in this space. Students across the region have missed hundreds of days of in-person learning. The result has been school systems falling back on what has always been done, in the form of traditional teaching.Harriet Burrows, Green School Bali’s head of high school says she believes the solution is for national systems to move away from a focus on content and instead build students’ skills.“Do we ask our students to show up every day with the willingness and eagerness to question, to think critically and to solve and adapt? \n“That’s a big shift for national systems because they’re rooted in the idea of memorising content to prove you’re intelligent, you’re ready for the workforce and you’re ready for the world,” she said.\n“It will take some of these young people to get into those systems and be given voices in those systems to really enable that change to happen.”\xa0\nThe lack of government-mandated climate education has opened the door to education entrepreneurs to fill a gap.\nThe founders of Earth Warriors, a global early childhood education curriculum, noticed a lack of climate education content available to any children under the age of 11. Keya Lamba and Shweta Bahri have designed materials suitable for those aged between 3 and 7, which they hope will be adopted by schools around the world. Their courses have been peer reviewed and supported by climate scientists.\n“Our whole mission and belief is that if you build these sustainable habits at a young age, then being a conscious citizen that cares about the planet comes as naturally to these kids as brushing their teeth,” Lamba said.\n“There’s a lot of evidence that shows this is true. It can also nudge the adults around them as well,” she said. \n""We try to show that kids are the ones demanding and making the changes. Climate change education has to be everywhere at every age group. It’s so critical and it’s surprising that it’s not taken very seriously or urgently.”\nThey aim to challenge assumptions that learning about climate change is too complex or daunting for children, and eventually advocate for governments to include this type of material themselves.\nFrom their research, they say there is no formal inclusion of climate education in Southeast or South Asia. But they first plan to deliberately target schools with higher fees, like those that use international curriculums.\xa0 “We made a very conscious decision. Research shows that it’s people from higher income backgrounds that are contributing a lot more to climate change than people from lower income backgrounds,” Bahri said.\nChildren are already highly exposed to the impacts of climate change. The recently released Children’s Climate Risk Index from UNICEF found that more than 99 per cent of children are exposed to at least one major climate and environmental hazard, shock or stress, “creating a child’s rights crisis”.\nClimate impacts such as flooding, cyclones, water scarcity, disease and air pollution overlap and compound in many parts of the world. Children in those often-poor parts of the world face even more future risks.\nIt is a further reason why experts want to accelerate the ability of young people to contribute to solutions and feel empowered to tackle these inherited issues. “There’s a growing recognition that we owe something to them, that they have a voice and a seat at the table,” Rajakumar of Climate Governance Malaysia said.\n“And there’s no silver bullet. There’s no dashboard, no roadmap, so why not invite the children to the table as well?”\n', 'related_topics': ['     climate change ', '     education ', '     United Nations ', '     environment ']}"

      'Complete strategy ready' to guarantee quality of Yale-NUS faculty until 2025 closure: College leadership
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Some faculty turnover at the Yale-NUS College is to be expected over the next few years in the lead-up to its closure in 2025, but plans are in place to bring in instructors from the National University of Singapore (NUS) should the need arise, said the college leadership.\xa0\nSpeaking to parents of Yale-NUS and University Scholars Programme (USP) students in a townhall meeting on Friday night (Sep 17), NUS president Tan Eng Chye and Yale-NUS College leadership responded to questions about ensuring the quality of the faculty during the transition period.\nNUS announced on Aug 27 that Yale-NUS and USP will be combined into a single college from 2022. Yale-NUS will close in 2025, ceasing Yale University’s collaboration with NUS, and its 2021 intake will be its last batch.\nThe announcement was met by surprise and confusion by alumni and students, with some saying they ""didn’t see it coming"".\nHundreds of parents subsequently called on Prof Tan to hold a townhall meeting to answer their\xa0""urgent and pertinent questions"", rejecting his suggestion to meet with them in person in small groups.\nA video of the virtual townhall meeting was put up on YouTube on Saturday.\nIn the video that was uploaded, executive vice president of academic affairs at Yale-NUS Joanne Roberts said that just like any institution, the college has “faculty turnover every single year"", and that this was to be expected over the next few years as well.\xa0\n“In response to that, we’re already planning to bring in some excellent instructors from NUS. I’ve had a number of Yale visiting professors who’ve already approached me who’d like to come between now and 2025,” she said.\xa0\nMany of the faculty members ""are extremely motivated"" to be part of the Yale-NUS project, Prof Roberts added.\xa0\nOn the day of the announcement, six people told her that they intended to teach at the college until 2025, she shared.\xa0\n“(They said) \'I want to teach here until 2025. I feel I have an obligation to these students, I want to be part of this until the end.\' I\'ve had many many people say that and this is something we\'re really going to be attuned to in planning the transition of our faculty from Yale-NUS to NUS,” she added.\xa0\n“We know that you chose Yale-NUS because of small classes and exceptional faculty. And we have a complete strategy ready to ensure that we guarantee that to you going forward.”\xa0\nAccording to Prof Tan, NUS has 1,600 tenure-track faculty members, and another 1,200 educator-track and practice-track faculty.\xa0\n“We can always make arrangements to support Yale-NUS when there’s a need,” he said at the townhall.\nThe decision to close Yale-NUS was “basically accelerated” before the programmes had a chance to ""dilute itself"", said Prof Tan in the townhall.\xa0\nContinuing status quo at Yale-NUS after ""premium funding"" from the Ministry of Education (MOE) ended in March 2022 would have been a “major challenge” and a negative impact on the overall quality of the school’s programmes, he added.\xa0\n“If I do not do anything to Yale-NUS, the programmes will start to dilute itself. And we feel that this is the best time, because we are actually combining them in a position of strength, rather than we allow Yale-NUS to dilute and possibly to disappear,"" said Prof Tan.\xa0\n“So I have basically accelerated the closure. There\'s no need actually to do that, but it\'s just that my entire system at NUS, we have changed to be similar to Yale-NUS, such a merger makes sense.”\xa0\nProf Tan was responding to a question from a parent about whether financial sustainability was the main consideration for the closure, and whether other alternatives were considered.\xa0\nMaking Yale-NUS financially sustainable was a problem he had been “thinking hard about” since he became president of the university in 2018, said Prof Tan during the townhall.\xa0\n“I have worked with Yale-NUS senior leadership on how we can address this change when the premium funding reverts to normal funding, and our conclusion is this - that continuing status quo for Yale-NUS will be a major challenge,” said Prof Tan.\xa0\n“And if you look at the financial sustainability, this will negatively impact the overall quality of Yale-NUS programmes, the gap is actually sizable enough to have this negative impact.”\xa0\nProf Tan also answered a question from a parent about how much deficit Yale-NUS was facing.\nEducation Minister Chan Chun Sing said in Parliament last week that\xa0MOE provided about S$48 million to the college in operating grants per year for its about 1,000 students in 2020, he noted.\xa0\nOn a per-student basis, this is more than double that of a humanities and science student\xa0in NUS, said Mr Chan at the time.\xa0\n""So if you look at this number, and in the context that this is the premium funding which the Government has actually provided for 10 years since its inception,"" said Prof Tan.\xa0\n""Just by this statement, you can guess that the deficit is at least S$24 million because it\'s more than double.""\nFinancing a university is ""actually more complicated"" and involves a component called ""total income contribution"", which acts to widen this gap every year, said Prof Tan.\n""So you actually have an increasing gap of at least S$24 million ... To have Yale-NUS at status quo will be a big challenge because of this.\n""You would have to trim the benefits, you would not be able to have the eight students to one faculty ratio. You may not even be able to provide the generous financial aid that Yale-NUS is now providing, and many other things.""\nBoth Yale-NUS and USP are recognised for their “high-quality” programmes with good outcomes, said Prof Tan.\xa0\n“This is the best time for me to pivot both programmes for the future and pivoting from a position of strength, not allowing any one of them to be diluted before we are forced to re-pivot,” he said.\xa0\n“And in our consideration, the new college is the best way forward in the next stage of growth and progress for both Yale-NUS as well as USP.”\nProf Tan also highlighted the wider curriculum changes ongoing at NUS, including introducing a general education or common curriculum for graduates, and the interdisciplinary College of Humanities and Sciences as well as College of Design and Engineering.\xa0\n“In fact, we are changing to a system that is closer or similar to Yale-NUS, that actually allows this merger to happen,” he added.\xa0\n“Last year, a merger would not make sense, because there would be incompatibilities between Yale-NUS and USP.\xa0\n“But because we have changed all of our big faculties to a framework that is similar to Yale-NUS, And because of that USP also has to change, to adapt to a framework that is similar to Yale-NUS, and that makes a merger possible.”\xa0\nAt the end of the session, Prof Tan also said he was willing to consider a face-to-face session with a smaller group of parents.\xa0\nThe townhall to engage parents was a “good gesture”, where NUS “tried to be more transparent”, a parent who attended the townhall told CNA.\xa0\nThe parent, who only wanted to be known as Joanne, is part of a 300-member chat group set up by parents of Yale-NUS\xa0students.\xa0\n“One population has been quite forgotten - the actual students themselves because they are the casualties, so to speak, of this saga. I feel that their voices have not been heard enough,” said Joanne, whose son is a second-year student in the college.\xa0\n“We’ve heard the administrators, of course, the so-called different key heads, the different presidents, the voices of the parents, but I felt the people that really mattered the most, the students have not been heard.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     NUS ', '     Yale-NUS ']}"

      Gaining strength, resilience and an edge in the working world 
  </h1>, 'text': 'A childhood spent reading crime novels and a gift for listening to the problems of her schoolmates proved instrumental behind Ms Ariel Lim’s choice to pursue a degree in psychology. It was a decision that shaped her for life, and one that has given her far more than just academic knowledge and professional skills. \nNow 33, Ms Lim graduated from James Cook University (JCU) with a Bachelor of Psychology in 2011. After her graduation from Pioneer Junior College, Ms Lim evaluated all her options, which included a local university,\xa0before settling on an overseas degree from James Cook University’s Singapore campus.\n\nIn contrast to JCU’s focused trimester structure that allows students to receive their degree in a shorter timeframe, the local university had a strict four-year-long programme with first-year modules that Ms Lim felt were not relevant to her desired field of study. In addition, she preferred studying directly at JCU – as opposed to having her modules administered through a third-party educational institution – and liked the fact that Australian psychology degree programmes had a robust reputation. \n“Also, JCU has a psychology clinic\xa0in Singapore that is open to the public, and students can gain practical experience there,” said Ms Lim. “This showed that JCU was serious about training students in this area.”\nGETTING SUPPORT FOR MATH, AND MORE\nStatistics, a math-based subject, is an essential part of psychology studies. For Ms Lim, the statistics module proved to be a bugbear since she had struggled with mathematics since secondary school. “Despite putting in more effort into mathematics than my other subjects, it had always been my lowest scoring subject,” she shared candidly.\nAt JCU, Ms Lim coped with the help of her study group, which tutored her in statistics. She also credits two of her JCU lecturers who made time after classes to assist her study group. “The lecturers were very encouraging when I made mistakes – and instead of providing solutions, they would nudge us to think a little more in the right direction, so that we learnt and understood the concepts. I really appreciate them because they kept believing in me, which motivated me to keep going.”\nOutside of statistics, Ms Lim and her classmates were able to put their psychology training to immediate use, learning to better themselves with the help of lecturers. “Our lecturers saw and listened to us as individuals,” she recounted. “Our past experiences were acknowledged, especially during the modules on counselling, trauma, and personality psychology. These experiences helped me understand my strengths and work on my weaknesses, and in turn helped me to grow more aware and more respectful of others’ experiences.” \nREADY FOR THE WORKING WORLD AND BEYOND\nMs Lim reckons that studying at JCU offered her a taste of diversity,\xa0citing the many working professionals of different ages and nationalities who were her classmates. “They had many valuable experiences to share, not only about their work – which we found fascinating – but also life experiences.”\nThis exposure to a broad range of students stood Ms Lim in good stead when she embarked on a career in human resources after graduation. “As my job scope involved working with people, JCU’s psychology programme equipped me with priceless people skills that served me well, such as empathy, listening and counselling.”\n\nIn 2019, Ms Lim – who has loved singing since young – left her corporate job to focus full-time on her company Relentless Vocal Studio, after having been a part-time voice teacher since 2015. She continues to use the training she received in university to help students overcome barriers in their vocal progress. \n“For example, I’ve found that some students fear singing above a certain loudness due to how they were required to be quiet at home,” she explained. “Strategies like openly addressing anxieties that the singer faces and working together with them for solutions can encourage and motivate them. They are able to break through the fear that has held them back for years, and I have to thank JCU for equipping me with these skills to touch lives, one at a time.”\nOn a personal note, Ms Lim said that studying in JCU showed her that there was no “correct” or “best” way to lead her life. “Interacting with my diverse group of peers who have made – and are still making – bold, unconventional decisions and are finding fulfilment at work by impacting lives, inspires and emboldens me to do things differently,” she reflected. “I would say I have become a more accepting person who dares to take more risks and is more resilient.” \nFind out more about James Cook University’s Bachelor of Psychological Science programme at Virtual Admissions Day on Sep 25.\n', 'related_topics': ['     James Cook University ', '     psychology ', '     education ']}"

      Back to school: Thailand prepares to resume classes with strict COVID-19 measures
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANGKOK: Thailand unveiled various strict COVID-19 control measures on Tuesday (Sep 14) in preparation for classes to resume in schools.\nKnown as Sandbox Safety Zone in School (SSS), the initiative was jointly developed by the education and public health ministries. The measures aim to create a safety zone in educational institutes once they are allowed to resume on-site operations.\xa0\n“The Public Health Ministry is fully aware that it is crucial for students to go to school as usual because it affects the interactions among themselves and their interactions with society. Besides, there are many activities that children cannot fully learn online,” said Dr Suwanchai Watthanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Health Department, in a press conference on Tuesday.\nMany schools in Thailand have remained closed for several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\xa0\nHowever, on-site learning is expected to resume in the second semester in November as the government plans to vaccinate 4.5\xa0million children aged between 12 and 17 next month.\nUnder the SSS initiative, educational institutes will be categorised according to the severity of the transmission in their respective provinces, from green to yellow, orange, red and dark red. Each category will entail different COVID-19 control measures.\nThese include the requirement for educational institutes to assess their readiness for on-site education based on guidelines provided by the Health Department and to carry out learning activities in small groups.\nThose located in the high risk zones such as Bangkok will need to conduct COVID-19 rapid antigen tests one or two times per week. They are also required to issue a school pass for every student, teacher and educational staff for screening and monitoring purposes.\n“The school pass will contain information such as their personal risk assessment, results of their rapid antigen tests, vaccination records or medical history going back one to three months in case they’ve been infected before,” said Dr Suwanchai of the Health Department.\nBefore on-site learning can resume, each school must also ensure that at least 85 per cent of the teachers and staff have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. If an infection is detected, the school is required to strictly follow the Public Health Ministry’s incident action plan.\nFor the red and dark red zones, businesses located within a 10m radius of the schools are also required to conduct risk assessment and adopt the so-called “COVID Free Setting” measures developed by the health department.\xa0\nThey include limited seating, regular cleaning of surfaces and weekly COVID-19 rapid antigen tests among employees, among others.\n“Although we’ve developed all these measures, we can’t avoid the possibility of detecting infections. That’s why we’ve designed an incident action plan and practised it. We’ve also prepared what we call ‘school isolation areas’. We can’t let the children do e-learning from home forever,” Dr Suwanchai said.\xa0\n“Various measures have been designed to create safety for students, communities and their families.”\nThe SSS initiative has been implemented in boarding schools during the trial period. Each school is divided into three zones, including the screening zone, the quarantine zone and the safety zone, where students and teachers can carry out activities close to normal.\nData from the Health Ministry showed a continued increase of COVID-19 infections among school-age children and adolescents, which went from 2,426 in April to 69,628 in August.\nAccording to Dr Chawetsan Namwat, the emergency health hazard and disease control director of the Disease Control Department, 30 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine will arrive in Thailand later this year and will be used to inoculate secondary school and vocational students.\xa0\nSince Feb 28, 40.95 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Thailand.\xa0\nAccording to Dr Chawetsan, 38.2 per cent of the population or about 27.54 million people have received their first shot and 17.8 per cent have been fully vaccinated.\n""Educational institutes in each area will report the numbers of students to the respective provincial public health office for vaccine allocation, which will begin in October,” said Dr Chawetsan.\nAbout 2 million doses will be dispatched in the first two weeks of October, followed by 2 million doses in the third week and 1 million doses in the fourth week, he added.\n“Then we will use another allocation plan for November. The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine will be administered in two doses, about three to four weeks apart.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

They must also complete a compulsory travel preparedness module, and will be briefed before going overseas.\xa0\nStudents will be covered under the NUS Student Travel Insurance Policy, which covers expenses for COVID-19 medical treatment, and NUS will “keep in regular contact” with them while they are overseas, the spokesperson added.\xa0\nSMU students will only be allowed to travel for overseas programmes to countries that are “deemed safe” by the Ministry of Health, said the university’s spokesperson.\xa0\nThey will also need to be fully vaccinated before they are considered for the programme, and SMU will provide travel insurance coverage, the spokesperson added.\xa0\nAfter “careful deliberation of the safety considerations” for the resumption of its international student exchange programme, SMU decided in August to resume the programme from Term 2 of this academic year, which starts in January 2022.\xa0\n“The University’s International Office has been in touch with our network of partner universities to discuss and plan international student exchange programme details on a regular basis and is able to facilitate student exchanges when travel restrictions are lifted. We have subsequently informed our students of the lifting of travel restrictions,” the spokesperson said.\xa0\nOf SMU’s partner universities, more than 80 per cent are open to accepting exchange students subject to local health and border control conditions, the spokesperson added.\xa0\nThe university has received about 800 applications for the exchange programme, said the SMU spokesperson.\xa0\n“We are still in the process of receiving and assessing applications, as well as communicating with our partner universities to confirm the number of placements available,” the spokesperson said.\xa0\n“We hope to place as many of them as possible in the programme, subject to prevailing health and border control conditions at the start of the semester.”\nNTU is “looking into” resuming its overseas exchange programmes, said the university’s spokesperson.\xa0\n“The university is monitoring the global situation and is planning appropriate measures in line with national guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of our students,” said the spokesperson. \xa0\n“Apart from the academic requirements that students need to fulfil, they must also meet the immigration requirements and border measures set by both the Singapore government and their host countries.”\xa0\nThese requirements may include COVID-19 tests, vaccinations, insurance coverage and self-isolation requirements. The university’s virtual overseas programmes will also continue for this semester, and are “currently being reviewed” for the next, which starts in January 2022.\xa0\nAt the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), inbound and outbound overseas programmes are still being conducted virtually, said the university’s spokesperson.\xa0\nHowever, SUSS is exploring starting overseas travel programmes from June 2022, with partner universities in the Greater China Region and Australia, the spokesperson added.\xa0\n“Partnership discussions on overseas academic exchanges are still ongoing, with many partner universities in Asia Pacific remaining cautious on student mobility programmes.\n“Beyond student vaccination, SUSS takes into consideration a range of other factors in assessing the resumption of our overseas programmes. This includes risk assessment of COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries, and entry and quarantine requirements.”\xa0\nThe Singapore University of Technology and Design is “still in the process” of finalising plans to resume international exchanges, said a spokesperson.\xa0\n“Due to the volatile pandemic situation overseas, we will be taking a careful and calibrated approach by reviewing all our overseas programmes in detail before making a decision.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     NUS ', '     NTU ', '     SMU ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: P1 registration changes – what would it take for us to believe ‘every school is a good school’?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It is safe to say that when you ask parents what is a “good” school, most, if not all, will name a school with a brand name – somewhere not easy to get into, has a storied alumni and churns out great results. \nBut if you check out Education Minister Chan Chun Sing’s Facebook page, you’d find a Woodgrove Primary teacher dressed in a bear suit, dramatising scenes from the beloved children’s story, We\'re Going on a Bear Hunt. \nAccording to his post, dressing up is common at the school as students are encouraged to bring their own props as part of the Applied Learning Programme.\nDoesn’t that sound like a good school too?\nI thought about this when recent changes to the Primary 1 registration process became the subject of most Whatsapp chat groups over the weekend. Parents have pored over the announced move to discern the implications for next year’s enrolment exercise.\nThe hive mind has concluded that combining Phases 2A(1) and 2A(2) and shifting 20 places from the new Phase 2A to the proximity phase (Phase 2C) will naturally mean that parents with prior links to schools face the uncertainty of being squeezed.\nSome say this will compel more from affected groups to move within 1 km of their school of choice, so their child has one more chance of applying for the school. \xa0\nFor prestigious schools in the Bukit Timah or Bishan districts, there is already a natural barrier to entry: A hefty property price tag to qualify for Phase 2C. \xa0\nFor a 1,000 sq ft condominium in Bukit Timah, you’d be looking to fork out over S$2 million, compared to half the price for a place in Punggol. \nThe 1 to 2 km radius policy has already created a vicious cycle, where “high demand for places at prestigious schools drives up prices of nearby homes, with well-to-do families snapping up these flats,” according to a 2018 TODAY report.\nChanges to the registration system, meant to allow more to study somewhere closer to home, is unfortunately likely to oil the wheels of this cycle even more. \nParents say they have little choice but to participate in this rat race to give their brood the “best start” but we do have options if we cared to look. \nI gave up my alumni seat at a good school because it was further away from our home. Instead, we enrolled our children into mission schools at Phase 2B on the basis of our church affiliations. On hindsight, it was the best decision we made.\nMy girl’s current school is hardly oversubscribed; at Phase 2C there are ample spaces to accept both citizens and permanent residents. Despite the school’s underwhelming popularity, my daughter thrived under the guidance of some very caring teachers. \nAlthough she began her educational journey a shy and quiet girl in class, she was given opportunities to step up and serve, culminating in her selection into the prefect captain team this year. \xa0\nA friend also shared a similar story with her daughter’s school, which she chose for its proximity to home and religious values. That there was no history of balloting in this school was a plus for her.\nShe tells me her girls had a lot of nurturing and fun in the school: “The teachers really go out of their way to organise interesting and fun activities each year, including post-PSLE activities like movie outings and trampoline sessions. Because it has ample spaces at Phase 2C, my kids have had classmates from Myanmar, Korea, Australia, India, Philippines and Vietnam.”\nThese anecdotes are likely replicated across thousands of families who looked beyond the traditional marker of what a good school entailed. \nWe can probably find such uplifting examples from prestigious schools too. But if we don’t hear of such stories from lesser-known schools, we’d just assume it doesn’t exist.\nA friend who has taught in both lesser known and well-known schools tell me the biggest myth parents have about getting their kids into a ""good school"" is that they would automatically excel. \nBut the reality is the children who enter prestigious schools typically receive more tuition and home support.\nLet’s also not just judge a school solely by the grades that it produces.\nAfter all, school isn’t just about doing well, but it’s also about being well, which is where positive relationships with teachers and peers come in.\nWe all know how critical teachers can be to our kids’ educational journeys and know one or two educators who have been pivotal – regardless of school status – so shouldn’t parents start looking at who their kids will be spending time with rather than where?\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, “a student who feels a strong personal connection to her teacher, talks with her teacher frequently, and receives more constructive guidance and praise rather than just criticism from her teacher … is likely to trust her teacher more, show more engagement in learning, behave better in class and achieve at higher levels academically.”\nThe questions remain: Do we just not buy into the mantra that “every school is a good school”, in their own ways? Is there a way to enable more schools to become “good schools”? And to help lesser-known schools get onto the radar screens of parents?\nPerhaps by investing more in such schools, developing niche CCAs, beefing up its teaching and support staff, or even having smaller class sizes to make them more attractive, we can help parents look at them differently. \nFor example, Horizon Primary features an interesting Applied Learning Programme in Computational Thinking in Mathematics, which allows students to develop coding skills and deepen their understanding of mathematical concepts through block-based programming.\xa0 \nStudents there also get the opportunity to learn about Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits of Highly Effective People in the school’s Learning for Life programme.\nGoing beyond allowing each school to have a unique selling proposition, we could also consider giving them a social media boost.\nInstead of waiting to be featured on the Education Minister’s social media, schools should be resourced to build their own online presence. \nTake a leaf from Anderson Primary’s Facebook page, where the school’s Primary 4 Bully-Free Ambassadors were recently featured sharing their vision of a bully-free school.\nReal-life stories like these that go beyond highlighting academic grades and co-curricular achievements help to make an impression on parents’ minds. \nThey also help remind us of the broader goals of education.\nIf we can help every school develop and profile the good work they are doing – going beyond grades to spotlight the quality of relationships within the school, and confidence and well-being of students – perhaps parents will be emboldened to navigate away from their narrow ideas of what makes a school good.\nIf you are a parent who will enrol your child into school at some point, remember that there is no real way of discovering a school’s unique strengths and weaknesses, and you’d have to rely on hearsay, which is often based on perception rather than facts.\nPrestigious schools may have the “value-adds” of a large alumni network and secondary school affiliation, but all schools do have exemplary teachers and students – and positive stories that arise out of these relationships. \nIf more can be done on the ground level to help these schools build their reputation and reach the right constituents, there could be less jostling for spaces at every phase.\nAnd instead of all the stress created in gunning for branded schools with limited places, we can finally shift our attention to the wonderful schools scattered around the island.\nJune Yong is a mother of three, a freelance writer and owner of\xa0Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Primary School registration ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Yale-NUS College did not reach fundraising target ‘through no fault of its own’, transition to new college will reduce costs: Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Yale-NUS College has not reached its fundraising target “through no fault of its own”, and the transition to the new college will reduce costs ""to some extent"", said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Sep 13).\xa0\nThis was a “relevant consideration” in the decision to close Yale-NUS College and merge it with the University Scholars Programme (USP) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), but not the “main motivation for the change”, he added.\xa0\nNUS announced in August that the two programmes would be combined into a single new college from 2022, and that Yale-NUS’ 2021 intake would be its last.\nStudents of the new college will read a new common curriculum adapted from “the best of both the USP and Yale-NUS foundations” enhanced with science, technology, engineering and mathematics elements, NUS said at the time.\xa0\n""When we first decided to set up\xa0YNC (Yale-NUS College), we knew that it would cost more,"" said Mr Chan, responding to parliamentary questions from\xa0Members of Parliament.\nThe cost of the education for a Yale-NUS student is more than double that of a humanities or\xa0science\xa0student in NUS, Mr Chan said, adding that both tuition fees and government funding are “more than double”.\xa0\n“But we accepted this because we saw value in having a liberal arts college in our tertiary education system,” he told Parliament.\nThe college had hoped to raise more than\xa0S$300m to reach an endowment fund size of about S$1 billion with government matching and investment returns, he added.\xa0\n“This would then have reduced the burden on the annual operating income of fees and government subsidies,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“YNC has done its utmost in raising funds, but through no fault of its own has not reached this\xa0target. Transitioning to the new college will give us economies of scale, and reduce costs to some extent.\n“This will be an important consideration, but not the main motivation for the change.”\xa0\nWith the “benefits of scale”, education in the new college can be “much more inclusive, affordable and flexible”, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThe new college would offer a wider choice of majors and minors compared to Yale-NUS, especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) areas, he added.\xa0\n“With closer integration with the wider NUS ecosystem, all NUS students will also be able to benefit from and (have) access to the new college’s facilities, resources, and community.”\xa0\nThe Education Ministry (MOE) is “committed” to supporting the new college, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“We expect that the tuition fees and costs per student will be lower than that at YNC, in keeping with the vision for the new college to be a more inclusive, affordable and accessible model of education,"" he added.\nMr Chan addressed concerns about whether NUS can “deliver this enhanced ambition” and whether the move will impact its overall standing.\xa0\n“There is no reason to believe why a university like NUS, which has grown in strength and reputation over the years, cannot continue to achieve great things.”\xa0\nResponding to a supplementary question from MP\xa0Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) about how financial sustainability was factored into the decision, Mr Chan said that when the college was first established, the Government recognised that education there would cost more because of its ""smaller size and unique education model"".\xa0\n“But we were prepared to invest in building the new facilities for YNC, and we accepted this because we saw value in having a liberal arts college in our tertiary education system,” he added.\xa0\nYale-NUS is more costly “on a recurrent basis”, said the Education Minister.\xa0\nIn 2020, MOE provided about S$48 million to the college in operating grants per year for its about 1,000 students, he added.\xa0\n“On a per-student basis, this was more than double that of a humanities and science student\xa0in NUS on average, reflective of the higher costs in education,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\nBeyond the operating grants, MOE has also provided capital funding for Yale-NUS’ infrastructure and matched donations to its endowment fund, he added.\xa0\nWhen NUS consulted MOE on its plan to merge Yale-NUS College and USP, the ministry was supportive because it would make education “much more affordable” to many more NUS students.\xa0\nIt was also in line with MOE’s push for institutes of higher learning to “expand their interdisciplinary approach to education”, Mr Chan said.\n“Merging YNC\xa0and USP to form the new college therefore allows NUS to combine the best elements of both sides and to achieve economies of scale, to allow us to scale this experience in many more students in part or in full across NUS,"" he added.\nMr Chan also addressed concerns about the decision-making process and questions about why students and staff of Yale-NUS were not consulted.\xa0\n“NUS did not do so because the decision involved discussions between the senior leadership of two universities, and with their respective boards, on sensitive issues of strategy and finance,"" he said.\nInstead, after the “broad parameters” were settled, NUS wanted to give the maximum amount of time for the transition to occur\xa0and for stakeholders to be involved in working through ""transition issues"", said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThe launch of the new college is an “important move” that has implications for many stakeholders, including the Yale-NUS students, parents, faculty and staff, said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“And I understand the sadness and sense of loss and uncertainty they may feel, especially for those who have played a part in building up YNC over the past decade,” he added.\xa0\nDescribing the decision-making process of closing the college, Mr Chan said that NUS initiated discussions with Yale University in early July.\xa0\n“Yale acknowledged NUS’\xa0vision to bring together both YNC and the USP into a new college that would not bear Yale’s name,” he added.\xa0\nYale-NUS leadership was informed in the same month, said Mr Chan. The NUS Board of Trustees endorsed the decision in early-August, and the Yale-NUS College Governing Board endorsed the transition plans in late-August.\xa0\nThe first announcement to the public was made\xa0on Aug 27.\xa0\nIn July, the timing of the announcement was also discussed with Yale and “jointly determined”, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“While the partnership would only end in 2025, both parties felt that the responsible thing to do was to announce it early rather than to hold back.\xa0\n“It would have been bad faith to delay the announcement and continue to admit students who would not be able to complete their education in YNC, or to continue to hire faculty beyond this juncture.”\xa0\nThis was\xa0why NUS made the announcement in August after the Yale-NUS Governing Board endorsed the ""broad transition approach"", said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“This allowed faculty and staff the maximum time, between now and 2025, to work through the details of the transition,” he added.\xa0\nYale-NUS\' final cohort in 2021 would also have the full four years to complete their undergraduate studies at the college, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThe Education Minister also addressed concerns about how the move affects the standing of the Yale-NUS\xa0degree, as well as how the merger will affect current students and staff.\xa0\nAll current students will graduate with the same degree as the students before them - a Yale-NUS degree that is awarded by NUS - Mr Chan said.\xa0\nBeyond 2025, NUS will continue to provide “supporting documentation” to explain the context of Yale-NUS and what its degree conveys, as well as provide letters of recommendation or referees if needed by alumni, he added.\xa0\n“NUS and Yale are both globally renowned universities which are well-recognised by employers, including the public sector, and postgraduate institutions. I am confident that the YNC degree will continue to be highly valued, and its past and future graduating cohorts will remain in good standing, even beyond 2025.”\xa0\nCurrent students in Yale-NUS will continue to have access to the full range of majors and minors currently offered by the college until 2025, the Education Minister added.\xa0\n“I know that many YNC students are actively involved in student organisations and look forward to a fulfilling campus life during their time at\xa0college,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“The establishment of the new college will open new possibilities for students of YNC, USP and the new college to interact and collectively participate in active and inclusive student life in the next few years.”\xa0\nNo faculty and staff will be made redundant from the merger, he said, adding that NUS has committed to honouring all existing employment contracts.\xa0\nYale-NUS leadership has also been engaging faculty members to “hear their concerns” and discuss possible options for them after 2025, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“I know some students and parents may nevertheless have lingering concerns, and we respect the preferences of those who may wish to consider other options. NUS and YNC will engage them and provide assistance where they can.”\xa0\nMr Chan also responded to questions about the future of liberal arts education in Singapore, and the impact of the merger on academic freedom.\xa0\nNUS is “building on the foundations” laid by Yale-NUS and USP, as well as lessons from the collaboration with Yale University.\xa0\n“It wants to make the distinctive features of education in YNC\xa0and USP more inclusive and more accessible. The new college will maintain the spirit of independent inquiry and inclusivity that characterise YNC, USP and NUS,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\nAs for the merger’s impact on academic freedom in Singapore, there were “similar concerns about a perceived lack of academic freedom” when Yale-NUS was established, said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“They proved unfounded. In fact, few believed then that YNC\xa0would live up to its ambition. Even fewer would own it,” he said.\xa0\n“It is perhaps ironic and a testimony to NUS and YNC’s efforts all these years that YNC is now seen as a paragon of academic freedom in Singapore.”\nYale-NUS’ current policies on academic freedom were framed by taking reference from NUS’ practices and have “remained unchanged”, he added.\xa0\nThe faculties of arts and social sciences in NUS and the other autonomous universities have\xa0“a long history” of teaching and research, including on ""potentially sensitive and difficult topics"", even before Yale-NUS was established, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“It would be grossly unfair to faculty members in NUS and other autonomous universities to suggest that their teaching or research is in any way less rigorous, or of lower quality, or less free than that of YNC\xa0faculty,"" added Mr Chan.\nIn a supplementary question, MP\xa0Shawn Huang (PAP-Jurong) asked Mr Chan how he would define success for NUS and its students “given its vision for its interdisciplinary education”.\xa0\n“To me, in time to come, I will consider it a success if NUS produced\xa0quality graduates that are much more global in their perspective, able to connect the East and the West, the North and the South.\n""That these students will be able to provide unique solutions in context to the challenges that Singapore faces and if possible, to make a contribution to the rest of the world.""\xa0\nNUS will continue to be successful if it ""continues to remain humble” and ""learn from the best in the world"", while being confident to “chart out its own way forward”, he added.\xa0\n“NUS is not just copying from the best in the world, but in the process, creates\xa0something new, creates something better,” said Mr Chan.\nAs a university, NUS should also help to reinforce Singapore’s standing in the world, said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“Because we stand for openness, integration, inclusivity. That we provide solutions in context for the world, just as we provide for ourselves,"" he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     NUS ', '     Yale-NUS ', '     Singapore Parliament ']}"

      Primary 1 places reserved for Phase 2C will double to 40, changes include revised priority for alumni members
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The number of places reserved\xa0under\xa0Phase 2C of the Primary 1 registration exercise will double from 20 to 40 from next year.\nPhase 2B will continue to have 20 reserved places, while Phase 2A1 and 2A2 will be combined into a single phase.\xa0\nAnnouncing this on\xa0Thursday (Sep 9), the\xa0Ministry of Education (MOE) said it is committed to ensuring that mainstream schools remain accessible to children of all backgrounds, ""while preserving strong ties to\nthe community and culture that our schools have built up over the years"".\nMOE had announced earlier this year that it will review the registration framework to possibly increase the number of places available under Phase 2C.\xa0\nThe changes will apply from\xa0the 2022\xa0registration exercise, for children who are starting Primary 1 in 2023.\nPhase 2C, for children with no ties to a school, is usually the most competitive phase. Priority is distance-based, given first\xa0to Singaporeans living within 1km of the school.\xa0\nIn this year\'s registration exercise, 64 schools -\xa0or about one in three schools - went to ballot in Phase 2C\xa0for Singaporeans living within 1km of the school, said MOE. This is an increase from one in four schools in the 2014 registration exercise.\xa0\nPhase 2B, which is for children of parent volunteers or parents affiliated to the related church or clan, will continue to have 20 reserved places.\xa0\nThis means that with the new framework, there will be\xa0a total of 60 places set aside in each school\xa0for Phase 2B and 2C at the start of the Primary 1\xa0registration exercise.\nIf there are vacancies left from earlier phases, one-third will be allocated to Phase 2B and two-thirds to Phase 2C.\xa0\nThe increase in Phase 2C slots will “especially benefit” about half of the 64 primary schools that went to ballot in the 2021 registration\xa0exercise, said MOE, as these schools had 40 or fewer applicants in this phase.\xa0\n“The P1 registration framework has a long legacy. Many stakeholders are involved and they all hold diverse views. If there is\xa0one clear conclusion from our review, it is\xa0that there’s really no perfect option that will satisfy everyone, because simply giving more places for one group means fewer places for another group,” said the ministry at a media briefing on Thursday.\xa0\n“In that sense, the P1 exercise is a zero-sum exercise.”\xa0\nFrom the 2022 registration exercise,\xa0Phases 2A1 and 2A2 will be combined into a single Phase 2A, MOE announced.\xa0\nPhase 2A1 was for children whose parents are alumni of the school and had\xa0joined the alumni association as a member not later than Jun 30 of the year before the Primary 1\xa0registration. Children whose parents are a member of the school advisory or management committee also fall under this phase.\xa0\nPhase 2A2 was for children whose parents or siblings previously studied in the school, or whose parents are staff members of the school. Children from the MOE Kindergarten located within the primary school also qualify to register under this phase.\xa0\nExplaining the decision to combine the two phases, MOE noted that the priority for alumni members in Phase 2A1 was introduced in the 1999 Primary 1 registration exercise “to encourage stronger alumni and community support” for schools.\n“Over time, more stakeholders such as former students and alumni associations have been actively contributing in their own ways to the schools. It is timely to review the fine differentiation of priority between stakeholders in Phases 2A1 and 2A2,” the ministry said in its press release.\xa0\nWith more reserved places in Phase 2C, there will be fewer places in the earlier phases, said MOE.\n""We expect that several schools would end up with relatively few or even no places left for Phase 2A2 registrants, if we continue to maintain the differentiation of priority between Phase 2A1 and Phase 2A2 registrants,"" it added.\nThe move will also\xa0“better achieve” the objective of providing priority admission to MOE Kindergarten children, the media release stated.\xa0\nThe ministry studied this “very carefully”, MOE added at the briefing.\n“We need to understand the implications that will happen when we double the Phase 2C reserved places. And the impact would be particularly hard on Phase 2A2 registrants with quite a number of schools going straight from Phase 2A1 to 2B. Essentially, they skip Phase 2A2 because there will\xa0be zero vacancies in Phase 2A2 for these schools,” the ministry said.\xa0\n“This means that the Phase 2A2 group won\'t get to exercise their priority at all. We felt that the right thing to do is therefore to merge Phase 2A1 and 2A2 into a single merged Phase 2A. This will spread out the impact a little bit more equitably, and it is also a small step to try to simplify our P1 registration framework from seven phases to six phases.”\xa0\nThe Education Ministry will also update\xa0how it calculates home-school distance, which is used as a tie-breaker in each phase when a school has more applicants than places. The three categories are: Within 1km of the school, within 1km to 2km of the school\xa0and outside 2km of the school.\xa0\nThe distance is currently calculated from a single reference point based on the school’s original building layout, to the child’s registered address, even if the current school building layout has changed significantly, said MOE.\xa0\nFrom 2022, home-school distance will be calculated based on the school land boundary, or any point on the boundary around the school to the child’s registered address.\xa0\nThe school land boundary is “much less likely” to change over time. This change will result in a “slightly larger coverage” of residential addresses within 1km and 2km for all primary schools, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\n“We believe this is a fairer way to draw these lines, but we are mindful that this change will potentially lead to slightly more registrants, roughly about 10 per cent more registrants on average, recategorised from a further home-school distance to a nearer home-school distance category,” said MOE at the briefing on Thursday.\xa0\n“To alleviate any concerns over there being slightly more competition for places in the more popular schools for each home-school distance category, we therefore felt that it would be helpful to time this home-school distance change with the doubling of Phase 2C reserved places.”\xa0\nMost parents and children applying to primary schools will not be affected by the changes, and some may find themselves now nearer to the school, said MOE in the press release.\xa0\nBut for three primary schools - Cedar Primary School, Maris Stella High School (primary section) and Marymount Convent School - some applicants will be shifted to a further distance category.\xa0\nThis is because the original reference points are outside the school land boundary due to “significant” past upgrading or rebuilding works, alongside school boundary changes, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nThis affected group will be allowed to retain their original home-school distance for the 2022 Primary 1\xa0registration exercise as a one-off arrangement, it added.\xa0\nCommenting on the changes, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said that the Primary 1\xa0registration framework has to balance “various considerations”, which include giving children convenient access to a school near their homes, keeping the society open and inclusive, as well as recognising the efforts of the community like school alumni.\n“As our society evolves, we will have to fine-tune the registration framework to balance these considerations. In recent years, we’ve observed that the number of students that can access a school near their homes without affiliation has declined,” Mr Chan\xa0added.\xa0\n“We hope that all of us will support these changes to ensure that our schools remain accessible, open and inclusive.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     MOE ', '     Primary School registration ']}"

      ‘My mental health is at an all-time low’: Teachers talk of burnout, MOE aware that ‘gaps’ need plugging
  </h1>, 'text': '* Denotes name changed to protect the person’s identity.\nSINGAPORE: As Betty* lay curled into a ball on the floor — in tears, hyperventilating, heart beating rapidly — the secondary school teacher hoped the panic attack would fade soon. Because she knew she could not afford to spend time away from work.\n“I have to get over it, I have to go and mark (papers) and do my work,” she thought.\nHer panic attacks typically happen once a fortnight. A heavy workload, dealing with parents’ expectations and large class sizes are perennial stressors, for her and some other teachers.\nIt was worse for Betty when Singapore moved to full home-based learning in April last year amid concerns over escalating COVID-19 infections. The frequency of her panic attacks increased to twice a week.\n“We suddenly had to pivot to online learning … in a very short couple of days, push out and create resources from scratch, record ourselves doing online lectures, design online quizzes,” she said.\n“That was extremely stressful. We still needed to give feedback to our students and continue giving them work and continue preparing more resources. It was like the work never stops. I was really, really burnt out — very, very depleted.”\nApart from the workload, some teachers feel that their mental health has been overlooked or not prioritised.\nAfter the River Valley High School (RVHS) incident took place, Susan*, who is from another school, was on the alert for students on “suicide watch”. But also running through her mind was whether she could finally raise the issue of teachers’ mental health.\nSo when she was giving her principal a routine update on her at-risk students, she decided to “boldly ask” about that.\n“I was rather saddened to hear her say, ‘the mental health of teachers? It depends on all of you. You guys are adults. You need to take care of each other and watch out for one another,’” she recounted.\nWhile it sounded “noble”, it felt “quite invalidating”, Susan said. “It’s a failure to recognise that you need to take care of the caregiver.”\nBetty and Susan are among the 100-plus teachers who responded to CNA Insider’s call on Instagram for teachers to share how they were coping mentally.\nOne teacher wrote: “It’s terrible being a teacher in the past two years. I know my mental health is at an all-time low.”\nAnother said: “These two years have been especially rough because … the workload has increased drastically, and it’s taking a physical and emotional toll on us. We’re in a pandemic and no concession for teachers has been made.”\nA primary school teacher who’s been teaching for four years shared: “When we expressed our stress and mental exhaustion, we were simply told, ‘Teachers should learn how to manage their own stress.’ I contemplated quitting every week for my well-being.”\nIn an interview with CNA Insider, Mrs Chua-Lim Yen Ching, the deputy director-general of education (professional development) from the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the ministry “can’t deny that COVID-19 has affected us”.\nShe disclosed that in an MOE engagement survey conducted in June among 460 teachers, seven in 10 respondents said “they can cope” with work stress.\n“But having said that, we still need to help the three out of 10. (It) doesn’t mean that because seven out of 10 said that they were good, then we say okay,” she said.\nQuestions about teachers’ well-being were added to the survey for the first time last year. “We realised that the staff’s wellbeing was very important, and we wanted to have representative data,” she noted.\n“All of us will have stress, (but) the most important (thing) is that we must be able to cope. It’s only when you’re stressed and you can’t cope, we get worried.”\nSo why do some teachers struggle to keep their heads above water and, like some of their students, fall through the cracks?\nAsked about the stressors affecting them lately, most teachers CNA Insider spoke to pointed to the rapid switch to home-based learning during last year’s circuit breaker.\nThey cited the need to create online lesson materials quickly, pick up skills to deliver engaging lessons and make sure that students attend classes.\nThat period “played with (her) mind”, said Susan, a secondary school teacher of 15 years. She was frustrated when “half the time” she had to ask students to switch on their camera and “every morning” she had to call students who did not sign in.\n“I was very frustrated such that I had to go and run every day,” she added.\nWhile full home-based learning was already a challenge for younger, more tech-savvy teachers, Melissa* said some older colleagues were “left out”.\n“Older teachers were like, ‘How to log in here, how to log in there?’ There was a lot of stress put on them,” said the secondary school teacher.\nIndeed, *Lisa, who is in her 50s and has been teaching at a primary school for 20 years, felt “shitty” when home-based learning came into force, as the “learning curve” to pick up new technologies was “very steep”.\n“Compared to my time (when I started teaching), I wanted to learn so much from teachers who’d been teaching (for a long time). But now, newer teachers look at me like I have nothing much to (contribute),” she said.\nToday, these teaching and administrative worries have only taken a new shape as physical lessons resume on a “blended learning model” where home-based learning occurs once a fortnight.\nWhenever there is a spike in COVID-19 cases, David* must also “stand by” with online lesson packages in the event that schools revert to full home-based learning.\nThe secondary school mathematics teacher recalled a time when “almost every single day”, he had to prepare extra material; “most” of it did not end up being used.\nOn top of the extra teaching workload, teachers now have a host of “nightmarish” COVID-related administrative duties, like keeping track of students’ and fellow teachers’ quarantine orders and COVID-19 test results, said secondary school geography teacher Sally*.\n“The Ministry of Health was constantly coming up with new directives on how long to keep them at home, whether the school will go on home-based learning, when approved absence starts (and) ends, the swab tests.\n“It was a lot to deal with,” she added.\nAll this additional work has put teachers in a state of “heightened alert”, said Singapore Teachers’ Union (STU) general secretary Mike Thiruman.\n“They (still) have to do everything that they’d been doing before COVID-19 … There’s a lot of nervous energy, and they have to be on guard all the time.\n“There’s a limit to how long you can be in this heightened alert state. (At some point) it just wears you out.”\nIn response to teachers’ sentiments of feeling overwhelmed, Mrs Chua-Lim said the MOE has branch meetings to “manage our teachers’ workload”. And it was found that “during this period, our teachers’ workload is very high … because of all these safe management measures”.\n“So we managed our professional development courses. We pace (them) out. Things that aren’t so critical … we don’t need to do this year.”\nThere are now “a lot” of resources in the Student Learning Space system for teachers to conduct online lessons, she added.\n“There’s this feature in the SLS: It’s called the community gallery. And those resources are developed by the master teacher together with the teachers.”\nTeachers have also noticed students getting more anxious about their subjects owing to less time spent in school with home-based learning and blended learning in place — especially so for graduating students with upcoming major examinations, said secondary school teacher Melissa.\n“My (four) graduating classes … are very affected by it, so they keep asking, ‘Teacher, can we have consultations?’ But for consultations, now I can’t have a big group: Just five in a group,” she added.\nThis translates into more time spent catering for all students. Furthermore, Melissa has received “a lot” of after-hours texts this year from students asking for help with their schoolwork.\n“Some of them would message me in the middle of the night. A part of me does want to help them, but (they) need to respect my time,” she said. “I have two young kids at home. I can’t possibly be messaging you and studying beside you, right?”\nAnne*, a teacher at an institute of higher learning, agreed that the boundaries between work and rest are increasingly blurred. Given that students are more anxious, there is “an expectation” of teachers replying “immediately”, she wrote in an Instagram message.\nFor Melissa’s part, she learnt to take matters into her own hands. “(When they text me) to ask me questions … or in the middle of the night ... the next day they’d get it from me,” she said.\nSome teachers notice that students are more “volatile” and “highly strung” with tighter Safe Management Measures at school, such as the suspension of in-person co-curricular activities and group activities in physical education classes.\n“A lot of the essential things that make school bearable or fun for them have been removed. So suddenly, the students have nothing else to do but study,” said secondary school teacher Sally.\nPrimary school teacher Lisa said this is often made worse by large class sizes, which reduce teachers’ ability to look out for every child. “You have to reduce the number of kids so that we can really take care of ...\xa0their mental (health),” she said.\nA smaller class size has made it easier for secondary school teacher Claire* to “build student rapport” and, in turn, take care of the students’ needs.\nHer Secondary 1 class has fewer than 20 students owing to falling enrolments, compared to “the normal 40 students per class” in the past.\n“With a smaller class … you become less of a dictator where it’s like, everyone just keeps quiet and listens to me,” she said. She can get to know her students now and can better understand why students “misbehave” as well.\nMandy* wished teachers had received psychological first-aid training while at the National Institute of Education (NIE) before entering the service.\nShe also felt there was “inadequate” training for the “emotional labour” of the job, such as how to manage one’s emotions when handling students — a view echoed by several of her peers.\nThe secondary school humanities teacher, who started teaching last year, encountered a student who “felt very alienated, very lonely” and committed self-harm during home-based learning. It was one of six cases of self-harm she has handled over the past year.\nShe experienced feelings of helplessness from struggling to find the right things to say to the students, she shared. “I didn’t know how to push (all the right buttons) and how much to push in order to find out what was stressing them, or to give them an adequate solution.”\nAccording to Mrs Chua-Lim, there are “self-management and mental health development” courses in the NIE, such as the Meranti Project, which “helps the teachers to think of ways to develop their resilience”. These are core modules everyone must take.\n“NIE also runs workshops for self-care for all our student teachers before they become qualified teachers,” she noted.\nMandy said the Meranti Project was a two-day weekend course in her first year at the NIE, where her facilitator addressed the “importance of unpacking (your) own trauma and mental health before trying to help (your) own students”.\nBut she could not recall learning “any actual strategies” she could implement for herself or her students.\nThe performance appraisal and ranking system also came up in the messages teachers sent to CNA Insider about what affected their mental health. One teacher said it created a “suffocating culture of fear (and) self-doubt”.\nThe performance of teachers is determined through the Enhanced Performance Management System, which subsequently has an impact on their remuneration and career development.\nThe MOE said last year in a parliamentary reply that a “broad middle” 60 per cent of teachers are given C-plus and C grades, while the top third can be awarded A and B grades.\nIn a perception survey on ranking that the STU conducted this year among 1,265 teachers, findings show that more than half of the respondents disagreed that teachers “understand the process of ranking”, while 80 per cent of teachers disagreed that the ranking process has been made transparent.\nFor Timothy*, who was a secondary school teacher for four years, the anxiety stemmed from not knowing what exactly he needed to do to perform better or “maintain” his grade.\n“I’d keep doing more to try to fill that gap, and then the disappointment is when (even though) I keep doing more ... I’m not performing (better) than another teacher in another school,” he said.\n“They’re getting a B; I’m getting a C-plus. But I’m doing more than them, and they always tell me that I’m doing way more than them. So how is this fair?”\nMrs Chua-Lim said the grades that teachers get “shouldn’t be a surprise”. Work review sessions should happen “two times a year at least”, so that teachers can improve after the first review if need be.\nBut hearing the differing experiences shared by teachers, she acknowledged that “somehow when it comes to the actual implementation, there are gaps”. “Now that we know there are gaps, we’ll then make sure that we plug the gaps,” she said.\nThat means the MOE “(needs) to work with the reporting officers”. For example, in their training, there is a workshop called “managing difficult conversations”, on how to say what they have to say.\n“So that at the end of the day, I may give you a grade, you may not be happy, but you can accept it,” said Mrs Chua-Lim.\nSeveral teachers, like Paul*, said there are expectations that they “demonstrably show” that they can deliver beyond their basic teaching duties in order to get better grades.\n“This is where people are pressured to stage projects and events that have little relevance to teaching and learning,” said the secondary school teacher.\n“This points to a larger systemic issue: That a lot of the pointless stuff we do, like planning sports day ... should be outsourced to either event vendors or specialty officers whose job is to do this stuff.”\nStradling multiple roles, said many teachers, is “overwhelming”.\nTo fulfil\xa0her other co-curricular activity and committee roles, Lisa said she is sometimes so busy she has to stop or delay her marking and her lessons preparations.\n“Everything becomes very messy (in class) because I didn’t finish marking, then I can’t give immediate feedback to my kids, and it frustrates me to be short-changing the children,” she said.\n“I truly hate it each time when it comes to the ranking, and (school leaders) start saying that, okay, look, you haven’t done this … and you’re going to get this grade.\n“It makes you feel like your worth is attached to (the grade) and as if you’re not doing (well) enough.”\nWhile the stressor and struggles are manifold, sometimes the starting point is whether teachers have asked, or been able to ask, for help.\n“Most people get into teaching because there’s a pastoral side to them,” said Chong Pao-er, a counsellor from Shan You Counselling Centre and a former teacher. “There’s that caring side to them, and interestingly, I find it’s that group of teachers who get especially burnt out.\n“There’s absolutely no limit to what (the teachers) can do in that sense.”\nIn Susan’s staffroom, frustrations are often put on the back burner. “The moment someone says, ‘let’s do it for the kids’, we go,” said the upper-secondary teacher. “We tell ourselves, stop complaining, let’s revamp this, design that, find resources.”\nAccording to Paul, the “prevailing social attitude” that teachers are self-sacrificial means seeking help can be met with disapproval.\n“When we complain that admin and organisational matters distract us from having to teach kids, we’re gaslighted into thinking that we ‘lack passion’ and ‘have to do it for the kids’,” he said. “It invalidates the very natural … feeling (of getting) frustrated.”\nBut “doing it for the kids” is becoming a difficult motivator when a heavy workload remains the key issue, as evidenced by the responses CNA Insider received on Instagram\n“Kids are what drives us to go on each day, but the endless amount of work takes the life out of you,” one teacher said. “You want to be a teacher and love and teach children. But you’re so tired.”\nAnother said the rhetoric on doing one’s best for students “feels like teachers are being exploited for their passion”. “Many good-hearted individuals who care deeply for our students leave the service after burning out ... What does this say about the longevity of this career?”\nMrs Chua-Lim said it is “very good” that teachers feel strongly about their mission because “that means their minds are on the kids”.\nAsked about the guilt teachers face when that motivation runs dry, she replied: “If we can’t have teachers first, we can’t have students first … At times, it’s important to have some degree of professional detachment.\n“There are always coping strategies to help you, and you just need to practice some of these.”\nEven if teachers do not wish to go it alone, many may struggle to find an alternative means of coping, depending on their school leadership and culture.\nFormer schoolteacher Timothy, for example, recalled feeling that his struggles were invalidated after he made an offhand remark one day about having many things to do.\nHe was asked to see his reporting officer, who told him that he was “not supposed to tell people how busy you are or how you can’t cope with your work in the office itself”, recounted Timothy.\n“That was the first incident that made me realise I couldn’t just say out loud that I was struggling, or I had a lot of things to do. I couldn’t tell people or seek help.”\nHe taught English and geography, was second-in-charge of his co-curricular activity and oversaw two committees.\nThings took a “180-degree” turn for the better only with his third reporting officer, who assured him that “there was a safe space” to share his struggles. “He was very supportive. He actually listened and talked to me,” said Timothy.\n“He’d say, ‘I understand where you’re coming from, this is what you should do. At my end, I’ll see what I can do for you.’ And he really did something.”\nMrs Chua-Lim noted that it is “very important” for school leaders to set the right tone. “That’s when it’s important for us to be transparent, to increase psychological safety, so that people can tell us how they feel,” she said.\nWhen reporting officers have not been pleasant, teachers do have “a lot of internal channels”, she added.\n“They can share (their experience) with their school leaders because the principal is above the reporting officer. They can share (it) with the superintendent. You can also share (it) with MOE, because HR has a platform for teachers to share.”\nAmong the teachers CNA Insider spoke to, some are aware that the school counsellor can also see teachers, but they would not exercise that option, knowing the counsellors are already busy managing student caseloads.\nFew teachers know of the services dedicated to them, such as counselling at the Singapore Teachers’ Union.\nFor one thing, publicity for these services is usually buried. “Teachers may not look at it because it’s not important, right? They have a thousand and one things to do other than to read your electronic direct mailer,” said Mr Thiruman.\n“More often than not, they’d say, ‘Do I need to go for this talk? I’d rather not. I can finish (marking) 10 scripts in that time.’”\nAt the MOE’s Academy of Singapore Teachers, two counsellors are available and generally see 30 to 40 teachers, said Mrs Chua-Lim. There is also a whole-of-government counselling hotline — rolled out in March — should teachers want to speak to someone outside of the MOE, she added.\nThis year, the academy’s counsellors have seen the number of cases increase to 80 to 90. Over at the STU, there has been a tenfold increase in sign-ups for its mental wellness talk on depression and burnout. In the past, there were only 10 to 20 sign-ups, said Mr Thiruman.\nCNA Insider reached out to 10 counselling centres, both private and government-subsidised. Three of them said there has been a rise in the number of teachers seeking help. It is unclear whether it is also a result of a concurrent rise in the number of people seeking mental health help.\nImPossible Psychological Services founder Muhammad Haikal Jamil said the number of teachers seeking help has more than doubled in the past two years.\n“Most of them seek help during the school holiday period. However, they tend to drop out of therapy when the school term begins again due to difficulties fitting therapy into their busy schedule,” he added.\nAt Annabelle Psychology, there have also been more teachers seeking support. “On average, I’d estimate that there’s been an average increase of about one teacher per month over the last two years,” said Dr Annabelle Chow.\nSimilarly, Dr Adrian Wang Psychiatric and Counselling Care sees about one new teacher patient every two to three months. “The recent RVHS incident in fact led to a couple of new referrals,” said its eponymous founder.\nWhen it comes to traumatic incidents like suicide cases, secondary school teacher Geraldine found that there was “insufficient mental health support” for teaching staff.\nSome years ago, a student of hers committed suicide. But she said there was no proper follow-up on “what to do for teachers”, whether from the school leadership or the ministry.\nShe ended up back in class to teach the next day, but she “couldn’t at all” and was crying in her students’ presence. Only when her reporting officer found out was she told to take the week off and advised to see the school counsellor.\nIn an email reply, the MOE said teachers are supported through “psychological first aid” after a traumatic event, which “helps to stabilise their emotional reactions to the crisis”.\n“Teachers also undergo the Critical Incident Stress Debriefing to enable them to process their experiences to aid them in returning to a normal routine. Referrals to counselling or psychological services are also made available for teachers who experience severe emotional reactions,” the ministry added.\nMuch has been said about encouraging conversations on mental health to reduce stigma. But some teachers said they have been told not to speak up for fear of what parents might think.\nRichard* shared his journey with depression on Instagram, where his students were followers, “so that the students can know there’s a teacher who’s been through mental illness, and they can find out what to do about their own mental health”.\nHe received “a lot of support from friends and students alike”, but what “greatly disturbed him” was his vice-principal instructing him to take his post down.\n“I was told something along the lines of ‘we don’t want parents to see the post and (question) how our school can have a teacher who’s depressed. Then how would the teacher be able to manage the students?’” he recounted.\nRichard felt that his post was an opportunity to educate parents and students about mental illness and to “try to take (away) the stigma”.\nAbove all, he was saddened that asking about his mental health looked like “an afterthought” for his school leaders. “The issue at the forefront seemed to be the public image of the school or the ministry”, he said.\nAnother teacher, Sally, said it is “very short-sighted” to say that teachers grappling with mental health issues cannot teach students. She herself went through a bout of depression while doing relief teaching prior to entering the National Institute of Education.\n“The most passionate and the most empathetic teachers are the ones who’ve gone through emotional struggles themselves,” she said. “That’s the most valuable thing — having that experience so you can (tell students) with certainty that you’re not a broken student.”\nMr Chong believes that at least one counselling session should be made “compulsory” for teachers who have gone through trauma at school, “because if you make it compulsory, there’s no shame”.\nAgreeing, Mr Thiruman said: “(If) you leave it up to (them) … it’s not critical. Then obviously the take-up rate would be low, and we might miss the people who might really need the help.”\nWhat is in the pipeline is the appointment of two teachers in each school as “wellness ambassadors” in future, said Mrs Chua-Lim and as disclosed in the Education Minister’s Teachers Day Message this week.\n“Colleagues play a very important part. If we train a few of those who can play this role right, they can up the capacity to be more observant … and detect (teachers struggling with mental health),” she said.\nThe MOE added in an email reply that teachers will do “a training session to learn peer support skills”.\nThe session will cover areas such as “skills required for a first-level responder (for example, active listening), setting of boundaries, as well as self-care techniques”.\nAsked if the additional responsibilities as a wellness ambassador will increase the teachers’ workload, Mrs Chua-Lim said that “not everyone has to be a wellness ambassador”.\n“It works like peer support, (which) is happening (already). We’ll just make it better … (and) equip you with better skills,” she added.\nUltimately, what is needed is a whole-of-society attitude shift towards mental health, noted Mr Thiruman.\n“(Education) is a reflection of what’s going on out there. And because we all go through the education system, it also creates the societal standards and societal atmosphere for issues of mental health for the future,” he said.\n“The way we perceive mental wellness has to change … It’s okay to seek help (for your mental health), and it mustn’t be seen as weakness.”\nTo teachers, Mrs Chua-Lim urged: “We must tell ourselves there’s no problem so big that collectively we can’t overcome. (If) all of us work together, sure we can overcome this.”\nWhere to get help:\nSamaritans of Singapore Hotline: 1800 221 4444\nInstitute of Mental Health’s Helpline: 6389 2222\nSingapore Association for\xa0Mental Health Helpline: 1800 283 7019\nYou can also find a list of international helplines here.

      An MD, equipped with a PhD
  </h1>, 'text': 'A medical degree often takes a long time to complete, compared to other qualifications. A medical degree combined with a PhD – a unique pathway available in Singapore at Duke-NUS Medical School – takes an even longer time to attain: A minimum of seven years.\nWhile this might seem arduous, for Duke-NUS alumni Dr Kwek Swee Sen and current fifth-year student Tay Shi Huan, the MD-PhD programme has offered rich opportunities to investigate burning research questions, connect with inspiring mentors and make valuable contributions to the medical world.\nTHE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS\nIn the Duke-NUS MD-PhD track, students embark on the PhD component after their second year in the MD programme. When they graduate, they receive a Doctor of Medicine degree, as well as their PhD in either Integrated Biology and Medicine or Quantitative Biology and Medicine.\nDr Kwek Swee Sen, a medical officer at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, graduated last year from Duke-NUS Medical School, where he was on the MD-PhD track.\n“The MD-PhD pathway allows one to have the training to enjoy the best of both worlds,” he said of his decision. “The programme trains us in clinical medicine through the MD portion and also hones our scientific thinking through the PhD training. More importantly, the opportunity to appreciate the greater value and real-world application of both is unique to MD-PhD training.”\nHe chose Duke-NUS as many of the faculty members are clinician-scientists who can be valuable mentors for students: “I think mentorship is really important for aspiring clinician-scientists since it is a very long career route from starting as an MD-PhD student to completing residency or clinical training and starting our own research careers. Having inspiring mentors who are willing to guide the way in shaping our paths is important.”\nDr Kwek cited his PhD mentor, Professor Ooi Eng Eong from the Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases as a visionary who inspired him in many ways during his time as a student.\nDr Kwek’s PhD focused on developing a novel method for identifying live attenuated flavivirus vaccine candidates. Flaviviruses include dengue and Zika. Working with different mutant variants of the Zika virus strains, Dr Kwek proposed that a strain weakened in its ability to replicate itself – but still possessing enough replication ability to trigger a robust immune response – would be able to elicit immunity in the vaccine recipient, without causing as many deleterious effects.\n“The goal is for such a method to be employed for other viruses, whereby a live attenuated vaccine will work better than vaccines that use or express parts of a virus – like the Hepatitis B vaccine and the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 – or killed viruses, like Sinovac,” he explained.\nDr Kwek, who was a frontliner during the COVID-19 outbreak last year, is soon embarking on his internal medicine residency with SingHealth. He hopes to be able to conduct more research on infection and immunity in his clinical and research career.\nOf being an MD-PhD, he said: “I hope that we can prove that we can be clinically competent physicians and at the same time make groundbreaking discoveries, all in the aim of delivering better healthcare to our patients.”\nANSWERING UNMET CLINICAL NEEDS\nA recipient of the A*STAR National Science Scholarship, Mr Tay Shi Huan had initially decided not to pursue medicine as an undergraduate in favour of going to the University of Cambridge to do a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Natural Sciences.\nHowever, during his research attachments, he found himself drawn towards a holistic perspective of the doctor-patient relationship, where patients are treated as a whole being instead of just their disease. He wanted to see the direct clinical impact of his work while satisfying his intellectual curiosity for identifying and investigating unmet clinical needs.\n“Hence, the MD-PhD was – and still is – the perfect fit for me as it will train me to confidently partake in all aspects of translational medicine from bench to bedside to generate worthwhile health outcomes,” said Mr Tay, who chose Duke-NUS for its unique MD-PhD programme and partnership with SingHealth.\n“Students are likely to gain unparalleled exposure to a plethora of medical conditions as SingHealth is the largest public healthcare cluster in Singapore,” explained Mr Tay, adding that this proximity also fosters valuable cross-institutional collaboration between the clinical and academic worlds. “Not only can I engage in exciting research for my thesis but I can also obtain first-hand experience of how stakeholders convene along the translational medicine pathway.”\nMr Tay’s PhD research focuses on the enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), a common type of childhood-onset autoimmune arthritis in Asia. ERA causes debilitating joint pain and a limited range of motion in afflicted children – a demographic he has a soft spot for, as he is considering specialising in either paediatrics or dermatology in the future.\nMr Tay explained that the existing insufficient knowledge of ERA’s disease mechanism means that diagnosis is often imprecise, and treatment ineffective. “My work aims to bridge these unmet needs by identifying immune cell subsets that are important in driving and perpetuating ERA. Doing so will allow us to increase the confidence with which we diagnose ERA and identify targets that we can design therapies for.”\nAt Duke-NUS, Mr Tay contributes actively to student life as a college representative of Seah Cheng Siang College, Duke-NUS, and as a student faculty member for peer mentoring initiatives, in addition to helming several student interest groups ranging from sports to academic topics like dermatology.\n“We invite alumni and practising clinicians to share their experiences so that students can make better career choices, and there are also occasional volunteer opportunities that provide tasters for public education,” he said.\nAccording to Mr Tay, his time at Duke-NUS thus far has been fulfilling. “The rigorous curriculum has stood me in good stead for a demanding career ahead, the research opportunities have sharpened my scientific reasoning and encouraged creativity, and the people whom I’ve met along the way have become great friends and mentors. If one is genuinely excited to straddle the clinical and academic worlds in translational medicine, do consider the MD-PhD programme at Duke-NUS for its comprehensive curriculum that prepares students for tomorrow’s medicine.”\nFind out more about the Duke-NUS Medical School MD-PhD programme.

      Recognising outstanding clinical faculty who are shaping tomorrow’s leaders in biomedical science
  </h1>, 'text': 'Taking up the mantle of a clinician is a noble pursuit. Among the many who have done so are several who have gone even further by demonstrating their mastery in improving lives through groundbreaking research and dedication to medical education. To recognise these outstanding clinicians, Duke-NUS Medical School established the Hall of Master Academic Clinicians.\nTo celebrate the SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre’s (AMC) greatest faculty, the school inducted its first cohort of eight Master Academic Clinicians earlier this year – one of the highest accolades given to a select group of clinical faculty by Duke-NUS. \xa0\nThese Master Academic Clinicians are from the hundreds of practising clinicians who have been appointed as clinical faculty by Duke-NUS to train and mentor medical students. With Duke-NUS’ novel TeamLEAD approach, these clinicians play a vital role in the classroom, where they bring their clinical experience to benefit students right from the first year of the rigorous four-year medical course all the way through to the students’ clinical years.\nAt the same time, these clinical faculty work across the diverse hospitals and specialty centres under SingHealth, Duke-NUS’ partner in academic medicine, and are dedicated to delivering world-class care to patients in Singapore and beyond.\xa0\nThey hail from more than 40 specialties that span the fields of medicine, surgery, diagnostics and radiology, which, in turn, contribute to the 15 academic clinical programmes (ACPs) established under the AMC. The ACPs correlate the main areas of practice to residency programmes that the Duke-NUS students are allocated upon graduation.\xa0\nThese ACPs are designed to better prepare students for their future working environment and create a bench-to-bedside continuum for research, education and innovation, allowing clinicians at all stages of their careers to fulfil their potential as scientists, educators and innovators – in other words, what Duke-NUS terms ‘Clinician Plus’.\nThis bench-to-bedside continuum proved to be particularly useful as the pandemic struck early last year, highlighted Professor Thomas Coffman, dean of Duke-NUS. SingHealth clinicians were able to send patient samples directly to Duke-NUS laboratories, where clinician-scientists worked on developing solutions such as a COVID-19 serum test for the benefit of public health.\nSaid Prof Coffman: “We have a fantastic reservoir of human talent on our AMC campus. And not just talented people, but people who are dedicated and want to do the right thing. This gives us tremendous strength to deal with whatever comes our way and continue\xa0to flourish even amid this pandemic.”\nMore than being ambassadors for Duke-NUS, Master Academic Clinicians are inspiring role models and mentors for students and faculty alike, leading by example through sharing their professional expertise in clinical research and education.\nMASTERS WHO INSPIRE OTHERS\nOne of Duke-NUS’ Master Academic Clinicians is Associate Professor Ong Biauw Chi, who heads the anaesthesiology and perioperative sciences ACP at the AMC. She is also one of the two college masters of Seah Cheng Siang College at Duke-NUS, providing support and mentorship to students throughout their time at medical school.\xa0\nThe anaesthesiology and perioperative sciences ACP chair, Associate Professor Soh Chai Rick, described Assoc Prof Ong as someone who leads by example, citing how she joined frontline healthcare teams working in the dormitories during the COVID-19 outbreak in order to support her staff: “Her relentless pursuit of excellence permeates every aspect of her life and it is no wonder the most challenging and important tasks have consistently fallen on her lap.”\nHer fellow Master Academic Clinicians are similarly dedicated to developing excellence in themselves and others. Clinical Professor Ang Chong Lye, of the ophthalmology and visual sciences ACP, is a thought leader in both management and clinical arenas, as well as a role model for trainees who benefit from his guidance.\xa0\nProfessor Chay Oh Moh, from the paediatrics ACP, has played an instrumental role in shaping education for the next generation of healthcare providers, many of whom she has mentored into leadership positions.\xa0\nOther renowned clinician mentors are Clinical Professor Fock Kwong Ming of the medicine ACP and Clinical Professor Tan Kok Chai of the musculoskeletal sciences ACP. Prof Tan is one of the earliest trained microsurgeons in Singapore who has shared his knowledge and expertise with generations of plastic surgeons, while Prof Fock has built a legacy of enhancing Singapore’s healthcare and serving the public selflessly.\xa0\nAlso from the medicine ACP is Clinical Professor Tan Ban Hock, a holistic caregiver skilled in clinical medicine who has led the field in innovating care processes, especially in patient safety and quality issues.\nClinical Professor Venkataraman Anantharaman is regarded as the father of emergency medicine in Singapore, having created early initiatives in the development of a world-class emergency care system. He brings his expertise to the emergency medicine ACP.\nIn the surgery ACP, Clinical Professor Wong Wai Keong has trained many young gastrointestinal surgeons and has undertaken clinical and educational leadership throughout his career.\nGROWING SINGAPORE’S HEALTHCARE TO GREATNESS\nAlong with their clinical faculty colleagues, the Master Academic Clinicians are the lifeblood of the AMC. Across the AMC, this pool of talented medical practitioners and researchers aims to provide excellent care outcomes for patients, pursue cutting-edge innovation and nurture the next generation of clinicians.\xa0\nSaid SingHealth’s group CEO and Duke-NUS governing board member, Clinical Professor Ivy Ng: “What makes\xa0this partnership work is that we share\xa0a single vision. On the SingHealth side, our single motivation is patients at the heart of all we do, while Duke-NUS’ vision is focused on improving lives.”\nSpeaking at the induction of the first eight Master Academic Clinicians, Duke-NUS vice-dean for Academic & Clinical Development and SingHealth deputy group CEO (Research and Education) Professor Wong Tien Yin said that the event demonstrated the progress of the AMC, as well as the role of the Master Academic Clinicians as beacons lighting the way \xa0for the next generation of clinicians.\nAs they inspire and mentor new generations of clinicians, the Master Academic Clinicians continue to contribute to the growth of Singapore’s healthcare ecosystem, striving towards a vision of greatness – not for themselves, but for the benefit of their students, junior colleagues and the patients they serve.\nLearn more about Duke-NUS Medical School’s Master Academic Clinicians.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      The Big Read: Not for the faint-hearted — parents jump through hoops, go great guns to secure Primary 1 spots
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: When six-year-old Kate Ong recently secured a spot in Anderson Primary School during this year’s Primary 1 registration exercise, she had her father to thank for it.\nMr Ong Jun Da, a self-employed mobile app developer, had spent close to 80 hours last year coding an e-open house website and an art gallery microsite for the school, on top of providing technical know-how to support the live streaming of the school’s National Day celebrations that year.\nBut even this opportunity to help out at the school did not come easy. Mr Ong, 38, had earlier been rejected by three different schools when he tried to join their parent volunteering programmes.\nThe great lengths that Mr Ong had gone to, in order to secure a place for his daughter, reflects the experience of many parents in Singapore as they seek to give their children the best start in their formal schooling years — by snagging a coveted spot in the school of their choice.\nThis year’s annual registration exercise is particularly competitive, as it involves the SG50 cohort starting Primary 1 next year —\xa0\xa0the bumper crop of 33,725 citizen births in 2015, which was the highest in the 13 years preceding it, helped by the feel-good factor of the enhanced parental perks handed out in conjunction with Singapore’s jubilee celebrations.\nOver the decades, particularly in the last 10 years, the registration system has morphed into a complicated scheme comprising seven phases and a multitude of rules.\nIndeed, it is a major source of stress and consternation for parents, with some already making preparations and plotting a strategy when their child is yet to be born.\nFor Mr Ong, he started his research on prospective schools when Kate was just around three years old.\nIn December 2019, he approached Chongfu School, located just outside the 1km radius from his home in Yishun, but was told that he lives too far away.\nNext, he tried to get a spot at Northland Primary School. While he managed to qualify for a ballot, he was not among the 20 applicants – out of a total of 80 – who were selected.\nIt was only when he was rejected the third time – this time by Anderson Primary located in Yio Chu Kang, that he called and emailed the school to appeal, saying that he could do much more than serving as a traffic warden.\nAnd that was how he finally got accepted as a parent volunteer, as the school assessed that it could use his technical expertise in dealing with the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nUnder this year’s Primary\xa01 registration exercise, most children by now would have secured a spot, except for those who had been unsuccessful in the balloting and underwent supplementary registration last week. The latter group would be notified of the outcome on Aug 31.\nMr Ong noted that apart from the time he spent volunteering with Anderson Primary, he also expended many hours reading up about the registration system.\nHis frustration over the lack of digestible information publicly available eventually prompted him to start a website SGSchooling.com in 2019 that collates all the information and analysis that a parent might need, including every school’s balloting history.\nThe perennial issues surrounding Primary 1 registration — including whether the system is fair and simple enough for parents with limited means — got a renewed airing in Parliament in March when Members of Parliament (MPs) called for a review during the debate on the budget of the Ministry of Education (MOE).\nIn response, then Education Minister Lawrence Wong acknowledged that the competition for spaces in more popular schools has intensified in recent years, and so some children do not get to attend a school near their home even with the spots set aside under Phase 2C.\nCurrently, 20 places are reserved for children with no prior connection to the school, but who live within the school’s vicinity, in Phase 2C — the fifth of the seven phases in the annual registration exercise.\nMr Wong announced that MOE was reviewing how the number of spots under Phase 2C can be increased, even as he pointed out that any increase may make the earlier phases of the registration process even more competitive than they already were.\nIn response to queries, an MOE spokesperson said that the ministry regularly reviews the Primary 1 registration framework, taking into account public feedback from various sources including appeals, forum letters and the outcomes of each year’s exercise.\nStressing the importance of keeping schools open to students from all backgrounds, the spokesperson said the latest review was undertaken amid intensifying competition for places in more schools.\nIt was so stiff last year that, in 69 schools, applicants who are citizens living within 1km were subjected to a ballot although they already belong to the group living closest to the school. Such was the situation in 64 schools in this year’s exercise.\nWhile the review aims to let more children attend a school near where they live, the spokesperson stressed that MOE is “mindful that any change to the framework will need to carefully balance the interests of different groups of stakeholders as parents and families have diverse needs and circumstances”.\n“We are therefore undertaking this review very carefully,” she added.\nThere are currently at least nine ways by which parents can seek priority entry to a school if their child doesn’t already have siblings who are schooling there or had studied there.\nFormer students can either join the alumni association of their primary school (Phase 2A1) – which may involve paying a registration fee of up to S$1,000 – or simply state that they are an alumni member (Phase 2A2).\nParents can also become a member of the school’s advisory or management committee (Phase 2A1), a staff member at the school (Phase 2A2), or a member endorsed by the church or clan directly connected to the school (Phase 2B).\nParents with no prior ties with the school can enrol their child in an MOE kindergarten under the purview of, or located within, the school (Phase 2A2), serve as a parent volunteer for at least 40 hours (Phase 2B), or serve as an “active community leader” in a grassroots group (Phase 2B).\nHome-school distance would be considered when the number of applications exceeds the number of vacancies available in any phase: Citizens living under a 1km radius will be accepted first, followed by citizens living 1km to 2km away, citizens living more than 2km away, PRs living less than 1km away, and so on, until a ballot is triggered when there are not enough places for everyone in the category.\nRather than sitting back and waiting for the luck of the draw that is Phase 2C, some parents would plan early to come up with a strategy that would help their child to get into the school of their choice.\nFor banker Hong Heng Jiong, 37, whose eldest child is five, the competition has already started. He could name at least five of his son’s preschool friends who had moved to new houses in the past year, which he believes is related to the cohort’s Pri 1 registration exercise next year.\nHe had also jumped on the bandwagon and was recently accepted to serve as a parent volunteer at a school 600m away from his home, which happens to be a traditionally oversubscribed Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school.\nTo stand out, he had listed in the application form all his skill sets, including photography, first aid and experience in running sporting events. He also offered to teach financial literacy if the school needs it.\nSome parents even send in their curriculum vitae (CV).\nMrs Ho GL, 41, a freelancer in the financial industry, said that, when she was still pregnant with a boy in 2012, she and her husband paid S$100 to join the alumni association of his school, a well-known boys’ school in Bishan which she declined to name.\nAnd when preparing for her six-year-old daughter’s Phase 2B admission, she had sent in both her and her husband’s CVs to two girls’ schools, when the child was still young, to be considered for parent volunteering.\n“We don’t want to be caught in a situation where we wanted to join a phase but missed out because of a cut-off date,” Mrs Ho said.\nEarlier this year, public relations manager Rachel Ho, 31, and her lawyer husband attended a Zoom interview so that they could join the alumni association of Nanyang Primary School, to prepare for the primary school admission of their son, who is one year old this year.\nTo get started, they would have to pay a one-time S$1,000 payment for a lifetime membership with the alumni association, attend a “values talk” and two sessions of volunteer work as a traffic warden.\nBut the alumni route doesn’t mean that the registration journey will be smooth sailing either.\nThe competition has become so intense that balloting took place even at Phase 2A1 at five schools this year: Catholic High, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’, Nanyang, Pei Hwa Presbyterian and Rosyth.\nMarketing manager Alethia Lee, 34, was one of the 102 parents vying for 81 spots at Rosyth under the priority phase.\n“I didn’t expect to be stressed about it at Phase 2A1,” she said, adding that she paid S$350 to join the school’s alumni association in 2019.\nThen, there are parents like marketing executive Evelyn (not her real name), in her late 30s, who decided to relocate so that her six-year-old son would stand a better chance at the ballot under Phase 2C after failing to find a way to do parent volunteering.\nIt is logistically taxing as it meant renting out her family home to live in a rented apartment within 1km from St Andrew’s Junior School since November last year, but still having to send her son to his kindergarten in their old neighbourhood.\nThe gamble did not pay off, however, and she is now waiting for confirmation that her son has gotten into Montfort Junior School through Phase 2C Supplementary.\nAfter this upsetting experience, Evelyn has resolved to do everything she could to ensure that her daughter, who is four, enters a girls’ school through her alumni affiliation.\n“If the education system is set up to allow people to game the system, you can’t expect people to not game it,” she said.\nMs Ho agreed, adding: “It is easy to caricature people … as ‘damn freaking kiasu’, but if your forward planning can alleviate stress down the road, why not do it now?”\nThe jostling for entry into more desirable primary schools is by no means a new development. In fact, it has existed since the late 1960s.\nIn 1971, then Minister of State for Education Lee Chiaw Meng remarked in Parliament that long queues at some schools registering children for Pri 1 classes was “the most perplexing phenomenon”, and “occurred year after year”.\nThe year before, parents queued for “many days” to sign their children up at Raffles Girls’, while there were hardly any queues at all at other “established schools”, Mr Lee noted.\nAt that time, Mr Lee also said that MOE was considering alternatives such as registration by balloting or limiting registration only to children living in the vicinity of the schools.\nThe need to curb excessive demand for places in popular schools led to the birth of the inaugural version of the national Primary 1 registration system in 1972, as policymakers sought to make the process transparent and orderly.\nDespite the acceleration of changes in recent years – at least five tweaks were made in the past decade alone – an academic paper published in May this year criticised the system for being “not transparent” and too convoluted for it to be fair.\nThe study, by Yale-NUS assistant professor of social sciences (psychology) Cheung Hoi Shan and Yale sociology lecturer Mira Debs, had analysed posts on popular online parenting forum KiasuParents from 2015 and news articles from 2010 to 2020.\nThey found that even savvier parents who could access the portal were confused and anxious, needing to make a series of complex calculations to exercise preferences, such as proximity to school and ease of entry, before they were able to narrow down “safer” choices.\nAs a testament to how ballot history has become an essential tool for parents in strategising how to get into their preferred schools, more websites that offer a collation of such data have emerged in recent years.\nOther than the ones hosted by KiasuParents and SGSchooling.com, there are also elite.com.sg and snowballdata.com.\nMr Ong said that his SGSchooling website drew 78,000 unique visitors over the past two months when the Pri 1 registration process was ongoing, the highest he has gotten since he started the website two years ago.\nContrary to the portrayal of parents being “kiasu”, or scared to lose and competing among themselves, Asst Prof Cheung and Dr Debs said\xa0that they in fact seek to help one another with the process.\nAgain, the system’s sheer complexity is to blame, they said.\nIndeed, even parents who set out not wanting to be caught up in the game said that they could not resist poring over the various schools’ ballot history, just so they could pick the closest school with the highest likelihood of a vacancy.\nMrs Cheryl Grange, whose son started attending Primary 1 at Tanjong Katong Primary School this year, said: “We did a quick back-of-the-napkin kind of calculation just to get a sense of roughly how difficult it might be and what might be the worst-case scenario.”\nEven so, she felt like she was making a decision in a vacuum due to the many unknowns, such as how many children in her area are applying.\n“In the absence of that data, it kind of feels a little bit like a lucky draw,” said the communications executive in her 30s.\nIn building a fairer and less overwhelming registration system, Asst Prof Cheung and Dr Debs said the number of preference categories would have to be limited, and parents should be given a smaller set of schools from which to choose.\nIt would also help parents if they could submit a ranked list of primary schools as they do in the secondary school registration process, where they can choose up to six schools, they said. That way, if vacancies in their first-choice school are completely filled, they do not have to start all over again with the registration.\nThey added that education research has shown that even if everyone’s ballot is given equal weight, there will still be inequalities in how parents with varying resources navigate a complicated school choice system.\nFor that reason, some districts in the United States have set aside a certain number of seats for disadvantaged children such as those from low income households, English language learners, and students with disabilities.\nNoting that MOE already has a kindergarten programme, which sets aside places for students from low-income families, Asst Prof Cheung and Dr Debs said that expanding such programmes in some of the popular primary schools would be an important way to ensure that the student composition in these schools are more socio-economically diverse.\nPioneer MP Patrick Tay, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Education, has a simple wish: For more places to be allocated to those living nearby.\nHe said he had encountered many residents who were given a place in a school much further away because the one just downstairs was already heavily subscribed or had its slots taken up in initial phases.\nMr Tan Kar Hui and wife Katie Lin are among those who had raised the issue with their MP after failing to secure a place for their girl at Kong Hwa School, located about 500m away from their home in Mountbatten, in Phase 2C earlier this month. The couple, both 42, are working as consultants.\n“On paper, it looks like we have a lot of choices to fall back on, but they are an illusion,” Mr Tan said, pointing out that this is the first time that the next three schools in their consideration – Geylang Methodist, Tanjong Katong and Haig Girls’ – were filled up by Phase 2C.\n“Even balloting historical records did not prepare us for this.”\nThey ended up signing their girl for Marymount Convent 10km away, which had quite a high number of places up for grabs.\nEven so, it is now uncertain if they would get in, as MOE’s update on Wednesday (Aug 25) said that citizens living outside a 2km radius of Marymount Convent will need to undergo balloting for 74 spaces as it had received 92 applications by the end of the exercise.\nMs Lin said she had already tried to assess the situation more accurately by calling the school for an update, but it said to contact MOE instead. She then called MOE but did not get what she asked for.\n“It doesn’t allow us to make good decisions based on facts. I know that the Government is always looking at ways to improve the system, but they should have stepped in this year when it concerned the SG50 batch of babies.”\nShe added: “The Government should give extra support for full-time working adults. They place such heavy emphasis on the alumni and the volunteer work, which makes it challenging for the working-class people who may not have the flexibility to do so.”\nAdministrative executive Iris Leong, a working mum in her 30s who juggles caring for three children under the age of seven while working from home, said: “Those with ample time to volunteer have ample help at home too. Of course they can afford the 40 or 80 hours. To me, it is unfair.”\nDr Vincent Chua, an associate professor in National University of Singapore’s (NUS)\xa0Department of Sociology, said it is hard to come up with an ideal Primary 1 registration system given the multiplicity of groups, interests and considerations, especially where solving one problem introduces another.\nFor example, while allocations based on home-to-school proximity and siblings solve the “practical problem of everyday logistics for parents”, it also reproduces advantages for wealthy families in top school areas, where the “whole family” gets to go to the same school, he said.\nIn the short term, increasing the number of Phase 2C slots might help, but it still doesn't eliminate the uneven playing field.\nTo reduce competition for top schools in the long term, the only way would be to “make every school a good school” by putting more resources to the other schools so that the schools are more equally desirable, Dr Chua added.\nIt is important to solve this issue as the “whole point of schooling is to narrow the variation between families,” he said.\nAs it stands, the first four phases in the Primary 1 registration system are “network-based”, making it “potentially divisive” as it entrenches a dynamic of “social reproduction” favouring the well-connected and wealthy.\n“If not careful, the Primary 1 registration system can evolve into a system of opportunity hoarding,” Dr Chua said. “It widens the gap between elites and non-elites that impact upon social cohesion.”\nSingapore Management University law professor Eugene Tan said that while maintaining alumni relations is desirable, it is crucial for schools to not become “closed circles”.\nHence, he would rather see the number of vacancies available after Phase 1, the sibling phase, be equally divided among Phases 2A (the sub-phases combined), 2B, and 2C, he said. Currently, only 40 places are set aside: 20 for Phase 2B and 20 for Phase 2C.\nA no-holds barred review of eligibility for each phase is also due, including a reconsideration of whether a member of the primary school’s school advisory committee should be given priority, he said.\nHe added that the parent volunteer scheme should be discontinued as the process of who gets selected to be a parent volunteer becomes “controversial” when demand often outstrips supply of volunteering opportunities, featuring CVs or even tacit appeals for donations to the school.\nNUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser said that the fairest way may well be to put everyone through a ballot, where every application has statistically a more or less equal chance of being selected.\nBut parent of three Christopher Gee, 52, believes this would spark an uproar.\n“If everyone goes through a random ballot, how would you make a decision? Imagine if that was the scheme tomorrow. There would be confusion. I’d argue that very few people would be for it,” said the academic.\nHence, any alternative system would still end up with some form of preference, which would inevitably favour some people more than others. “How is it different from the current system?” he asked. “What we have could well be the least worst of the systems.”\nBut he said the mantra of “every school is a good school” needs to be backed up.\n“You might need to differentiate them a bit more, or else they are just neighbourhood schools ... They need to be seen as really good schools that parents want to send their children to, not just ‘any other school’,” he said.\nThe fact that Primary 1 registration has become a high-stakes exercise is a manifestation of the larger societal concerns and anxieties, Mr Gee said.\n“We are all in this prisoners’ dilemma together. We are all doing this to each other.\n“For what? We end up with more mental stress for parents, more mental stress for the kids, expending more energy on this internal ‘winner takes all’ contest, which only differentiates in minute ways that are ultimately completely unimportant to one's purpose in life,” he said.\nSome parents have already decided to stay out of the game, for the sake of their own sanity, as well as their kids’.\nOne of them is a 35-year-old lawyer who, despite having secured a place for her daughter at Rosyth under Phase 2A1 in July, made the unpopular decision to enrol her child at Marymount Convent instead.\nMs Ang, who declined to give her full name, said that Rosyth, one of the most competitive schools to get in, was a “natural choice” as they live within 1km of it and she was an alumni.\nThere was also the pressure from family and friends who gushed about how it is a good school and that she would be “foolish to give it up”.\nBut Ms Ang ultimately withdrew with her child’s interest in mind.\nShe described her child as a bright and perfectionist girl who had not reacted well to a highly academic environment in preschool. Marymount Convent would be a better fit for her, said Ms Ang.\n“She is already very hard on herself. I want an environment where she is not going to focus on one benchmark to measure herself by,” said Ms Ang.\nFor more news like this, visit\xa0todayonline.com\n"", 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     Primary School registration ', '     education ']}"

      They left their home comforts as teens to study in Singapore. A scholarship wasn’t the only reason
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: While in secondary school in Hanoi, Le Minh Giang used to have little respite on school days. Once school ended at 4pm, he had to prepare for cram classes in the evening.\nBut these classes were not related to what he was learning in school; instead, they were tailored to prepare him for the opportunity to study in Singapore — through a shot at a scholarship.\nEvery year, the Ministry of Education awards a variety of bond-free scholarships to students from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), China and India, who join Secondary 1, Secondary 3 or Pre-university 1 classes in selected Singaporean schools.\nThe scholarships cover an annual allowance, hostel accommodation, return airfare and school fees. For students like Giang, extra preparatory classes are a small price to pay for a scholarship they covet.\nThe selection process is rigorous and competitive: Shortlisted applicants are required to take a series of English, mathematics and general logic tests. A small number are then invited to the final stage of selection, an interview.\nVedant Sandhu, 22, recalls that he was one of three recipients of the Singapore Airlines Youth scholarship for Indian students in the year he applied, out of thousands of applicants.\nThese international scholarship holders make up 0.9 per cent of Singapore’s secondary school and pre-university students, the ministry reported in 2019.\nThough in some schools, their numbers are more sizeable. Giang, who received the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) scholarship in 2015, says he had 31 fellow recipients in his batch in Anglo-Chinese School (Independent).\nIt may be little wonder that they are attracted to Singapore’s educational system. But the idea of studying here also holds different promises for different scholarship holders, who have an array of journeys and dreams. And not all expectations are realised eventually.\nFor 21-year-old Giang, the seeds of his “dream” of studying in Singapore were planted when his older brother, Le Minh Phuc, was awarded Singapore’s Asean scholarship in 2010.\n“Before my brother went to Singapore, I didn’t even know it was possible to study abroad before university,” he recalls.\nPhuc was placed in National Junior College. Through weekly video calls on Facebook Messenger, he relayed details of his overseas school trips and Malay dance co-curricular activity sessions.\nTo Giang, these represented an escape from the “long days of classes after classes” at his secondary school in Vietnam. He was motivated to follow in his brother’s footsteps.\n“I felt that (Singapore’s) was a more holistic education that (would give) me more freedom to do what I want,” he says.\nBut first, there was cram school to attend, to increase his chances of getting the scholarship. He started lessons in Secondary 1 and learnt material from Singapore’s education syllabus.\nThe scholarship’s popularity has spawned a boutique industry not just in Vietnam.\nUpon returning home after his A levels, scholarship recipient Albert Augustino from Medan, Indonesia, set up a tuition centre — along with three friends — to prepare students for the selection process for Singapore-based scholarships.\nIt provides lessons in English, mathematics and interview preparation. Despite competing with a larger, more established tuition centre, it signed up 12 students within a few weeks. Tuition centres for these scholarships are “widespread”, says the 20-year-old.\nScholarship recipients from Malaysia and Thailand also affirm that “large communities” of parents and students are formed around these tuition centres.\nAfter submitting his Secondary 3 scholarship application, Giang underwent two days of assessments. Following the final interview, he was informed that he had been awarded the A*Star scholarship, along with nine others.\n“When I got it, I was quite speechless (with) that feeling that you (have got) something you’ve been working so long towards,” he recalls.\nWhile his path to a scholarship was relatively straightforward, it was less so for 22-year-old Presca Lim.\nBorn in Penang, Malaysia,\xa0she spent her childhood drawing on any surface she could get her hands on. “Everything I did was about art,” she recalls.\nIn Primary 6, the topic of her future profession came up in a conversation with a teacher.\n“I said I wanted to be an artist, then she said why not be an architect? It’s more professional, and you earn more money,” Lim recounts.\n“I thought: Oh, that sounds cool. When I told my family and friends, everyone supported this idea. And that’s how I decided that should be my dream.”\nShe came up a plan: Study in Singapore first, for the opportunities that would “equip (her) better” to achieve her dream, and then go to Germany to study architecture. But it was easier said than done.\nHer first application for the Asean scholarship in Secondary 1 was rejected, along with the second, third and fourth. She had been “just trying (her) luck”, she acknowledged.\n“I needed to get my life straight,” says Lim, who was in Secondary 3 by then.\nTo ensure that her fifth application would be her final one, she practised on workbooks from Singapore and applied for a school-based scholarship available to certain schools in Malaysia affiliated to Methodist Girls' School in Singapore.\n“When I finally got the scholarship, I was excited and hopeful. It was like a promising future,” she says.\nOnce in Singapore, change comes for these scholarship holders in both expected and unexpected ways.\nHere, school usually ended by 2pm for Giang, and he was excited to use his new-found time to explore non-academic pursuits, like his fledgling interest in dance, which he could not fully pursue in Vietnam owing to his busy schedule.\nOne of the first things he did in Singapore was take up dance as a co-curricular activity.\nHe still remembers every detail of his first dance class at O School, a dance studio at *Scape — from the lyrics to the steps.\n“I was very awkward. I didn’t know what was normal in a dance class, and the whole lesson was (about) me struggling to follow hip-hop,” he says. “But after that, I was excited to learn more.”\nDance soon became an abiding passion as he participated in dance auditions and competitions. In this way, he was able to enter Victoria Junior College via the Direct School Admission (DSA).\nToday, he is heavily involved in the Singapore dance scene and has even judged competitions, a role taken on by the more experienced dancers in the community.\nWould things have been different if he had stayed in Vietnam? “I wouldn’t be doing the same style of dance I’m doing today. And I wouldn’t have met my closest friends,” he replies.\nFor Lim, who arrived in Singapore expecting to study a predetermined set of subjects, her initial dream of becoming an artist resurfaced unexpectedly in her first week of school: An art teacher informed her that it was possible to take Art as an O-level subject if she submitted a portfolio.\n“Back in Malaysia, art wasn’t the most important subject at school. But when I found out Singapore’s O levels deemed art as a very legit subject, that gave me hope,” she says.\nShe passed the aptitude test and enrolled in her school’s Art Elective Programme — for the first time, she could pursue art in a well-funded environment. It soon became “one of the things that got (her) through (her) stay in Singapore”.\nShe excelled in the subject, which allowed her to enter Hwa Chong Institution (Junior College) via the DSA scheme.\nEventually, she enrolled at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, hoping to study architecture and sustainable design before planning her route to Germany. After a chance experience with a computer science course that she liked, however, she switched courses.\n“I changed my 10-year ambition in a few months,” she remarks. She now aspires to be a UI/UX (user interaction and experience) designer, to combine her love of both computer science and art.\nWhile scholarship recipients like Giang and Lim have flourished under Singapore’s educational system, not all of them manage to adapt well. Some of them have had their scholarships terminated for poor academic performance or disciplinary infractions.\nWATCH: Life as an international scholar in Singapore (10:32)\nTake, for example, Yap Kian Yew, who was invited for the scholarship selection test and interview in 2013 after he was placed fourth in the Asia-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools.\nAt the age of 13, he was placed in the Integrated Programme at Hwa Chong Institution along with other scholarship recipients who had done similarly well in the competition.\nThe decision to accept the scholarship was automatic, yet he “wasn’t exactly sure of what to expect”. The 21-year-old says: “(It’s) almost like I decided to come on a whim.”\nThe academic transition proved difficult for the straight-A student from Malaysia. He “didn’t know how to react” when he got Cs in his first few tests.\n“It was a bit of a shock because of the difference in difficulty,” he recalls. “I wasn’t used to working hard … You have to be quite independent (in Singapore), and I wasn’t able to do that.”\nThe school arranged to meet his parents after his first semester. But without his parents’ full supervision, he started to spend more time on computer gaming, which led to his laptop being confiscated in his second semester.\n“On weekends, I spent 18 hours (a day) gaming. I’d game into the night, go for breakfast, then sleep,” he recounts. “I lost my passion for learning. Instead of trying to catch up, I just gave up.”\nHours after school were spent sleeping in various places in his student dormitory, and his grades failed to improve.\nWhile he periodically failed subjects, he was able to pull his grades up to the minimum needed for promotion in the year-end exams. Eventually, he dropped out of the Integrated Programme and was placed on the O-level track.\nParadoxically, he continued to perform well in maths Olympiads. He remembers getting the F9 grade in a Secondary 2 math paper and receiving a gold award in the Singapore Math Olympiad on the same day.\n“There was a disconnect between what I was good at and what I did in class,” he says.\nEvery semester, international scholarship recipients with poor academic results are placed on a warning list of sorts, which entails a visit from ministry officers. Yap found himself on the list regularly.\nTo change his behaviour, a staff member in charge of managing scholarship recipients asked Yap’s peers to keep tabs on his movements throughout the day.\n“I saw photos of me sleeping on the sofa in the common area. They had a whole document of what I was doing at different times of the day, and they showed it to me and my parents,” he recalls.\n“My mum was pretty angry. They didn’t try to connect with me on a personal level.”\nPart of his apathy stemmed from his deteriorating mental health, and his lowest point came in Secondary 3. “I didn’t want to go to school. I’d lie in bed and not go,” he says.\nHe was referred to a school counsellor and eventually was diagnosed with mild depression.\nWhen he took a month’s break from his studies to return home, his relationship with his school had deteriorated to the point where he told his parents to “expect (his) scholarship to be terminated soon”.\nHaving got into trouble for several absences from school and continued academic under-performance, the writing was on the wall. Six months before his O levels, he received an email informing him that his scholarship had been terminated.\n“At that point, I felt ‘whatever’. I just wanted to finish my O levels and get out,” he says.\nAs he did not initiate the termination, he did not have to pay a financial penalty, a fear many scholarship recipients have. He was able to continue studying but had to start paying school fees out of his own pocket.\nHis L1R5 score of 11 in his O levels qualified him for junior college in Singapore, but he returned home and took his A-levels at Methodist College Kuala Lumpur. He is now studying computer science at Monash University Malaysia.\n“I don’t regret coming (to Singapore) as I learned a lot. But I feel I’d have developed better if I hadn’t come,” he says, referring to his struggles to adapt.\nWhile his story illuminates how there can be a mismatch between expectations and ability, terminations remain rare. He was the only scholarship recipient in his batch of 11 whose scholarship was terminated.\nFor the hopeful applicants scattered throughout the region, Yap’s story may be a cautionary tale but not a deterrent.\nAsean scholarship recipient Hnin Azali believes its benefits outweigh the costs of living independently at a much younger age than her peers. That is why the 21-year-old convinced her younger sister in Mandalay, Myanmar, to also apply for the scholarship.\nThe Vietnamese students attending cram school as Giang did may feel the same way, though a Singapore scholarship might capture each child’s imagination differently, in stories yet to unfold.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      'Definitely didn’t see it coming': Yale-NUS and University Scholars Programme students, alumni react to news of merger
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Students from Yale-NUS College and the University Scholars Programme (USP) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) have said they are shocked and confused at the news that the two programmes will merge.\xa0\nYale-NUS will close in 2025, ceasing Yale University’s collaboration with NUS, and its 2021 intake will be its last batch. The two programmes - Yale-NUS\xa0and USP - will be merged and will accept its first batch of students from 2022, NUS announced on Friday (Aug 27).\xa0\nThe original affiliation agreement signed in 2011 between NUS and Yale has always given either party the opportunity to withdraw in 2025, said the Connecticut-based university.\xa0\nOn its news site, Yale University said\xa0NUS\xa0announced its intention to withdraw four years in advance, which gives current students the chance to complete their undergraduate studies as planned.\xa0\nYale-NUS was established in 2011, and USP was established in 2001. Both programmes have residential colleges in UTown. Students currently enrolled in the USP will transit to the new college from January 2022.\xa0\nSpeaking to CNA\xa0at the Yale-NUS campus, first-year student Jordan (not his real name) said students were only informed on Thursday that classes would be cancelled on Friday, without further details.\nYale-NUS and USP students were given a Zoom link for a virtual townhall on Friday morning, which started shortly after the announcement of the merger.\xa0\n""Some of (my friends) are sad. They turned down opportunities elsewhere to come here … those are good opportunities. So it’s a shame. I guess it’s a bit irresponsible,"" said Jordan.\nAdding that it would have been more helpful if the school had told its students about the merger earlier, Jordan\xa0said: “People’s decisions would definitely change. I can guarantee that. But that’s the way the world works ... I think there’s a lot of people wanting to transfer now.”\nClasses for the new academic year began at Yale-NUS and USP in August.\nFor Jordan, who is Singaporean but has lived overseas his whole life, coming to Yale-NUS was a dream - and he “didn’t even think about other schools”.\xa0\n“Coming back to my home country, getting to know my country, and having an international curriculum. The reputation of Yale also definitely attracted me. But now it’s like I’m going to a non-existent college,"" he said.\xa0\nHe also expressed concern about applying for jobs in the future, as he thinks employers “will have to do some digging” for background on his university.\xa0\n“I was frankly quite shocked when the announcement was made because I thought that the two programmes offered at Yale-NUS\xa0and USP were sufficiently distinct,” first-year USP student Chiew Chern Faye told CNA.\xa0\nShe hopes that the new college will bring about new and exciting learning opportunities for future cohorts, and that current students will be given “adequate support” to navigate this new development.\xa0\n“Since developments are still ongoing, I am unsure of what exactly to expect in the new programme. However, I hope that it will bring about new opportunities and allow us access to more resources to facilitate our learning,” she said.\xa0\nAfter classes were cancelled and the townhall was announced, students were speculating about what the announcement would be, said a Year 3 USP student who only wanted to be known as Charlene.\xa0\n“And then suddenly, when the townhall started, there were already news articles coming out on the merger itself. It was a concurrent shock because on the Telegram chat there were news articles, and the NUS president was also announcing it on Zoom,” she added.\xa0\n“We were all very very surprised by this, we definitely didn’t see it coming.”\xa0\nCharlene, as well as a group of other Year 3 students, were “quite concerned” at first about their graduation certificates, and how the new college would affect their prospects in the future.\xa0\n“We entered USP for the USP experience and the prestige that comes with USP,” she added.\n“Despite USP being quite a young institution of only 20 years, I think I was quite sad about (how) when we graduate, USP will no longer be here for us.\n""It just feels like all the heritage that comes with USP might vanish alongside the merger with Yale-NUS.""\nMoving forward, she hopes for more sessions or townhalls between the NUS admin and affected students with more information about what will happen in the future.\xa0\n“As of now, the Q&A, even though they’re involving both USP admin and the NUS provost, they seem to be giving very vague answers, or they don’t seem to be giving us very concrete assurance of what’s going to happen,” said Charlene.\xa0\n“They keep saying something is going to happen, but it’s just all very unclear, and all the details aren’t really there yet. I guess it’s just quite disconcerting.”\xa0\nFor future plans, she hopes the university will engage with students first on the initiatives before “throwing us into the depths of these announcements”.\xa0\nSeveral final-year Yale-NUS students on campus expressed sadness about the loss of college culture.\xa0\nThe smaller size of Yale-NUS meant students felt “closer to management”, said 22-year-old student Alice, who declined to give her real name.\xa0\n“Whatever we feel about certain things, we feel comfortable voicing it out. ... And if we scale up, I\'m not sure how much support there will be in the future. I’ve just had a good time in this school and thinking how it will change (makes me) a bit sad,” she told CNA.\xa0\n“This space is quite special, especially in Singapore … The founding faculty and admin knew what it was like to run a small liberal college,” said Henry (not his real name), 24. \xa0\n“There’s a closeness that’s not contrived, but actually cultivated. I think a lot of people are saying they have no faith that they will be able to replicate it in a larger (setting).\xa0\n“(Here at Yale-NUS), boys can wear dresses, and in orientation there were people who would dance in the rain. People can just do what they want and (other) people would leave you alone. I’m happy that there was this space, even if you weren’t so inclined to dance in the mud.”\xa0\nFinal-year student Lucas said he feels “doomed and lost”.\xa0\n“What’s the point of anything now, if all I can say is that I’m from a failed experiment that no longer exists? Why was this not made more transparent?” the 24-year-old said.\xa0\nFreshmen at Yale-NUS were also reminded to pay their university fees just before the announcement on Friday, he noted.\xa0\nIn an email sent to students on Aug 2 seen by CNA, the NUS Office of Finance said that the due date for the payment of tuition fees for the first semester of the 2021 academic year was Friday - the same day of the merger announcement - for all modes except GIRO.\xa0\nLucas felt news of the merger “trapped the freshmen”, and said he was advising all of them to drop out of the programme because of the “terrible planning”.\xa0\nAlumni for both colleges also expressed shock and disappointment at the news.\xa0\nAn alumnus from the pioneer batch of Yale-NUS who only wanted to be known as Qistina said she was “genuinely shocked” despite having heard rumours of a merger.\xa0\nNoting that NUS had also previously announced that it would form a new College of Humanities and Sciences in September 2020, she added that this news now “makes a bit more sense”.\xa0\nThe NUS College of Humanities and Sciences was set up in 2021 as part of a push towards broad-based and interdisciplinary education.\xa0\nStudents admitted to the college belong to both the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences\xa0and the Faculty of Science. They have access to majors and minors offered in both faculties, as well as the three types of four-year honours degree programmes - Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Social Sciences and Bachelor of Science.\nNUS announced the new college in September 2020. At the time, the university said the proposed curricula structure will allow for “greater flexibility and the cross-pollination of disciplines” across the humanities, social sciences, science and mathematics.\n“The rapid pace of change in many industries means that the old model of intense academic specialisation will no longer work for our young adults,"" NUS president Professor Tan Eng Chye had said.\xa0\n“Rather, graduates into the workforce will need breadth of knowledge, depth, as well as the ability to integrate multiple disciplines to solve complex problems.”\xa0\n“As an alumni, I don’t quite know yet how to process my relationship to an institution that will not exist in four years time. I don’t know how to process how my relationship with it will change, given that this is a completely new institution, and understandably it’s going to be very very different from the one that I knew and grew up in,” said Qistina.\xa0\nShe hopes that active student participation, which is a “core principle” at Yale-NUS, will continue on into the new college.\xa0\n“I want the students to be able to take charge of their education and feel like they have a sense of ownership over it. In my batch, we definitely very strongly had the opportunity to do it because we were so new, we were the only ones who were experiencing everything for the first time,” Qistina told CNA.\xa0\n“That’s something that, when I graduated, I wanted to continue. If they’re able to carry that into the new school, that would be wonderful because I don’t always see institutions giving students that autonomy.”\xa0\nAnother Yale-NUS alumnus from the pioneer batch who only wanted to be known as Mel told CNA: “Honestly, it is a mixture of shock and disappointment. USP is a great programme with its own merits, but Yale-NUS was always framed to us as an autonomous institution from the start.\n“It was an experiment, but from the success and exciting outcomes of the first few batches, most of us felt that it was an experiment worth continuing. Unfortunately, we did feel like the carpet was suddenly pulled from under us with no warning.” \xa0\nThe tight community, the access to many disciplines and the diversity of people and ideas Yale-NUS students experience is “not something that can be easily recreated”, she told CNA.\xa0\n“After graduation, I have not been able to find anything close to it, and it is something I have always missed, and will continue to miss.”\xa0\nAlthough she is glad that interdisciplinary education paths are “gaining traction”, she hopes that the spirit of “thinking with different hats, critical thought and bravery to explore new paths” will continue to be embraced in the new college.\xa0\n“I worry for the younger batches who are still in Yale-NUS, as they were sold a dream and a concept that they will only get half of. The culture will inevitably be different, since the school will be much larger, but we can only be optimistic about it,” Mel added.\xa0\n“If anything, perhaps the choice that NUS made is reflective of the success of Yale-NUS - so much so that it decided to multiply it to a bigger audience. But there is still a sense of loss and heartbreak in the small special space that we created, as the sense of intimacy and purpose to make this project work will be lost.”\xa0\nUSP alumni Chan Meiyi said she was quite surprised by the announcement as both institutions are quite young, noting that USP and Yale-NUS were set up in 2001 and 2011 respectively.\xa0\n“I feel that it hasn’t been a particularly long time since the university’s infrastructure has gone through changes,” said Ms Chan, who graduated in 2011.\xa0\n“It’s barely been 10 years, so I don’t feel like either of the colleges or USP itself has had a sufficiently long time to grow really significant and meaningful roots in the community.”\xa0\nUSP’s small cohort size, especially before Cinnamon College was established, was a reason for the programme’s success and strong alumni ties, she added.\xa0\n“The decision to terminate USP by merger for reasons of \'scale\'\xa0is therefore quite disappointing,” said Ms Chan.\xa0\nAdding that the merger announcement is “a bit surprising, somewhat disheartening”, she said: “I’m not very encouraged by it because it makes me question why there are so many changes in a relatively short amount of time for an academic institution.”\xa0\nMs Chan also noted that the common curriculum at the new college would be enhanced with science, technology, engineering and math elements.\xa0\n“It’s a bit disheartening because the whole point of USP was not to privilege any particular discipline. It was to allow people from various disciplines to take classes in other disciplines,” she said.\xa0\n“Once you’re saying that we’re going to be enhancing it with STEM aspects, or even to say we’re going to be enhancing it with humanities aspects, I would be questioning what the objective is now.\xa0\n“In the past, USP was a very open-ended disciplinary programme. When you weigh it (more) in certain areas, to me, that’s a different programme. Now it has a slightly different agenda from what I was used to when I was a student.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     NUS ', '     Yale-NUS ']}"

      Yale-NUS and University Scholars Programme to be combined into one new college from 2022
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Two programmes at the National University of Singapore (NUS) –\xa0Yale-NUS College and the University Scholars Programme (USP) – will be combined into a single new college from 2022.\xa0\nIn a press release on Friday (Aug 27), the university said students of the new college will read a new common curriculum adapted from “the best of both the USP and Yale-NUS foundations”, enhanced with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) elements.\xa0\nThis means that Yale-NUS College will “cease” in 2025, said Yale University on its news site after the announcement.\xa0\nGraduating students from this new college will earn degrees conferred by their respective home school or faculty.\xa0\nThe merger of both programmes will provide students with ""an immersive, interdisciplinary liberal arts education"", said the university in its press release.\xa0\nThe programme will also retain a feature of the USP, where students can access the full range of majors, second majors, minors and specialisations offered across NUS.\xa0\nThe USP accepted its first intake in 2001. In 2011, the programme moved to UTown after its residential college\xa0Cinnamon College was established.\xa0\nThe new college will welcome its first intake of up to 500 students in the academic year of 2022. Students currently enrolled in the USP will transit to the new college that year.\xa0Students who matriculated into Yale-NUS in the academic year of 2021 will form the last batch of students from the college, graduating in 2025.\xa0\nThe original affiliation agreement signed in 2011 between NUS and Yale has always given either party the opportunity to withdraw in 2025, said the Connecticut-based university.\xa0\n“By announcing four years in advance its intention to withdraw, NUS is providing all current Yale-NUS College students the chance to complete their undergraduate studies as planned,” the statement read.\nAll current Yale-NUS students including the last cohort will “continue to enjoy the full Yale-NUS experience” and earn the same degree conferred by NUS as previous students, the university said.\xa0\n“Allowing students the flexibility to build their own learning portfolio and achieve their desired breadth and depth across diverse fields, the New College will offer greater access to multiple pathways and combinations in areas of specialisations.\xa0\n“Students will experience the model of immersive and interdisciplinary learning characterised by flexible curriculum, residential living and small group teaching.”\xa0\nYale-NUS was established in 2011 as a collaboration between Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and NUS, launched as Singapore’s first liberal arts college.\xa0\nStudents of the college spend four years in a residential college at UTown, and they graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours or a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours from the college, awarded by NUS.\xa0\nYale University will continue to play “an advisory role” in the new college as a pioneering member of its international advisory panel, said NUS president Professor Tan Eng Chye.\xa0\nYale representatives will play no role in the oversight of the new college, but Prof Pericles Lewis, who served as Yale-NUS’ founding president from 2012 to 2017, will join its planning committee.\xa0\nIn a letter, Prof Lewis said planning for Yale-NUS College and becoming its founding president was “one of the great endeavours” of his life.\xa0\nAdding that Yale’s senior faculty and trustees feel strongly that Yale-NUS is a “remarkable institution”, he wrote: “The College has attracted excellent faculty, staff, and students. The innovative common curriculum and co-curricular and residential activities have been distinctive and influential.\xa0\n“We are proud that Yale-NUS alumni have launched their lives after college successfully, whether in employment or graduate education. Distinguished for its culture, Yale-NUS is one of the leading liberal arts colleges in the world.”\xa0\nWith “bittersweet emotion”, Prof Lewis thanked students, alumni and faculty of Yale-NUS for their contributions to the college.\xa0\n“It is my hope that when, in four years, Yale-NUS combines with USP to create something new and at greater scale, the distinctive DNA of each will be discernible, and the new combination will become essential to the future of liberal education in Singapore and in Asia more broadly,” he wrote.\xa0\n“Yale takes great pride in the accomplishments of Yale-NUS College — a pioneering partnership between two leading universities to create a residentially based liberal arts college,” said Yale president Professor Peter Salovey.\xa0\n“I want to offer my best wishes for the new college and express our gratitude for the generous support of the Government of Singapore in making it possible for us to partner in the creation of a model of liberal arts education that is regarded as one of the most innovative in the world — one whose DNA will live on, we trust, in new and exciting ways.”\xa0\nYale-NUS will remain open and continue running its academic, co-curricular and research programmes until the end of the academic year of 2024 to 2025, said NUS in the press release.\xa0\nA New College Planning Committee will continue the plan to develop the new college, chaired by NUS senior deputy president and provost Professor Ho Teck Hua, comprising leaders from both USP and Yale-NUS.\xa0\nIn a letter addressed to Yale-NUS staff, students and alumni, Prof Tan said NUS is committed to “ensuring as much continuity as possible” for everyone. He assured students currently enrolled that they will continue to receive ""the full Yale-NUS experience"".\xa0\n“For Yale-NUS faculty and staff, I would like to assure you that your contracts will be honoured, and there will be no redundancies,” he wrote.\nThe faculty will continue to teach college modules until 2025, though many may also be involved in teaching the common curriculum at the new college, Prof Tan added.\xa0\nIn another letter to USP faculty and staff, he also reassured them that there will be no redundancies, and that they will have the opportunity to be deployed to the new college or other departments in NUS.\xa0\n“Many operations will stay status quo, but some may gradually change as we make the transition,” he wrote in that letter.\xa0\nYale-NUS alumni will continue to be alumni of both Yale-NUS College and NUS, and will also be recognised as alumni of the new college. Similarly, USP alumni will also be recognised as alumni of the new college.\xa0\n“We have enjoyed a close friendship and established a strong bond with Yale since 2001, and are proud to have pioneered a model of liberal arts education in Singapore and Asia that is trailblazing, distinctive and world-renowned,” he wrote.\xa0\n“We had a vision to develop a unique model of liberal arts education contextualised to Asia in the 21st century, and that has been achieved. Both NUS and Yale are extremely proud of what Yale-NUS has accomplished over the past 10 years.”\xa0\nNUS has “great respect and admiration” for what both colleges have built over the years, said Prof Tan.\xa0\n“We truly believe this is an incredible opportunity for all of us, collectively, to build on this legacy. We are very focused on making sure the New College reflects the very best of both its predecessors.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     NUS ']}"

Students who are currently \xa0enrolled in the two schools will “seamlessly transit” into the new college with effect from Jan 1, 2022.\xa0\nFrom this August, the newest cohort of students of about 1,800 students enrolled in the Faculty of Engineering and School of Design and Environment can take courses from both schools to “develop competencies across different fields”.\xa0\nThis cohort will start their time with NUS with a common curriculum, and “enjoy greater choice, breadth and flexibility in charting their learning journeys”, said NUS in the press release.\xa0\nThe college will be home to the 11 departments in the two existing schools, and is a “future-focused, interdisciplinary learning and research institution” designed to advance the applications and professions of engineering and design.\xa0\nIt was conceptualised by a task force chaired by NUS Senior Deputy President and Provost Professor Ho Teck Hua, comprising industry leaders, as well as the deans and some academics from the two schools.\xa0\n“In the converging fields of engineering and design, professionals must be able to problem-find, ideate, build and realise their ideas into solutions that are practical, functional and appealing. This requires thinking and behaviour that reflect adaptability, empathy, creativity, and resourcefulness,” said Prof Ho.\xa0\n“At NUS, we see a great opportunity to bring together two world-class NUS schools – the Faculty of Engineering and the School of Design and Environment – to pioneer a unique model of interdisciplinary undergraduate education that takes advantage of the natural synergies between these fields.”\xa0\nCurrent Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Professor Aaron Thean has been appointed the Dean-Designate of the new college, and will lead the merger of the two schools.\xa0\n“This is a very exciting development and we are encouraged by the positive response from students, employers and professional institutions following the introduction of the forward-looking common curriculum,” he said.\xa0\n“At CDE, students will have the flexibility to build their own programme based on how broad, deep or integrated they want their education to be. This addresses the increasingly diverse design and engineering professions in Singapore.”\xa0\nStudents will also gain a “broad intellectual foundation” for lifelong and development, said Prof Thean.\xa0\n“Our goal is to nurture a new generation of professional engineers, technologists, architects, designers and built-environment specialists who will have deep domain knowledge, enhanced by a multi-disciplinary background. We hope our students will be well prepared to draw from and collaborate with wide areas of expertise, to solve complex problems.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     NUS ']}"

      Traineeships, school schemes pick up slack with fewer jobs for fresh graduates in some industries
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Fresh graduate Nur Tasleem Banu, who studied Applied Math, has been applying for internships, part-time gigs and jobs since May 2020.\xa0\nAlthough she is only graduating from the National University of Singapore this year, she wanted to get an internship or some work experience first, but had no luck until recently.\n“You're like ... I haven't gotten a job and you're wondering when you're going to get a job.\xa0Is the economy going to recover? Are you going to be unemployed for a long time?” she said, adding that she knows many seniors who graduated last year and\xa0are still on traineeships.\nAnd while she would prefer a full-time job, the 23-year-old told CNA that she is happy to pick up some skills and experience first as an intern or trainee. She landed a traineeship under the National Youth Council’s YouthTech programme last month and started work last week.\xa0\nThe whole process was mentally and emotionally challenging, not least because of the uncertainty, she said.\n“It’s very difficult to tell whether is it because I’m lacking skills or is it because of the pandemic,” she said. “You have a lot of questions … like (when you get an offer), if I don't accept now, am I going to get another job offer?”\nHer experience mirrors that of fresh graduates that CNA spoke to. While all have found work in some form, a number have taken up traineeships while they wait for a full-time position.\nAs of end-April,\xa0about 9,200 fresh graduates are in the SGUnited Traineeships Programme (SGUT), said Workforce Singapore (WSG).\nThe programme aims to help those graduating between 2019 and 2021 take up traineeships lasting up to six months. Trainees are given an allowance of up to S$2,500 a month that is 80 per cent co-funded by the Government.\n“Most of the traineeships are still ongoing. Among these trainees, over 680 fresh graduates were offered full-time employment with their host organisation, or had found full-time employment elsewhere,” a WSG spokesperson said.\nFor those graduating this year, WSG said it has one-to-one career advisory and preparatory workshops covering topics such as resume writing, virtual job interviews and personal branding. Fresh graduates can also seek career advice from lecturers or career guidance officers in their schools, it said.\xa0\nSince last year, institutes of higher learning have pushed out programmes to help recent graduates cope with poorer employment prospects.\nThe Institute of Technical Education (ITE)\xa0has offered its graduates from the class of 2020 and 2021 free continuing education and\xa0training modules. Graduates were also offered job counselling services, virtual career fairs, a one-stop job site (CareerNet@ITE portal) and a Telegram channel where they can get job alerts.\xa0\nTemasek Polytechnic (TP) began a career kick-starter programme last year with the onset of the pandemic and has extended it this year to 2021 graduates.\nGraduates receive S$500 in course credits which they can use to enrol\xa0in short courses, and the polytechnic also provides career coaching, said Ms Tan Siew Kim, director of corporate communications at the polytechnic.\nA third area of help is in matching them with job opportunities in the school.\n“To help our graduates and to ensure that they're given the opportunity to pick up valuable experience amid this pandemic, internally in TP, we have actually created a total of 80 positions under our kick-starter initiative in 2021,” said Ms Tan.\n“We have seen a very healthy uptake from our TP graduates under this scheme.”\nTwo graduates joined TP’s corporate communications department this year under the programme, she added.\xa0\n“The main challenge for the kick-starter is really to address the shrinking number of employment opportunities in certain sectors, (such as) aviation and hospitality,” she said.\nJobTech, a start-up that provides AI job matching and labour market analysis, said that the ratio of new-graduate to total jobs\xa0remained constant from April 2019 to July 2021.\xa0\nHowever, as some industries faced a large decline in job openings, there are fewer new-graduate jobs overall, making job seeking difficult, said a spokesperson. Industries dented by the pandemic, such as tourism, are also the worst affected.\nJobTech data also showed\xa0a large spike in SGUnited Traineeship openings around the second quarter of 2020 when the scheme was introduced, but concluded that they did not seem to reduce the amount of new graduate job postings in many cases.\nWSG career coach Vimala Ramasamy said that for Singaporeans who have recently graduated from ITE, polytechnic, university and private educational institutions, entering the job market at this time can be “quite nerve-racking”.\xa0\n“However, the future is not bleak. The key is to be versatile and stay adaptable,” she said.\n“Before they proceed on their job search, it is important for them to first understand about themselves (their profile), their strengths and weakness, towards the objective of identifying as many options as possible that tap on their strengths and career interests. Then, they can apply for job roles that are aligned to their personal growth and interests.”\nMs Jaya Dass, Randstad's managing director for Malaysia and\xa0Singapore, said that the graduating class this year may be in a better position to secure a job compared to last year, in part due to the recovering economy.\xa0\nHowever, there are other factors to consider. For one thing, the SGUnited\xa0traineeship programmes are slowly retiring.\xa0\n“This means that employers will need to revert to pre-pandemic hiring budgets, which some of them may not be prepared to do,” she said.\xa0\nMany employers Randstand works with also want more digital capabilities, she said.\xa0\n“Employers are also more likely to look to younger talent to bring new ideas to drive digital-led initiatives that have potential to drive business performance and productivity,” she said.\n“So while there are more job options for them to pick from, graduating students need to note that job requirements are very different from previous cohorts.”\nShe said that graduating students should be patient and take time to conduct extensive research on the employer.\n“While the urgency to secure a job as quickly as possible is justifiable, it is critical to take the time to evaluate your options and really understand if the employer and job is a good fit for you,” she said.\xa0\n“If personal income and expenses allow, we always advise candidates to find a job that fits what they are looking for. The last thing any job candidate wants to experience is to settle for a job that doesn’t quite meet their requirements, only to restart the job searching process all over again in a couple of months.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     jobs ']}"

      Schools will provide diversity of skillsets and education pathways as MOE looks to re-examine teaching, testing: Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore “must build diversity” and strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as well as soft skills learning in schools, said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Aug 16).\xa0\nSpeaking at an engagement forum for public officers jointly organised by the Public Service Division (PSD) and the Civil Service College Singapore (CSC), Mr Chan said: “We must build diversity in our schools. In an uncertain world, diversity is key to our resilience as a country.\xa0\n“In a hyper-competitive world, diversity is also key to alleviating the unhealthy stress of pursuing the same definition of success. We will provide our students with a diversity of schools and education pathways, a diversity of skillsets and a diversity of perspectives and experiences.”\xa0\nIn a more complex world, there may also be a tendency to demand that schools teach even more, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“Against a more competitive landscape, there can also be demands to make our tests sharper to distinguish one student from another. However, we should be careful and not go overboard,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“Teaching and testing more do not equate to learning more. We will need to re-examine the way we teach and test. What ultimately matters is not how much our students know, but how fast they learn, and how able they are to adapt to an ever-changing environment.”\xa0\nSchools also need to develop a culture that encourages students to discover and develop their strengths beyond what is tested in school, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nSingapore has specialised schools that allow students to develop their interests and strengths\xa0in areas like sports, the arts, or maths and science.\xa0\n“We will continue to have a diversity of schools, each with their unique propositions, to cater to the diverse learning needs of our students. We should not homogenise all schools beyond a common core in areas such as literacy, numeracy and values,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThere are also students who prefer or “are more suited” to an applied education pathway, he added, noting that about seven\xa0in 10 students in a Primary 1 cohort go to polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education (ITE).\xa0\n“We must continue to ensure that their education and training provide a good foundation for them to remain competitive in the job market,” said Mr Chan, noting that Second Minister for Education Maliki Osman is leading a review on ITE and polytechnic pathways.\xa0\nIn school, children must also be equipped with diverse skillsets that ""open doors for them in the modern economy”, said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“In a world driven by new technologies and science, we will need to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics\xa0or STEM learning.\xa0\n“In our schools, we will strengthen our STEM curriculum to not only equip our students with the new STEM foundations to be smart users of technology, but also nurture a lifelong interest in STEM and its applications, so that more of them join the science and technology sector.”\xa0\nSchools will also nurture soft skills that ""endure"", including curiosity and confidence, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“We need to spark our students’ curiosity from a young age. For example, by exposing them to different cultures and ideas to broaden their horizons,” he added.\xa0\n“Our students must have the confidence to chart their own paths. This includes having confidence in themselves – assured of their ability to compete and thrive in a global world and be able to bounce back from failure or adversity.”\xa0\nStudents must also be equipped with “a sense of purpose for the wider community”, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“To understand that the opportunities that we have now are the result of the hard work of those who have come before us. That\xa0we too must pay-it-forward to the next generation.\n""Only then\xa0will we become closer as a society, knowing that everyone has a chance to move up, as everyone has a responsibility to help each other move up.”\nThe move away from an over-emphasis on academic grades to “truly embrace” diversity also depends on teachers and parents, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nTeachers are stretched on ""many fronts"", and the Government must find ways to give teachers more “white space” to engage in their own learning.\nThe Education Ministry should also explore giving them more exposure beyond school, he added.\xa0\nThis could include supporting them in taking sabbaticals or short stints in the private or public sectors to refresh their perspectives and renew their skillsets.\nStudents will also need diverse perspectives and experiences to “understand the dynamics and realities of the world”, he added.\xa0\n“Notwithstanding the disruption of travel due to COVID-19,\xa0we are finding ways to re-establish and strengthen our students’ exposure to the world. Having the opportunity to learn from and together with peers from around the world is a great advantage that our students have today and must not lose,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“If survival is a contest of evolution, then the best help that we can give them is the widest exposure possible to different experiences, challenges and circumstances.”\xa0\nStudents from disadvantaged and vulnerable backgrounds are of ""utmost importance” to the Education Ministry, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“The disruptive effects of technological developments and globalisation, accentuated by COVID-19, are often felt most acutely by them and their families. In such times, education must remain an uplifting force and beacon of hope for them all,” he added.\xa0\nSingapore must adopt a “life-cycle approach” to support these students across various stages of life beyond school “to make a real and sustained difference”.\xa0\n“We will strengthen child development support starting from the ante-natal stage to preschool years. We will also mobilise the public and community resources to provide greater support at the family level, as family problems can have outsized impact on a child’s attendance and engagement at school,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThe UPLIFT community pilot in four towns has seen an improvement in attendance for eight in 10 students involved, he said, adding that the programme will be further strengthened.\xa0\nAfter foundational schooling years, MOE will partner with institutes of higher learning and the community to help these students “maximise their educational potential” and support their transition to the workforce after they graduate.\xa0\n“We will be announcing what we plan to do more for our least privileged students and families in the coming months.”\xa0\nEducation must remain a “key enabler” to counter the social and economic divide that happens if “forces of inequality” are left unchecked, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“Our education policies and structures will need to be refreshed to meet the evolving demands of our times,"" said Mr Chan.\xa0\n""Beyond formal, foundational schooling in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions, the game-changer of global competition will be in lifelong education and early childhood education.""\xa0\nWith technological and business disruptions, Singaporeans must be able to keep learning through their careers, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“How fast we close the cycle from frontier industry knowledge to the classroom will be a key competitive advantage for Singapore,” he added.\xa0\nLearning must not stop when students graduate from school, and Singaporeans ""will never leave school"", said Mr Chan.\xa0\nAdding that Singapore’s continuing education and training (CET) must be responsive to changes in the economy and evolving industry trends, he stressed that learners must feel that training programmes “make a real difference” to their employment outcomes.\xa0\nThe Education Ministry will also continue extending its focus upstream to early childhood education, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nBy 2025, eight in 10 children will have a place in a Government-supported pre-school, he said.\xa0\nNoting that young parents are worried about the higher cost of pre-school education and care, the Education Minister said the ministry’s “long-term goal” is to make pre-school education as affordable as primary school education with after-school care.\xa0\nParents now pay between 40 to 90 per cent less than they did in 2019 for full-day childcare in anchor operator pre-schools, and lower-income parents pay as little as S$3 a month, he added.\xa0\n“We will continue to find ways to reduce the cost pressures of educating and caring for our youngest Singaporeans. We must continue to enhance preschool education and care by training our educators and investing in early childhood research,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\nMoving forward, Singapore faces several challenges, including geopolitical uncertainty, technological disruption and a population that has “increasingly diverse” aspirations.\xa0\nA large part of the geopolitical uncertainty is driven by domestic developments in the major powers, said Mr Chan, describing this as “not surprising”.\xa0\nThe global power balance is “shifting”, he said, adding that China’s rise and the US’ response will affect all countries.\xa0\nHow relations between the two countries will pan out “remains to be seen”, but amid the uncertainty, Singapore must remain a “principled and relevant” partner to both and to the rest of the world, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“Amidst an ageing population that desires stability and a more dynamic and vocal younger generation, our social fabric is evolving and being tugged in different directions,” he added.\xa0\n“We should not neglect such concerns, for they can strain our unity as a nation. In Singapore, we must address the concerns and aspirations of different groups and communities, while rising above differences for our common good.”\nTo counter these challenges, Singapore must ""double-down"" on strategic growth opportunities that would make us harder to displace from the global supply chain,\xa0said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“In an integrated and globalised economy, companies have options to invest in many more places. Countries are also competing aggressively for these investments.”\xa0\nAnother strategy is to build a global talent network, because businesses “always gravitate” to where this is most dense and connected.\xa0\n“Any country or city aspiring to be a global hub will have to move past the debate on foreign-local worker balance. It will have to instead focus on the critical task of building a global innovation and knowledge network,” said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“Singapore is no different. We need the best ideas and talent to compete on our side.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Chan Chun Sing ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Housewife Santi Choo’s two children briefly had Chinese tuition but by and large, she never believed in sending them for private tuition — not even when her older daughter sat for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) some years ago.\nCOVID-19, however, changed all that.\nDespite the pandemic causing her husband to lose his job as a project manager in the middle of last year, they decided to spend about S$700 a month from January to hire two home tutors for their younger son, who is taking the PSLE this year, after seeing his maths and science grades plummet last year.\nMrs Choo, 46, blamed her son’s poor performance partly on home-based learning (HBL), which was first introduced when Singapore entered a two-month circuit breaker in April last year amid a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases.\n“He thought of it as holidaying at home and took schooling too lightly,” she said.\nShe was further compelled to seek tuition for the 12-year-old boy after finding it increasingly hard to reach his school teachers.\n“Normally, within a day or the following day, the teachers will reply, but nowadays, the replies are a bit slow,” she added.\nWith her 16-year-old daughter also requesting to have maths tuition, the family’s expenditure on tuition goes up to S$1,500 a month.\nThis is by no means a small sum for Mrs Choo, who is working part-time at a food stall, while her husband does a mix of odd and contract jobs while searching for permanent work.\nDespite their initial lukewarm attitude towards tuition, they believe that it is necessary now as their children just need “some pushing” to excel.\nLikewise, even though their household income took a slight hit due to the pandemic, housewife Iris Sim, 40, and her husband spend just more than S$2,000 a month on tuition and enrichment classes for his three children — aged eight, nine and 11 — who attend “brand name” primary schools.\nMs Sim, who will soon return to the workforce after a five-year hiatus to help pay off the children’s tuition expenses, considers the fees a modest sum. The higher-end tuition centres can charge around S$2,000 per child, she pointed out.\n“If your child is in a good class in a good school, then most, if not all, of their classmates have tuition in each subject. That is why they got into that class in the first place. That is how they are going to keep up with the pace that the teacher goes in that class,” she added.\nEven as teachers are now required to seek approval to give tuition outside of school, following a review of guidelines by the Public Service Division, the pandemic has not only prompted some parents in Singapore such as Mrs Choo to reconsider their stance on tuition, it also seems to have made tuition as indispensable as ever.\nMeanwhile, some tuition centres had moved even faster than the schools in coming up with innovative platforms to adapt to the disruptions to school-based learning.\nFor instance, at SLC School of Language and Communication, the centre which specialises in English and Chinese tuition wasted no time in offering auxiliary “top-up classes” for students who might require additional support on specific areas such as oral or comprehension over teleconferencing app Zoom.\nAs a result, student enrolment over the past 18 months had grown by 50 per cent, with principal Ben Lee attributing it to the implementation of HBL — particularly in the initial stages when schools and teachers were still new to it.\nBetween March last year and now, some 15 per cent more students had enrolled with Making Sense, a chemistry and science tuition centre, as it fills the need to “support and hand-hold” pupils who have found it difficult adjusting to online or self-directed learning, said its managing director William Lin.\nDr Gavin Ng, director of Gavin’s Tuition, said enrolment at his centre, which mostly operates over online platforms now following the closure of two of his five outlets, went up from around 450 students to 600.\n“There is no point spending on rent now. The definition of space has changed,” said Dr Ng, whose reimagination of online tuition involved working with a logistics firm to bring science experiments to homes and making use of machine learning to track his students’ weaknesses.\nThe neverending debate over the pros and cons of private tuition has resurfaced following China’s drastic move recently to ban tutoring for profit in core school subjects, as well as foreign investment in the sector, in an attempt to make raising children and education more affordable for parents.\nThe high cost of raising a child in China has contributed to its low birth rates.\nThe harsh curbs — which threaten to decimate China’s US$100 billion (S$136 billion) private tutoring and online education sector — have led some parents and educators here to question whether Singapore, too, should do more to rein in its own “shadow education industry”. The sector here was worth S$1.4 billion, according to the last Household Expenditure Survey in 2017 and 2018.\nBack in 2018, then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung had said the Government had no intention of banning tuition even as he announced a slew of major changes to reduce emphasis on academic grades, such as scrapping mid-year examinations at some levels in both primary and secondary schools.\nA ban on tuition would be akin to just treating the symptoms of a rigorous education system, Mr Ong said.\n“We can come up with many initiatives to tackle the symptoms… But we hope this (cut in assessments) is a meaningful step to really go a lot deeper for us to soul-search as parents and students and educators (on) what really is a more optimum way of teaching our children, for the joy of learning, to cultivate and nurture curiosity,” he said.\nIn 2019, Mr Ong reiterated in Parliament that the Government needs the support of parents to shift the culture from turning to tuition as the default option to one where children have the self-confidence and support from their families, schools and peers to manage their learning.\nMeanwhile, the tuition industry itself has evolved to keep abreast of the education landscape’s changing needs and demands, education experts and industry players said.\xa0\nThey added that the sector is now dominated by tutoring chains with deep pockets, which are well-equipped to follow the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) mandate to help students “discover the joy of learning” and give their own spin to it.\nTake the example of The Learning Lab, which American private equity firm Advent International reportedly bought a significant stake in for around S$300 million in 2014.\nThe centre was known for its emphasis on getting students into MOE’s Gifted Education Programme (GEP), meant for the intellectually-gifted, and Integrated Programmes (IP), a six-year programme targeted at the top 10 per cent of PSLE students.\nIn the past five years, the 20-year-old centre has put in place a teaching and learning framework that emphasises “a holistic approach to education, balancing knowledge, skills, and dispositions”, said The Learning Lab’s director of curriculum, Dr Lubna Alsagoff, a former National Institute of Education (NIE) associate professor.\n“We use insights from research into learning, pedagogy, and technology to ensure that we do the very best for our students in creating a curriculum that focuses on learning and growth rather than only on performance,” added Dr Alsagoff, who joined the centre in 2017.\nAdding that the focus is “academic enrichment”, she said students are taught how to analyse tasks and questions, think about complex problems more deeply and in a systematic way, and learn how to connect what they have learnt with real world situations.\nBut such tuition courses don’t come cheap.\nToday, the monthly regular fees for one subject at The Learning Lab start from S$410 for Primary 1 to 4\xa0students, and S$432 for those in Primary 5 or 6\xa0— up from S$390 and S$400 respectively in 2018. Group tuition typically costs S$30 per hour at the primary level.\nReferring to perennial calls to regulate the tuition industry in Singapore, the centre’s chief executive officer Hamilton Lau said: “If framed well, a common set of rules helps to assert standards of quality and drives out less-principled providers and those who are not up to the task.\n“Perhaps what would be eventually shut down are those centres that are not supportive of the more progressive ethos of the MOE – those that perhaps stick to the outdated methods of teaching through repetitive drill and practice, mechanical memorisation, and regurgitation of information.”\nBased on MOE’s website, there are more than 800 registered tuition and enrichment centres, up from about 600 five years ago.\nAs Singapore’s lucrative tuition pie continues to grow, a chunk of it is taken up by an increasing number of centres set up by the former teachers from top schools.\nThe Physics Cafe, for example, was started in 2010 by former Raffles Junior College physics teacher Dave Sim. It boasts a yearly cohort of 1,000 and has its own lecture theatre, in-house cafe, exclusive study rooms, and even shuttle buses to ferry students to MRT interchanges.\nThen, there is Future Academy, which was co-founded seven years ago by Ms Yvonne Chen, a former Raffles Girls’ School and Nan Hua High School teacher, and Mr Lau Hock Soon, a former head of department for maths at Hwa Chong Institution.\nThe centre, which has about 50 tutors, currently serves 500 to 600 students ranging from the Kindergarten Two to Junior College Two levels, and will soon be opening its third centre. Its class sizes do not exceed 10 students.\nMs Chen said 20 to 30 per cent of the parents who turned to the centre enrolled for its S$3,000-a-year programme that prepares children from as young as Primary One for Direct School Admission (DSA) through the science, mathematics and engineering route.\xa0\nThe programme teaches school topics in advance and students are also prepared to perform in national or international academic competitions.\nWhile many of the “elite” primary schools have a structured coaching programme to prepare children for this, neighbourhood primary schools do not and parents may source for such courses offered by tuition centres, Ms Chen added.\nFifty per cent of the centre’s students come for its IP courses, which cost S$4,000 to S$5,000 a year.\nShe shared that about one in five of these students are high-achieving O-Level takers who prefer to take the IP classes so that they can be exposed to questions that require higher order thinking and goes more in-depth into various topics.\n“To me, as a teacher, I think they can survive very well without tuition. But a student told me: ‘I come for tuition, so I can understand the concept very fast. If I explore myself, it might take me a whole day, but if I come for two hours of tuition, I would have learnt everything already,” she said.\nBut as parents become spoilt for choice with a smorgasbord of programmes in the tuition scene — with one “guaranteeing ‘A’s” in a S$2,888 two-month package, for instance — Mr Clarence Tan, founder of English tuition centre The Learning Board, warns against parents making use of tuition centres to “pump grades” at the very last minute.\nOnce, a mother came to Mr Tan’s tuition centre in 2018 offering to pay S$4,000 to block off his schedule for a month for one-on-one sessions with her daughter who was about to take the PSLE.\nWhile the offer was enticing, he did not take it up. Tutors who claim that they can produce the desired results under such circumstances may not be totally honest since it is unrealistic, he said.\nApart from discussing whether private tuition is a boon or bane for students and their parents, the debate also involves a broader discourse on issues such as inequality, privilege, meritocracy and competition.\nThe problem is that the industry has become overly segmented with unequal access, said Mr Victor Pok, who runs KidsExcel, a social enterprise for the underprivileged, and Pal Learning, a commercially-run tuition centre for the middle-income segment.\nFor tuition to play a complementary role in the Singapore education system, costs have to be regulated, so that opportunities can be equalised and market failure managed, said the former physical education and English school teacher.\n“Classes for GEP preparation and DSA have gotten out of control and it is impossible to stop as long as parents can afford it,” he said.\nMr Pok said the tipping point came in the 2000s after more independent schools emerged, which opened up a separate track for entry into the top secondary schools.\nHe said: “It is a very primordial kind of system that affects society as a whole. You have the upper class congregating in elite schools and centres that cater to that social class. Others were excluded simply by price.”\nMr Pok defined premium centres as those that charge between S$250 and above per subject a month. Heartland centres charge around S$180 to S$200 per subject. Then, there are still cheaper ones that try to make a profit through bigger classes.\nOnline lessons at his for-profit centre cost S$99 a month, and group sizes are capped at five.\nMr Pok also noted that some premium centres practise a discreet policy of rejecting weak students by putting them on a waitlist after making them take certain tests. This is so that they can maintain the centres’ stellar record.\nThe myriad of offerings by tuition centres to help students in just about any area where demand for it exists — so long as they can afford it — has also created excessive reliance on tuition, along with its implications.\nMr Ong touched on this when he addressed the tuition issue in Parliament in 2019, in response to queries from Members of Parliament following the release of the Household Expenditure Survey that year.\xa0\nStating that tuition “may not be necessary and can even be detrimental” if a child is generally coping well academically and understands the fundamentals, Mr Ong said: “Excessive reliance on tuition can diminish the ability for independent learning, deprive students of opportunities to develop self-management skills and promote unhealthy competition.”\nOne of the first steps towards reducing the reliance on tuition is to address society’s excessive focus on academic grades, Mr Ong noted in his parliamentary response.\nHe then highlighted that MOE had introduced several policy changes under its “Learn for Life” movement in a bid to strike a balance. They included expanding the number of DSA places in schools, reducing school-based assessments, changes to the PSLE scoring system this year, and the rollout of full subject-based banding in all secondary schools by 2024.\nFormer MOE curriculum planner Liu Yueh Mei said these are steps in the right direction as the removal of exams open up time and space for broader learning in school, while changes to PSLE scores aim to give parents the transparency that they have been asking for.\nMeanwhile, full subject-based banding recognises that each student has his or her strengths and weaknesses, and it may not be necessary for students to take all the subjects at the same level, said Ms Liu, who is the chief executive officer of online teaching and learning space HeyHi and iMath, a Math tutoring app.\nDespite such changes to the educational system, the demand for private tuition here doesn’t seem to be waning. Why?\n“It is in our DNA. Not just Singapore, but Asians in Australia, the US, UK, Canada are also anxious. They are the ones who will still send their children to enrichment classes,” Ms Liu said.\nIn response to queries, an MOE spokesperson said that the reforms are part of its efforts to raise the school education system to a new level “over the next five to 10 years”.\n“These efforts will take time to bear fruit, even as changing mindsets take time,” the spokesperson added.\nNevertheless, she pointed out that MOE has already seen encouraging signs, such as younger cohorts of students adapting well to the removal of school-based assessments and enjoying their learning in different areas of interest.\n“We are confident that together with parents and the wider society, we can give our children greater confidence and joy in learning, and best prepare them not only for examinations but for life ahead,” she said.\nTwo teachers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they were not supposed to speak to the media, continued to highlight the problem of teachers being overburdened with duties other than teaching, such as in event planning.\nFor example, as COVID-19 had put a stop to mass assemblies, teachers would have to leverage on their own skills or learn from scratch how to pre-record or stream performances and show them over Zoom on occasions like Racial Harmony Day or Chinese New Year.\nSaid a 31-year-old Chinese teacher at a Secondary School: “These are not skills that a layman would have … We need more help here, and these shouldn’t rest on our shoulders. We are not supposed to be professional entertainers.”\nShe added that the workload would never be even under such circumstances as the teachers who are more skilled would always be tapped. “When is this going to end?” she said.\nIn its reply, the MOE spokesperson said that teachers are “appraised holistically and recognised for their contributions in all areas of work, including their work in supporting students’ all-round development”.\nIn terms of administrative responsibilities, much effort has been made to reduce teachers’ involvement through leveraging technology, such as the Parents Gateway platform, and reviewing the provision of manpower support, she said.\n“Schools have also been reminded to regularly review their organisation and management systems to ensure teachers’ workload is well managed,” she added.\nWhile the reliance on private tuition of parents in Singapore is not that different from their counterparts in China, many here — especially the younger parents — do not see a need to develop\xa0\xa0“jiwa”, or “baby chicks”, a term popularised in China referring to children whose schedules are filled with extracurricular classes, thanks to anxious parents.\nHousewife Grace Loh, 36, who has two children aged two and seven, said she would only turn to tuition if their self-esteem is affected.\nFor pharmacist Joen Wong, 36, whose girls are three and six years old, her approach is to not overload her children’s schedules too much as the programme in their preschool is already quite well-rounded. She said she would opt for no tuition as far as possible, and would also steer clear of academic-related enrichment programmes, unless she senses the child's interest in them.\nFollowing the new curbs in China, all centres that offer tutoring on the school curriculum will be registered as non-profit organisations, and they are not allowed to raise money through capital-related activities.\nExisting online tutoring firms will be subject to extra scrutiny and after-school tutoring is prohibited during weekends, public holidays and school vacations.\nCan Singapore implement similar measures to reduce parents’ reliance on tuition? Doing so would be counterproductive, several experts and industry players told TODAY.\nDr Kelvin Seah Kah Cheng, a lecturer at the National University of Singapore’s economics department whose research focuses on the economics of education, said he does not think that cracking down on tuition this way will necessarily eliminate it.\n“It is likely that tuition will continue to exist, with the only difference being that much of these activities will now be pushed underground and perhaps will exist on a somewhat smaller scale than before,” he said.\nHe added that paradoxically, the move might even increase educational inequality between the rich and poor, since the poor would find it more difficult to afford private tuition. The reduced supply of tuition, coupled with a high demand for it, would just mean that the price of tuition will increase.\nSingapore can take a leaf out of South Korea’s experience, he said. South Korea banned tuition in 1980 but the ban was lifted two decades later. Currently, it employs a more sophisticated approach — ordering schools to hold after-school classes and offer free online lessons, as well as imposing a 10pm curfew on tuition centre’s operating hours.\xa0\nMr Timothy Joshua Chia-Lee, director of curriculum and student services at The Thought Tailor, an English and General Paper centre, argued that a ban would in fact be detrimental to students. “One fundamental trait of our meritocracy is that our students must and should continue to find that if they wish to work harder and to push themselves more, they should be able to do so outside of school,” he said.\nNIE associate professor Jason Tan Eng Thye noted that even though the tuition industry is such a big part of Singapore’s education landscape, its status as a major stakeholder is not openly acknowledged.\nHe believes that MOE should resolve this uneasy and ambivalent relationship, and stop being under the illusion that mainstream schools are the sole source of information for many students and parents. He noted how some students are not paying attention in class because they have been taught the topics in their tuition classes ahead of time.\nIn a sign that the ministry is paying closer attention to the issue, teachers have been barred from giving private tuition without approval. Previously, they could give up to six hours of private tuition a week.\xa0\nThe MOE spokesperson said that with effect from Jan 1, teachers are required to seek approval for paid part-time lecturing or teaching, which includes paid tuition.\nThis came about as the guideline on participating in part-time lecturing or teaching, including paid tuition, not exceeding six hours a week has been removed following a review by the Public Service Division.\n“The Public Service has existing guidelines on public officers participating in outside activities to ensure that their outside activities do not distract them from their core duties,” she added.\nMr Shawn Cheong, lead coordinator at Schtutors, a home tuition agency matching only MOE-accredited teachers, said that sometime late last year,\xa0\xa0he received a slew of requests from listed tutors requesting to be deregistered from the platform.\nMr Cheong said that currently, only 20 to 25 per cent of the over 5,500 teachers listed on Schtutors’ platform are current MOE teachers, down from about 60 per cent in 2013, when more than 3,000 teachers were listed.\nAt the end of the day, the amount of tuition that a child needs — or doesn’t — may well boil down to his or her parents’ mindset.\nAs a father of two boys aged one and three, business owner Jeremy Ko, 33, confessed that he is already feeling the pressure of having to balance his belief in giving his children a childhood of self-discovery with his resolve to ensure that his child does not fall too far behind.\n“My kid’s teachers in childcare say his Chinese and English are both very good, but I also compare him to my business partner’s kid who is a few months younger but can do addition and read more words than mine,” he said.\nFor more news like this, visit\xa0todayonline.com.\nBut after giving it some thought, Mr Ko has decided that he will not be sending his child for preparatory classes designed to equip preschool children with academic skills before they enter Primary One.\n“The values that you are teaching the kid (by sending him for tuition or enrichment) is that money can be used to solve problems and that parents cannot help too much in their studies,” he said.\nMr Ko can’t say for sure if he would send his child for tuition, though. “I cannot imagine if my kid starts doing badly in school,” he said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Tuition ', '     education ']}"

      Home-based learning for entire level no longer default approach when COVID-19 cases discovered in schools
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) will “fine tune” its response to COVID-19 cases in schools to “minimise the disruptions” while keeping students safe, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Friday (Aug 13).\xa0\nSince early August, the ministry has moved towards a “more targeted approach” that affects a more narrowly defined group of students whenever there is a positive COVID-19 case in school, he wrote in a Facebook post.\xa0\n“This means that where possible, we will place close contacts and students from the same classes or CCA groups under LOA (leave of absence) or QO (quarantine order), instead of putting the entire level on HBL. The disruptions are further minimised this way,” Mr Chan said.\xa0\nHe added that moving forward, the ministry is exploring options for\xa0less-invasive testing methods to further minimise disruptions to children and families.\nThe ministry has implemented full home-based learning twice so far, he said in his post.\xa0\n“However, Full HBL has its limitations and is disruptive to students, parents and teachers. It is not a sustainable option and must be our last resort,” he wrote.\xa0\nBetween May and July this year, MOE took a “more targeted approach” by placing entire levels on home-based learning when there were confirmed cases in schools.\xa0\nIn that time, 216 students of the 600,00-strong student population were infected with COVID-19, most of them from household transmission, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nOf the 216 students, 103 were from primary schools,\xa0he added.\xa0\n“But even with the HBL limited to specific levels, the disruption to student learning and family schedules is still quite significant,” Mr Chan wrote.\xa0\nOver the past three months, 100 levels across 50 schools were placed on home-based learning at different times and for varying periods, affecting more than 20,000 students, he said.\xa0\nNone of these students tested positive for COVID-19 as all close contacts had already been placed on leave of absence or quarantine orders, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n“With more evidence pointing to the efficacy of our previous measures and as we transit towards living with COVID-19 as an endemic situation, we will fine tune measures further to minimise the disruptions while keeping our children safe,” he wrote in his post.\xa0\nWhere possible, schools will no longer place entire levels on home-based learning as a default when there is a positive COVID-19 case, said MOE in a separate press release on Friday.\xa0\nInstead, it will focus on placing close contacts and students from the same classes or CCA groups on leave of absence or quarantine orders, the press release read.\xa0\n“This approach will allow the rest of the students and teachers in the level and school to continue with classes in school and minimise disruption, while safeguarding their health and safety,” said the Education Ministry in the press release.\xa0\n“Placing more classes or levels on HBL remains an option should there be a risk of transmission beyond close contacts. Our schools will also continue to monitor the health of students and staff more closely as an additional precaution.”\nTesting would allow the Education Ministry to be “much more targeted” in deciding who should stay away from school and for how long, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nWith more regular and faster testing using self-administered Antigen Rapid Tests (ART), students and staff who are tested negative can return to school earlier.\xa0\n“As new scientific evidence emerges and we accumulate more experience, we will further calibrate the suite of measures and apply them based on the circumstances, to keep our schools and children safe. Where necessary, we will tighten the measures, balancing the considerations for risk management with the impact of the disruptions,” he wrote.\xa0\nAll unvaccinated teachers and staff who have regular contact with students aged 12 and below will be tested for COVID-19 twice a week as part of the new “vaccinate or regular test” regime from Oct 1.\xa0\nThis will apply to staff who are not fully vaccinated, unvaccinated or medically ineligible to take the COVID-19 vaccines, said MOE.\xa0\nThe new regime will apply to all of its staff since they are public sector employees, said the ministry.\xa0\nMOE will also extend the coverage of the regime to all staff who are not government employees but have regular contact with students aged 12 and below, the press release read.\xa0\nThis includes settings outside of school, like tuition and enrichment centres, student care centres, as well as school bus drivers and attendants, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nThe vaccinate or regular test regime was announced by co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong on Aug 6.\xa0\nThe regime will apply to individuals in industries that interact with customers in high-risk mask-off settings, such as at Singapore’s borders or COVID-19 frontline work\xa0will also be subject to this regime. Other sectors include food and\xa0beverage establishments, gyms and fitness studios, and personal care services.\n""This will help to protect them, their colleagues and the people they serve in the course of their work,"" said co-chair of the task force Lawrence Wong.\nThe Government will subsidise these\xa0COVID-19 tests for those who remain medically ineligible for vaccines.\nAs part of the national fast and easy testing regime, a smaller group of staff will also have to be tested regularly even if they are fully vaccinated because they are involved in higher-risk activities, said MOE in the press release.\xa0\nThis includes contract cleaners and school canteen operators, as well as PE teachers who conduct mask-off activities in school.\xa0\nFrom Sep 3, cleaners at tuition and enrichment centres that cater to students aged 12 and below will also be included in this group, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nTuition and enrichment centres can register for fast and easy testing at https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet.\n“In schools, teachers and staff will continue to be vigilant due to the infectious nature of the current variant and send students who display even mild symptoms home,” Mr Chan wrote.\xa0\n“Even so, this will not mean zero cases in schools, as long as there continues to be cases in our community. But we will do our best and remain watchful so that students can keep learning in school.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      One staff member dismissed, two students expelled after 11 sexual misconduct complaints made in first half of 2021: NUS
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: One staff member was dismissed and two students were expelled from the National University of Singapore (NUS) for sexual misconduct in the first half of this year, the university said on Thursday (Aug 5).\nIn its second report on sexual misconduct released on Thursday, NUS said it received 11 complaints between January and June this year. Ten of the\xa0sexual misconduct complaints were made against students and one involved a staff member, said NUS.\nDuring the same period last year, the university received five sexual misconduct complaints involving students and four against staff members.\n""While we note the drop in the number of sexual misconduct incidents involving staff ... We are seeing more individuals come forward to file reports against alleged student perpetrators,"" the report read.\xa0\n""We believe this demonstrates that our approach of greater transparency has increased the level of trust in NUS, that each complaint is taken seriously, investigated thoroughly following due process, and appropriate disciplinary sanctions are imposed for every infringement that is proven.""\nTwo students reported that they were\xa0sexually harassed by a research staff member in school, said NUS in the report.\xa0\nThe staff member allegedly made inappropriate sexual remarks at\xa0work and sent inappropriate videos to the students. One of the students also reported that the staff member had made inappropriate physical contact without consent.\xa0\nThe report was made on Mar 25 and investigations concluded on Apr 7. A no-contact order was issued to the staff member, who admitted to touching the student’s knees and making inappropriate remarks, said the university.\xa0\nAdding that the staff member had breached the Code of Conduct by behaving “unprofessionally and inappropriately”, NUS said a committee of inquiry was formed and the staff member\'s\xa0employment was\xa0terminated.\xa0\nTwo students had their candidatures terminated by the university\'s board of discipline.\nIn the first case, the complainant reported on Feb 10 that a\xa0student had ""non-consensual sexual intercourse"" with the complainant while\xa0they were in a hostel, said NUS in the report.\xa0\nIn the second case, another complainant reported\xa0on Mar 26 that a student touched the complainant inappropriately without consent while they were\xa0in a hostel. The student was also accused of filming another complainant naked without their consent in a hostel, the report read.\xa0\nIn both cases, no-contact orders were issued to the students before their candidatures were terminated.\xa0Both students are appealing the decisions.\xa0\nNUS on Thursday also consolidated its policies relating to sexual misconduct into one standalone policy on Protection of Staff and Students against Sexual Misconduct, said the university in the report.\xa0\nThe policy clarifies what NUS considers to be sexual misconduct and provides procedures for reporting and handling an incident. According to the policy, sexual misconduct includes, but is not limited to: Sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and sexual contact.\nThe policy provides an ""integrated approach"" for managing sexual misconduct in NUS, and provides a system for reporting, investigation and decision-making, the report read.\xa0\n""We continue to strive to offer a safe and conducive platform for affected parties to step forward and share their experiences in confidence.""\nThe sexual misconduct report,\xa0released every six months, is part of efforts by NUS to raise awareness of the issue after a spate of cases involving both staff and students.\nNUS first stepped up its response to sexual misconduct after undergraduate Monica Baey spoke out online about how the institution responded when she was filmed in a hostel shower by a fellow student in 2019.\xa0\nNUS subsequently set up a Victim Care Unit\xa0 in August 2019 for students who are victims of sexual misconduct.\xa0\nIn its first sexual misconduct\xa0report published in January this year, NUS said that\xa071 sexual misconduct complaints involving students were made to the university between 2016 and 2020. The university also received 19 complaints of sexual misconduct involving staff members between 2016 and 2020, the report said.\xa0\nNUS saw several allegations of sexual misconduct and inappropriate behaviour against staff members in 2020.\xa0\nLecturer and fellow at\xa0Tembusu College Dr Jeremy Fernando was sacked\xa0on Oct 7 that year, following an internal investigation of two complaints alleging that he had “behaved inappropriately as a teaching staff”. The university\'s investigations established that he had ""an intimate association"" with an undergraduate.\nOn Nov 17, 2020,\xa0NUS announced that it had completed its review of a complaint made against former East Asian Institute (EAI) director Professor Zheng Yongnian and found that he had behaved inappropriately towards a colleague in May 2018.\nThe university said that ""in the absence of evidence"", the inquiry was unable to verify all the allegations except that Prof Zheng had hugged the member of staff without her permission during a meeting.\nAs such, the ""appropriate sanction"" was a written warning.\nOn Dec 1, 2020,\xa0NUS\xa0dismissed Professor Theodore G Hopf - or Ted Hopf - over a case of sexual harassment against a student following an anonymous complaint sent to the university in August.\n\xa0\nA new component for bystander intervention will also be integrated into the current Respect and Consent module for all students, the university said in its report on Thursday.\xa0\n""This aims to help students understand the roles and social responsibilities of bystanders, thereby fostering a safer campus environment for all,"" the report read.\xa0\nNUS has progressively rolled out its new bystander training programme to all full-time staff since Apr 2021.\xa0\nFeedback has been ""positive"", and as of Jun 30, the training for all full-time staff has been completed, while training for all incoming full-time staff will continue, the report said.\xa0\n""This will greatly contribute towards raising awareness and building a culture of respect and consent on campus.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     NUS ', '     education ', '     crime ']}"

      Later school start times ‘make sense’ for adolescents, who have natural tendency to fall asleep later: Experts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Later school start times for adolescents could result in more sleep time\xa0and in turn better school performance, said experts.\xa0\n\xa0\nAt the onset of puberty, adolescents may develop a two-hour phase delay in their circadian rhythm, or their ""body clock"", and that leads to a natural tendency to fall asleep at later times, said Associate Professor Teoh Oon Hoe, deputy head of the department of paediatrics at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.\n\xa0\nA later school start time after 8am or 8.30am for secondary school students would accommodate their adolescent circadian rhythm better, he added.\xa0\n\xa0\nMany children in Asia sleep less than the recommended duration for their age, so a later school start time can help to increase their sleep hours, noted Assoc Prof Teoh.\xa0\n\xa0\nThis comes as the issue of later school start times was discussed in Parliament on Tuesday (Aug 3). The Ministry of Education announced that it has commissioned two research studies on the impact of factors affecting sleep duration and sleep quality of students in Singapore.\xa0\n\xa0\nSchools currently start no earlier than 7.30am, said Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling.\xa0\nAdolescents aged 13 to 19 have a “natural tendency” to be active until late at night and wake up late in the morning, compared to younger children and adults, said Dr Michael Lim, senior consultant of the division of pulmonary medicine and sleep at the paediatrics department at the National University Hospital\'s (NUH)\xa0Khoo Teck Puat -\xa0National University Children Medical Institute.\nThis is due to developmental changes in their sleep regulation, Dr Lim added.\xa0\n\xa0\n“Behavioural and social factors, such as the nighttime use of electronic devices and social obligations, contribute to delayed sleep onset, and it is common for adolescents to have considerably less sleep than the eight\xa0to 10 hours the National Sleep Foundation recommends,” he told CNA.\xa0\n\xa0\nThus, it would “make sense” for school start times to be delayed to ensure students get enough sleep, said Dr Lim.\xa0\n\xa0\nWhile some might argue that students will just sleep later if school starts later, data from several studies have shown “real gains” in sleep duration for students when later school start times for\xa0were implemented - particularly for adolescents, he added.\xa0\n\xa0\nFor example, with school start times delayed by 20 to 85 minutes, studies have reported an increase in sleep duration of 18 to 99 minutes, he noted.\xa0\n\xa0\nCiting a study conducted during the “circuit breaker” period last year, Dr Lim said that with children waking up 55 minutes later on average due to enforced home-based learning, those in primary school gained an extra 30 minutes of sleep, while students in secondary school level slept 56 minutes longer compared to pre-pandemic times.\xa0\n\xa0\nOther\xa0physiological changes related to puberty, academic and social demands of adolescents may also affect their sleep, pushing back their bedtime, said Assoc Prof Teoh.\xa0\n\xa0\n“Adolescents who have adequate night sleep do not usually need afternoon naps. The tendency to take short naps when given the opportunity or fall into periods of ‘micro-sleep’ may be a sign that they have inadequate nocturnal sleep and are making up for chronic sleep deprivation,” said staff physician Dr Cheng Zai Ru, from KKH’s Respiratory Medicine Service.\xa0\n\xa0\nChildren manifest signs of sleep deprivation differently from adults, she added.\xa0\n\xa0\nFor example, in the short term, children who lack sleep may not appear sleepy, but exhibit problems with impulse control, hyperactivity, and difficulties controlling their emotions like aggression, tantrums and signs of anxiety or depression, said Dr Cheng.\xa0\n\xa0\nIn the long-term, children’s academic performance may decline, with higher frequencies of falling sick from acute illnesses, she added. Growth may “falter”, as growth hormone secretion happens at night while they are asleep.\xa0\nIn January 2021, the first Singapore Integrated 24-hour Activity Guidelines for Children and Adolescents\xa0was launched.\nHere are its recommended sleep durations:\n""Regularity is as important as duration. There needs to be consistent, early bedtime for both weekdays and weekends,""\xa0said\xa0Associate Professor Teoh Oon Hoe, deputy head of the department of paediatrics at\xa0KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.\xa0\n""One must not be sleep deprived on school days, only to make up for sleep debt over the weekends.""\xa0\nLater school start times have been associated with better sustained attention, school attendance\xa0and improved academic performance, said Dr Lim of NUH.\xa0\n“This is not surprising when one appreciates the function of the brain as a memory aid. It is important to get enough sleep the night before and the night after learning. Sleep restores the brain’s capacity for learning and makes rooms for new memories,” he added.\xa0\n“There is enough evidence showing that schoolchildren who sleep longer obtained better grades across the board, and the impact of later school start times would impact greatest on adolescents, as this allows for longer sleep duration on school days with a timetable that is in sync with their physiologically delayed circadian rhythm.”\xa0\nWhen students are well-rested and refreshed, they can pay attention, learn better and have better mental and physical health, said Assoc Prof Teoh.\xa0\n“Longer sleep time can help reduce daytime sleepiness, improve socio-emotional functioning and academic performance, and reduce risks of accidents,” he added.\xa0\nBut later start times also lead to logistical issues.\nMember of Parliament Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) said in Parliament on Tuesday that in previous discussions on school start times, the possibility of traffic congestion was a concern if school buses were taking students to school at the same time as office workers heading to work.\xa0\n“Will the Government also consider that with the trend towards working from home, flexible work and so on, which may persist beyond the COVID pandemic, that is an issue that actually may be much less of a concern,” he added.\xa0\nIf all schools implemented later start times, this could affect parents’ work schedule and contribute to morning traffic and public transport congestion, echoed Assoc Prof Teoh.\xa0\n“Adjustments will also be needed to stagger work hours of some parents, for food catering arrangements and other enrichment activities to cater for different start and end times at school,” he added.\xa0\nThere may also be concerns about pushing extracurricular activities to later in the day, completing homework assignments later in the day, therefore resulting in later bedtimes, said Dr Lim, noting data has shown that later start times lead to longer sleep duration despite this concern.\xa0\nHowever, later start times do not mean parents and children do not need to cultivate and maintain good sleep hygiene habits, experts told CNA.\xa0\nIf bedtime is moved later because of the later start time, this will reduce\xa0the impact of the change, said Assoc Prof Teoh.\xa0\n“The reality is that some students sleep late because of academic demands, and some due to parental work schedules which impact the family’s daily routine,” he added.\xa0\nChildren should have regular sleeping hours, said Dr Kenny Pang, a ear, nose and throat specialist at Asia Sleep Centre.\xa0\nPrimary school children should be in bed by 9pm to 9.30pm, and secondary school children should be in bed by 10pm to 10.30pm. Most of them wake up at around 6am to 6.15am to prepare for school, have breakfast and travel to school as most schools start at 7.30am, he noted.\xa0\n“Hence, it would be intuitive to start school at 8am, so that the kids may wake up slightly later too, this would mean more sleep for them.”\nThe use of digital devices can also disrupt sleep, experts stressed. At night, the pineal gland in the brain releases vast quantities of melatonin, a hormone that signals to our bodies that it is time for bed, said Dr Lim.\xa0\nArtificial light, including blue light from phones and laptops, can fool the brain into thinking that the sun has not yet set. In turn, melatonin is suppressed, and this makes it less likely to fall asleep at a reasonable time, he added.\xa0\n“Apart from delaying the timing of melatonin release and taking longer to sleep, there is poorer quality of sleep when one does get to sleep.”\xa0\nTo avoid this situation, parents should establish “strict ground rules” around bedtime, and keep the timing consistent every day, including on weekends, said Dr Lim.\xa0\nParents can also establish a regular, calming and relaxing bedtime routine 30 to 60 minutes before bed.\xa0\n“Keep all electronic devices outside the bedroom during this time. For children especially, do not allow excessive use of electronic devices in the daytime as well,” he added.\xa0\n\xa0\n“The short-term effects of sleep deprivation can be reversed once the child starts getting adequate good quality sleep as a matter of routine. It can take weeks to clear an accumulated sleep debt and for these symptoms to reverse,” said Dr Lim.\xa0\n“The long-term health consequences ... will often be from chronic sleep deprivation, once they are established, the window for improving these health effects is gone.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     health ', '     school ']}"

Those who are not vaccinated or who have only received one dose of the vaccine will have to test themselves once a week.\xa0\nStudents and staff who do not reside on campus must test themselves before their first visit to the campus, effective Aug 10. Thereafter, those who are fully vaccinated will need to take a COVID-19 self-swab test at every 20th visit to campus, while those who are not vaccinated will have to do so at every fifth visit.\xa0\nStudents and staff must make sure they are connected to the NUS Wi-Fi on their mobile device when they are on campus, said Dr Peck in the circular.\xa0\nFor those who do not live on campus, the uNivUS app will help them keep track of their visits to campus as long as they are connected to the NUS Wi-Fi. The app will prompt them when they are due for a self-swab test, the circular read.\xa0\nIn response to CNA queries, NUS said that students and staff will need to upload their swab test results on the uNivUS app. Currently, students can log their temperature through the app as well.\xa0\nStudents and staff who serve in the medical sectors and are already subject to rostered routine testing may be exempted from the Fast and Easy Test pilot, Dr Peck wrote. They can submit an exemption through their respective Faculty Dean’s offices. They may also opt to participate in the pilot, if they wish to do so.\xa0\nAll staff and students should also update their COVID-19 vaccination status on uNivUS by Aug 9, a day before the pilot programme begins.\xa0\n“This will enable the university to plan for a safer return to campus for our community, while adhering to prevailing safe management measures,” said Dr Peck.\xa0\n“Vaccination is a key enabler to protect ourselves and our loved ones against COVID-19, minimise transmission in the community, allow more social activities to resume and enable Singapore to re-open further.

      Commentary: Chinese youth want to 'lie flat'. Authorities are taking them seriously
  </h1>, 'text': 'HONG KONG: China’s social contract is fraying, and a song deleted from the country’s Internet captures the problem vividly.\n“Lying flat is good, lying flat is wonderful, lying flat is right, lie down so you don’t fall,” Zhang Xinmin sings in Chinese as he lies on a sofa strumming a guitar.\n“Lying flat”, a trend among young Chinese to opt out of stressful jobs, represents the antithesis of a development model that has delivered extraordinary growth over four decades by enlisting the maximum effort from its people.\nBeijing is more than a little perturbed. “In this turbulent era, there is no such thing as lying flat and waiting for prosperity,” said Wu Qian, an official spokesman, this week. “There is only the splendour of struggle and endeavour. Young people, come on!”\n\n\nSuch concerns lie behind several initiatives to galvanise people and encourage families to have more children. Crucial among these moves was the decision last week to clamp down on after-school tutoring, a US$100 billion business that heaps stress upon school children while taxing the finances of their parents.\nNew rules issued by the State Council, or cabinet, ban for-profit tutoring in core school subjects. The news hit like a thunderbolt, driving down the share prices of US-listed industry leaders TAL Education, New Oriental and Gaotu Techedu.\nThe antipathy of Xi Jinping, China’s leader, toward after-school tutoring had been telegraphed. In March, he criticised a “mess” in the sector and called it a “chronic disease that is very difficult to cure”.\n\n\nCITY LIFE BECOMING A HAMSTER WHEEL\nBut the fact that Beijing has been willing to administer what could be a mortal blow to an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of staff reveals how seriously it takes the problem.\nFor tens of millions of middle-class people in China’s large cities, life has become a hamster wheel of increasing effort and diminishing reward. A welter of costs for housing, education, healthcare and other expenses are rising faster than average salaries, giving many people the sensation of running to stand still.\n“The latest measures to bring down after-class tutorial companies are in line with the shift of focus to the Chinese population’s quality of life,” says Yu Jie, senior research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think-tank.\nAccording to figures from the Chinese Society of Education, the average annual cost of tutoring for a student is more than 12,000 yuan (US$1,860), more than an average month’s salary in a country with a 2019 per capita gross domestic product of US$10,216.\nSome families, however, spend as much as 300,000 yuan a year for tutoring in well-known schools by famous teachers. Such a burden is often exacerbated by the need to pay for childminders while both parents work long hours in office jobs and contend with snarled rush-hour traffic.\nParents who elect to live in the catchment area of sought-after schools in cities such as Shanghai pay extortionate amounts for the privilege.\n“We paid over 3 million yuan for our place,” says Yang Liu, a mother in Shanghai who leaves home for work at 6.30am and does not return until shortly before her six-year-old daughter goes to bed at 9pm.\nEven though kindergartens are officially discouraged from setting after-school work, her daughter gets homework for every day of the week. She must learn Chinese characters, English words, memorise poems, practise reading and play the violin.\n\n\nDELAYED MARRIAGES, FALLING BIRTH RATES\nThe stress that such lifestyles display to unmarried young people has an impact beyond inducing some of them to “lie flat”. Statistics show that couples are getting married later and the birth rate is falling precipitously.\nIn 2020, only 12 million babies were born, down from 14.65 million a year earlier.\nWith the number of women of childbearing age (22 to 35) due to fall by more than 30 per cent over the next decade, some experts are predicting the number of babies born could drop to below 10 million a year and China’s fertility rate could become the lowest in the world.\nThe realities of daily life for China’s middle class presents a different image from that offered by the inexorable rise of headline GDP figures. The cost of living in big cities has risen sharply, shrinking people’s disposable incomes.\nAlicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, an investment bank, puts it succinctly: “The bulk of China’s population is doing worse in net terms as housing affordability continues to worsen and access to education and health becomes more and more costly.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     education ']}"

One of her creations is a battery-powered spin art device to create distinctive artwork.\n""I am happy to share this with my younger ones and the community at large for the growth of the society,"" she said proudly.\nKabara is the brainchild of engineer Hadiza Garbati, who wanted to raise the aspirations of northern Nigerian girls and help them develop skills they might harness to start their own small businesses or enroll at university.\nSince it started in Kano in 2016, Kabara has trained more than 200 girls, and Garbati is working on expanding her project to other northern cities.\nIt is a rare educational success story in northern Nigeria, where more than 1,000 children have been kidnapped from their schools by ransom seekers since December, causing many more to drop out because their parents are fearful of abductions.\nKabara, located in a safe area in the heart of Kano, has been unaffected by the crisis.\nGarbati said she had overcome resistance from some parents by being highly respectful of Islamic traditions. The girls wear their hijabs during sessions.\nCrucial to her success has been support from Nasiru Wada, a close adviser to the Emir of Kano, a figurehead who has moral authority in the community. Wada holds the traditional title of Magajin Garin Kano.\n""The main reason why we are doing this is to encourage them, to open their minds,"" said Wada.\n""Tradition, not to say discourages, but does not put enough emphasis on the education of the girl child, with the belief that oh, at a certain age, she will get married,"" he said.\n""It is good to encourage the girl child to study not only the humanities but the science subjects as well because we need healthcare workers, we need science teachers,"" he said, adding that even married women needed skills to manage their affairs.\n(Reporting by Seun Sanni and Nneka Chile, writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Bernadette Baum)\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Nigeria ']}"

      ‘With school counsellors, it’s really hit-or-miss’: Behind the challenge of safeguarding student mental health
  </h1>, 'text': '* denotes name changed to protect the person’s identity\nSINGAPORE: When Jane* opened up to her secondary school counsellor about the cold wars and troubles she was having with some close friends, she was told that “life’s like that”.\nThat was the then 14-year-old’s first session.\n“I felt ignored, like (school counselling is hopeless) even if I bring up my problems,” said Jane, now 17 and in her first year at junior college.\nShe had been “mandated” to attend counselling because she was frequently late for class and did not submit homework on time. She recalled her form teacher telling her outside the classroom, in full view and within earshot of her classmates, that a session had been arranged to address her tardiness.\n“It brings the idea that those who aren’t faring well have some problems and need to see the counsellor, rather than (the idea that) people … want to see a counsellor because of personal reasons,” she said.\nAfter three compulsory sessions on her time management — none of which circled back to the issue with her friends — Jane did not hear from the counsellor again.\nThen there is the contrasting experience of Hanna Lee, 19, who was asked to see a counsellor when she was in Secondary 2 for frequent truancy.\n“It wasn’t that I didn’t want to go to school. I just had trouble with getting there regularly,” she said.\nHer form teacher, who was aware of her family issues, texted or called her whenever she was absent to ask what was going on. One day, the teacher said: “If you need some help, I can arrange an appointment with the school counsellor.”\nMs Lee was relieved. “I was finally getting help,” she thought. In the counselling room, where a diffuser emitted a calming scent and artwork adorned the walls, she sat on a couch with cushions all around, feeling safe as she vented (sometimes for up to three hours).\nShe remembers learning breathing exercises and wanting to go to school so she would not miss an appointment.\n“Sometimes I’d tell myself I just need to get through one more day, then I can go and release all of my frustrations,” she said. “As (the counsellor) got to know me more, instead of just (letting me) vent, she would give me some advice to help me cope.”\nShe saw the counsellor for three years, until she graduated from secondary school. Today, she is waiting to start her undergraduate degree in philosophy.\nJane and Ms Lee first shared their experiences on Reddit, where CNA Insider saw at least three threads asking about school counsellors.\nWhile a handful of people shared positive experiences, there were common complaints that the counsellors belittled the students’ problems by making comparisons with others, or that the counsellors would “snitch” on them to their teachers or parents.\nSome of the youths agreed that “with school counsellors, it’s really hit-or-miss”.\nIn the light of the pandemic and the recent tragedy at River Valley High School, the mental health of Singapore’s distressed youth is back in the spotlight. Last week, President Halimah Yacob said on Facebook that parents, schools and society were “ill-equipped” to deal with youths’ mental health issues.\nWith school counselling being one of the first ports of call for students, why is there a disparity in their experiences? Given the task of managing both students’ well-being and their academic standards, what challenges do schools face?\n‘JUST FOCUS ON STUDYING’\nWhen Ms Lee entered junior college, she decided to see the school counsellor to continue working on her issues. The experience this time, however, fell short of the mark when the counsellor harped on one question: “How is this going to affect your academic performance?”\n“It felt like I wanted to talk about the issue (affecting me), but I’m constantly being redirected to talk about another thing,” she said.\nUnlike the sympathetic ear she was given at secondary school, she felt it was “a lot more” about the practicalities at junior college.\n“(The counsellor) said, like, ‘You have all these things, and you need to learn which one to focus on. You only have two years; you need to focus on academics.’ And then I was more stressed,” she said.\nAfter that hour-long session, she never went back.\nIn response to a call via CNA Insider’s Instagram account for experiences with school counsellors, one reader shared that he constantly felt dismissed by the counsellors from his university’s counselling centre.\nHe was told things like, he was “not prioritising things” or he should “just focus on studying, and everything else will get sorted out”.\nThe final straw for him? “I was told I should be like other students and just study, and not waste her time and mine,” said the reader, who wished to remain anonymous.\nHe “struggled through a few more years” while dealing with his parents’ marriage issues, the family business and a break-up, and the centre did not reach out to him. He eventually quit school.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bDO COUNSELLORS REALLY ‘SNITCH’?\nBesides feeling that their worries or stressors were “downplayed”, many people in the Reddit threads were concerned that counsellors would “snitch” on students to their teachers and, especially, their parents.\n“(Students) are scared to tell (their) parents. They don’t want to disappoint the parents, or parents could be the source of their pain,” noted former school counsellor Gary Koh.\nAccording to him, all records are confidential, and there are only three instances when counsellors must break confidentiality: Harm to self, harm to others or when the law comes into question.\nBut students believe what their peers have experienced or what they hear through the grapevine. Jane, who was sent to counselling for tardiness, shared about being bullied with her counsellor. The next thing she knew, her teachers asked her for the names of those involved.\n“I definitely was a bit surprised,” she said, as she was not told about the ground rules for confidentiality. While she was not too affected, as the bullying incident was “kind of small”, a friend who confided her sexuality to the same counsellor had it worse.\n“She got scolded and punished by her parents. The counsellor reported it to the teachers, who called her parents,” said Jane.\nAnother student, speaking to CNA Insider on condition of anonymity, said the experiences shared on Reddit “confirmed (her) fears” and that school counselling was “not very helpful in general”. Others agreed that “snitching incidents limit the ability of students to share their problems”.\nHowever, some students, like Ms Lee, were told at the outset when the counsellor would have to break confidentiality. So when she shared her suicide ideation with her counsellor some months later, she “knew what (she) was getting (herself) into”.\nTeachers, too, find confidentiality hard to navigate. “Sometimes we do need to know, and counsellors may not be able to tell us anything,” said former secondary school teacher Rachel*, who left the profession last year.\n“As a teacher, I’d ask the counsellor how the student’s doing. Is there any way I can help? But in terms of what actually goes on, counsellors aren’t supposed to (tell us).”\nWhere necessary, she used to ask the students directly. “If (the counsellors) feel the need to get parents involved, they’d also have to consult the student,” said Rachel.\nBeing informed beforehand made a difference for Phoebe Chew. She started seeing her counsellor in Secondary 3\xa0as her teachers were concerned about her home environment.\nAbout three months later, she was informed that her parents would be contacted, though her issues were not related to harming herself or others, or anything to do with the law.\n“That was one of the worst nightmares any student could possibly want,” said Ms Chew, now 21 and studying social work and psychology at university. “But I think the school counsellor had enough concerns to raise them to my parents.”\nIn the end, it was still a “nightmare scenario” as her “parents weren’t happy”.\nTHE PERENNIAL STIGMA\nIn serious cases, said Rachel, when she did need to involve parents, that was when it became “a bit tough”.\n“The resistance comes more from parents,” she said. “Because some parents refuse to believe their child needs help. They feel like, ‘Oh, it means (my child) is crazy.’”\nAll students CNA Insider spoke to also reported a sense of fear and shame when going to see the counsellor for the first time.\nMarcus* remembers the feeling as he walked to the counselling room, which was located within what looked like a pantry area.\n“It feels like a very shameful thing, and I guess being in a school environment, people gossip. I was really scared people would see me going to the counsellor and think something’s wrong with me,” he said.\nThis thought was also triggered by a remark made by his teacher, even before he considered going for counselling. In year two at junior college, Marcus experienced a bad break-up, and while on an overseas school trip, he broke down in the hotel lobby. His teacher was alerted.\n“Basically, the teacher walked up to me and told me, ‘Actually, you shouldn’t beat yourself up over a girl. If you really can’t handle it, then I’ll give you the number of the school counsellor,’” recalled Marcus, now 21.\nHearing this, he thought, “Am I just emotionally weak? If I go to the school counsellor, it kind of means I’m weaker than everyone else.”\nBut because he was “screwed up”, he decided he could use some help from the counsellor, even if it felt “lame” and “emasculating”.\nSome students also said efforts to inform students about school counselling felt “almost like an afterthought”.\n“Whenever the school mentions (it), it’s always very briefly, at the bottom of the (presentation) slide. ‘Oh, by the way, we have a school counsellor, this is the number, the email. Then okay, next slide,’” Ms Chew said.\nOthers said the counsellor’s office was “tucked away on an upper floor of the school” or “just some room next to the vice-principal’s office”, so it hardly felt prominent, much less welcoming.\nBut in Ms Lee\'s secondary school, mental health did not seem a taboo, thanks to the counsellor’s efforts to de-stigmatise seeking help. There were “posters all around”, and the counsellor regularly went on stage during assembly to introduce herself and say how she could be reached.\nShe also walked around school, especially during recess, and smiled or waved at students she knew. If they gave any indication of being open to talk, she would walk up and check in with them.\n“Most of the students knew that she was a school counsellor, and they were all very open to her talking to students and being around,” Ms Lee said.\nRATIO OF COUNSELLORS TO STUDENTS\nAfter her mixed experiences with school counselling, her heart still goes out to the counsellors “because they’re trying their best”. With “one, at most two” counsellors serving a cohort of 800 to 1,000 students, she “understands the mental burnout”.\n“At this age, 13 to 18, it’s the period when teens go through the most mental instability, like stress and social anxiety. And pressures really get to them, maybe because their brain hasn’t developed yet or whatever,” she said.\n“That’s … when, I feel, the most help needs to go out to students. But looking at the numbers alone, it’s so inadequate.”\nOn July 27, in the wake of the River Valley High School incident, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said in a ministerial statement that all schools now have at least one school counsellor, while some have two.\n“Where feasible, we’ll recruit more school counsellors or ‘re-role’ suitable educators, to augment the counselling support network,” he said.\n\n\nTeachers told CNA Insider that having one or two school counsellors is insufficient for their schools, especially with the “increasing volume of students who need mental health support”.\n“My school has two counsellors, and it’s not enough. They don’t just handle diagnosed mental health issues but all the other anxieties and misbehaviours daily, from all sorts of students who may just be having a bad day,” said Cindy*, a secondary school teacher.\nEx-teacher Rachel said school counsellors’ heavy caseloads have resulted in a prioritisation of “urgent cases”, like those with suicidal tendencies, over others.\n“It makes sense, but there are students who are struggling with social interactions, for example, which are important too. And these things can build up and escalate,” she said.\n“I know they’re doing their best already, but there isn’t enough of them to manage.”\nAnother teacher, David*, is at a school with a population of “about 900 to 1,000” and one school counsellor available. “Even if we increase to two counsellors, we’re still talking about one counsellor to 400, 500 students,” he said.\nNoting that school counsellors often go above and beyond to care for students, he cited how his school counsellor walked one of his students with mental health issues to class every day to build trust and help her overcome her anxiety.\n“One case already takes a lot of energy,” said David.\nCompared to other developed countries, Singapore’s ratio of students to counsellors appears to occupy a lower rung. Research last year showed that schools in Ireland with more than 500 students must have one school counsellor per every 250 students, like in the United States.\nSome schools in Singapore, however, may have more school counsellors than others. Mr Koh, who was a counsellor at an Integrated Programme school for 10 years, said there was a team of seven counsellors to a cohort of 4,300.\nThat is a ratio of one to 600, which he felt was already “overwhelming” at times. “It’s mentally tiring. All you need to have is one student who has depression — it’d suck the life out of you,” he said.\nHe eventually left his job owing to the “trauma” of encountering “too many” suicide cases in and out of school. “It takes its toll on you,” he said. “I needed to disconnect for my own well-being,”\nEven so, he acknowledged that he was “privileged” to have worked in a team of counsellors as it offered more choices to students.\n“It’s like seeing a doctor, right? All doctors are trained, but sometimes you go to one doctor, and you don’t find him helpful. Then you go to the next doctor down the road, you get the same medication, but something is different,” he said.\n“The benefit of having a pool of counsellors (is having) different modalities, different styles, different personalities … So a student who may not quite work well with me can find another counsellor whom (he or she) can connect better with.”\nDavid agreed as he has had a few students who have reflected that they had negative experiences with the school counsellor.\n“Counselling is a very intimate kind of relationship. Sometimes it’s just personality differences, (but) if they don’t like it, it becomes a bad experience for them. That’s the disadvantage of having only one school counsellor in the school,” he said.\n“If they have a bad experience, they won’t be so keen to explore counselling again.”\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bEFFECTIVENESS OF TEACHER-COUNSELLORS\nAs part of plans to strengthen schools’ capabilities, the Ministry of Education (MOE) aims to deploy more than 1,000 teacher-counsellors in the next few years, up from the 700-plus in schools now.\nTeacher-counsellors are teachers who have received additional training so they can help students who are dealing with more challenging social-emotional problems, such as grief and loss.\nSpeaking in Parliament this week, Mr Chan said: “Some of (the new teacher-counsellors) will volunteer, and some of them will be identified to take on additional training to become teacher-counsellors\n“Instead of teaching two subjects, they may reduce the load of teaching … to even become one subject. But they take on the additional responsibilities within the school to help in the counselling service provided.”\nWhile having more teacher-counsellors may help to take some load off school counsellors, experts CNA Insider spoke to said playing a dual role can be “conflicting” for teachers sometimes.\n“Though there are similarities (between both roles) like caring for another person, the manner of it is very different. For teachers, the most well-developed (skills are) sharing and educating,” said Counselling and Care Centre therapist Charlotte Chen.\n“(For) a counsellor, one of the most foundational skills is the ability to listen empathically to the essence of what the person is saying, and also to observe the effect of the conversation on the other.”\nShe added that it will be a “real challenge” for teachers to “switch hats” and hold back on sharing, even if well-intentioned.\nMr Koh observed that even though the school he was with had teacher-counsellors, more students chose to see school counsellors for help.\n“I think students still struggle, (thinking), ‘But this is my teacher? This teacher teaches this subject … I don\'t really want that,’” he said.\nThis was echoed by former Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong, who advocated prioritising mental health during the Budget 2020 debate.\n“The question to ask here is: What’s the primary role of our teachers in schools? If they see their primary role as competency-giving, competency may sometimes be in conflict with students’ well-being,” she told CNA Insider.\n“If you aren’t competent (academically), you’re sometimes made to feel terrible in class — and sometimes unintentionally by the teachers.”\nRecalling her time as a teacher, Rachel said the biggest “pressure” came from having to keep her students’ grades up.\n“I remember a few departments were called down to the principal’s office because those subjects didn’t do well (in examinations),” she cited. “If your class didn’t do well, there was something you did wrong.”\nAlthough there have been efforts to reduce the emphasis on academic results, such as the reduction in the number of examinations and assessments and, most recently, the removal of Common Last Topics from this year’s N, O and A level exams and year-end school exams, Rachel said the need for testing is “ingrained in parents”.\n\n\nAnd rather than wearing many hats, Cindy emphasised that “teaching itself is already a full-time job”, something she would like to be able to excel in “because that’s what I signed up for,” she said.\nJoyce* concurred, saying that she will never choose to be a teacher-counsellor. “I chose to teach history because I’m good at it, and I love it. You wouldn’t ask a counsellor to teach history on the side, right?”\nDavid, on the other hand, sees the benefits of equipping himself with the basics of counselling.\n“For most teachers, you’d have some form of relationship with the students. I think going for it is a good thing … so that I can have a better journey with my students,” he said.\nAccording to him, teachers selected to become teacher-counsellors attend “a full five-day course”, which he wanted to go for when it was offered to him. But he could not, owing to his heavy workload.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bTEACHING AND COUNSELLING ROLES BLURRED\nAs it is, however, some teachers who are not teacher-counsellors have already been acting as counsellors if students are more comfortable talking to them, Cindy said.\n“It falls on the teacher to do the follow-up on their mental well-being, as well as triangulate with the parent. We end up wearing many hats: Teacher of knowledge but also a teacher of values and social well-being, and also a teacher-as-caregiver.”\nSo when Mr Chan said in his parliamentary speech that all teachers will receive enhanced professional development on mental health literacy “as a baseline”, to further strengthen teachers’ abilities to identify and support students in need, some teachers CNA Insider spoke to questioned if the “burden” of taking care of students’ mental well-being should fall solely on their shoulders.\nIn an email response to CNA Insider’s queries, the MOE said that the enhanced efforts will include areas such as understanding and recognising symptoms related to common mental health issues and suicide, strategies to de-escalate strong emotions and impulsive behaviour, and facilitating classroom conversations on mental health with sensitivity.\n“The new measures come from the underlying assumption that teachers have, or could be equipped with, the ability to diagnose and competently deal with students with mental health issues under our charge,” said Cindy, a secondary school teacher.\n“With poorly defined boundaries of where a teacher’s role begins and ends with regards to mental health, the culpability in the case of a repeat incident will fall onto teachers,” she added.\nIdeally, teachers and school counsellors would interact in a symbiotic relationship, said Inner Light Psychological Services clinical psychologist Tracie Lazaroo.\nShe explained that both teachers and school counsellors act as “gatekeepers”, but they possess “unique resources” that will help with their students’ well-being.\n“Teachers are equipped with unique student-related knowledge including how they have been performing in class, their temperament, behavioral tendencies and level of interaction with other students,” Dr Lazaroo said.\nAccording to the MOE,\xa0teachers are trained to engage students to understand their issues, but should refer them to school counsellors should they need “extensive support”.\nCounsellors, Dr Lazaroo said, would be equipped with “more in-depth interviewing skills”. They would also be able to “create support strategies for the student” and make referrals to community services for long-term support.\nHence, some teachers, like Joyce, feel like even with additional training, they can never be fully equipped to take care of students’ mental health, or that there is a limit to what they can do.\n“You care for them, you truly do care for them. And it breaks your heart to see them in this position. (But) we all have different thresholds and once you pass that, I\'m like, I don\'t know what to do. I don\'t know what to say,” said Joyce, who teaches in a secondary school.\n“Genuinely, I\'m only comfortable to a certain extent. I just don\'t have the eloquence to phrase things in a way that would help a person and I think it’s a skill to be able to talk about (mental health) in a way that\'s helpful to a teenager.”\n“That’s a skill that counsellors have.”\nCindy agreed, noting that the expectation that teachers should be utilised to tackle mental health “hints at a more systemic issue regarding the perception of teachers and their duties”.\n“As much as we wish we have the capacity to do everything that is asked of us, the reality is that the more roles we take on, the worse we are going to perform across all of them.”\n‘TEACHING IS JUST 20 PER CENT OF THE JOB’\nThe most common grievance for teachers who spoke to CNA Insider is having to care for students’ well-being on top of a crushing workload.\n“The preparation for work was tough and then it’s worse when you have so many students - having to keep track of their work, keep track of their well-being, and even just their names sometimes,” said Rachel, who had had eight classes of 40 kids at one point.\nIn her Facebook post, Mdm Halimah also said that for teachers already overloaded with work, it is not possible for them to ""delve deeply"" into the issues affecting one child as that would require close monitoring, observation and engagement.\nAs for teacher-counsellors, Rachel observed that even though those in her school were “slightly offloaded” in terms of teaching responsibilities, there were still “a lot of backend” things that they had to attend to.\n“I always tell people that teaching is really just 20 per cent of the job. The rest is administrative, like doing lesson plans, classroom management and marking.”\n“Even if you have less classes to teach, when it comes to marking papers, testing exams, everybody has their load.”\nDavid also questioned if teacher-counsellors can successfully juggle the dual role if the number of teachers in a school does not increase - especially when there is subject-based banding in school.\nSubject-based banding was introduced in 2019, where students will take subjects at a higher or lower level based on their strengths.\n\n\n“More banded classes means you’ll need more teachers. It’s not going to be easy to offload teachers to really focus on being a teacher-counsellor.”\nAdditionally, what is “missing from the conversation” of mental health in schools is the mental well-being of teachers, Cindy shared.\n“Mental health issues among teachers are very present, yet rarely talked about … I don’t see how we can create a safe space to discuss mental health issues when we ourselves are situated in an environment that discourages it,” she said.\nAnother teacher, who also declined to be named, described the mental health of teachers to be “a very sad affair right now”.\n""Despite all the positive media coverage of our successful pivot to home-based learning (HBL), the reality is that we’re struggling in schools to keep pace with the ever-changing Safe Management Measures, oscillations between HBL and physical lessons, and the perennial need to still keep apace with the syllabus.”\n“It’s a whole new workload altogether and I think at this point teachers are just barely managing.”\nMs Ong urged that “we must not look at the student’s mental well-being without looking at the teacher\'s well-being” as well.\n“A student who is not well affects the wellbeing of a teacher and a teacher who is not well will also affect the students. These two things need to be looked at in totality.”\nWHAT WOULD MAKE COUNSELLING A VIABLE OPTION?\nOne 19-year-old student, who wishes to be anonymous, suggested offering students email or phone call services like what is done at Samaritans of Singapore, such that students who are afraid of physical sessions may have an option.\nShe also suggested having routine mental health checkups, such that students who may be afraid to walk into the counsellor’s room have a space to speak up under the guise of a formal school event.\nSome schools, like Marcus’ junior college, have school leaders offering peer support. Marcus, who holds a leadership position himself, was taught some techniques on how to spot students who might need mental health support or what to do when a student confides in him.\n“I think that’s also a very important part because ultimately, most people turn to their peers when they are facing issues,” he said. “And it definitely would help to get students to know how to help each other, and in really serious cases to flag it out.”\nBut he admits that the job can be overwhelming, especially with the already heavy academic stress and workload.\nAbove all, all students CNA Insider spoke to echo making school counselling more approachable, with a strong emphasis on confidentiality.\n“If there’s no approachability then no one would even see the school counsellor,” said Ms Lee. It starts with making the counsellor more visible to students, she said. “If you don’t know how to see the school counsellor, you might not want to ask the teacher for fear of judgement.”\nAnd while there may be a mismatch in expectations in seeing a school counsellor, another student, Ms Chew, shared that it is helpful for students to share what they hope to achieve out of counselling. But not all students may have the self-awareness or knowledge to do so, she said.\n“These are students, it’s probably their first time starting this kind of thing. So I hope that (school counsellors) will be the ones taking the lead in asking the students, guiding the students to realize what they want,” she said.\nMORE TRAINING FOR SCHOOL COUNSELLORS?\nOther than the lack of resources in schools, Mdm Halimah also said that school counsellors “may not be well-trained on issues affecting mental health”.\nIn the 2013 American Counselling Association report on the counselling landscape in Singapore, it also noted that while there are increasing numbers of individuals entering the field with basic training, there is “limited opportunity for high quality clinical supervision”.\nIn its email response, the MOE said that school counsellors receive monthly professional supervision, peer support group sessions and individual clinical supervision from lead school counsellors.\n“These have been continuing via online platforms in the midst of COVID-19 restrictions.”\nThe MOE added that school counsellors also deepen their knowledge through workshops and courses such as “suicide assessment and intervention, psychological first aid, addiction, child abuse or family violence, and multicultural issues”.\nEven with the measures in place, Ms Chen questioned if the current clinical supervision that school counsellors have access to is sufficient, especially when “they probably already don’t have many colleagues to bounce off” ideas and experience, as most schools only have one school counsellor.\nAt Counselling and Care Centre, she conducts supervised training for professionals in the field and she has been working with some school counsellors who want to seek “extra supervision”.\n“We often encourage them to record their sessions - with the permission of their students - and showcase segments of their work so we can really look at the skills.”\nFrom her experience working with school counsellors, she noticed that it is “really hard” for them to get more support and training to improve their skills when they have heavy caseloads and are constantly “firefighting with higher risk cases”.\n“In this line of work, we can’t just rely on our degrees. There’s so much more conversation that needs to be carried out to support professionals in working effectively with people,” she added.\n“The most dangerous thing is when practitioners practice on their own.”\nCHANGING PERCEPTIONS OF MENTAL HEALTH\nIn schools, there is the Character & Citizenship Education (CCE), which this year had a refreshed syllabus that gives more focus on mental wellness and peer support. But teachers find that it is merely “scratching the surface”.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n“The reality of the execution is … it might not always work because kids are tired (from other classes). They don’t want to hear me talk about how to be a good person. It’s not something that you can learn by sitting down and listening,” said Joyce.\nRachel added: “Teachers are so busy teaching other lessons that during CCE lessons, we just literally deliver whatever the school gives us. It’s really hard to engage the kids in a manner that is real and that they can fully relate to.”\nThis is why she also felt that her students took CCE as “a joke”.\n“Students don\'t feel like they can ask anything. It\'s very hard in a group of 40 - not every child wants to speak up, not every child wants to engage. Whereas if you had smaller groups, it’ll be more intimate.”\nWhile part of the refreshed CCE syllabus teaches “resilience and social-emotional well-being” - which includes having a sense of gratitude and appreciation - Cindy felt that it perpetuates “toxic positivity”.\n“Before we get to resilience there are so many other logical steps a person struggling with his or her mental health can go through - acceptance, for example. We really can\'t teach resilience through CCE. Inspiring videos and powerpoint slides can only go so far,” she said.\nPerhaps, beyond improving ratios and the quality of care, it is an attitudinal shift that is needed in taking care of students’ - and even teachers’ - mental health.\n“We need to be mindful of using mental resilience and mental well-being interchangeably. We really need to stop talking about resilience as if (poor mental health) is just something to snap out of,” said Ms Ong.\n“There isn’t a strength more powerful than being able to deal with your own vulnerability, and I think we understate that.”\nWhere to get help:\nSamaritans of Singapore Hotline: 1800 221 4444\nInstitute of Mental Health’s Helpline: 6389 2222\nSingapore Association for\xa0Mental Health Helpline: 1800 283 7019\nYou can also find a list of international helplines here.

      MOE to strengthen support networks in schools; all teachers to get enhanced training on mental health literacy
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: New measures will be rolled out in the “near term” to better care for the well-being of students in schools, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing in Parliament on Tuesday (Jul 27).\nThese measures include giving all teachers “enhanced professional development” on mental health literacy as a baseline and deploying more teacher-counsellors in the next few years, said Mr Chan in a ministerial statement about the support given to schools and students in need.\nIt comes after the death of a Secondary 1 student at River Valley High School. A Secondary 4 student was arrested and charged with murder in connection with the incident.\nIn his statement, Mr Chan said youths are learning to cope with the pressures of a “competitive, high-performing environment”.\n“For our youths growing up in today’s complex and fast paced world, their challenges are intensified by what happens online, where comparisons are incessant and unrelenting – adding yet another layer of social pressure,” he added.\n\n\nSingapore must do “all we can” to help children “find their footing in an intense environment”, he added.\n“Our approach should not only be to strengthen the overall system of support, but to engender a much more caring, much more\xa0nurturing environment in our society,” the minister said.\nNEW MEASURES TO BE TAKEN\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) will be undertaking several new measures in the near-term, said Mr Chan.\nAll teachers will receive enhanced professional development on mental health literacy “as a baseline”, to further strengthen teachers’ abilities to identify and support students in need.\nIn addition, MOE will aim to deploy more than 1,000 teacher-counsellors in the next few years, up from the more than 700 who are currently deployed in schools.\nThese are a group of teachers who have received additional training so they can help students who are dealing with more challenging social-emotional problems, such as grief and loss, said Mr Chan.\nHe added that currently, all schools have at least one school counsellor, while some have two.\n“Where feasible, we will recruit more school counsellors or re-role suitable educators, to augment the counselling support network,” he said.\nCo-curricular activities (CCAs) for secondary schools and pre-universities will be allowed to resume within the next few weeks, as more students complete their COVID-19 vaccinations, noted Mr Chan.\n“These activities are avenues for our young people to build bonds, and to grow in a balanced way - emotionally, physically and psychologically. We plan to reinstate such activities in full as soon as the COVID-19 situation allows for it,” the minister told Parliament.\n\n\nSchools will also dedicate more time and attention to checking in on students’ well-being, he said.\nFrom now on, teachers will devote time at the start of every school term to check in on their students’ well-being, and guide them on how, where and when to get help if needed. Schools currently have orientation programmes for new students at the start of the school year, he noted.\nRELIEVING EXAM STRESS\nThe removal of Common Last Topics (CLT) will be extended to GCE O-, N- and A-level examinations this year. Last month, MOE announced the removal of CLT from the Primary School Leaving Examinations for 2021.\nThis is because the Delta variant of coronavirus has “created much greater disruptions than envisaged” and impacted students’ social and emotional well-being, with authorities “especially concerned” for graduating cohorts, said Mr Chan.\n“While these topics would have already been taught in schools, removing them from the national examinations would help to relieve the revision load and exam stress for our students,” he added.\nAll schools will also reduce the scope for their end-of-year examinations this year to alleviate students’ revision load, said the minister.\nHe also noted current measures taken by MOE around students’ mental well-being. Social-emotional skills and resilience building “form the foundation of MOE’s mental health efforts” and have been part of the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum.\n\n\nThis year, the revised CCE curriculum was implemented, starting with lower secondary levels. It includes enhanced features on mental health education.\n“For example, they learn to differentiate normal stress from distress and mental illness, so that they can seek help before becoming overwhelmed,” said Mr Chan.\nAll schools have also been putting in place peer support systems to encourage students to look out for one another, said the minister, adding that teachers have also been keeping “a watchful eye” over students to provide a listening ear where needed.\nHe noted that when students need further help, they can see the school counsellors. If students need further intervention, school counsellors can also refer them to professionals, such as those in the Response, Early intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (REACH) teams or social service agencies.\nWHOLE-OF-SOCIETY EFFORT NEEDED\nThe Education Minister said the mental well-being of Singapore’s youths requires “strengthening the continuum of support” across schools, families and the community.\nThe Health Ministry (MOH) and\xa0Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) have set up a new task force, which transited from the COVID-19 mental wellness task force.\nChaired by Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary, the task force aims to develop an “overarching national strategy and action plan on mental health and well-being”, said Mr Chan. As a member of the task force, MOE will work with MOH and MSF to give focus to the youth segment.\n\n\nMr Chan also stressed that a whole-of-society effort is needed to avoid “such tragic incidents” from happening again.\n“We need a communal safety net, underpinned by a caring and nurturing culture, for all our people, especially our youths. So that collectively, we send them the unequivocal message that no one will ever be alone; and no one needs\xa0to go through life’s toughest moments alone,” he said.\nHe noted that community efforts around promoting mental health have been gaining momentum and expressed gratitude for the “overwhelming” outpouring of support in the wake of the incident at River Valley High School.\nHe urged members of the public to “look within our own social circles” and start there.\n“Within our own families, we can all spend a bit more time listening to our children’s thoughts and feelings. Let them share with us what they find stressful. Give them the space to process their emotions,” he said.\n“We can have more frank conversations with our children and families on the definition of success … Success cannot, should not and must not be the constant need to be compared with someone else and having to live up to someone else’s image.”\n\n\nHe urged adults to set the “right tone and example” for children, by treating others with grace and compassion.\nMr Chan also added that MOE wants to strengthen its partnership with parent support groups in schools, and encouraged each group to form a sub-group focusing on the mental well-being of children and families.\n“I appeal to everyone not to stigmatise those who come forward to seek help … Reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness,” said the Education Minister.\n“Let this incident motivate all of us to take down our barriers and treat struggling individuals who step forward with care and compassion.”\nMPs RAISE SEVERAL CONCERNS\nAfter the ministerial statement,\xa0MPs from both sides of the aisle raised numerous concerns\xa0in a session that lasted about 90 minutes.\nAmong the\xa0issues brought up was the stigma faced by those seeking help with their mental health.\nFor instance, Nominated MP Shahira Abdullah noted that students and teachers who wish to seek support may\xa0still be afraid to ask for\xa0help due to ""entrenched stigma"".\nIn response, Mr Chan emphasised that medical confidentiality will be respected for those who come forward, and that such information will ""not be passed around to different agencies"".\n""Only in the exceptional cases where there is a real threat, agencies might then take actions to work with other agencies to pre-empt this,"" he said.\n\nMP He Ting Ru (WP-Sengkang) also pointed out that mental health issues should not be equated with violence, a point that Mr Chan agreed with.\n""Not every distressed individual is a violent individual. The distress can express in various forms ...\xa0So I think we all can help to spread this message.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Chan Chun Sing ', '     River Valley High School ', '     education ', '     schools ', '     mental health ']}"

He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. An axe was also seized by the police.\nPreliminary investigations showed that the accused and the victim did not know each other.\nThe 16-year-old has been charged with murder and is in remand for psychiatric assessment.\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Chan provided a summary of what happened in the school on Jul 19, saying that the 16-year-old was seen holding an axe outside a toilet towards the end of lunch break.\nThe boy had asked two different groups of students to call the police. He also complied with a teacher's request to put down the axe, and was escorted to a meeting room before the police arrived and took him into custody.\xa0\xa0\nThe next day, a\xa0Caring Action in Response to Emergencies (CARE) Post was set up in the school to provide psychological support to students and staff who needed immediate help.\xa0\nAbout 540 students and staff members have since sought psychological support from the CARE post at the school, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nMOE will continue to support the school’s community, including the affected families, and monitor the well-being of students in all schools, he said.\n\n\nNew measures will also be rolled out to better care for the well-being of students in schools, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nThis includes giving all teachers “enhanced professional development” on mental health literacy as a baseline and deploying more teacher-counsellors in the next few years.\nSchools will also dedicate more time and attention to checking in on students’ well-being, he said.\n\n\nIn his statement, Mr Chan also said that MOE will continue to update security measures in schools in a “targeted” manner, without losing the sense of “homeliness” of the school environment.\nMOE does not want schools to be turned into “fortresses”, creating unease and stress among staff and students, he said.\nMr Chan said he discussed the issue of school security with school leaders, adding that they were “unanimous” in their responses.\n“School is like a second home to our children and all of us. It is a safe place where values are cultivated; life-long relationships are built, and a shared identity is forged,” he stated.\n“It is a warm and supportive environment that allows students with different learning needs and aspirations to discover their passions and develop their strengths.

      As Canada heads toward vote, Trudeau vulnerable over indigenous policies
  </h1>, 'text': 'OTTAWA: The discovery of hundreds of graves of indigenous children, highlighting Canada\'s mistreatment of First Nations, has dominated campaigning ahead of a likely election and is an issue on which Liberal Canadian Prime Minister Justin\xa0Trudeau\xa0is vulnerable, analysts and indigenous advocates say.\nIn 2015,\xa0Trudeau\xa0promised to reset relations between the government and indigenous peoples, a point he re-asserted in a 2017 speech to the United Nations, but his government\'s own 2019 inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls has been widely criticised for leading to little change.\nLiberal sources say a snap election is likely as soon as September as\xa0Trudeau, 49, seeks a majority after being forced to depend on opposition parties to pass legislation since 2019.\nFor the first time since the pandemic began,\xa0Trudeau\xa0travelled to make in-person policy announcements around the country last week. Two of his rivals, Conservative leader Erin O\'Toole and progressive New Democrat Jagmeet Singh, also hit the road.\nCanada has been rocked by the disclosures of more than 1,000 unmarked graves of indigenous children were discovered at former ""residential schools,"" church-run institutions funded by the government. The system forcibly separated the children from their families, subjecting them to abuse, in what the country\'s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) called ""cultural genocide"" in 2015.\nAlmost 70 per cent\xa0of Canadians said they had been unaware of the severity of abuses in the residential school system until the graves were found, according to an Abacus Data survey published in June. According to the same poll, 72 per cent\xa0of Canadians now support moving faster to redress the legacy of the schools.\nKathleen Mahoney, a human rights lawyer and one of the architects of the TRC, said the discovery was ""an existential crisis for ordinary non-indigenous Canadians, about who are we and what is our Canadian identity.""\nNO \'MEANINGFUL PROGRESS\'\nBefore his first election victory in 2015,\xa0Trudeau\xa0promised to address all 94 recommendations - or ""calls to action"" - set out by the TRC report but has so far covered only eight, according to the Yellowhead Institute, a First Nation-led think tank. Six recommendation were about finding, identifying and commemorating children who died at the schools.\n""Had the government really done their job, then we really would not be here today looking at this six years later,"" said Lynne Groulx, Chief Executive Officer of the Native Women\'s Association of Canada.\nTrudeau\xa0also promised to end all boil water advisories in indigenous communities by 2020. Fifty-one advisories are still in effect in 32 communities, while 108 have been lifted since 2015, according to official data.\n""There hasn\'t been any meaningful progress on their watch"" on indigenous issues, said Frank Graves, president of polling company EKOS Research, leaving\xa0Trudeau\xa0""somewhat exposed"" politically.\nThe government\'s shortcomings could benefit the left-leaning New Democrats, Graves said, who accuse the Liberals of not doing enough.\nThe Liberals would win 38.1 per cent\xa0of the vote if it were held now, a Nanos Research poll from Jul\xa02 shows. That puts them in majority territory for now, with Conservatives trailing at 23.6 per cent\xa0and New Democrats at 20.4 per cent.\nOn Thursday,\xa0Trudeau\xa0responded to a question about his government\'s failure to address the TRC\'s recommendations at a news conference in Quebec, saying: ""What took generations and indeed centuries to break ... is going to take more than just a few years to fix.""\nSome 80 per cent\xa0of the TRC recommendations that require government action are ""completed or well underway,"" a spokesperson for the Canadian minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations said.\nIn a joint statement, the two ministers in charge of indigenous affairs and services said the latest budget includes ""historic, new investment of over C$18 billion (US$14.3 billion)"" over five years for indigenous communities.\nLast week,\xa0Trudeau\xa0made a stop at the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan, where graves were found, to sign an agreement two years in the making that allows Cowessess to take charge of its own child welfare system.\nEarlier the same day, he made the historic appointment of Mary Simon, an Inuk woman, as the first indigenous governor general, who serves as Canada\'s representative to head of state, Queen Elizabeth.\n""We all inherited this.

  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: A commission set up by Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton to help boost the number of Black people in British motorsport published its report on Tuesday with 10 recommendations for change and some damning insights into the industry.\nThe report, led by\xa0the Royal Academy of Engineering, found that none of the seven British-based Formula One teams or 4,000 UK motorsport companies had ethnicity data for employees.\nAn estimate, however, suggested that only 1per cent of the 40,000 strong workforce was Black.\nRhys Morgan, director at the Royal Academy, told reporters the research also found examples of ""quite horrible racist comments"", which he said were waved away as \'banter\'.\nOne Formula One engineer said he had experienced jokes about Black people, afro combs, fried chicken, crime rates and poverty in Africa while a Black female race marshal spoke of people addressing her in a Jamaican accent.\nThe commission found a number of barriers to diversity, including hiring from a select group of top universities, the rural locations of teams and systemic under-achievement in schools.\nThere was also a feeling among Black students that motorsport was not for them, while a cost cap introduced this season created a potential barrier for taking on more apprentices.\nRecommendations include asking Formula One teams to implement a diversity and inclusion charter for motorsport and possible cost cap exemptions for taking on staff from Black backgrounds.\n""A lot of the teams are responsive on this,"" said Morgan. ""We are keen to explore that further with the FIA and Formula One.""\nThe report, released in the week of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, proposed the establishment of a fund to develop programmes to address the factors contributing to high school exclusion rates among students from Black backgrounds.\nIt also suggested the piloting of new approaches to increase the number of Black teachers in subjects leading to careers in\xa0engineering and the creation of scholarship programmes.\nHamilton, the sport\'s sole Black driver who was expelled from school as a youngster, hoped the report would start ""a ripple effect"" for change and saw it as a big part of his motorsport legacy.\n""I would be like to be remembered for much more than just winning championships, which of course is an amazing thing on its own, but actually helping people and changing the industry and the viewpoints,"" he said.\n""We all bleed the same.

      Primary 1 registration: 5 schools head for balloting in Phase 2A(1)
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Parents hoping to land a place in five popular primary schools for their children next year are headed for balloting\xa0for Phase 2A(1) of the Primary 1 registration exercise.\xa0\nAccording to the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) website on Friday (Jul 9), the schools are Catholic High School (Primary), CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School (Primary), Nanyang Primary School, Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School and Rosyth Primary School.\xa0\nNext year's cohort of Primary 1 students was born in 2015, which saw the highest number of citizen births in 13 years at 33,725. This figure is also higher than the 33,238\xa0babies born in 2012, the Year of the Dragon.\xa0\nThe Phase 2A(1) balloting for the five schools will be carried out for students living outside of the 2km radius from these schools, said MOE on its website.\xa0\nPhase 2A(1) is open to parents who are members of a school's alumni association, or who are\xa0members of the school’s advisory or management committee.\nUSE THE MAP TO FIND OUT HOW MANY VACANCIES ARE LEFT IN EACH SCHOOL AFTER PHASE 2A(1):\n\n\xa0 \n  \xa0\nEvery year, a school will have to reserve 40 Primary 1 places\xa0for Phase 2B and Phase 2C - 20 each phase - to ensure “continued open access to all schools in later phases”, said MOE.\nBut if a school is already oversubscribed in Phase 2A(1), it goes to the ballot.\nIn 2020, CHIJ St Nicholas, Pei Hwa Presbyterian and Rosyth also held a ballot for this phase, alongside Nan Hua Primary School.\xa0\nThis year, Catholic High saw 123 applicants for 119 places in Phase 2A(1). Rosyth\xa0saw 102 parents apply for the 81 spots available.\xa0\nOver at\xa0Nanyang Primary,\xa0150 applicants will ballot for 140 available vacancies, and at Pei Hwa Presbyterian, 86 parents will draw for 71 spots.\xa0\nAnd, the 121 parents hoping to get their daughters into CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ will ballot for the 77 places available.\xa0\nFifteen other schools also saw more than half of their spots available for Phase 2A(1) snapped up, including Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) and (Primary), Henry Park Primary School, Pei Chun Primary School, Rulang Primary School and Temasek Primary School.\xa0\nAi Tong Primary School is also almost full, with only the 40 places reserved for Phase 2B and 2C remaining. There were exactly 113 applicants for the same number of vacancies\xa0available in Phase 2A(1).\n\n\nLARGER COHORT SIZE, CHOICES FOR YOUNGER SIBLINGS\nParents who registered their children for various stages of Phase 2 told CNA that they had some worries about securing spots in the schools of their choice because of the large cohort size.\xa0\n“To be honest I was worried, because my older daughter is born in 2015 with the bigger cohort,” said Mr Henry Tan, who has registered his daughter for a place at\xa0Raffles Girls’ Primary School under Phase 2A(2) as his wife is an alumnus of the school.\xa0\n“But my wife has done her analysis, and found that for girls schools or single-sex schools, typically the vacancies are more than mixed schools, the more popular ones,” he told CNA.\xa0\n“After doing that analysis, I’m not too worried, and I think there should be vacancies for the Phase 2A(2) part.”\nPhase 2A(2) is open to parents who studied at the school\xa0or who have another child who previously studied there.\nAccording to MOE data, there were 166 available vacancies for Raffles Girls’ Primary in Phase 2A(1), and 45 applicants.\xa0\nIf they secure a spot for their older daughter in the school, her younger sister will be able to apply via Phase 1,\xa0which is open\xa0to applicants\xa0with siblings in the same school, Mr Tan noted.\xa0\nOther parents are opting to apply through Phase 2C,\xa0the open phase which will come later for those who do not enjoy any form of priority admissions.\nFor mother-of-two Yu Hui Ping, she previously managed to use her alumni status to get her daughter - now in Primary 4 - into Raffles Girls' Primary through Phase 2A.\xa0\nSince Raffles Girls’ is a single-sex school, she had to look for other options for her son, who will be entering Primary 1 next year.\xa0\n“With my son, we don’t really have alumni status anywhere and we live in Toa Payoh, which is a densely populated place,” said Mrs Yu.\xa0\nShe has shortlisted two schools within 1km of their home, Pei Chun Public School and Kheng Cheng Primary School, and plans to register him through Phase 2C for either school.\xa0\nThe former would provide a “really good bilingual education”, while the other\xa0is within walking distance, she told CNA.\xa0\n“We’ve been looking at the statistics of previous years and the current year, and we also realised that the spots are already filled up unexpectedly faster in the first phase,” said Mrs Yu, noting that for both schools, about half\xa0of the places\xa0were snapped up in Phase 1.\xa0\n“I am getting a little worried, what happens if I don’t get the schools that I am looking for? But as it is I can’t really do anything right now, so it’s a sit-and-wait approach.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ']}"

      Sexuality education for pre-schoolers among proposals by WP's Raeesah Khan to address abuse, harassment
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mandatory sexuality education for younger children, a greater focus on teaching students about consent and having more time for such classes were among the suggestions raised by\xa0Workers’ Party Member of Parliament Raeesah Khan on Tuesday (Jul 6).\xa0\nSpeaking on an\xa0adjournment motion titled sexuality education in schools as a first line of defence against sexual violence, Ms Khan said:\xa0“While the Government has introduced stiffer penalties for sexual offenders, criminal deterrence is not a silver bullet for this issue.\xa0\n“We must get to the root of the problem by building a strong culture of consent in our society. Without a strong consent culture, the criminal justice system alone cannot protect us, women, men and children from sexual harassment and violence.”\nLaw and Home Affairs\xa0Minister K Shanmugam said in January that from 2017 to 2019, there were 6,988 reports of sexual assault, including rape, sexual assault by penetration, outrage of modesty, as well as\xa0sexual offences involving children and vulnerable victims.\xa0\nOf these cases, 2,798 victims were below 16 years old, 1,000 victims were between 16 and 20 years old, and 3,685 victims were aged 21 years and older, he said at the time.\xa0\nSTANDARDISED SEXUALITY EDUCATION FOR PRESCHOOLS\nThe number of underaged sexual assault victims is “likely to be much higher in reality” as many children may not be aware that they are victims and what they can do about it, said Ms Khan on Tuesday.\xa0\nNoting that most sexual assault cases involving minors are committed by someone they trust, and only a small fraction seeks help, she said that mandatory sexuality education should be extended to young children.\nA standardised sexuality education curriculum for all pre-school operators should be created, said the MP for Sengkang GRC.\n“While our frontline caregivers must be more proactive in weeding out potential abuse, our children must be taught to recognise the wrongs being done to them,” she said.\xa0\nChildren should be taught body safety, when a touch is good or bad, what secrets should be shared with a trusted adult, and how they can get help, she added.\xa0\n“Some might feel uncomfortable with introducing the concept of sex to pre-schoolers. As a mother of young children. I share their concerns about making sure that our children are not exposed to sexualised content.\xa0\n“But sexuality education isn\'t just about sex. It\'s about teaching the concepts of normal relationships, boundaries, and respect for one another\'s feelings and bodies. These concepts can be taught in age appropriate ways,” said Ms Khan.\xa0\nThe sexuality education curriculum in schools starts at Primary 5 with the Growing Years programme, she noted.\xa0\nCiting New Zealand as an example, Ms Khan said personal safety programmes there start sexuality education for children at the age of five.\xa0\n“It\'s clear that hundreds of minors are hurt by sexual abuse each year. But the trauma of sexual violence finds many young victims far too early,"" she said.\n“If we wait too long to teach our young children about consent, respect, and what to do if they ever face sexual assault, we are failing them as the adults they trust.""\n\n\nIn response to Ms Khan’s motion, Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling noted that a new character and citizenship education curriculum was launched this year.\xa0\nSince the rollout of the sexuality education curriculum in 2014, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has been updating its content “to ensure that they remain relevant towards sexuality matters”, said Ms Sun.\n“We considered emerging trends, local and international research, input from specialists in relevant fields and our local context, and also importantly, feedback from our youths on their concerns and how they want to be meaningfully engaged,” she added.\n“These may sound new to those of us who did not go through this new curriculum nor experienced these new teaching delivery methods, but we recognise that there are new challenges that our youths are facing and we are committed to partner them in their adulting journey.”\nStudents learn about personal safety and protection from abuse from Primary 1, said the Minister of State, including what is a good touch and what is a bad touch.\xa0\nIn a Primary 5 lesson on sexual abuse, students walk through different scenarios to figure out if the situation is a case of sexual abuse.\xa0\nThey are taught to recognise sexual abuse and harassment through “carefully designed and developmentally appropriate” character and citizenship education lessons.\xa0\n“They learn skills to protect themselves both in the physical and online space, and know the laws that protect them,” said Ms Sun.\xa0\n“Also, we hope that by sharing with our students about different ways to seek help, it will encourage them to approach a trusted adult when required.”\xa0\n\n\nCALL FOR CURRICULUM TO FOCUS ON CONSENT\nThe sexuality education curriculum also needs to focus on consent, said Ms Khan.\xa0\nShe noted a 2020 survey conducted by AWARE and Ngee Ann Polytechnic that showed that more than half of the students surveyed were not taught about consent in school.\n“It\'s not enough to simply teach that sex without consent is wrong. Consent is complex, and our students must know why it\'s important, and how to navigate it respectfully,"" said Ms Khan.\nIn the same survey, youths expressed trouble identifying consent in situations involving alcohol abuse and conditional consent, she noted.\xa0\n“Rape myths, like how women who drink deserve it, or silence means consent, worsen this problem. Effective sexuality education must tackle these problems head on.”\xa0\nNeither the current Growing Years sexuality education curriculum nor the eTeens programme developed by the Health Promotion Board “gets to the root of the problem”, she said.\n“Our students need to be taught why consent is key, and how people cannot fully give consent in certain scenarios. It\'s commendable that some tertiary institutions now teach consent explicitly, but this must start earlier on in life,"" she added.\n\n\nMORE LESSON TIME FOR SEXUALITY EDUCATION\nSexuality education needs to be “more sustained” and “openly taught”, said Ms Khan. Students currently get 25 hours of class time for these lessons, equivalent to one week of school out of the 12 years spent in primary school to pre-university.\xa0\nStudents also need dedicated channels and access to educators who support students through relationships, emotions and abuse, she added.\xa0\n“These spaces should be non-judgmental and confidential, so that our children and youth are willing to talk about their struggles,"" she said.\nSome students find the current sexuality education curriculum “unrelatable”, said Ms Khan, and they want teachers to facilitate questions and conversations about sex in a “non-judgmental space”.\xa0\n“They need regular open discussions in which they can ask questions, explore issues, not simply in a passive environment that only happens once or twice a year,” she added, noting that some may think parents should be\xa0responsible for their children’s sexuality education.\n“The reality is that parents are uncomfortable talking about sex, much less teaching important concepts relating to it to their children,” she said, adding that some parents think talking to their children about sex may drive them to become sexually active.\xa0\nChildren may also feel uncomfortable learning about sex from their parents, or unable to address such topics due to “abusive dynamics” at home, said Ms Khan.\xa0\n“Sexuality education is complex and leaving it up to parents to deliver accurate and up-to-date information about STIs, tech-enabled offences, and the nuances of consent might be too much to ask.”\xa0\n\n\nThe autonomous universities are implementing compulsory education modules on respect and appropriate behaviour, where students learn about the key elements of respect and appropriate behaviour, said Ms Sun.\xa0\nFor example, in the National University of Singapore\xa0module, students learn that consent must be actively communicated and given freely and voluntarily, she noted. These learning points are reinforced through compulsory workshops and peer discussions for those staying in hostels.\xa0\nStudents also learn what constitutes sexual misconduct and harassment, and are informed of the various reporting channels and support networks, said Ms Sun.\xa0\nTHE ROLE OF TEACHERS\nIn sexuality education, teachers are “especially important”, and all educators, especially early childhood educators, need to be more proactive and sensitive while addressing sexual abuse and assault, said Ms Khan in her speech.\n“This includes being able to spot when students may have faced sexual assault, ensure their safety, handle reports sensitively and confidentially, and support students with empathy.”\xa0\nThey must also be trained in facilitating scenarios and discussion-based learning for sexuality education to be effective, she added.\xa0\nAdding that she was “glad to know” that the Education Ministry currently requires sexuality education to be taught by specially selected and trained teachers, Ms Khan suggested giving all trainee teachers at the National Institute of Education more exposure to sexuality education training.\xa0\n“In addition, the teachers’ sexuality education training should be frequently updated and refreshed to reflect best practices,” she said.\xa0\nSchools also need channels for accountability and reporting, and these should be widely publicised so that students know where to go for help, said Ms Khan.\xa0\nIn response, Ms Sun said: “We acknowledge that sexuality-related issues are complex and multifaceted, and we know that sexuality education lessons involve highlighting issues that are important and relevant to our young people and that we need to create a safe space for them to have honest conversations and to hear multiple perspectives from one another.\n“At the end of the day, we hope to empower our students so that they can understand themselves better and make responsible decisions.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', ""     Workers' Party ""]}"

      Commentary: After an epic struggle with Higher Mother Tongue, maybe I will finally speak the language as an adult
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Even as working adults with school long behind us, my friends and I still commiserate about the sheer struggle that was Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL).\nThere were those who could pass each test with flying colours, by dint of growing up bilingual or having a natural affinity with languages.\nI was blessed with neither. Just to keep afloat, I needed daily remedial, weekly tuition, holiday classes, assessment books, mock papers and non-stop immersion in Channel 8 dramas and mandopop.\nEven now I still get nightmares about finding myself in exam halls staring down at a Chinese paper – and\xa0seeing only incomprehensible squiggles.\n\n\nTWEAKS TO THE SYSTEM\nWar stories like these might be par for the course – after all, HMTL is notoriously difficult and is meant for students who can handle the added workload.\nThis is probably why when a new Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring system kicked in this year, giving some the impression that it might be easier to take HMTL at the secondary school level, the Ministry of Education stressed there’s no change to the standards and assessment of PSLE.\n\n\nBut recent changes to HMTL curriculum, where children are being eased into HMTL earlier at a younger age, might help flatten the learning curve.\nWhile all schools offer Higher Mother Tongue at Primary 5, Higher Chinese Language is increasingly available to Primary 3 students. Starting next year, Higher Malay Language and Higher Tamil Language will be available to Primary 3 students as well.\nA TRANSACTIONAL MINDSET AROUND HMTL\nThese changes to encourage kids to take up languages at a challenging level reflect the larger shift in the education system towards imbuing a love for learning.\nBut sometimes mindsets can be the slowest to change. If today’s students are like me and my friends, taking HMTL may be less motivated by a love for languages but by practical benefits.\nStudents who pass Higher Chinese receive a posting advantage for admission into prestigious Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools.\nStudents who pass HMTL at O-Levels enjoy a two-point deduction from their aggregate scores, and the added perk of not having to take H1 MTL at A-Levels should they choose to go to Junior College.\nThese payoffs might be one factor behind the growing popularity of HMTL. At the 2018 O-Levels, 31 per cent of Chinese language students took Higher Chinese, up by 5 percentage points in the past decade. That figure was 34 per cent, up from 12 per cent for Higher Tamil and 14 per cent, up 2 percentage points, for Higher Malay.\n\n\nOne can argue that the advantages HMTL confers are well-deserved; a fair exchange for students’ blood, sweat and tears. Students also strengthen their mastery of the language by studying it at an advanced level. The hope is that this skill is something they can use well into their adult years.\nAt an Apr 16 event hosted by the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC), then Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran emphasised the importance of cultivating a lifelong love for mother tongue languages. He said the opportunity to study Higher Tamil in Primary 3 and 4 will help sharpen language proficiency and deepen understanding at a younger age.\nNo doubt the formalised system of HMTL helps achieved this. But if we chase after HMTL only because of the grades and bonus points, then what is left to motivate us to speak our mother tongue when there aren’t incentives to score?\n\n\nPART OF A PACKAGE DEAL\nAn unfortunate reality is that many students who took Higher Mother Tongue weren’t suited for the subject – including me. But we signed up anyway because HMTL was part of a package deal.\nTake my friend for example. She had good enough grades to get “promoted” to the top Secondary 2 class. She just had to enrol in Higher Chinese.\nLike many who take this route, the subject was an uphill battle for her. One day at class, their teacher pointedly remarked: “I don’t understand why some of you who are not up to standard insist on doing Higher Chinese.”\nMaybe she was right – after all, HMTL is meant to be studied by students with the right interest and aptitude. Yet we clung onto this quid-pro-quo system of HMTL, taking it only to reap its dividends after O-Levels, or to get coveted spots in classes and schools.\nA LIFELONG LOVE FOR MOTHER TONGUE\nIf we continue to harbour a utilitarian mindset around mother tongue, it’s no surprise when a student drops the language right after O-Levels. Most of us could hardly wait to wipe clean all the unpleasant memories associated with it.\nThat’s what many of my classmates did at junior college. With one subject in the bag, we spent afternoons hunkered down in the library doing homework or revising for other A-Level subjects, while the non-HMTL students toiled at H1 mother tongue class.\n\n\nThe need to cultivate that love for mother tongue is more urgent when more households are speaking English predominantly rather than their mother tongue.\nAccording to Singapore’s 2020 census, English has become the language most frequently spoken in households. 48.3 per cent of residents speak English at home, up from 32.3 per cent in 2010.\xa0\nMeanwhile, the proportion of residents who speak mother tongue languages at home has dwindled – 29.9 per cent of residents speak Mandarin; down from 35.6 per cent; 9.2 per cent speak Malay, down from 12.2 per cent; and 2.5 per cent speak Tamil, down from 3.3 per cent.\n\n\nI remember my last conversation with my Higher Chinese teacher, which took place as she handed me my HMTL O-Level certificate. I scraped by with a C6 – the minimum passing grade.\nShe smiled wryly at me, knowing the pain I (and probably she too) endured just to get to that point.\n“Promise me you’ll keep working,” she said. “Your journey with Chinese has only just begun.”\nI cried in relief at having passed my hardest subject in school. It’s no surprise I never kept my promise to my teacher to keep at it – because the journey hurt so much.\nBut now that I’m not tied to the pressure of gaining bonus points or admission into a good school, I can be free to embark on learning the language. Just for the sheer interest in it.\n(Listen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys\xa0in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:)\n\nErin Low is Research Writer for the Commentary section.

      Exclusive: Google drops engineering residency after protests over 'inequities'
  </h1>, 'text': 'REUTERS: Alphabet Inc\'s Google plans to shut down a long-running program aimed at entry-level engineers from underrepresented backgrounds after participants said it enforced ""systemic pay inequities,"" according to internal correspondence seen by Reuters.\nGoogle confirmed it was replacing the Engineering Residency with a new initiative, saying it is ""always evaluating programs to ensure they evolve and adapt over time to meet the needs of our employees.""\nGoogle last year pledged to improve retention for underrepresented employee groups.\nCritics have long argued that Google and its tech industry peers favor white, Asian and male workers in hiring, promotions and pay. Companies have grown more attuned to concerns about workforce diversity since the Black Lives Matter protests a year ago.\nThe Google residency, often referred to as ""Eng Res,"" has since 2014 given graduates from hundreds of schools a chance to work on different teams, receive training and prove themselves for a permanent job over the course of a year. It offered a cohort of peers for bonding, three former residents said.\nResidents were Google\'s ""most diverse pool"" of software engineers and came ""primarily from underrepresented groups,"" according to a June 2020 presentation and an accompanying letter to management that one source said over 500 current and former residents signed.\nCompared with other software engineers, residents received the lowest possible pay for their employment level, a smaller year-end bonus and no stock, creating a compensation deficit ""in the mid tens of thousands of dollars,"" the presentation said.\nNearly all residents converted to regular employees, according to the presentation. Many alumni years later have continued to feel the ""negative effect"" of their starting pay on their current salary, it said. Google said it worked to eliminate long-term disparities when hiring residents permanently.\nThe letter came after Google gave big donations https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/commitments-racial-equity to promote racial justice amid the global outcry over the police murder of George Floyd. Black, Latinx and female staff ""deserve more than just \'the opportunity to be at Google,\'"" the letter said.\n""Google is willing to invest large sums of money in issues of racial inequity outside of the workplace, but still seems unwilling to address or even acknowledge the role that the Eng Res program plays in enforcing systemic pay inequities,"" it said.\nVice President Maggie Johnson emailed alumni on June 2 saying Google would replace the residency with a new program it was devising for 2022, called Early Career Immersion (ECI). The message, seen by Reuters, did not explain reasons for the switch but said ECI would include mentoring and training.\nThe company said the program would provide permanent employment. Concerns about being offered a job made the engineering residency feel ""probationary,"" the Google employees\' presentation said.\nThe old program tried to provide ""a wide range of high potential engineers"" a chance to ""hone their skills and gain relevant experience as they start their careers,"" Google said in a statement. ""Our Early Career Immersion onboarding program will provide a new approach.""\nGoogle continues to run other fixed-term residencies, including 26-month roles working on internal technical systems and an 18-month program for artificial intelligence researchers. The company said it had no updates on the other residencies.\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin and Paresh Dave; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Gerry Doyle)\n', 'related_topics': ['     Google ', '     education ', '     program ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'HONG KONG: China is poised to unveil a much tougher than anticipated crackdown on the country\'s US$120 billion private tutoring industry, four sources told Reuters, including trial bans on vacation tutoring and restrictions on advertising.\nThe new rules, which aim both to ease pressure on school children and boost the country\'s birth rate by lowering family living costs, could be announced as early as next week and take effect next month, two of the people with knowledge of the plans said.\nThe imposition of a trial ban on both online and offline tutoring over the summer and winter holidays in Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities, cited by the sources, goes much further than the planned measures first reported by Reuters last month.\n""The new rules would be stricter than expected,"" said one of the sources, a person close to regulators drafting the new rules. ""The industry should be preparing for the worst.""\nThe trial vacation ban, which adds to plans to bar online and offline tutoring on weekends during term time, could deprive tutoring companies of as much as 70 to 80 per cent of their annual revenue, two of the sources said.\n\n\nThe changes being drafted by the Ministry of Education and other authorities target the cutthroat tutoring market for school students from kindergarten through to the 12th grade, or K-12 pupils, an industry that has grown rapidly in recent years.\nMore than 75 per cent of K-12 students - roughly aged from 6 to 18 - in China attended after-school tutoring classes in 2016, according to the most recent figures from the Chinese Society of Education, and anecdotal evidence suggests that percentage has risen.\nThe planned industry crackdown, which Reuters last month reported had already forced at least one major company providing tutoring services to put a billion-dollar fundraising round on ice, is being driven from the top, said three of the sources.\nPresident Xi Jinping last week said schools should be responsible for student learning, rather than tutoring companies.\n""The education departments are correcting this phenomenon,"" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.\nThe State Council Information Office and the Ministry of Education did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\nThe ban on vacation and weekend tutoring would be implemented in nine municipalities and provinces, including Beijing, Shanghai and Jiangsu, for twelve months before being rolled out across the country, one of the sources said.\n""While the rules are to be adopted on a trial basis, you would be surprised if other areas don\'t follow the lead and even launch tougher regulations to be politically correct,"" the source said.\nWeekday tutoring, which currently runs until 8-9pm, would be restricted in the trial areas, two of the sources said.\n""Excessive"" online and offline advertising, in particular in the mainstream media and public places, will be banned, said two of the sources, adding that tuition fees would be tightly controlled.\nAll four sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\nNew York-listed shares of Chinese private tutoring companies TAL Education Group, New Oriental Education & Technology Group and Gaotu Techedu Inc closed down 12.3 per cent, 17 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively on Wednesday.\n\'CHICKEN BABY\'\nAs incomes rise in China, well-off families are eager to see children succeed in an increasingly competitive society.\nCompetition is so fierce it has given rise to a popular term in parenting circles. Jiwa, or ""chicken baby"", refers to anxious parents pumping energy boosting ""chicken blood"" into their children by loading them up with extracurricular classes.\nAs well as protecting stressed students, Beijing sees the changes as a financial incentive for couples to have more children as it seeks to shore up a rapidly declining birth rate, the sources said.\nThe cost of raising a child in urban China, with education accounting for a big chunk of that, has deterred many would-be parents.\nThe cost for an ordinary family to raise a child surged from the 490,000 yuan (US$76,600) cited in a 2005 state think-tank report to nearly 2 million yuan last year, according to local media.\nChina\'s population grew over the 10 years to 2020 at the slowest pace in decades, the country\'s latest census showed last month, raising fears its dwindling workforce will be unable to support an increasingly elderly population.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Beijing ', '     China ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Reopening schools should be an urgent priority, as online learning is no substitute
  </h1>, 'text': ""MANILA: With the COVID-19 pandemic now well into its second year, safely reopening schools has become an urgent priority.\nSchool attendance is critical for children’s education and lifetime prospects. The long-term costs of closures – both for individual children and society – are simply too large to justify on a continuing basis.\nEvidence since the start of the pandemic shows that COVID-19 does not pose a high risk to children, and that schools are not drivers of transmission within the surrounding community.\nWe have also amassed a large body of knowledge about how to reduce the risks to children, teachers and their families. Using this knowledge, we all need to urgently work toward reopening schools safely to protect our children’s future.\n\n\nIMPACT OF PROLONGED SCHOOL CLOSURES\nProlonged school closures have a significant impact not just on children’s skills attainment and earning prospects, but also on their physical and mental health.\nWhile online education can guarantee some continuity of learning for some children, these services are no substitute for in-person attendance.\nMoreover, access to online learning remains woefully uneven, with disadvantaged children – including those with disabilities, those affected by migration and excluded minorities – bearing the brunt of the shortcomings of digital education.\nThe evidence shows increases in anxiety, depression and self-harm among school-aged children since the start of the pandemic.\nChildren who are not in the classroom also experience increased loneliness, difficulty concentrating, and high levels of learning anxiety. These problems will only grow worse the longer schools remain closed.\nSchool closures have also led to reduced physical activity, poor eating habits and disrupted sleep patterns. For some children, more time at home has increased the risk of domestic violence, just as more screen time has exacerbated the risks of online harm.\nAnd with schools closed, a critical avenue for identifying and reporting abuse and mental-health issues has been closed off.\nIn nearly half the countries in developing Asia, schools have been closed for more than 200 days during the pandemic.\nThe region should prepare for a reduction in the expected gains in reading and math skills for children in both preschool and primary school, as well as a wider achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their peers.\n\n\nThe Asian Development Bank warns that the learning losses caused by prolonged school closures will significantly reduce the future productivity and lifetime earnings of affected students in the region. It estimates the present value of these losses to be US$1.25\xa0trillion – 5.4 per cent of the region’s 2020 GDP.\nAchieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for education was already going to be challenging enough before the pandemic. Now, UNICEF and UNESCO estimate that education budgets in the region will need to increase by at least 7 per cent to stay within striking distance of those targets.\n\n\nSCHOOLS LIKELY NOT HIGH-RISK SETTINGS FOR TRANSMISSION\nDespite the obvious costs of school closures, many countries are still reluctant to reopen, citing fears of further transmission. But our focus now should be on using what we know about COVID-19 and children to work towards the safe reopening of schools.\nGlobally, children account for a very small proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Children of primary-school age and younger are among the least likely cohorts to be infected.\nEven when they do contract COVID-19, they tend to have milder symptoms than adults (which is why they have not contributed significantly to the proportion of hospitalised cases or reported deaths). And a study of children from the Republic of Korea shows that infected children are less likely to spread the virus.\nIn short, primary schools, preschools, and early childhood development (ECD) centres are not high-risk settings for transmission, especially if the right safety measures are followed. Transmission levels in these settings have been found to reflect those of the surrounding community.\nThe one possible exception is secondary schools (high schools), which have accounted for a higher number of outbreaks than primary schools. Because adolescents appear to transmit the virus much like adults, partial closures for secondary schools should remain an option, but only as a last resort and for limited periods where community transmission is surging.\nWhen schools are forced to close temporarily, this must be done in conjunction with other community-level public-health and social measures.\nBut overall, the evidence overwhelmingly points to the need for schools, especially preschools and primary schools, to be reopened. The same applies for ECD centres.\n\n\nREOPENING SCHOOLS SAFELY\nThere is no such thing as zero risk. But the risks are manageable with robust mitigation strategies.\nThe World Health Organization’s guidance on operating schools during the pandemic includes several measures to reduce COVID-19 exposure and transmission. These include personal hygiene practices, proper mask use, physical distancing, adequate ventilation, and regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces.\nClear and consistent communication with parents and children to ensure compliance both in the classroom and during after-school activities is equally important.\nPolicymakers must also consider the local context for resuming in-school learning, including factors such as the level of community transmission and the capacity to respond to an increase in infections.\nIn some places, health and education services will need additional resources to implement the necessary safety measures.\nMaintaining vigilance and adherence to all of these measures is critical – not only for schools, but also for our broader efforts to contain COVID-19, including the development and spread of virus variants and mutations.\nThe good news is that school reopenings are not dependent on the availability of vaccines. We need to work toward a sustainable “new normal” right now.\nWhile the relatively low risks of children being in school are easily managed, the consequences of keeping them out of their classrooms are grave and far-reaching. It is time for the school gates to reopen.\nListen to two parents share their front-row experience to their kids' educational journey of home-based learning during the circuit breaker\xa0on CNA's\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\nTakeshi Kasai is World Health Organization Regional Director for the Western Pacific.

      Commentary: Raising bilingual children is challenging but immensely rewarding
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Parents in Singapore often report significant stress when raising children to speak their mother tongue.\nIn spite of their best efforts, even at a very young age, children can simply refuse to speak in the mother tongue. This can cause family strain and even disharmony around bilingualism.\nEven though parents value the ideals of bilingualism, in practice, raising multilingual children can be challenging.\n\n\nThis is not limited to Singapore. Annick de Houwer, a linguistics professor in Germany, has written extensively of “harmonious bilingualism”.\nNoting parents might feel shame when their children resist speaking their mother tongue, or that children’s resistance towards the mother tongue can cause internal family conflict, Professor de Houwer is a strong and powerful advocate for cultivating positive attitudes towards bilingualism within the family.\nBut for many parents in Singapore, mother tongue learning has become the stuff of classrooms deeply intertwined with academic success. As a result, children too can associate the mother tongue primarily with homework, exams, and rote learning, causing stress.\n\n\nGENUINELY HARD TO RAISE BILINGUAL CHILDREN\nRaising bilingual children is genuinely hard. Unfortunately, it often becomes harder as children get older.\nAll over the world, there is evidence that children gravitate towards the language of their peers and larger community as they mature.\nFor many in Singapore, that language is English. As our children grow, they experience a strong desire to socially conform to their environment.\nFor example, children start speaking like their peers in terms of accent and colloquialism, shedding the home accent in favour of the accent used amongst their friends.\nIn a similar way, speaking the language that prevails in the larger community can become a powerful force. For many students, English is also the language of popular culture and entertainment choices, which gives it a great deal of social appeal.\n\n\nEven children who have strong mother tongue proficiency in early childhood, after a few years of primary school in English, can become dominant users of English over the mother tongue.\nChildren’s views of their mother tongue can turn from positive to negative within a few short years. For this reason, igniting children’s motivation to speak their mother tongue can be a significant challenge.\nCULTIVATING POSTIVITY AROUND MOTHER TONGUE\nSo, what can we do? First, we can introduce our children to environments where the use of the mother tongue is relevant and useful to children in their own eyes.\nIn my experience as a bilingualism researcher and as a parent of bilingual children, I have noticed that as adults, we often cite specific reasons for why we want our children to know their mother tongue that are important to us as parents.\nWe often think about how helpful their mother tongue will be in their adult lives, for their academic test scores and later success, and other real-world factors that don’t always appeal to children.\nInstead, thinking about reasons that might resonate with a child may be more effective. What opportunities will children feel they will miss out on if they do not know their mother tongue? Are those opportunities of personal value to the child?\n\n\nStudies have shown that children who see the language as relevant to their personal goals learn it more readily and with greater motivation than those for whom mother tongue use is limited to the classroom.\nA special connection with a warm and caring mother tongue teacher, an affinity for songs or games associated with one’s culture and language, or a special bond with a grandparent who speaks the mother tongue can engage children in their heritage language.\nIt’s worth remembering that for each child, the touchpoint with the mother tongue is different. As with most things, young children’s preferences can be highly idiosyncratic.\nLearning about what makes your own child tick with regards to the mother tongue and building off that connection with the language can help a child break through motivational barriers.\nPERSISTENCE IS KEY\nOne of the most common complaints I hear from parents is that their child has stopped talking to them in the mother tongue and only wants to communicate in English.\n\n\nThis is very common: Many children go through a phase where they resist or altogether refuse responding in the mother tongue, even if they can understand what is being said.\nWhen faced with these challenges, it is easy to default back to English. But persistence is key.\nWithout creating negativity and tension, families should continue to speak in their mother tongue to children to provide continued exposure and gradually build children’s willingness to engage in conversation.\nIn general, children who speak (and not just understand) the mother tongue fare better with bilingualism than those who only understand. Parents should encourage and motivate children to use the mother tongue, all the while accepting that this may be a long and gradual process.\n\n\nTo help with mother tongue learning, bilingualism researchers have often argued for setting up individualised goals.\nIs your main goal for your child to get a high PSLE score, for your child to eventually live in the country where the mother tongue is dominant, to keep contact with extended family, for your children to pass the language onto their children, or some combination of factors?\nRecognising and acknowledging these goals can help families to direct their efforts and resources to the kind of bilingualism they aspire to. In thinking of ways to realise these goals, developing strategies to foster the child’s personal interest is very beneficial to mother tongue learning.\nBUILDING A PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH MOTHER TONGUE\nFinally, it can cause stress for some bilingual families when their children aspire to drop the mother tongue at the first opportunity – particularly if it has been a source of intense academic stress or if the child feels disinclined towards learning additional languages.\nI often poll my students on their relationship with their mother tongue. Those for whom the mother tongue serves as a social or family connector often express more fondness and motivation for the mother tongue than those whose mother tongue experience has been purely academic.\nBuilding a personal connection with the mother tongue, outside of the classroom, can go a long way towards encouraging its use.\n\n\nEven for parents whose children have dropped the mother tongue, they can take some comfort in research that suggests children who learnt a second language earlier in life find it easier to pick it back up as adults, even when they have little or no memory of it. Languages encountered early in life hold a special and dedicated place in our mind and aren’t easy to erase.\nThere is no doubt that raising multilingual children can be challenging for many families. It is most certainly a marathon, not a sprint.\nBut the rewards can be immense. Knowing our mother tongue can bring great joy and fulfillment, as well as valuable connections to our extended family, personal history, and culture.\nLeher Singh is Associate Professor and Director of Research at the Department of Psychology, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, National University of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     school ', '     Parenting ']}"

Daily COVID-19\xa0cases have breached the\xa09,000-mark twice, while daily\xa0fatalities reached 126 on Jun 2, the highest since the start of the pandemic.\xa0\nThe latest school closure hinted at yet another year of disrupted education, after 2020’s schooling year was upended by the COVID-19 pandemic\xa0which saw schools opening for face-to-face learning for just about five to six months.\nStudents in Malaysia had returned to schools in phases\xa0this year,\xa0beginning with pre-schoolers as well as Primary 1 and Primary 2 students on Mar 1.\xa0\nHowever, there have since been\xa0reports of positive cases being detected in educational institutions and affected schools or classes were ordered to close for two days.\xa0\nSchools in localities that have been put under enhanced movement control order (EMCO) due to a high number of cases were also mandated to close, further reducing the days of in-person schooling.\xa0\nThe same challenges from last year\'s prolonged school closure resurfaced, including students\' access to the Internet and efficiency of home-based\xa0learning.\xa0Parents are understandably worried about their kids\' academic progress,\xa0not to mention the\xa0lack of social interaction and outdoor activities.\xa0\nWith the enforcement of a total lockdown beginning Jun 1,\xa0the daycare centre and pre-school which Mdm Teng usually sends her children to have to close as well.\xa0\n“We’re feeling mostly frustrated\xa0and worried, because it feels like we just can’t win.\xa0The schools reopened not too long ago and then they’re closed again,” she said.\xa0\n\n\nACADEMIC TOLL AND PRESSURE ON PARENTS\nLike other parents CNA interviewed, Mdm Nasreen Hani, an engineer, was worried about her daughter\'s progress. She had earlier pulled her eight-year-old daughter out of physical schooling in April because\xa0a positive case was detected in a class next to her\xa0daughter’s.\xa0\n“She’s in Primary\xa02, but she has yet to master the basics for some subjects, including Bahasa Melayu. She’s also taking Bahasa Arab at school, and we don’t speak or understand the language at home.”\n“Can you imagine how parents like me are supposed to help them with their homework? Our teaching method is also different from actual educators. I worry that I’d confuse my kid more than helping her,” she lamented.\nSabahan Leslie Ikon noted that his three nieces, aged 7, 10 and 12,\xa0have been affected by school closure, with the lack of stable Internet connection compounding the problem.\xa0\nAt one point, there was no Internet connection for a few weeks in March and April in\xa0Telupid, where he and his extended family are living.\xa0\n“They can’t read properly or construct proper sentences on paper.\n“This makes me worried when my eldest son enters primary school next year, because he’s already not the top student in (his pre-school)\xa0class even though his mum is the teacher,” he said, adding that his son also has speech problems.\xa0\nMs Nasreen said the shutdown was definitely taking a toll on her mental and emotional health.\n“As a working mum who also has a business on the side, it feels almost impossible to cope with my daughter’s distance learning activities,” she said.\nSCHOOL CLOSURE RESULTS IN LEARNING LOSS\nWhile there was no study at present\xa0in Malaysia to identify the amount of lost time students experienced as a result of school closure,\xa0education expert Melissa Tanya Gomes said they could be experiencing\xa0one year or more immediate learning loss, an estimation based on a World Bank study.\xa0\nMs Gomes, who runs\xa0Edvolution Enterprise, an education non-profit social enterprise,\xa0said the June 2020 study\xa0concluded that\xa0five months of school closures due to COVID-19 would result in an immediate 0.6 years of schooling.\n""During MCO 1.0, schools were closed for four months (from mid-March to June 2020), and closed again for another three months (until schools reopened in March or April this year),\xa0a total of seven months.\xa0\n""This means, Malaysian students are experiencing nearly one\xa0year or more of immediate learning loss,"" she\xa0told CNA.\xa0\nMs Gomes also pointed out that when schools reopened on Jun 24 last year, a majority of students did not report back to their schools.\xa0\nIn October, the minister had announced that Malaysia\'s average school attendance was at 85 per cent, meaning the remaining 15 percent of students, approximately 705,000 nationwide, were absent from school.\nThe issue has surfaced again\xa0one week into home-based learning in May, she noted.\xa0\n""This unending predicament will compound the current learning loss in students,"" she said.\xa0\nTicking off a list of issues from Internet connectivity and\xa0affordable learning gadgets to\xa0teachers’ competency and educational materials, Mr Mak Chee Kin, who heads the Melaka Action Group for Parents in Education (MAGPIE), said the renewed school closure revealed that the government has not prepared the schools for digitalisation.\xa0\nThe 150,000 laptops promised in Malaysia\'s 2021 budget\xa0to enable schoolchildren to carry out home-based learning have yet to be fully disbursed, he pointed out.\xa0\n“Regretfully, even this has yet to be fulfilled. If the government can’t provide the budget for all, we propose that any community halls or rooms in public flats, or even the rural or district libraries, be converted into computer resource centres.”\n“At least they would help some children who are serious about their studies,” Mr Mak said.\n\n\nFOCUS ON MASTERING BASIC CONTENT: MINISTER\nIn the Sunday press conference, Dr Mohd Radzi, the education minister, explained that the ministry had realigned the curriculum last year and divided the content into three main components - basic, additional and complementary.\xa0\nTeachers would give emphasis on completing the basic content, he said.\xa0\n""Upon ensuring that students have mastered the basic content, teachers will then move on to the additional content and then complementary content, if time permits,"" the minister said.\xa0\nThe education television service “Didik TV” would also continue with 15 hours of broadcasting a day for students facing connectivity problem, Dr Mohd Radzi said. The slot for education programme\xa0would also proceed on RTM’s TV Okey for two hours and Astro Tutor TV for four hours every day.\nAs for the 150,000 laptops under the\xa0Cerdik Initiative,\xa0a joint effort between the finance and education ministries, the minister said\xa012,887 laptops had been distributed to B40 (bottom 40 per cent of income distribution) students in 95 schools nationwide.\xa0\nAnother 40,290 devices were expected to be distributed latest by Jun 12, and the remaining 96,823 would\xa0be fully distributed by the end of September.\xa0\nThe minister added that the ministry would continue to support students and\xa0teachers through counselling.\xa0\nStudents would be able to receive counselling if they were facing difficulties with their schooling experience. The same applied to the teachers, he added.\xa0\nFurther training and courses for teachers would also be increased, especially in the context of home-based learning and teaching skills such as mastering information and communication technology (ICT) and digitalisation, the minister said.\xa0\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ']}"

      Classroom in a box: How two Singaporeans hope to help less-privileged children 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Access to education, especially at a young age, can have a huge impact on one’s life but with livelihoods thwarted and schools having to be closed intermittently, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted this for many around the world.\xa0\nIn Singapore, not everyone gets a conducive environment to study outside of a school setting, especially those from low-income, vulnerable families, said Ang Yu Qian and Kloe Ng. They are founders of an education start-up who believe they can help.\nTheir idea: A briefcase-sized cardboard box that can be unpacked easily to form a light but sturdy table and stool.\nDesigned with children aged four to seven in mind, each cardboard table stands at about 56cm tall and has a surface measuring 65cm by 46cm. The stool, at about 31 cm tall, is\xa0also made of cardboard.\nThis hopes to provide those from less-privileged backgrounds with a versatile and age-appropriate set-up, as they tend to do their studying\xa0on the floor, dining tables or beds due to resource and space constraints, said Mr Ang.\nWhen not in use, the table legs and stool can be easily unassembled and packed into the box, making it easy to be stored. There is also sufficient space to pack in stationery and books.\n“What we have in mind is when you open the box, you will have everything you need,” the 34-year-old told CNA.\nSince the start of the year, the two Singaporeans, who are based in the US, have partnered several welfare organisations such as the Singapore Children’s Society, Shine Children and Youth Services, as well as Boon Lay Youth Network, to identify those in need. More than 50 sets have been given out for free.\nWorking with these organisations have helped them to understand real demands on the ground.\nFor instance, some of the sets had to be laminated to better serve children with special needs. “We were also told that our stools don’t have a backrest so the children were rocking the stools and find it difficult to sit still,” said Mr Ang. “That was something we did not think about.”\n\n\nA handle to the box was also subsequently added, alongside a whiteboard to the table top.\xa0Different stationery and learning materials were included based on the needs of the beneficiaries.\n“One of the organisations told us that with COVID-19, maybe it’s better to have a table top that is easy to wipe down and can hold up to repeated cleaning. The kids also wanted a writing surface so we added a whiteboard,” he said.\nBoon Lay Youth Network, a youth volunteer group under the People’s Association Youth Movement, has distributed 15 of these cardboard sets to participants of its kidsREAD programme since February.\nThe hope is that this will encourage the children aged four to six and living in nearby rental blocks, to keep reading outside of the bi-monthly reading sessions, said one of the volunteers Chia Zhao Wei.\n“If you want a child to focus on reading or studying, it is good to give them their own space which can be as basic as a table. But for many of our low-income families living in rental flats, they don’t have much space so there isn’t much furniture or what they have may not be kids-friendly.\n“So we feel something that is compactable is useful in this situation. By giving the children their own tables, we also hope it will help to inculcate a sense of ownership,” he added.\nSo far, the cardboard sets have been well-received by the young beneficiaries.\n“The kids got very excited when they saw the tables. The measurements are of the right height and size for them,” said Mr Chia. “Based on our follow-up visits, they are still enjoying and using it, especially the whiteboards.”\nApart from welfare and self-help groups, a few dozens of the cardboard sets were also distributed to returning Singaporean families who had to serve their quarantine orders or stay-home notices at hotels.\xa0\nAltogether, about 80 sets have been given out.\nTHINKING OUT OF THE BOX\nBut a cardboard set wasn’t what Mr Ang and Ms Ng had in mind initially.\nInstead, they had wanted to distribute a product they were working on for the past three years as part of their start-up, Out of the Box.\nDubbed “a mobile classroom in a box”, it is a wooden and plastic box fitted with wheels and packed with an easy-to-assemble study table and chair, alongside other learning materials.\nThe plan was to give this to as many as 100 low-income households in Singapore to help them with home-based learning needs amid the pandemic. They had pitched this idea to an innovation challenge organised by the National University of Singapore (NUS) and was awarded a S$50,000 grant after being named one of the winning teams in November last year.\n“But we met with some challenges,” recalled Mr Ang. “First, a high manufacturing cost which means we will be reaching out to a lot less children. Second, the duration to manufacture is also longer.”\nSo the duo had to improvise.\nThey quickly settled on cardboard as an alternative and found home-grown firm Tri-Wall Asia, which was able to supply the cardboard and manufacture quickly.\nWhile tweaks had to be made, the two Singaporeans said they are heartened by the feedback so far.\n“We started working on this and Out of the Box because we wanted to address issues with accessibility and affordability to pre-school education, especially in developing countries,” said Ms Ng. “We think this new cardboard version will be useful when we go into these places.”\n\n\nThe idea of “a mobile classroom in a box” first took shape in 2013 when the pair started their first venture – an enrichment business focusing on STEM, otherwise known as science, technology, engineering and mathematics, classes.\nThen, the final-year students at the NUS School of Design and Environment held their classes at different community centres. Logistics soon became a headache with the amount of teaching materials needed.\n“Let’s say for a science class on chromatography, you’ll need containers, food colouring, droppers, filter papers, scissors and other things to add to the experience like lab coats, safety goggles and magnifying glass. With 20 kids in the class, it really adds up so we’d be lugging a luggage around,” recalled Ms Ng.\n“That was when Yu Qian... starting having an idea of a mobile classroom – a box where you can bring it everywhere, open it and be ready for class,” she added.\n“He had some sketches and we thought it was a great idea. But we didn’t act on it.”\nIt was only five years later when they moved to the United States to further their studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that this idea resurfaced. Mr Ang is currently pursuing a PhD in Architecture (Building Technology) while Ms Ng is studying a Master’s in Urban Studies and Planning at MIT.\n“Kloe saw a call for ideas by the World Bank in 2018 for their Youth Summit focusing on education. She thought my old sketches could be relevant and so we submitted it,” said Mr Ang.\nThe “mobile classroom in a box” went on to bag the audience’s award at the summit that year.\nThis motivated them to put the idea to work. Since then, they have wowed more judges and was selected to be part of the MITdesignX, a programme at the MIT School of Architecture and Planning dedicated to design innovation and entrepreneurship.\nAsked what drives their passion in early childhood education despite their studies in completely unrelated fields, Mr Ang said he was partly inspired by his mother, a pre-school teacher, who brought him along to her classes when he was young.\n“I’ll sit there and look on while she teaches. Slowly, I got more personally interested in early childhood education because it can make a lot of difference,” he said.\nBoth of them also went on several overseas volunteering trips, which opened their eyes to the hardships of children in other parts of the world.\nFUTURE PLANS\nThis is why making their product available in developing countries is a key goal for Mr Ang and Ms Ng.\nThey continue to test ideas, such as a “solar sticker” that absorbs light in the day and can become a light source at night.\n“From our volunteering trips, we know children in these countries can’t study at night because there are no light sources. So this is a really important issue to solve,” said Ms Ng.\nCOVID-19 has also made significant disruptions to education, with the problem likely more acute in developing countries where basic infrastructure is already lacking, added Mr Ang.\n\n\nThe two Singaporeans are also working on an artificial intelligence-based software which will work hand-in-hand with the physical mobile classrooms.\n“Apart from the hardware, which is the mobile classroom, we will deliver the curriculum or learning content with an online software. That will essentially allow children to learn properly and effectively wherever they are in the world,” he said.\nFor now, 10 learning activities created by the pair are available for free on the start-up’s website. Recipients of the cardboard sets can also access these materials by scanning a QR code on an instruction sheet.\n“This will be like a Coursera for kids,” said Mr Ang, referring to the US-based open online course provider. “The medium-term plan is to make the software artificial intelligence-based. It will capture how the children are learning and automatically recommends what and how they can learn better.”\nUltimately, the start-up wants to be self-sufficient with its\xa0“mobile classroom in a box” soon be available for sale.\n“The plan is to build a sustainable start-up where we sell our consumer versions and then use this money to fund the distribution projects we want to do,” said Mr Ang.\nFor now, they still have remaining funds to give out more than 100 cardboard sets in Singapore and urge those in need to reach out to them.\nWhile they are based in the United States, Mr Ang and Ms Ng have roped in a friend to help them with all local requests and deployment.\n“We definitely want and are able to deploy more of our cardboard versions,” said Mr Ang. “So do reach out to us and we will work something out.”\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      Measures tightened to ensure people are not given wrong COVID-19 vaccine: Chan Chun Sing
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Measures have been tightened to ensure that people are not given the wrong COVID-19 vaccine, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Friday (Jun 4).\nThis comes after a first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was wrongly administered to a 16-year-old student\xa0on Thursday at Kolam Ayer Community Club vaccination centre.\xa0The vaccine is currently authorised for use in Singapore for those aged 18 and above.\xa0\nThe student\'s date of birth was ""erroneously entered"" when he was booking\xa0an appointment, and it\xa0resulted in his age being incorrectly registered as above 18 years old,\xa0said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Education (MOE) in a joint statement early Friday morning.\nThe ministries added that vaccination centre staff members had failed to verify his age during registration.\n\n\n""Since yesterday\xa0we\'ve done a thorough debrief with the MOH team, and they have tightened up the measures to make sure that this mistake of not thoroughly verifying before the vaccination is not repeated,” said Mr Chan on Friday afternoon.\nStaff members from MOH\xa0will also look at the registration process to see how chances of a wrong entry can be minimised, he added.\xa0\n“But having said that, the final\xa0layer of checks must be on the ground, whereby prior to the vaccination, the staff will check and verify the IC number, the allergies, the age profile of the person coming in for the vaccination. So we\'ve also issued instructions, particularly to all the centres offering Moderna,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“It is less of an issue for the centres offering Pfizer because Pfizer is given to be used for all age groups. But for Moderna, thus far we have not gotten the HSA (Health Sciences Authority) approval for that.""\n\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been\xa0approved for use in Singapore for children aged 12 to 15. Students below 18 years old will only be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, while people aged 18 and above can opt for either the\xa0Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.\xa0\n“We want to make sure that all the Moderna centres put in an extra layer of checks to make sure that whoever goes to the Moderna centres is eligible for the Moderna vaccine,"" Mr Chan added.\nThe error in giving the 16-year-old student\xa0the Moderna vaccine was discovered during the post-vaccination\xa0observation period when vaccination centre staff members identified that the boy was under 18.\xa0\nHe was placed under a longer observation time of 50 minutes as an additional precaution and ""remains generally well"", said the ministries early Friday morning.\nThe boy’s parents are “calm”, and the ministries are working with his family to support them and are making\xa0sure ""the health and well-being of the child is well taken care of”, said Mr Chan on Friday.\n\n\nVACCINATION REGISTRATION NUMBERS\nThe response rate to the invitations to register for vaccinations has been\xa0“very positive”, said the Education Minister. Mr Chan was speaking to reporters at ITE College Central, one of the four dedicated vaccination centres for\xa0the student vaccination exercise.\xa0\nStudents in graduating cohorts - those taking their GCE N- O- or A-Level exams this year, were among the first to receive their invitations. More than five in six of such students have already registered for vaccinations, said Mr Chan.\nRegistration for vaccinations has also been opened up to polytechnic students and other pre-university students, he added. This comprises JC 1 students and non-graduating cohorts of Millennia Institute.\xa0\nOf this batch, more than three in four of these students have already registered for vaccinations, said Mr Chan.\xa0\n\n\nA third tranche of invitations to register for vaccinations has\xa0also sent out\xa0to students from Secondary 1 to Secondary 3, as well as\xa0Primary 6 students who are 12 years old,\xa0he added.\xa0\n“We are very encouraged by the response rate so far,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\nThe MOE vaccination centre at ITE College Central will be operational from Monday, while the three other dedicated vaccination centres\xa0at ITE College West, ITE College East and Raffles City Convention Centre will start operations in the coming weeks, said Mr Chan.\xa0\nAll four centres will offer only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, he added.\xa0\nThe vaccination exercise for students is expected to be completed by August, the Education Ministry said on May 31, when it announced the exercise.\nResponding to a question about whether measures in schools, such as wearing masks,\xa0may be relaxed after the vaccination exercise, Mr Chan said: “I think we take that from the prevailing protocols that MOH will advise (on).""\xa0\n“There are a lot of safe management measures that we must emphasise, that we must continue to adhere to, notwithstanding the vaccination rate. We must never ever be complacent,"" he added.\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     health ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      COVID-19 vaccinations for Singapore students aged 12 and above begin
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When Secondary 4 student Salwa Taib Ali first heard about the COVID-19 vaccination exercise for students aged 12 and above, she immediately told her parents that she would like to sign up for it.\n“I was really excited because I would be able to play my part in ensuring that the COVID-19 situation in Singapore does not ... deteriorate,” she told CNA.\xa0\nThe Ngee Ann Secondary School student\xa0was among the first students aged\xa012 and above\xa0to receive a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday (Jun 3). Bookings for vaccination slots opened on Tuesday.\n“I was also really happy, especially because I’m taking my O-Levels this year. I was pretty stressed out because I was really scared I would contract COVID-19, or any of my friends or peers would contract COVID-19,” said 15-year-old Salwa.\xa0\n“So when the vaccination (exercise) was announced, and students were allowed to take it, I was really excited and the first thing I did was to tell my parents to book me for the first slot available.”\xa0\xa0\n\n\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on May 31 that more than 400,000 students would be progressively invited to register for vaccinations\xa0from Jun 1, after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved in May by the Health Sciences Authority for those aged 12 to 15 years.\xa0\nThe invites were first sent out to students or parents of students in graduating cohorts from secondary schools and at pre-university levels, or students sitting for the GCE N-, O- or A-Level examinations later this year.\xa0\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday evening, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said more than\xa09,000 students have ""booked appointments to receive the first dose of vaccination against COVID-19 today"". \xa0\n""I am heartened by the positive response that we have received thus far, and the high sign-up rate. As we battle the evolving challenges from the pandemic, vaccination remains the best way to keep our students and children safe,"" he said, adding that eligible students will be notified via SMS invitations until Jun 13.\nMr Chan also urged parents to sign their child up for vaccination when they receive the invite.\nSecondary 5 student Philicia Geow was\xa0one of those who received an invite to register for vaccination.\n“Being in the graduating cohort this year, we’re doing our national exams soon, and\xa0being able to have the priority\xa0this time\xa0instead of having to get our vaccinations during our national exams\xa0is something that I’m pretty grateful for,” said Philicia.\nThe CHIJ Katong Convent student\xa0has three siblings, two of whom are also in the age range to receive jabs as part of the vaccination exercise for students. Philicia will receive her first dose\xa0on Monday at a community centre near her home.\xa0\n“I’m looking forward to, hopefully, the restrictions getting more lenient ...\xa0I feel like this vaccination is a big milestone for not only our country but for the whole world as well,” she said.\xa0\n“I\'m really looking forward to the entire world, or even just our country, being able to overcome this challenge of the pandemic, because I\'m really looking forward to being able to just go out without wearing a mask and being able to meet people again.”\xa0\n""REALLY FAST, PROMPT AND EASY""\nSpeaking to CNA hours after receiving her jab, Salwa said the injection went “way better than expected”, and that the process was “really fast, prompt and easy”. She did\xa0not experience\xa0any side effects shortly after the jab.\nAdding that she is looking forward to returning to school for face-to-face classes when more students are vaccinated, she said: “With the increasing number of people taking vaccines, I hope that (we can have) more face-to-face lessons, which will also help.”\xa0\nShe also hopes to resume PE classes and other mass school activities, which had to be cancelled due to the rising number of COVID-19 community cases.\xa0\n“Many of these are things that my friends and I like to do together. So I hope that with the increased number of students and my friends taking the vaccine, I hope that we’ll be able to resume these activities once again.”\xa0\nOver the next two weeks, the remaining full-time students in schools and institutes of higher learning will receive invitations to register for vaccinations, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nThese\xa0include\xa0privately-funded schools, madrasahs and special education schools, said MOE on May 31.\xa0Privately-funded schools comprise Anglo-Chinese School (International), St\xa0Joseph\'s Institution International High School and Hwa Chong International School.\xa0\nStudents who are enrolled in private education institutions, such as\xa0international schools, can register as part of the national vaccination exercise, which is separate from the one for students, said MOE in response to CNA queries. Children who are home schooled can also register as part of the national vaccination exercise.\n“If supplies continue to arrive as scheduled, the national vaccination exercise will be rolled out to the rest of the age-eligible population by mid-June 2021, starting with Singapore citizens,"" added the Education Ministry.\n\n\nStudents below\xa018 years old will only be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, while those aged 18 and above can opt for either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. The interval between the first and second dose will be six to eight weeks.\xa0\nThe Education Ministry said it has conducted two webinars to address parents’ concerns and queries about the safety of the vaccines.\n“Our schools will also work closely with parents to encourage students and their parents to sign-up for the vaccination. Parents should also consult their family doctors if they have questions pertaining to the suitability of the vaccination for their children,” the ministry added.\nEligible students can get vaccinated at community vaccination centres. There will also be four dedicated MOE vaccination centres set up at Raffles City Convention Centre, ITE College Central, ITE College East and ITE College West, said MOE.\xa0\nEach ITE centre will have up to 1,600 vaccination slots per day, which is\xa0""comparable"" to the number of slots at\xa0community vaccination centres, while Raffles Convention Centre will have up\xa0to 2,000 slots per day, the ministry added.\nThe vaccination exercise for students is expected to be completed by August, MOE said on May 31.\nHearing that students her age would be able to register to get vaccinated was a “pleasant surprise”, said Secondary 4 student Julia Ho, adding that she had expected those in her age group to be among the last to get vaccinated.\nSeeing the increasing number of COVID-19 infections involving\xa0students\xa0over the past few weeks was “slightly worrying”, said\xa0the Nanyang Girls’ High School student. She will be getting her first dose of the\xa0vaccine on Monday.\xa0\n“The first thought that really came to me at that point in time was that if the majority of us in schools get vaccinated, then I think it would definitely create a much safer environment for all of us ...\xa0where we can learn in peace without having to worry as\xa0much about the virus spreading among us in schools,” she said.\n“I think it really brings this sense of hope that we can resume to what school was like two years ago – where we could have things such as mass assemblies, mass celebrations like Chinese New Year celebrations or Teachers’ Day in person as a school –\xa0which I think really adds that human touch to the school experience.”\xa0\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Surviving home-based learning in the long haul may require parents to dial back on kiasuism
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The irony that the recent spate of COVID-19 infections surrounding school children began from one tuition centre is not lost on parents.\nThe spread of the virus from centre to school testifies to the interconnectedness of the enrichment centre scene and our children. Several schools were affected, including the two schools my children attend.\nSingapore’s tuition culture – a hefty S$1.4 billion industry – is deeply rooted in the\xa0education system that we’ve established. It is not only the go-to for struggling students, but is often deemed a necessary and legitimate out-of-school activity for well-performing ones.\nJust a few nights ago, a friend was bemoaning the fact that her child, having missed his goal for his Math exam paper by one mark, had bugged her to sign him up for Math tuition.\nThis goes to show how deeply entrenched tuition culture is – and the buck doesn’t just stop at parents.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nBut as the situation calls for us to pay greater attention to our children’s health and emotional well-being, will we take a collective step back and focus less on achievement?\nOr would it be more of the same (tuition) game, just over a different medium?\nTHE BALANCE BETWEEN CARING TOO MUCH AND TOO LITTLE\nLet’s face it: Pandemic parenting is hard. Especially now that we’re in the middle of a full-blown battle with the new COVID-19 variant.\nCoupled with an increase in work-related or relationship stresses, HBL and extreme forms of kiasuism might prove an explosive mix.\xa0\nI’m referring to certain parenting traits that might undermine a child’s sense of self-esteem, such as being overly critical of their weaknesses, and being over-controlling.\nWhen we glance over at our child’s work and spot a glaring mistake, is our first instinct to yell or to scold?\nWhen the child comes to us with a question, do we respond in irritation: “So simple, how come you don’t know?”\nIn zeroing in on\xa0the missed mark, critical parenting has been consistently associated with depression and even anxiety in children. It can also undermine a child’s emotion regulation and curb the growth of their self-esteem.\nEven as a relatively relaxed parent, I’m not immune to a sudden uptick in my blood pressure and heart rate when a teacher notifies me that my child has overlooked a piece of homework or was inattentive in class.\nIf I go on a full-scale rant at him, I’m caring too much. If I ignore the feedback, I’m not caring at all.\nIt takes a conscious effort to step back and see the full picture before I can muster up an empathetic response and problem solve with my child.\nThis being HBL round two, hopefully most of us have wisened up. Granted, we are still learning to walk the tightrope between caring so much that we take over the problem, and giving our kids room to make mistakes.\nScored 60 on a science test? Don’t sign him up for tuition just yet, find out exactly where the gaps are and what can be done to help your child.\nWe’ve also learnt to not take the grade at face value. Instead, we look a bit deeper to decipher what could be standing in the way of our child’s learning.\nFor example, my youngest didn’t know that he had to refer to the textbook for a particular Chinese assignment and so could not make head or tail of the questions. The minute he looked at the textbook, a light bulb went on in his head.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nMistakes are also an opportunity for us to know what might be missing. And we gain the precious chance to teach our children that it’s okay not to know everything at first glance.\nAn article in The Washington Post sums up well: Parents should ease up on academic micromanagement as what children need most right now is support, not pressure. We must resist the urge to “catch up” after remote learning losses and instead focus on giving our children “tools for success”.\nThese include: The ability to organise homework,\xa0have a system for completing them and practising the skill of asking a teacher for help.\nDIALLING BACK ON KIASU PARENTING \nIt is not hard to find that a thread of kiasuism running through parenting in Singapore. To the uninitiated, it is a Singlish term that translates to the “fear of losing”.\nNowhere is this more pronounced in the education system where parents are fearful their children will not get into good schools or worse, fail subjects in school thereby setting them up for a lifetime of struggle.\nBut does kiasuism simply equate to endless tuition classes? If we dig deeper, kiasu parenting encompasses a wide spectrum of beliefs and actions.\nOn one extreme, it is the need to have your children be number one in school (and in other forms of enrichment such as sports, drama or music). There is a perpetual chase for the elusive extra mark or to get into that branded school.\nHere, it wouldn’t be hard to conjure an image of an angry mum waving a cane threateningly at her child or tearing his composition up because it just isn’t good enough.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nThankfully, the majority of Singaporeans probably fall somewhere within the large middle ground, where it’s not so much about being the best, but giving your best.\nFor such parents, we may not hesitate to seek extra tuition help if we see our child is truly struggling with the concepts.\nNor would we try to hold our children back if they exhibit interests in learning a particular sport or musical instrument.\nBut we certainly wouldn’t be holding a cane behind us, ready to pounce whenever our children make mistakes.\nKiasu parenting, at its best, simply desires to see our children reach their full potential. It doesn’t necessarily equate to harsh parenting styles or punitive punishment methods.\nMy fear is that being in close quarters and having to monitor our children’s learning on top of our work responsibilities may bring out the worst in us.\nBeing aware of this is a good starting point to dial back on our worst instincts to micromanage and to really walk the talk that while grades are important, our children’s attitude toward learning, their resilience in times of change and their character traits, like helping others in greater need can take center stage.\nMAKE THE HBL EXPERIENCE COUNT\nThe road ahead is long and uncertain. The jury is still out on whether we’ll be back to in-person learning, distance learning or blended learning come end-June.\nIt is precisely due to the murkiness of the times we are in that we need to be aware of our fears – whether it’s about our children not catching up or if we should get them vaccinated.\nWe often teach our kids that no matter what happens, they have a choice as to how to respond. The same applies to us in this round of pandemic parenting.\nWe can model resilience to our kids if we choose to acknowledge the positives of this unfortunate situation. And there are many positives.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nFor one, since WFH has been reinstated and sports lessons have all but shut down, our schedules have become more streamlined, and along with that, less rushing about.\nAnd as my 12-year-old remarked when I asked her whether she hated COVID-19: “It has made my life more interesting. I think people’s expectations of how we’ll do in the PSLE have also lowered.”\nI’m not espousing that we sweep this crisis under the carpet with self-help and positive thinking.\nBut the way we see a situation, or a child, can either promote or inhibit our compassionate response.\nAnd when it comes to pandemic parenting, every bit of compassion counts – not merely for our children, but also for ourselves.\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of\xa0Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     school ', '     education ', '     Wellbeing ']}"

      Snapask: A unique e-learning platform that nurtures self-directed learners
  </h1>, 'text': 'E-learning portal Snapask believes in teaching its students how to fish, instead of just giving them the fish.\nOne of the fastest-growing e-learning portals in Singapore, Snapask is structured in a way that motivates students to learn, and to become self-directed learners. Its offerings comprise not just high-quality multimedia learning content in the form of interactive courses, practice papers and examination tips, but also a one-on-one, on-demand tutoring service that flexibly accommodates students with different learning needs.\nSaid Ms Kelly Chen, head of Singapore at Snapask: “Snapask’s self-directed learning model offers different learning solutions to fit students with different learning styles. We aim to help students develop good learning habits. We want them to be curious in their quest for knowledge, to practise to know more and to ask questions in order to own the knowledge. This will boost the students’ motivation and in turn lead to learning efficiency and effectiveness.”\nWhen students hit a roadblock with their homework or learning, they can submit their query via the Snapask app, which swiftly matches the student with a tutor from Snapask’s pool of qualified educators. The tutor would answer the query and ensure that the student understands the topic fully.\nSnapask is based on a monthly subscription model or a pay-per-use model with quotas on the number of queries. Founded in Hong Kong in 2015 as a mobile app, Snapask is now operating in nine regions in Asia-Pacific: Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. It connects more than 4 million students to 350,000 tutors.\nStudents in each region are only able to access the respective region’s tutors, as each region has different educational curricula and standards.\nMs Nur Jannah, whose 10-year-old child uses the learning resource app, is impressed with the “convenience and effectiveness” of the app and how it is able to help with “difficult questions”. Said Ms Jannah: “It is very useful as my child could post questions at any time, even at night. A tutor will pick up the query not long after it is posted. Best of all, we do not have to step out of the house!”\nA GLOBAL SHIFT TOWARDS SELF-REGULATED LEARNING\nFuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic and the call to stay home to reduce virus transmission, online learning has become increasingly popular. School closures the world over have also kickstarted the demand for self-directed learning, with digital learning tools serving as effective academic supplements.\nDuring Singapore’s circuit breaker period last year, Snapask saw a sharp spike in subscriptions. Said Ms Chen: “Online learning has become the go-to option for most. Digital learning can easily be scaled and applied to users with different learning styles to support different learning needs.”\nAdvances in technology have made it possible to customise learning for each student, as compared to a classroom environment where one teacher is facing a large group of children. It also enables 24/7 on-demand coaching as well as timely feedback on a student’s learning progress.\nSnapask leverages technology to offer a comprehensive raft of educational resources in order to prepare students for a lifelong learning journey.\nSaid Ms Chen: “The significance of self-directed learning will only increase with the current fast-paced lifestyle and dynamic workplace. Self-directed learners have a competitive edge due to their ability to proactively learn new skill sets that are in line with changing times.”\nThe best gift parents can give their children is the ability to learn by themselves.

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The problem of school bullying was in the limelight in recent months, after several highly-publicised incidents such as the case of aggression on an ITE student, and a 14-year-old student who attempted suicide after being bullied by her schoolmates.\nThe latter wrote a personal appeal to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to look into the issue of school bullying.\xa0\nWhat makes these cases particularly disturbing is the victimisation of vulnerable children with special needs, which in some cases seem to have persisted over time without any recourse for the victim.\xa0\nParents weighed in on the issue, prompting a response from the Ministry of Education.\n\n\nThe tried and tested method to deal with bullying is to punish the bullies and make them apologise to their victims.\xa0\nSchools and the Ministry of Education reiterated their zero-tolerance stance towards school bullying, and assured students and parents that measures are in place to keep schools safe, such as stating clear negative repercussions for bullies as a form of deterrence, and offering counselling and peer support for the victims.\xa0\nAs a preventive measure, MOE also refreshed the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Curriculum by emphasising the need for students to forge a kind and caring community in schools.\nWorldwide, research has shown that school bullying is a pervasive phenomenon, one that affects not just younger children in schools, but also young adults in institutes of higher learning.\xa0\nHence, bullying is not a problem that children grow out of, or that results from children being immature or weak.\xa0\nUnfortunately, no magic formula exists for eliminating school bullying completely, though there are evidenced-based methods that could mitigate the impact of bullying when it occurs, or decrease the likelihood of bullying from happening in the first place.\xa0\nWHAT CAN BE DONE\nSeveral insights can be gleaned from two recent studies involving primary school children and university students in Singapore, conducted by our research teams at Yale-NUS College and the National University of Singapore.\xa0\nThese studies found that a combination of strong parental and peer support, as well as empathy training, might be the way forward to effectively combat school bullying across educational settings.\n\n\nIn a study involving 570 primary school children aged 10 to 12, findings showed that children’s attachment to parents helped minimise the incidence of being bullied, while friends’ reliable support in the form of protection and aid reduced the likelihood of children bullying others.\nWith a strong parent-child attachment, which is cultivated through spending time with the child and being responsive to their emotional needs, children are given a safe space to share their troubles at school with a trusted adult.\xa0\nThis provides an opportunity for parents to suggest effective strategies on how the child can cope with school bullying, ensuring continuous support at home. For example, parents may role-play with the child appropriate responses towards a bully.\xa0\nThereafter, regular check-ins with the child would help parents monitor the situation closely, providing emotional support to the child in the process. A strong attachment to parents also allows children to feel secure enough to turn to parents in times of distress, and report bullying early before it escalates further.\nPOWER OF PEERS\nSimilarly, peers who offer aid and support to one another in school facilitate the development of a positive peer culture, where children learn to engage peers without resorting to dominating strategies.\xa0\nThis is especially helpful for children who tend to react aggressively out of anxiety and a fear of rejection, which may turn into acts of bullying.\xa0\nAs students approach young adulthood, parents may no longer wield as much influence as peers do. Our study on 835 university students aged 21 to 24 showed that it was attachment to peers, rather than to parents, that buffered the effects of bullying and victimisation.\xa0\nFor students who were both a bully and a victim (the “bully-victims”), being highly attached to their peers reduced their anxiety to the same level as those who have not been involved in any bullying relationship.\xa0\nBully-victims are those students who bully others and at the same time are victims of bullying. Research has shown that this group of students tends to have worse mental health outcomes than those who are pure bullies or pure victims.\n\n\nThe importance of peers highlights the need for putting in place a systematic support network of peers specific to school bullying. This goes beyond the usual strategies of merely disciplining or “counselling” bullies, which may not always be viable as the first avenue of support due to the time needed to schedule an appointment with a counsellor.\xa0\nA structured and targeted platform of a peer network where students are trained and equipped to handle issues related to bullying to support their peers who might be facing these challenges will help. Even young children who show the ability to offer support to others can be trained to help victims of bullying.\nEMPATHY TRAINING\nApart from peer support, empathy training appears to be a promising route to reducing the effects and incidence of bullying. Our research indicates that high levels of empathy reduced the level of anxiety experienced by bully-victims, such that they were no different from students who were entirely uninvolved in bullying.\xa0\nThis insight is backed by other studies, which have shown that structured empathy training programmes are effective in lowering bullying rates among students as young as primary school.\n\n\nThese programmes are often conducted over several sessions, and include components such as helping students understand diverse perspectives, role-playing, and modelling empathic responses. These targeted programmes may complement the existing CCE and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) programmes in schools.\xa0\nHowever, the responsibility for making schools a safe haven should not rest solely on the schools themselves. Parents and families have a vital role to play in modelling good social behaviours for their children to emulate, and by being more involved in their children’s lives so that the first signs of difficulty are spotted in early stages, for both bullies and victims.\nBullying is a vicious and persistent problem. But insights from our studies highlight that a multi-pronged approach is likely to be most effective, where students are constantly exposed to anti-bullying messages at home, within their peer group, in school, and the larger community.\xa0\nCheung Hoi Shan is an Assistant Professor of Social Sciences (Psychology) at Yale-NUS College and Lee Jungup is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Work, National University of Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     school ']}"

      New ITE curriculum from 2022 to let students get Higher Nitec in 3 years instead of 4 years
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will introduce a new curriculum that allows its students to achieve a Higher Nitec (Higher National ITE Certificate) in three years instead of four.\nThe new curricular structure will start with selected courses from Academic Year (AY) 2022, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and ITE said in a press release on Friday (Apr 30). All courses are expected to transition to the new structure by the 2026 intake.\n“The enhanced curricular structure seeks to equip our ITE graduates with deeper industry-relevant skills for employment, as well as provide a stronger foundation for further education and skills upgrading over the course of their careers,” MOE and ITE said.\n“This move is in line with MOE’s commitment to provide opportunities for all ITE graduates to upgrade beyond a Nitec qualification over the course of their careers by 2030.”\nMOE first announced in 2019 that all Nitec graduates will have the chance to attain a higher qualification by 2030.\xa0Second Minister for Education Maliki Osman also\xa0told Parliament in March that the route to a Higher Nitec will be shortened.\nCurrently, ITE offers the two-year Nitec programmes and the Higher Nitec programmes, which are mostly two years, separately. As such, GCE N-Level holders who enter Nitec courses will typically achieve a Higher Nitec after four years.\nIt is easier for Higher Nitec holders than Nitec holders to enter polytechnic, should they wish to do so. According to the most recent Joint Polytechnic Admissions Exercise, Higher Nitec holders needed a lower grade point average to qualify for some polytechnic courses.\n\n\nUnder the new structure, the Nitec and Higher Nitec curricula will be streamlined into a three-year programme by removing “overlapping competencies” between related Nitec and Higher Nitec courses, MOE and ITE said.\nIn Year 1, students will take broad-based foundation courses on fundamental skills needed for the relevant industry sector. In Years 2 and 3, they will take more specialised modules, leading to a Higher Nitec.\nStudents will also do two industry attachments in the three years – a three-month attachment in Year 2 and a six-month attachment in Year 3. The latter attachment is designed to build on the competencies of the former.\n“Industry attachments will remain a key component in the enhanced curricular structure so that students continue to be equipped with industry exposure and relevant work-ready skills,” MOE and ITE said.\n\n\nAs the changes comprise “a significant shift involving curriculum redesign and restructuring”, ITE will adopt a phased implementation approach.\nSixteen courses – eight Nitec and eight Higher Nitec – have been identified for the first phase of implementation from AY2022. This will involve about 2,000 students admitted into Year 1 and about 1,200 students admitted into Year 2 directly.\nITE will review the outcomes of the first phase of implementation, and make necessary adjustments including to the implementation approach and student support measures, before adding more courses under the new structure in subsequent phases after AY2024.\nCURRICULUM WILL BE FLEXIBLE FOR DIFFERENT LEARNERS\nThe new curriculum will be flexible enough to cater to a diverse range of learners with different strengths, interests and learning needs, MOE and ITE said.\nFor instance, students with the abilities and aptitude can still\xa0get a Higher Nitec in a shorter duration of two years. This includes GCE O-Level holders and those who enrol into ITE via the Direct Entry Scheme to Polytechnic Programme.\nStudents who find it more difficult to cope will get additional learning support, MOE and ITE said.\nThose who cannot complete the full three-year Higher Nitec programme can go out to work first with a Nitec qualification, comprising a transcript showing modules already taken, and complete the rest of the modules at ITE at a later stage.\nCurrently, more than seven in 10 Nitec graduates progress to Higher Nitec or pursue other publicly-funded upgrading pathways over the course of their careers, such as the ITE Work-Study Diploma (WSDip) Programme, MOE and ITE said.\n“Students who graduate with a Higher Nitec can look forward to further upgrading opportunities – such as the expanded offerings of ITE’s WSDips,” they added.\nITE now has 30 courses under the WSDips, offering more than 600 places for students to upgrade themselves while mastering their skills in a workplace environment as employees.\n\n\nThe new structure was studied as part of a review into\xa0outcomes for ITE and polytechnic students, led by Dr Maliki.\nEngagements with ITE’s stakeholders as part of the review showed that students aspire to pursue further education, upgrade their skills and remain nimble amid economic transformations, MOE and ITE said.\nThey added that ITE’s industry partners also looked forward to ITE graduates having deeper skills and an improved workplace learning experience.\nITE chief executive officer Low Khah Gek said: “The ITE curricular structure is built to be flexible and responsive to the changing and rising skills demands of industry, as well as enable ITE students to be better equipped to secure good jobs, pursue skills upgrading and build their careers.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Institute of Technical Education ', '     education ']}"

      FAQ: What you should know about the PSLE scoring system and cut-off points for secondary schools
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE)\xa0on Tuesday (Apr 27) released the range of scores for entry to nearly 140 secondary schools, under a new scoring system that takes effect this year.\nPrimary 6 students taking the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will receive Achievement Levels of 1 to 8 for each of their four subjects, with\xa01 being the best and 8 the worst.\nTheir final PSLE score is the sum of these achievement levels - meaning the best possible total score is 4.\nHere’s what you need to know about the new PSLE scoring system and what the indicative cut-off points mean for parents and students:\xa0\nQ: How were the indicative PSLE score ranges for individual schools simulated?\xa0\nA: The indicative scores are the scores of the first and last student who would be admitted into each school under the new scoring system, based on the 2020 cohort\'s results and school choice patterns.\xa0\nThe PSLE score of the last student is referred to as the school’s cut-off point.\nThe indicative score range for Cedar Girls Secondary School, for instance, is 4-8.\nMOE first simulated each student’s individual subject score in terms of the Achievement Level based on their raw subject scores. The Achievement Level scores were then added to form a student’s total PSLE score.\xa0\nUsing these simulated PSLE scores and the school choices of the 2020 batch, MOE simulated the students’ posting outcomes based on the new Secondary 1 posting system and the tie-breakers in order of citizenship, choice order of schools and computerised balloting.\xa0\xa0\nThe actual PSLE score range is not pre-determined and may vary from year to year depending on that year’s PSLE results and school choice patterns of each Primary 6 cohort.\xa0\nQ: If my child meets the school’s indicative cut-off point, does that guarantee my child’s admission into the school?\xa0\nA: Meeting the indicative cut-off point of the school does not guarantee a child’s admission into that school.\xa0\nThe indicative cut-off point is the score of the last student admitted into the school of the previous cohort, and actual cut-off points may vary from year to year.\xa0\nIf there are two or more students with the same PSLE score vying for the last places in the school, a tie-breaker will be applied in the order of citizenship, school choice order and computerised balloting.\xa0\n""Given this, it is possible for students scoring at the cut-off point of the school to be tie-broken out,"" said MOE.\nQ: Why is there no school with an indicative cut-off point of 4 or 5 in the indicative PSLE score ranges?\xa0\nA: The indicative PSLE score range of a school shows the score of the first and last student admitted into that school and course in the previous year via the Secondary 1 posting exercise. The score of the last student is the indicative cut-off point of that school.\xa0\nBased on MOE’s simulations of the 2020 Secondary\xa01 posting exercise, there were no schools where the last student admitted had a PSLE score of 4 or 5, and therefore no schools with cut-off points of 4 or 5.\xa0\nQ: What does MOE mean when it says ""students have a range of schools to choose from at each PSLE score""?\xa0\nA: There is a “good spread” of schools with cut-off points at every PSLE score from 6 to 30, said the Education Ministry.\xa0\n“This means that students would have a range of school options at each PSLE score and could also consider schools with cut-off points that do not correspond exactly to their PSLE scores,” MOE said in a factsheet.\xa0\nTo illustrate, a student with a PSLE score of 6 could choose schools with a cut-off point of 6, 7 or higher.\xa0\n“We encourage parents and students to look beyond the schools’ cut-off points when choosing a secondary school, and to consider schools that would be a good fit for the student’s overall learning needs.\xa0\n""This includes choosing schools based on their programmes or initiatives, co-curricular activities, ethos and culture as well as home-school distance,” said the Education Ministry.\xa0\nQ: Why do several schools have the same indicative cut-off point? How should parents and students choose a secondary school when the indicative cut-off points for many schools are the same?\xa0\nA: With the new scoring system, PSLE scores are now less finely differentiated - there are only 29 possible PSLE scores compared to more than 200 aggregate scores under the previous T-score system. This means that schools are now less differentiated by cut-off points, said MOE.\xa0\n“We encourage parents and students to look beyond the schools’ cut-off points when choosing a secondary school, and to consider schools that would be a good fit for the student’s overall learning needs,” said the Education Ministry in the factsheet.\n“They should consider the student’s learning needs, interests, strengths and aspirations, and how the school’s culture, environment, ethos, and programmes can support the student’s development.”\xa0\nEncouraging parents to find out more about the schools using MOE’s platforms like the PSLE-FSBB microsite and SchoolFinder programme, the Education Ministry also stressed that the choice order of schools will be a tie-breaker under the new posting system.\xa0\n“As choice order of schools will be a tie-breaker under the new Secondary 1 posting system, we encourage parents and students to give careful consideration to the choices that they indicate on the S1 Option Form and choose schools that are a good fit for the learning needs of the student.”\xa0\nParents are also advised to consider at least two to three schools where the student’s PSLE score is better than the school’s cut-off point, the ministry said.\xa0\nQ: \xa0Will there be an increased likelihood of balloting since there are fewer possible PSLE scores and more schools at every score?\xa0\nA: Students will be posted to schools based on academic merit - the students with the better PSLE score will be admitted before others with poorer scores, MOE said.\xa0\nIf there is more than one student with the same score competing for the last available place in the school, tie-breakers will be applied in this order: Citizenship, school choice order and then computerised balloting.\xa0\nA Singaporean has the highest priority, followed by a permanent resident and lastly an international student.\xa0\nWith school choice order, students who put the school as their first choice would be admitted over others who put it as their second or third choice.\xa0\nIf citizenship and school choice order are the same, computerised balloting will be used to determine which student will be admitted.\xa0\nThe Education Ministry expects that about nine in 10 students will not need to undergo balloting, and the “vast majority” of students will likely be successfully allocated to one of their six school choices, “comparable” to under the T-score system.\xa0\n“Parents and students should give careful thought to the choices that they indicate since choice order of schools will be a tie-breaker, after citizenship. We encourage parents and students to look beyond schools’ PSLE Score ranges when choosing a secondary school, and to consider schools that would be a good fit for the student’s overall learning needs.”\xa0\nThe score ranges for each school can be found on https://moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      Commentary: Learning another language has benefits - just not the economic kind
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: I’m a rootless cosmopolitan, so we’re moving the family to Spain for a year.\xa0\nThe kids are up for it. Growing up with anglophone parents in Paris, they speak French and English, and once you know one Romance language, learning another is a cinch.\n“Lexical similarity” is the measure of overlap between word sets of different languages; the lexical similarity between French and Spanish is about 0.75 - where 1 means identical.\nI want the children to have such good Spanish that they can say everything, understand everything, have deep friendships and be fully themselves in the language for life. That’s what matters, not perfect grammar.\nBut for all my emotional commitment to multilingualism, I know its usefulness has diminished. How should we think about learning languages in this era of global English and machine translation?\nMUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING?\nI spent an intensely rewarding decade learning German. Yet I now keep encountering younger Germans who insist on speaking their practically native English to me. This is true across Europe: About 98 per cent of pupils in primary and lower secondary schools in the EU are learning English.\nMeanwhile, machine translation is catching up with the human sort. I’ve been having successful email exchanges with Spaniards by putting my English text through Google Translate. It’s imperfect, but still much better than my Spanish.\nThe utility of language-learning will only keep diminishing. Already, many publications around the world now translate some of their articles into English.\nIn five years’ time, Le Monde and China’s Jiefang Daily could whack 20 articles a day through machine translation, hire underpaid young anglophones to polish them and, presto, they’ll be global newspapers.\nThe corollary to all this: Learning a language badly is becoming pointless.\nIn my generation, people spent years at secondary school breaking their heads on French or German grammar.\nMost emerged able to order beers and perhaps read a basic news story. I suspect they would have had a more enriching experience spending that time studying medicine, history or statistics.\nLanguage teachers will disagree, but then they would, wouldn’t they? They have jobs to protect.\nLOST IN TRANSLATION\nI’m equally sceptical of translators who insist they can never be replaced by a machine.\nTrue, machine translation is often faulty, machines can’t (yet) communicate through body language or eye contact, and some algorithms are sexist.\nFor\xa0instance, in gender-free languages such as Turkish, today’s algorithms tend to assume an engineer is “he”.\nBut most human translators are faulty too. One man did such a poor job translating a German text into English for publication in the FT that I spent an afternoon rewriting it.\nMoreover, humans can produce sexist language without help from machines, and their algorithms are harder to adjust.\nIn short, rather than spend years learning bad German, just install a translation app on your phone.\nIf you do learn a language, go for excellence. If\xa0you have children, immerse them in it from birth.\nWall Streeters sending their kids to Mandarin-speaking preschools may be hilarious, but they are choosing the most efficient route.\nPRACTICALLY ENGLISH\nI still wrestle with the issue of anglophones learning foreign languages. Here the utilitarian argument is weakest of all. If the global language is your mother tongue, your brutal self-interest lies in forcing foreign interlocutors onto your home turf.\nAnd anglophones don’t have the easy linguistic wins that francophones do, because no major foreign language is particularly close to English.\nI took these issues to Mark Dingemanse, a linguist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands.\nHe agreed, up to a point, on the weakening utilitarian case for languages. Dingemanse is a gifted linguist who speaks a Germanic language and lives 10km from the German border, yet even he often finds himself speaking English to Germans.\nFor other languages, he sometimes uses machine translation. “I think everyone does,” he says.\nStill, he points out, humans can do something machines can’t: Ask each other for clarification. We do that constantly in conversation: “Really? You sure? What do you mean?”\nHe worries that machine translation might dilute our accountability for what we say.\nMULTIPLIER OF OUR LIVES\nBut he warns me against focusing on the utilitarian value of languages. Multilingualism, he says, is the standard human condition. Most people alive today speak multiple languages. That shapes who they are.\nIn the Ghanaian village that Dingemanse studies, people use different languages for different registers: English for some purposes, various Ghanaian ones for others. Each language has its\xa0own domain.\nHe asks me: “How would you feel if you suddenly became monolingual?” I shudder: I’d feel diminished as a human.\nHe explains why that is: A multilingual person can be multiple people, inhabiting multiple worlds.\n“The pleasure of mastering different languages is something humankind will never lose,” he says. “As the linguist Nick Evans wrote, we study other languages because we cannot live enough lives. It’s a multiplier of our lives.”\nThe enrichment, Dingemanse emphasises, “is not just economic or utilitarian”. He’s right — but it’s best to know that before you start.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      California public schools see 'sharp decline' in enrolment 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SAN FRANCISCO:\xa0California public schools have experienced a sharp decline in enrolment this year as the pandemic forced millions into online school, according to data made public on Thursday (Apr 22).\nThe drop came as the state\'s school districts dawdled in bringing children back to the classroom, making California one of the slowest in the country to reopen schools.\nThe California Department of Education data shows that the number of students at K-12 schools dropped by more than 160,000 this academic year, most of them at the K-6 level, to a total of 6 million.\nThe drop is by far the biggest decline in years and represents the clearest picture yet of the pandemic’s devastating toll on California public schools.\n“The annual snapshot of fall enrolment shows a sharp one-year decline as the state and nation grappled with a deadly pandemic that disrupted all aspects of public education,” the education department said in a statement.\nThe exodus was led by white students who account for just 22 per cent of California’s public school population but represent about half of the departing students for the 2020-21 school year, which could increase disparities in California’s public education system.\nCalifornia has the most students of all states in the US\xa0and the overall student body has hovered at about 6.2 million in recent years. In previous years, the number of students fell by about 20,000 to 30,000 annually, led by declining birth rates, and that rate was expected to continue.\nWhen the pandemic hit and Governor\xa0Gavin Newsom ordered public schools to close in March 2020, no one expected the closures would last as long as they did.\nMost of California’s public schools started this academic year with distance learning and many continued that method into the spring. In-person classes started resuming this month in the state’s largest urban school districts.\nAmong the concerned parents who switched to private school was Aurora Guel, a San Diego County mother who said distance learning sent her high school senior into a downward spiral.\n“She became really depressed with all the isolation that started when school closed,” said Guel.\nHer 18-year-old daughter’s grades had dropped to the point she was failing three classes; she lost motivation to apply for college and wouldn’t leave her room, even for dinner with the family.\n“We needed to do something to get her out of this deep hole she had fallen into,"" Guel said.\nAfter transferring to a private Catholic school in October, the teen\'s spirits and her grades are up. She has a college acceptance and is looking forward to her prom, a milestone that many public schools have scrapped. “She\'s doing so much better now,"" her mother said.\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond called the numbers concerning but said officials are optimistic that enrolment will rebound as more schools reopen to in-person learning. He said officials are working with schools and families to understand why so many families left and how to bring them back.\nThe public school exodus happened nationwide. There is no national data available on the 2020-2021 enrolment decline but an analysis from 33 states by the Chalkbeat nonprofit news organisation covering education and The Associated Press published in December showed that public K-12 enrollment in the fall had dropped by about 500,000 students compared to the previous school year.\nCalifornia’s 2020-2021 enrolment declined 2.6 per cent from the previous school year, driven by a combination of factors.\nFewer California parents enrolled their children in kindergarten, which accounts for a decline of 61,000 students and the largest drop in enrolment.\nThat could indicate that parents either held off sending their children to kindergarten or enrolled them in private schools, which saw an overall enrolment increase of 20,000, or 4 per cent, from the previous year. The data also indicate that homeschooling surged in the fall, the CDE said.\nSome of California\'s biggest urban districts had the largest declines.\nLos Angeles Unified School District, the largest in the state, experienced an enrolment decline of almost 22,000, or 4 per cent, to 575,000, the CDE said.\nThe data released Thursday was collected from all of the state\'s school districts in October, and education officials say it is too soon to know if the trend has continued since then.\nYear-end figures won’t be known for months but the data help illustrate how the pandemic upended public schools and has prompted concerns about funding for California’s 1,000 school districts, which is tied to headcounts.\nDemocratic Governor\xa0Gavin Newsom\'s budget proposal calls for schools not to be penalised for enrolment declines, but education advocates are seeking extra money for low-income students, English learners and foster kids.\n“Any changes in enrolment will have impacts on funding and equity,” said Christopher Nellum, interim executive director for The Education Trust-West, an education equity advocacy group. “It’s just going to exacerbate the problems that already existed.”\nNellum said schools will need to think strategically about how to engage Black and brown students, who were more likely to spend the year in distance learning than their white peers who moved to private schools or other learning options.\nThose families, who were disproportionately hit by the virus, have also been more hesitant to return their children to classrooms as they reopen. Schools will also need to find ways to convince private school defectors to return, he said.\nFor parents like Jonathan Alloy of San Francisco, that will be a lost cause.\nAlloy kept his 8- and 10-year-old children in a distance learning “pod” as classrooms stayed closed but recently decided to abandon the school district and the city.\nAlloy said he lost faith in the city\'s school district, which has been embroiled in scandals, infighting and lawsuits, including one launched by the city attorney for the district\'s failure to reopen schools more quickly. San Francisco still no timetable for returning middle and high school students to classrooms.\nBecause of that combined with San Francisco’s high cost of living and more expensive private school tuition, Alloy is moving to Connecticut, closer to his wife\'s family.\n“To leave is just crushing,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     California ']}"

Other modes of SafeEntry, including using the Singpass app or scanning the barcode on personal IDs, will be discontinued.\xa0\nAlthough both the TraceTogether app and token serve the same function, MOE said students are encouraged to bring the token to school for ease of contact tracing as they may not have access to their mobile phones all the time during classes or outdoor activities.\nParents of students with special educational needs are encouraged to obtain and use the TraceTogether token for their child for school activities that may require it and for their private use.\nMOE said parents of students who do not routinely carry a TraceTogether token should take note that some out-of-school activities, such as external co-curricular activities and learning journeys, could involve entry to public or commercial buildings which require the app or token from Jun 1.\n""For such activities, parents may wish to work out an arrangement with their child\'s school to facilitate the use of the child\'s (TraceTogether)\xa0token for these activities,"" said MOE.\nStudents\xa0who have missed the deadline to request a token via their respective schools may still collect it at any community centre or community club listed on the TokenGoWhere website.

      Council of Europe official calls for discussion on Super League
  </h1>, 'text': 'REUTERS: A top official from the Council of Europe has called on an inter-governmental sports co-ordination body to urgently discuss the ramifications of the proposed breakaway European Super League.\nThe Super League project was announced on Sunday with 12 founding members, though six Premier League clubs have withdrawn following a backlash from players, fans and football authorities.\nThe Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport (EPAS) was formed by the Council of Europe in 2007 for European governments to come together and address challenges facing sport.\nNorway\'s Bjorn Berge, who serves as the Deputy Secretary General of the Council, said the Super League was an ""unfortunate initiative"" and the EPAS board should take up the matter.\n""I believe that it is important and timely to organise an urgent exchange between public authorities and the sport movement to address the possible implications of such an unfortunate initiative ...,"" Berge said in a letter to EPAS Chairman Alexandre Husting.\nThe Super League has argued that the project would increase revenues to the top clubs and allow them to distribute more money to the rest of the game.\nHowever, governing bodies, other teams and fans organisations said the move would only boost the power and wealth of the elite clubs, and that the partially closed structure went against European football\'s long-standing model.\n""It would be key to discuss how the principles of solidarity, sporting merit, openness in competitions, sport integrity and inclusion, could help governments and sports organisations to protect sports from initiatives that completely deprive sport governing bodies of their fundamental regulatory role,"" Berge added.\n(Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Peter Rutherford)\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     sport ', '     Super League ']}"

      Commentary: Getting kids ready for primary school has to start even before they attend pre-school
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Although pre-school education in Singapore is not compulsory, the majority of young children are registered in pre-schools before entering the mainstream system of education.\nThe pre-school landscape presents over 1,900 childcare centres and kindergartens that offer a wide-ranging fee structure that can range from as low as a few dollars to over S$2,000 a month, depending on whether there are subsidies, full or half-day programmes.\nWithout a centralised curriculum, pre-schools plan and implement learning experiences that cater to the needs and interests of the children and families they work with, thus presenting an array of curriculum approaches resulting in uneven learning experiences for young children across various settings.\nYet, when young children arrive at Primary 1, they are generally expected to demonstrate a general set of “readiness”.\xa0\nFor instance, they need to show cognitive skills – counting and reading - take part in cooperative goal-directed activities such as putting up a performance at the end of a performing arts lesson and show they are able to initiate and sustain interaction with peers and of course, follow a teacher’s instructions.\nYet at pre-school, depending on the type of school, there are different emphasis on these skills. This means children don’t start at the same line.\nFor example, a child attending a Montessori environment learns practical life and sensorial exercises in a self-paced manner along with literacy and numeracy. The chronological sequencing of learning experiences in this programme is said to facilitate decision-making, responsibility, and completion of tasks in an organised manner. \xa0\nSocio-economic status, in particular income disparities, add one more layer of complexity, causing additional pressures to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nChildren from families that can set aside additional resources for enrichment programmes such as outdoor play experiences and speech and drama lessons have more opportunities to strengthen their social and behavioural skills compared to those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, children from higher socio-economic status in general score better on social and emotional skills. These gaps can become more pronounced and pose\xa0risks to children’s academic achievement, their overall well-being and the well-being of communities, says OECD.\nHELPING KIDS AT PRIMARY ONE IS A GOOD START\nIt is heart-warming to know that children with readiness related issues are identified right at the start of primary one and provided with necessary support through initiatives such as Transition Support for Integration Programme (TRANSIT) that will be run in all primary schools by 2026 - through role play, independent practice and coaching by teachers.\nThis was announced by Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling on Mar 3 during the ministry’s committee of supply debates in Parliament.\nTRANSIT aims to provide both learning and behavioural support for primary one going children, with the focus on facilitating their transition into the mainstream environment.\nIt is unquestionably a well-directed move because moving into primary school is an important jump for children and this programme acknowledges the importance of young children’s potential and aims to tap the optimal growth and development of every child.\nProviding structured assistance to children in need of social and behavioural support will mean individualised and small group-based sessions to assist children to learn the necessary skills to work in groups and to self-regulate.\nWHY WAIT TILL PRIMARY SCHOOL?\nWhile this kind of initiative creates an enabling environment for children with social and behavioural needs, should we wait until Primary 1?\nResearch has shown that early childhood years are when the critical foundations of social and emotional learning are laid. This is especially pertinent in the case of children who come from more disadvantaged backgrounds, especially those experiencing toxic stress.\nComplex family backgrounds coupled with poverty can expose young children to toxic stress that can be unfavourable to their growth and development, and overall well-being.\nAccording to the Centre on the Developing Child at Harvard University, prolonged exposure to factors such as marital conflict, neglect or financial hardships can increase the risk for cognitive impairment and damage social and behavioural outcomes in children.\nSuch childhood experiences are said to be closely associated with externalising and internalising behaviours. Examples of such behaviours include verbal bullying, non-compliance, tantrums and anxiety.\nSuch stress can be reversed or prevented through early and consistent child-centred interactions – naturally, the earlier the better.\nDespite pre-school education not being compulsory, the majority of our children receive some sort of pre-school experience before entering the mainstream education.\xa0\nThis demonstrates the presence of young children in the care of trusted adults during their formative years, thus making the case for laying the foundations for social and behavioural learning during pre-school years.\nExperts from ZERO to THREE, a global non-profit organisation on advocating child development, say adults in the child’s immediate environment can foster school readiness as early as birth.\xa0\nFor example, playing turn-taking games with toddlers such as passing the ball helps them to gradually learn and practice self-regulation, a critical skill for “readiness” in mainstream education.\nWhen adults in the immediate environment establish consistent routines such as packing away toys before a meal and reading a book before bedtime, children learn both positive and responsible behaviours.\nWhile pre-schools do make an effort to strengthen readiness – they can tap on the key tenets of the TRANSIT programme to weave it into their own instructions in a systematic way that will help all children meet these social and behavioural milestones required of at the start of formal schooling.\nWhile for most children acquiring such skills can happen quite quickly, some may need additional time and resources and this may be better done in the pre-school setting.\nThrough careful and systematic observations, early childhood educators can identify young children in need of additional support that requires intentional and systematic planning of instructions.\nFor example, for a child who has difficulties waiting for his or her turn, the teacher can explicitly teach the skill by introducing it, demonstrating when it is used, and providing several opportunities to practice it.\nSuch intentional practices when consistently weaved into day-to-day routines and interactions can help see positive outcomes in children so that they are helped even before they start formal education, making transitions easier.\nWORKING WITH FAMILIES\nWhile we make the case for such intentional experiences to happen in greater intensity in pre-schools, it is important to remember that families are children’s first educators.\nYoung children’s social and emotional learning is closely related to quality parent-child relationships.\xa0Initiatives\xa0supporting children’s social and emotional learning can be fruitful only when we draw on the expertise of the families, thus advocating for collaborative relationships between pre-schools and families.\nWhen combined, the knowledge and expertise of both early childhood educators and families is proven to enrich young children’s social and emotional learning.\nHowever, this also raises the question of parents’ readiness to strengthen young children’s social and emotional development at home, thus also making the case for parent education programmes with an increased focus on equipping parents with relevant knowledge and skills to strengthen children’s social and emotional well-being.\nIdeally, all parents, whatever their socio-economic status in life, can be involved in getting their children ready for formal schooling.\xa0\nAnd pre-schools can play a part in disseminating information, partnering them by supporting and encouraging good practices to continue at home and during long holidays.\nEarlier intervention is critical in ensuring that all children get off the starting block of formal school without too much difficulty.\nDr G Kaveri is an Early Childhood Education lecturer at the S R Nathan School of Human Development, Singapore University of Social Sciences.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Commentary: Grappling with the sadness and outrage triggered by school mergers
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced last week that four pairs of primary schools and five pairs of secondary schools in Singapore will be merged between 2022 and 2024.\nThis is the third round of school closures in the last five years. In 2016, there were plans to merge 22 secondary schools. In 2017, MOE also announced the merger of 28 schools, including four pairs of junior colleges.\nThe main reason behind the slate of closures? Falling birth rates and alongside it, shrinking school cohorts.\nSENTIMENTALITY OVER SCHOOL CLOSURES\nSchool closures – we have seen this happen time and time again. They are a stern admonition of our lack of procreation, despite gentle, constant reminders.\nTheir shuttering is a manifestation that what we are sacrificing lies not only in the years ahead but also in the past, with the precious places of youth providing many a cherished memory the price we pay.\nIn one fell swoop, because we’re not making the present decision to have more children, both our past and the future must be punished.\nWe know this is our burden to bear. It is unsurprising therefore that the first response when hearing such news tends to be sadness, or even outrage, especially if one has links to these schools.\nSometimes, it can seem like some schools are bearing the brunt more than others, when netizens have asked why the neighbourhoods schools seem to be getting the short end of the stick more often in each round of closures.\nWe would be hard-pressed to find the same fate befalling popular schools like CHIJ St Nicholas Girls School despite its location in a mature estate.\nThen again, with prestigious primary schools seeing no lack of eager parents volunteering each year in the hopes of enrolling their kids there, perhaps the answer is clearer than we realise.\nOur pursuit of brand-name schools have created an endless stock of students flocking to them, even when this sometimes involves traveling long distances each day.\nStill, sympathetic Singaporeans can’t help but want to rescue our neighbourhood alma maters. And so many have questioned why the schools cannot simply adopt smaller class sizes and continue running as they are.\nBut schools, it seems, are also subject to the dynamics of supply and demand. Would parents be willing to pay higher school fees for teachers to continue earning their current wages despite class sizes shrinking?\nWe are practical people at the end of the day. The Ministry has said that most schools must still attain a certain economy of scale, in order to sustain the quality and variety of its programmes, such as co-curricular activities for the children.\nOther observers have suggested moving the school to newer housing estates (with a higher proportion of young families) to “preserve the heritage”, but this may turn out to be impractical as many families opt for their kids to attend schools close to their homes.\nIt’s understandable when so many of our formative years were spent in schools. There is a sense of history associated with the school grounds that you’ve roamed about, played zero-point on, and received your first major examination results.\nFor some, there is a strong sense of identity, of camaraderie, as “old girls and boys”. Although we are all grown up now, many of us retain fond memories of our first favourite teachers and principals. Especially those who played a formative role in our character training and upbringing.\nOn the other hand, is it a little over the top to be sentimental about a place where we’ve barely stepped foot in for the past two decades? How many of us have contributed back or participated in alumni events?\nWhen it comes to emotions, there is often no straight answer.\nIn visiting a childhood stomping ground, we can feel an overwhelming sense of nostalgia.\nThe memories come flooding back at an old school – be it of a principal telling us to quit hiking our skirts up as we run past her in the concourse, or the drinks stall aunty who used to sell “mixed” – drinks made of coke, 7-up and who knows what else went into that concoction.\nPerhaps part of the reason we get worked up is because we did not have the chance to properly say goodbye, when PSLE or O-levels happened so fast, we were out of school before we had the chance to process that farewell.\nSo for schools with a longer history, school leaders might consider arranging a virtual closing off ceremony each year for alumni and school parents to express their appreciation for the school leaders and gain closure for themselves.\xa0\nOr invite past students and staff to contribute photos and yearbooks to be placed in the newly merged school’s premises.\nPerhaps the side-gate, an old chair or an iconic wall mural could be saved, accompanied by an inscription to commemorate that token of those days of yore in the newly merged school. A time capsule can preserve a prized moment in time for us all, even if the school compound has to go.\nAs a country, we’re great at tearing places down and placing new developments where they used to stand, less so with retaining a piece of yesterday’s history for tomorrow’s memory.\nWhat might appear to be a small gesture can bear a deep significance – especially if it helps children and parents build a sense of ownership and appreciation of deep roots in the new school entity.\n(Listen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys\xa0in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:)\n\nUPHEAVAL OF ROUTINES\nThe bigger impact may be on the kids still in the school when it has to merge and move.\xa0\nSpeaking as a parent whose child has seen her school St Margaret’s Primary shift to a temporary site some distance away, while major upgrading works are carried out, I recall how parents were concerned of adjustments to a new environment and the longer travel distance.\nIt can be difficult for our children to suddenly have to uproot from the school that they’ve been attending for some time, especially if they are in the more crucial exam preparation years of Primary Six or Secondary Four.\nIf there are at-risk children in the mix, the picture is even more complex.\nAs parents, we work tirelessly in the early years to instill a sense of structure and routine in our children’s lives. This helps create a sense of stability and security.\nWhile we all know that change is uncomfortable, we can cultivate a positive attitude towards it in the way we communicate with our children. Children tend to be more adaptable than we think.\nIn all likelihood, they will settle into the new compound just as quickly as they settled into Primary One. They will learn to navigate the new classrooms and facilities in a jiffy, and even if there are challenges, they will at least be able to find solace in the same friends who have moved along with them.\nAnd for all the alumni mourning the mergers of their schools, perhaps an educational moment lies in these questions: What happened to the relationships we've made, the people around us, the teachers, and the friends?\nHave we become concerned with the replacement of a physical building, the loss of a named institution, at the expense of forgetting what remains of our time there in the ties we’ve let lapse?\nIt’s not a case of either/or but my hope is that we see the\xa0newopportunity in these school closures to open up\xa0freshconversations with old friends.\xa0\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     school ', '     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

      A prestigious new school that trains luxury hoteliers is now open in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'One of the most prestigious hospitality schools has opened its first international campus\xa0right here in Singapore. The famed Ecole hoteliere de Lausanne (EHL) is the world’s best university in hospitality education, according to QS rankings.\nThe new campus is located in the upscale neighbourhood of Lady Hill Road in District 9, in the former Kinloss House that was once a boarding school for the children of British soldiers.\nThe 2,400 sq m building, set on 1.9 ha of land, used to be the executive training centre for insurance company AXA. The restored heritage building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, a cafeteria, a large multi-purpose hall and numerous breakout spaces for students.\nEHL is the first hotel management school in the world, founded in 1893 by Jacques Tschumi. Aside from the new Singapore campus, the school has two campuses in Switzerland – EHL Campus Lausanne, and EHL Campus Chur-Passugg.\n""The new campus has been launched to meet the growing demand for hospitality professionals in Asia. It aims to expand opportunities and education for future hospitality leaders to thrive in an international landscape,"" said Jenny Ang, Managing Director of EHL Campus (Singapore).\n“As a travel hub and one of the most desired places to live in, Singapore is a gateway to the rest of Asia and we look forward to introducing students to the diversity and nuances in Asian culture, as well as the variety of businesses in the region – hospitality and beyond. Singapore already boasts some of the world’s best restaurants, beautiful hotels and impeccable leaders within the industry,” Ang continued.\nThrough the years, EHL has trained a host of notable hospitality professionals and entrepreneurs worldwide. There are a total of 150 alumni based in Singapore, including Olivier Bendel, founder of Delicae Hospitality Management (DHM), who opened renowned restaurants Sabio by the Sea and Riviera The Restaurant, formerly known as Forlino.\nHoteliers based here include Eric Piatti, General Manager of the recently opened Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore. Other notable alumni include Singaporean Huilin Quek, CEO of Q Industries, a family business that supplies kitchen and tableware to hotels and restaurants.\nOther students have also gone on to work for top names in the hospitality industry such as Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, Kempinski, Starwood and Mandarin Oriental.\xa0\n\n\nAN ASIAN LENS\nEHL Campus (Singapore) will deliver the same internationally recognised Bachelor of Science in International Hospitality, offered at the Lausanne campus. Students will thus benefit from the same curriculum content, quality and recognition of their degree.\nIn terms of tuition fees, the cost of the programme (S$143,700) is the same across both countries, the school said.\xa0\nHowever, students who choose to study here as opposed to the campuses in Switzerland will gain unique insights into the hospitality industry in Asia through local case studies embedded in\xa0the curriculum content.\nLocal F&B and hospitality companies, including the Lo & Behold Group and Les Amis Group, are also strong supporters of the school. These companies regularly offer internship opportunities for students.\nThe first cohort of 60 students, six of whom are Singaporeans, have already completed a semester of preparatory studies at the Lausanne campus, and are currently completing internships around the world.\nThey will return to Singapore in September for the rest of the four-year programme. Another 40 students are expected in the February intake, bringing the total to 100 students at the Singapore campus. Fifty per cent of the student cohort come from Asia, while the other half are from the rest of the world.\nAside from the bachelor programme, EHL Campus (Singapore) also provides short courses open to adults keen to upgrade their knowledge and skills. The duration of these courses range from three to five days.\nCourses include Luxury Brand Management, Designing Hotel & Restaurant Concepts, People & Analytics and more. Classes began in\xa0February this year.\xa0\n\n\nWHAT\'S THE RELEVANCE OF A HOSPITALITY EDUCATION IN A PANDEMIC?\nConsidering the ongoing pandemic, which has halted the tourism industry worldwide, one might ponder the relevance of a hospitality degree in the current climate.\n“Travel tourism has seen ups and downs through the years, including the 9/11 crisis and the SARS outbreak. It has always bounced back,” Joshua Gan, regional director, Asia-Pacific of EHL told CNA Luxury at the opening\xa0event.\xa0\n“We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic is not the same as these crises before, and that tourism will take a long time to recover. Our students are still coming to us because they believe in the outlook of travel.”\nStudents who have graduated in the current climate have still managed to secure jobs, albeit in other service industries such as luxury goods, FMCG,\xa0healthcare and technology, Gan added. “There are still jobs available, although not in the [hospitality] industries as hotels and restaurants are not hiring as much,” he said.\nDuring the media presentation, EHL also shared that while 50 per cent of alumni typically go on to work in the hospitality industry, another 50 per cent found jobs in other sectors such as banking, finance, consulting, real estate and more. This is testament to the broad nature of EHL’s curriculum.\nTop brands that recruit EHL students and graduates each year include luxury conglomerate LVMH, F&B manufacturer Nestle, electric car company Tesla and more.\n“More and more of our students are also starting their own businesses. Though some have started businesses in F&B and hospitality, many of them are also looking at creating tech solutions for the industry. We have our own incubator as well as our own fund that invests in start-ups in Lausanne, and we would love to replicate that here. We are just starting out [in Singapore], and there’s so much that we can do,” Gan said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     school ', '     Travel ', '     tourism ', '     Expert Advice ']}"

Both schools are located in mature areas and enrolment has been “falling consistently” in recent years, MOE said in a press release on Wednesday.\xa0\nThe merged school will be temporarily housed at Juying Primary School\'s current site, but will eventually move to new location in Tengah Plantation district from January 2025. This will be the first primary school in Tengah, said MOE.\xa0\nThe merged school will not admit new Primary 1 cohorts at its temporary site from 2022 to 2024, and will only admit its first batch after relocating to the new campus in Tengah.\xa0\nExisting students of the merged school will continue to study at the Juying Primary School campus after the new campus opens, and the last batch of Primary 6 students will graduate in 2026.\xa0\n“In a way (it’s) definitely sad because we will have to leave our campus and be merged with another school. But at the same time we also felt that we are also being recognised because we are going to be the first school in Tengah,” said Mrs Lee, who joined the school in 2018.\xa0\n“My take is that this is from good to great … That is something we look forward to but meanwhile, there is a lot of work to be done, to manage a lot of emotions and help the transition to go through smoothly,” she added.\xa0\nTeachers and staff members, especially those who have worked at the school for a long time, “naturally do feel sad”, but they understand the reasons for the merger, said Mrs Lee.\xa0\n“Last year we just celebrated our 25th anniversary, so there are some staff who have been here since the start. There are a lot of sentiments and fond memories of the school, now knowing that they definitely have to leave this campus because of the JRL and because of the very short notice, they do feel it,” she added.\xa0\nAnother school with a long history is Telok Kurau Primary, which will be keeping its campus in its merger with Eunos Primary School.\xa0\nTelok Kurau Primary was formerly Telok Kurau English School, founded in 1926.\xa0Its alumni include former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former Malaysian Prime Minister Hussein Onn.\xa0\nThere will “naturally” be some anxiety from students and teachers over the merger, but the school is also excited about its future, said principal Lau Wan Sze, who joined the school in 2019.\xa0\n“Part of it will be to take the rich histories of both schools and then combine some of our strengths together,” Ms Lau added.\n“Regardless of whatever happens, we just remain committed to the fact that it’s really about our students, and ensuring that their experience remains enriching … I think that’s something shared by Eunos Primary too.\xa0\n“It’s very exciting for me, and it’s really something that we feel that we will do our best to ensure that this continuity happens for both schools.”\xa0\nThe principal of Eunos Primary Grace Ong said the merger announcement was “not something unexpected”, because the school has been seeing low enrolment numbers.\xa0\n“We focus a lot on the possibilities for the children after the merger. We were talking about the experiences that the children will enjoy by having a wider range of CCAs, for instance,” Mrs Ong added.\xa0\nSTUDENTS AND ALUMNI\nMost students who have heard about the mergers are excited about the move, the school principals told CNA.\xa0\n“The children were excited because some of them have friends in Telok Kurau. They were looking forward to when the (schools are) merged, they will be able to have recess with their friends or have common experiences with their friends,” said Mrs Ong.\xa0\n“The children were also very excited by the new possibilities. They were asking what kind of CCAs there would be. Some of them were asking in terms of the canteen food, for instance, some of the facilities, so they were quite excited by some of the more physical changes that they might experience when they go over to the merged school building.”\xa0\nThe students at their partner school asked similar questions, said Telok Kurau Primary principal Mrs Lau. “Does this mean that we will have more classmates, more friends? They are just very excited about the whole concept.”\xa0\nPrincipals CNA spoke to also acknowledged that alumni might feel more attached to the campuses and feel sad about the mergers, especially for schools that are moving out.\xa0\n“The school campus may disappear, but the memories, the legacy that they have left behind, definitely we are consolidating it and we’re bringing it to the new school building, where the school heritage will remain, and give them\xa0this sense (that) their former school is still around, this merger is not that the whole school is disappearing. It’s still there,” said Pioneer Primary’s Mrs Lee.\xa0\n“I hope that my staff and my students will see beyond just the campus. Because everything that they have done will definitely be continued and things that they\'ve left behind as a legacy would also be retained,” she added.\xa0\n“I think I would tell them, don’t be sad,"" said Stamford Primary’s Mdm Fan, noting that the merger with Farrer Park Primary was a “very tough” decision MOE made “for the sake of the children”.\xa0\n“Rest assured the history and heritage of both schools, especially our school here, will be preserved, will be documented,” she said.\xa0\nAdding that the school plans to dedicate some space in the new school to the history of Stamford Primary, she said: “We welcome our ex-students to come back and visit, and even if the name Stamford Primary may not be there ... It doesn\'t change the fact that they had studied in the school before, and we want to build a strong identity for the school.\xa0\n“It\'s important for them to know that even though the school is not here, but the parts of our history, our heritage is here.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      18 primary and secondary schools to undergo mergers due to declining birth rates, changing demographics
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Four pairs of primary schools and five pairs of secondary schools will be merged between 2022 and 2024, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Wednesday (Apr 7).\xa0\n""Declining birth rates and changing demographics in our housing estates have led to falling enrolment in several of our schools. At the same time, some areas are experiencing rising demand for school places,"" said Ms Liew Wei Li, MOE\'s director of schools and deputy-director general of education.\xa0\nThe paired primary schools are Juying Primary School and Pioneer Primary School, Eunos Primary School and Telok Kurau Primary School, Farrer Park Primary School and Stamford Primary School, and Guangyang Primary School and Townsville Primary School.\xa0\nThe paired secondary schools are Bedok Green Secondary School and Ping Yi Secondary School, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School and Teck Whye Secondary School, Fajar Secondary School and Greenridge Secondary School, New Town Secondary School and Tanglin Secondary School, and Fuchun Secondary School and Woodlands Ring Secondary School.\xa0\nThe names of the merged schools will be announced later.\nThese schools were identified based on enrolment trends, geographical proximity of the schools to be merged, suitability of merger partners and the receiving schools\' infrastructure capacities, said Ms Liew.\xa0\nThe resident birth rate has dropped from around 46,000 per year in the 1990s to about 35,000 in recent years, said MOE at a briefing on Wednesday.\xa0\n""At the same time, population demographics have changed in the newer estates, leading to an uneven distribution of students across the schools,"" said the ministry.\xa0\n""What we\'re seeing is that nationally, there is a drop in the number of students. Then at the same time because there are estates that are maturing … you will see fewer young families, and then there are newer estates, which actually have more young families. So there is an even more uneven distribution factor localised.""\xa0\nMOE\'s previous merging exercise, which involved 14 pairs of schools, took place in 2019. That was the largest school merging exercise in the past decade, involving eight junior colleges for the first time, as well as 14 primary schools and six secondary schools.\xa0\nFor this round, all the mergers will take place in 2023 except for the merging of Juying Primary School and Pioneer Primary School (2022), and Fuchun Secondary School and Woodlands Ring Secondary School (2024).\nJuying Primary School and Pioneer Primary School are located in mature areas, and enrolment in both schools have been ""falling consistently"" in recent years, said MOE in the press release.\xa0\nThe schools will merge in 2022 to ""facilitate a revised alignment"" of the Jurong Region Line, which will run through Pioneer Primary.\xa0\nThe merged school will be temporarily housed at Juying Primary School\'s current site, but will eventually move to new location in Tengah Plantation district from January 2025, said MOE in the press release.\xa0\nThis will meet ""upcoming demand"" for primary school places in Tengah and address the ""declining demand"" in the Jurong West area. This will be the first primary school in Tengah, said MOE.\xa0\nThe merged school will not admit new Primary 1 cohorts at its temporary site from 2022 to 2024, and will only admit its first batch after relocating to the new campus in Tengah.\xa0\nExisting students of the merged school will continue to study at the Juying Primary School campus after the new campus opens, and the last batch of Primary 6 students will graduate in 2026.\xa0\n""This means that from 2025 to 2026, the merged school will operate two campuses to minimise the need for their Primary 5 and 6 students to commute to the new campus in Tengah,"" the press release read.\xa0\nAs for Fuchun Secondary and Woodlands Ring Secondary, the rebuilding and improving programme for the latter was previously delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and will only be completed in 2023.\xa0\nThe two schools will thus merge in 2024 to allow the merged school to take over the upgraded campus, said MOE in the press release.\xa0\nLONG HISTORY\nSome of the schools involved in the upcoming exercise have a long history. Tanglin Secondary School, which was founded in 1964 as Tanglin Integrated Secondary Technical School, recently merged with Clementi Woods Secondary School in 2016. The school it will be merging with in 2023, New Town Secondary School, was founded in 1965, the year Singapore gained independence.\xa0\nIn addition to falling enrolment, future development plans at Tanglin Secondary School\'s current site were also part of the considerations for its merger with New Town Secondary School. MOE said more details would be given by the relevant agencies when ready.\nIn 2016, Fajar Secondary and Ping Yi Secondary also merged with Chestnut Drive Secondary and Bedok Town Secondary respectively.\xa0\nThe Education Ministry is ""very mindful"" that a merger is ""not the best thing that can happen to a school"", addressing questions on multiple recent mergers for these schools.\xa0\n""But when we look at it we sometimes just have to accept that the local demographic numbers just don\'t permit us to hold back a merger,"" said the ministry.\xa0\n""For instance, Bedok - we\'ve been looking at the numbers. Bedok actually has been maturing for some years, and really the student numbers of the secondary school-going age have come down by a lot. So even when the first merger happened in 2016, we knew that it\'s just a matter of time that we would have to consider more mergers in that area. We just did not know which school we may have to consider.""\xa0\nTelok Kurau Primary School was formerly Telok Kurau English School, founded in 1926. Its alumni include former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and former Malaysian Prime Minister Hussein Onn.\xa0\nTeck Whye Secondary started as Jalan Teck Whye Secondary School in 1967. It was the second integrated school to be established in the Teck Whye neighbourhood and provided education in English, Mandarin and Malay.\nNO RETRENCHMENTS\n""As with all previous mergers, there will be no retrenchment of MOE staff,"" Ms Liew said.\xa0\nIn the year leading up to the merger, there will be discussions across the two schools merging on what would be ""a good mix"" of staff members, and the new principal will be announced, said MOE in the briefing.\xa0\n""Those (who) are not going to be part of the merged school, we obviously have plans for them to be posted, redeployed to other parts of the education system, typically in another school for teachers,"" the ministry said.\xa0\n""That\'s our assurance and it\'s not an issue of numbers. We will ensure everyone will be redeployed.""\xa0\nThe ministry will ""work closely"" with the affected schools to ""ensure a smooth transition"" to the merged school for students and staff, said Ms Liew.\xa0\n""I know that every merger is a painful exercise. It\'s a painful exercise for the students, the alumni, the staff in particular and the school leaders,"" she added.\n""MOE HQ is committed to work closely with them to ensure that this process is as smooth as possible and that they can see the resulting outcomes, which is a vibrant and a stronger school for the students that will be coming to their merged school.""\xa0\n""The history and heritage of both schools will be documented in a heritage space in the merged school building,"" MOE said in the press release.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      Commentary: Why we need to teach pre-schoolers protective skills to stop child sexual abuse
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: It is horrifying to read about the recent spate of child sexual abuse cases being brought to court, especially those involving fathers sexually abusing their daughters.\xa0\nIn 2019, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) investigated 210 child sexual abuse cases, which account for about 20 per cent of all child abuse and neglect investigations mounted.\xa0\nThis trend has been observed for the last three years. Statistics for 2020 have not been released.\xa0\nIn a 2017 news report, MSF revealed that close to 40 per cent of child abuse and neglect cases involved children below seven.\xa0\nOne also must note that MSF figures only accounts for intra-familial sexual abuse cases, while the police handles extra-familial cases. Yet in this, about 40 per cent of sexual assault cases reported to the police from 2017 to 2019 involved victims below the age of 16.\nThe figures clearly show the young in our midst are at risk. The consequences of sexual assault are devastating, lasting well into adulthood for many survivors. This is a pattern we must break.\xa0\nAnd much will hang on how we empower our children to speak out about sexual abuse.\nSEXUALITY EDUCATION EARLIER\nIn mainstream primary schools, sexuality education officially begins in Primary 5, when the child is 11. The focus of this is on pubertal changes happening in the body, relationships with the people around them, and sexual abuse prevention.\xa0\nFor lower primary students, lessons on safety and safeguarding, including having students learn to protect themselves from sexual abuse, are loosely incorporated into the Form Teacher Guidance Period.\nBut more can be done. Body safety teaching can start even earlier, at the pre-school age. And to ensure access to such education, these messages should be integrated into all pre-school curricula.\nBody safety is part of sexuality education, and it takes a wider perspective than sex education, which is more narrowly concerned with explaining the act of sex. Sexuality education focuses on equipping children with the skills to keep themselves safe, and to make responsible decisions about their social and sexual relationships.\nThis suggestion of starting young is not novel. UNESCO’s international technical guidance on sexuality education begins at age five. It recommends for such curricula to be incremental in age and be developmentally appropriate.\xa0\nIn New Zealand, a national school-based personal safety programme, Keeping Ourselves Safe, had been implemented for more than 30 years for children aged five to 17.\nWHY WE SWITCHED OUR OUTREACH TO PRESCHOOLS\nSingapore Children’s Society started conducting a child sexual abuse prevention programme, KidzLive: I Can Protect Myself, in 2000. In the earlier years, we reached out to primary school children, but we have switched the focus of our efforts in the last decade to children in the early childhood stage.\xa0\nYounger children are even more vulnerable to sexual abuse due to lack of knowledge, and such education was almost non-existent in our pre-school classrooms.\nThe key elements in our programme are to guide children to be aware of where their private body parts are, use the proper terms for these parts, to identify good or bad touches and inappropriate actions, and to tell a trusted adult should sexual abuse happen. \xa0\nIn 2015, we ran a pre-post programme evaluation with a sample size of 250 pre-schoolers and found that these children aged four to six years old were able to pick up the concepts described above.\xa0\nIn particular, they had significant learning in the identification of their private body parts, and the strategies to take— summarised into the N.O.T. rules—Say No, Walk Out, Tell a Trusted Adult— if somebody touches them inappropriately.\xa0\nThese results show that with the right approach, language and explanation tailored to the children’s cognitive level, they are able to pick up body safety messages.\xa0\nWe also engage parents and train pre-school educators with the hope of creating a multiplier effect to reach more children. To date, we have educated more than 11,000 pre-schoolers, trained 530 pre-school educators, and engaged more than 1,000 parents.\xa0\nCompared against an average birth cohort of 40,000, we have reached just a tiny fraction of our young children. We do slightly better with training teachers, reaching more than 3 per cent of the 17,000 educators based on our 2018 figures.\nLIMITATIONS OF PARENTS\nIdeally, all parents should be empowering their young ones with body safety skills such that children know what to do if they encounter unsafe situations.\nIn reality, this ideal falls short.\xa0\nIn a survey conducted in 2020 by the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) and the independent research agency, Blackbox Research, almost 70 per cent of the 564 parents surveyed believed they were the best persons to teach their children about sexuality.\nYet, only about half of them were comfortable to do so. The results further revealed that many parents lacked the tools and knowledge to begin such conversations.\nThese findings corroborated with our interactions with parents. Many find it awkward to talk about sexuality-related matters, and simply do not know how to start.\xa0\nThen there will always be a handful of cases where the parents are the ones who perpetuate the sexual crimes themselves.\xa0\nNeedless to say, this group will never engage in such education for their children.\xa0\nMAKE PROGRAMMES PRE-SCHOOL-BASED\nThis is where school-based child sexual abuse prevention programmes can be greatly beneficial. In addition to being able to reach masses of children, research has shown that school-based programmes are effective in increasing the protective knowledge and skills of children.\xa0\nHaving a formal structure to deliver body safety messages from pre-school until primary school would mean that children’s protective knowledge and skills will be expanded, reinforced, and retained over time. In doing so, no child will be left out.\nFor children who are experiencing abuse in their homes, having someone outside of their family to talk to and provide support can be a lifesaver. We have encountered a handful of sexual abuse disclosures when conducting the KidzLive programme.\xa0\nThese disclosures, which were flagged to either the Child Protective Service or Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) for further intervention, demonstrate that young children can speak out against abuse if given the right knowledge and opportunity, and the abuse can be ended earlier.\nIn some of the cases seen locally, disclosures came to light when children talked about these incidents with their teacher or school counsellor.\xa0\nTHE TIPPING POINT\nThrough our decade of work in the pre-school sector, we have encountered our fair share of challenges. Many times, these can be traced to adults’ resistance against what they do not fully understand.\xa0\nThey wrongly imagine that sexuality education is teaching children about the birds and the bees. After observing the KidzLive programme, however, teachers and parents understand what body safety education is, and understand the necessity and importance.\nBut even so, practical constraints of not having enough time outside of curriculum to cover these skills means that body safety education often gets squeezed out.\nChallenges aside, we are also greatly encouraged by the progress that have been made.\xa0\nPre-schools have allowed us into their spaces to talk to young children about body safety and have rallied their parents to attend our talks. ECDA has listed our training programme as a continuing professional development course for educators since 2017. This has opened doors for us to inform and persuade educators on the importance of body safety skills.\nThe National Institute of Early Childhood Development has worked with us to integrate content on child sexual abuse prevention into the training curriculum for trainee teachers.\nThese developments point to the ground warming up to the idea of delivering sexual abuse prevention messages to our young children.\nWe seem to be on the cusp of a\xa0tipping point, and what is lacking is a coordinated effort, or a body to take the lead, for such a curriculum to be established and implemented by all pre-school operators.\nReading the sordid details of child sexual abuse cases, we can continue to lament about how societal and personal morals are being eroded and castigate the perpetrators who are brought to justice.\nBut we must do much more than that. No child should be subject to sexual abuse, and if we believe that, we can accept the importance of sexuality education from young.\xa0\nEducation has shown to be an effective tool to \xa0break the cycle of child sexual abuse and we should not wait until things become much more dire before making the move to shift sexuality education and body safety awareness into pre-school.\nProfessor Ho Lai Yun is Chairman, Research and Advocacy Standing Committee and Vice Chairman of the Singapore Children's Society.

      Commentary: Hire an arts graduate to formulate business strategy. Why not?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore will soon have an arts university, the first of its kind in the country. In announcing this on Mar 3, Minister for Education, Lawrence Wong acknowledged that in the next phase of Singapore’s development, a diversity of talent is needed, not just in STEM, but also in the arts, design and media.\nIn today’s business environment, those with talent and expertise in these fields can contribute to, not just the arts community and creative industries, but a wide range of business functions.\nSince COVID-19, the demand for talent in areas such as digital marketing and data storytelling has increased exponentially. With businesses moving online as a result of pandemic mitigation measures, user experience and interface designers are needed to ensure the best possible consumer experience.\nWriters and artists also play an important role in making meaning of complex information and communicating it in a palatable fashion across digital channels.\nTHE ART OF BUSINESS\nArt allows people to view the world from different vantage points, and think creatively and empathetically. These abilities can make all the difference when formulating business strategies and creating products and services for diverse consumers.\nOver the years, companies such as Coca-Cola and GAP have reportedly turned to artist-consultants to help solve their innovation and branding challenges.\nThere are many other examples of successful business leaders with an arts background.\nFor instance, former Walt Disney Company CEO\xa0Michael Eisner has a degree in theatre, while the founder of US$20 billion burrito chain Chipotle, Steve Ells, has a degree in art history.\nIn a society with entrenched beliefs about education, perhaps there is a need to belabour the point that a degree in a particular field should not restrict a person’s employment prospects.\nAs far back as 2008, a US Conference Board survey revealed that 85 per cent of employers who were in search of creative employees had “difficulty finding qualified applicants”. The same survey found that 57 per cent of respondents saw arts degrees as a reflection of creativity.\nIt seems employers appreciate candidates with an arts background. Yet, there aren’t many reports of artists being welcomed into offices.\nThis could be due to several factors including obvious concerns that an arts degree may not demonstrate key technical or functional competencies necessary for certain jobs.\nWhile this is a valid concern, knowing how to recalibrate companies’ structures to get the most out of creative talent could open up many opportunities. The owner of a start-up recently told me that he has considered hiring performance artists for his team as their arts training enables them to improvise, manage time efficiently and be great collaborators.\nCANDIDATE SELECTION PROCESSES MUST EVOLVE MORE QUICKLY THAN EVER BEFORE\nUnfortunately, such open-mindedness is uncommon.\nFor many years, a large number of local employers only shortlisted candidates who attended well-established universities such as the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).\nToday, based on our experience, employers are increasingly taking a more granular approach, putting the universities that job seekers attended aside in order to more seriously consider results from psychometric tests and how candidates handle situational and behavioural job interview questions.\nBut the uncertain and rapidly transforming business environment demands that employers broaden their minds faster than ever before.\nIn order to avoid losing out on great talent, anything that serves to perpetuate entrenched biases needs to be addressed as a start.\nDO SURVEYS AND RANKINGS MATTER?\nFor one thing, the merits of graduate employment surveys should be reassessed.\nSuch surveys have the potential of depressing the prospects and salaries of graduates from newer universities and certain courses.\nThe recent annual Joint Autonomous Universities Graduate Employment Survey which polled 11,800 fresh graduates from full-time programmes at NUS, NTU, Singapore Management University (SMU) and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) showed that 69.8 per cent of fresh graduates found permanent full-time jobs last year. Their median gross monthly salary was S$3,700.\nA follow-up survey of 827 graduates of courses that typically require post-graduate practical training from NUS, NTU and SMU showed that 93.5 per cent had found full-time employment by Nov 1 after completing their training. Their median gross monthly salary was S$4,625 – higher than that of the first group.\nThe graduates polled in the follow-up survey were from the architecture class of 2017, and the biomedical sciences, Chinese medicine, law, medicine and pharmacy courses, who finished their first year of training upon graduation in 2019.\nSeveral inferences could be rightly or wrongly made from this data. The disparity in terms of percentages between the two groups could point to certain courses being more reliable in terms of increasing graduates’ employment prospects or that certain sectors are doing better and can pay fresh graduates a higher starting salary.\nBut others might also surmise that the first survey showed a lower number of graduates gaining full-time employment because it included graduates from a relatively new university – SUSS.\nWhile employment prospects and starting salaries may be important metrics for students deciding which course and school to pick, such surveys tend to signal that these are the key metrics that matter. The results also propagate perceptions about particular institutions and courses of study, and even mistaken assumptions that become harder to dispel.\nAs a result, even if they were equipped with well-structured courses and competent teachers, schools and courses that are less favourably reflected in such surveys might struggle to attract students. Likewise, graduates might struggle to counter employers’ biases.\nIn an era where more employers are beginning to recognise other indicators of domain knowledge and expertise, perhaps we could do away with surveys that make distinctions between autonomous universities and private universities, or arts institutes and academic institutes.\nLet’s also remember that an individual’s employability and starting salary are often influenced by the state of the economy, business requirements and the skills that the specific employer deems valuable at the time.\nThe current crisis has brought this into sharper focus.\nAt the height of the air travel boom, the salaries of pilots, even First Officers, were the envy of many. After a pandemic-ravaged year, that is no longer the case. Instead, the profession is plagued by layoffs and pay cuts.\nIn the last few years, even the merits of global university rankings have come under scrutiny, as their utility for students deciding on which institution to go to has been robustly debated. It is a well-known fact that each ranking system has different criteria.\nSome focus mostly on institutional research output while others place a greater importance on perception surveys. Many rankings pay little attention to real-world undergraduate experience.\nHOW THEN CAN STUDENTS AND EMPLOYERS MAKE INFORMED CHOICES?\nWhat then should go into a decision about which university to go to?\nIt’s a combination of factors including research into the structure of the programme, what people say and what you know about the quality of teachers, and the individual student’s interests.\nConsidering that a crisis could change everything in the blink of an eye, what’s more important today is to be ready to pivot to job roles and fields that have very little to do with the degrees we graduated with.\nLikewise, employers need to be more open to cross-disciplinary and cross-industry hiring. It is heartening to see that talent shortages in certain sectors and the need for fresh perspectives have made this more common today.\nREAPING THE BENEFITS OF DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS MORE FULLY\nThe truth may be that whether or not mechanisms such as graduate employment surveys exist, biases against certain universities and courses of study will not disappear overnight.\xa0\nThis is why employers who have such biases entrenched in their hiring processes must make a concerted effort to recalibrate their criteria.\nThe importance of specific degrees is likely to persist in professions such as medicine or law which require individuals to have a large amount of domain knowledge best learnt in a structured environment.\nHowever, with the advent of alternative and informal learning avenues such as credible online courses and autodidacticism, the fixation on academic qualifications in other fields should dissipate.\xa0\nA Ministry of Manpower report published in 2019 showed that academic qualifications were not the main consideration for employers hiring PMETs in 2018.\nThis applied to 52 per cent of PMET job vacancies and included occupations such as software, web and multimedia developers, systems analysts and commercial and marketing sales executives.\nIn these cases, employers were more interested in candidates with relevant skills, work experience, soft skills and the right attitudes.\nFor newer educational institutions, courses and methods of study to have a chance of success, more employers must set the tone for a better way of assessing an individual’s value. \xa0\nThe introduction of diverse educational pathways will come to nought if employers and society as a whole remain unreceptive to broader definitions of potential and competence.\nJaime Lim is Group Business Leader of\xa0PeopleSearch, an executive search and outplacement services firm with a presence in six cities including Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     jobs ']}"

      Commentary: Teachers have 12 weeks of holiday each year – fact or myth?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The March holidays have just concluded.\nAs an educator, one thing I do hear during the school holidays is this: “Teachers are so fortunate. They get 12 weeks off work each year. What a great deal!”\nThis all-too-common perception of teachers has persisted in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary.\nOn the face of it, it is all too easy to believe teachers enjoy among the most generous paid leave schemes. After all, since students are off from school during the holiday periods, teachers are getting a break, right?\nNot entirely.\nPROTECTED DOWNTIME AND FLEXIBILITY\nIn practice, teachers may be called upon for duty at any time during the school holidays. In fact, concerns that teachers are not getting enough of a break even during such periods were raised in Parliament in August 2016.\nThe Ministry of Education’s reply referred to guidelines that include the idea of protected holiday time to help teachers manage workloads and enjoy sufficient rest and bond with their families.\xa0\nThis time comprises at least two days in March, two weeks in June, two days in September and three weeks during the year-end break.\nAt the same time, the Ministry allows individual schools flexibility with teacher deployment during school holidays in order to meet their specific needs.\nFor instance, it is common practice for schools to conduct remedial or enrichment classes for specific groups of students. In some schools, teachers may offer small group remediation for students in order to address learning gaps identified during lessons and tests.\nCHALLENGING DEMANDS SINCE PANDEMIC HIT\nTeachers have experienced more challenging demands since the coronavirus hit our shores. During the mid-year school break in May 2020, then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung announced that schools would be inviting students in the graduating cohorts to return for coaching and consultations with their teachers.\nOng mentioned that this support was customary for graduating students during the mid-year break, but had taken on added urgency because of the anxiety brought about by school closures earlier in the year.\nFurthermore, some students taking subjects with coursework or practical components – in the sciences, design and technology, and food and consumer education for example - needed to use school facilities and equipment in order to make up for lost time.\nHIGH TEMPO OF CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\nBesides academic lessons, some teachers are busy during school holiday periods with co-curricular activities. Some activities like camps or leadership courses are less easily conducted during term time when there is a high tempo of teaching and formal curriculum.\nHoliday periods in fact provide students preparing for competitions a chance to step up training under the guidance of teachers and external coaches. For instance, the resumption of the National School Games this year after a brief hiatus in 2020 meant that sports teams can make use of the March or June breaks for more intensive training.\nPre-coronavirus, school holidays were also a prime time for schools to organise overseas learning experiences.\nThese trips, which centred around such matters as cultural exchanges, adventure learning or service learning, provided students a chance to develop key Character and Citizenship Education skills and competencies such as leadership. Quite naturally, some teachers would find their school breaks occupied with these trips.\nPREPARING FOR THE NEXT TERM, TACKLING NEW CHALLENGES\nAnother form of work that occupies some teachers during school breaks is lesson preparation.\nAmid a dynamic environment in which schools continue to introduce a variety of teaching methodologies such as differentiated instruction, many teachers need that brief let-up from the relentless press of the school day.\nThe school holidays are an invaluable time to step back to refresh their lesson plans and teaching techniques to better meet their students’ diverse learning needs.\nIn addition to all of the points that have already been mentioned, school breaks are sometimes used for teacher professional development activities.\nFor instance, schools may organise whole-school strategic planning meetings in order to chart key directions for the future. Teachers may also meet colleagues teaching the same cohort or the same subject.\nThere, they discuss topics and fresh challenges facing teachers, in a bid to figure out how to deal with changing social mores and challenges wrought by an increasingly digital, fast paced world - \xa0including cyberbullying, mental health or efforts to foster a student peer support culture.\n12 WEEKS OF HOLIDAYS – IT’S JUST A MYTH\nIt should be clear by now that the myth of teachers enjoying the luxury of 12 weeks of paid holidays is nothing more than fiction.\nThe reality of teachers’ lives is that attending to their students’ developmental needs, whether academic or non-academic, often takes precedence for at least part of the school holiday periods over spending time on their families or leisure activities.\nTheir own professional development needs are also often addressed during school breaks, on top of the workshops or meetings that they normally attend during term time.\nYou might ask, why the Ministry of Education cannot mandate that school holidays be left completely free of school activities in order for both teachers and students to enjoy more restful breaks.\nThe fact appears to be that the 40 weeks of school within each calendar year are insufficient for schools to fully carry out the myriad of tasks and programmes with which they have been entrusted. We see this for instance in the case of overseas learning experiences, preparation for inter-school competitions and extra academic lessons.\nThe Ministry has to maintain a balance between maximising rest time for teachers and students during school holidays and addressing the learning and developmental needs of both.\xa0\nSchool leaders have an important responsibility too in terms of ensuring that their teachers have sufficient downtime during school holidays in order to recharge themselves for the challenges of the next school term.\nIt is also important to remember that in lieu of annual holiday leave, school teachers are eligible for full-pay leave for up to 10 working days in a calendar year to attend to urgent private affairs such as marriage, the selection of an HDB flat or serious illness of family members, or up to 12 days if examination leave is included.\nThus, for most teachers the school holidays represent the only opportunity for a brief respite from the frenetic pace of school life.\nListen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys\xa0in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\nJason Tan is an associate professor at the National Institute of Education.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     school ']}"

      A university education that provides the best of both worlds
  </h1>, 'text': 'After enrolling in junior college, Ms Elsie Hui realised that she wanted to study something she was passionate about – psychology.\n“Ever since I was young, I have been intrigued by how the human mind works,” the 25-year-old said, adding that she enjoyed watching documentaries on criminology, mental disabilities and illnesses. Ms Hui left junior college to enrol in Temasek Polytechnic, from which she eventually graduated with a Diploma in Psychology.\nIn July 2016, she embarked on the Bachelor of Psychological Science programme, including her one-year honours, at the Singapore campus of James Cook University (JCU).\n“JCU was one of the few schools in Singapore that offered a science degree in psychology, as compared to other universities that only offered an arts degree in the field,” she explained.\nDEVELOPING CONFIDENCE IN HERSELF\nAt JCU, Ms Hui had the flexibility to choose the number and type of modules she took in each trimester. JCU has a trimester schedule, allowing students to complete their Bachelor programme in two years instead of three.\nMs Hui was able to customise her academic load by spreading out higher-level modules across different trimesters and pairing them with easier modules. She said: “I enjoyed this fast-paced and flexible learning process as I could plan my own learning progress and group the modules I felt were relevant to one another.”\nDuring her polytechnic years, Ms Hui struggled with statistics. University proved to be no different initially, as she continued to grapple with coding methods and data analysis.\nHowever, at JCU, she had the help of Dr Patrick Lin, her lecturer in her second trimester. He guided Ms Hui in mastering statistics and boosted her confidence by encouraging her to enrol in the honours year for her course and taking her on as a supervisee for her thesis research paper.\n“Dr Lin helped me to figure out a criteria checklist to find out which statistical analysis method I needed to use, and also taught me to interpret the analysis results and what it meant for the research study,” recalled Ms Hui. “I eventually did well enough to be a statistics peer tutor to my other university mates in the third trimester.”\nBesides academic support, JCU through its Inter-campus Mobility programme also gave Ms Hui the chance to experience a semester abroad at the JCU Cairns campus in July 2017.\nMs Hui, who has fond memories of hiking, volunteering at an animal centre and barbecue nights with newfound friends, was happy with the seamless, hassle-free experience where all accommodation and activities were provided for her. Unlike some other universities’ mobility programmes, she only needed to pay her usual Singapore-based school fees instead of paying the Australian campus.\nACQUIRING PROFESSIONAL SKILLS\nHaving graduated from JCU in April 2019, Ms Hui is now a learning facilitator at the Rainbow Centre, where she is part of the teaching team helping students with disabilities to learn the skills needed to live an independent life. Dr Lin, her statistics mentor, served as one of the referees on her resume.\nAt JCU, she gained an understanding of autism and other disabilities like cerebral palsy in addition to her knowledge of psychology. This has helped her to design strategies to increase students’ engagement and interest in lessons. Modules like educational psychology, child development psychology, and behaviour and learning were especially useful.\n“I was able to brainstorm strategies and refer to evidence-based practices that I came across in school in order to adapt and create behavioural management interventions that help students learn more effectively,” she explained.\nReflecting on her time in JCU, Ms Hui said JCU has opened more doors for her career.\n“We should enjoy our university life, and this can be achieved given the flexibility that JCU provides,” she said. “With the science degree in psychology that you graduate with from JCU, there might be more job opportunities and choices that you can explore.”\nFind out more about JCU’s programmes at JCU’s Accessible 24/7 Open House.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      'Outside, we don't get a chance': What it is like studying for a degree in prison
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Every Thursday\xa0after having lunch, Wayne (not his real name) will make the short walk to school.\nThe classroom has a familiar feel: Whiteboard, blue tables and dusty grey floor. But the windows have metal grilles, and Wayne and his classmates sport standard crew cuts, white T-shirts and rubber slippers.\nWayne, 48, is about four years into his 11.5-year sentence for drug offences. This is his sixth time in prison, but the first time that he, or any inmate for that matter, is enrolled in a structured degree programme behind bars.\nThe Singapore Prison Service (SPS) has partnered the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) to let inmates take up a Bachelor of Science in Business programme, specialising in logistics and supply chain management.\nIt is an eight-year part-time programme that started last July, with lessons taking place in the prison school every Thursday.\nThe idea for this degree programme came about after a batch of inmates completed a diploma in a similar logistics field in May last year. This diploma programme was launched in 2018.\n""Some of them had enough sentence length to kickstart the (degree) in which they had keen interest in,"" said Prison School principal\xa0Leong Sow Phong.\n""As SUSS offers this degree on a part-time basis and the students met the entry requirements, Prison School initiated the discussion with SUSS, to offer opportunities for inmates to further their studies and assist them in their employment prospects after their release.""\nFor Wayne, who said he came from a poor family and grew up with a single dad, going to university had never crossed his mind.\nSo when he was offered the opportunity to get a diploma and then a degree in prison, he ""grabbed"" at it with both hands.\nInmates who have completed the related diploma, or an A-Level\xa0with a pass in GP and two H2 subjects, can apply for the degree programme. Factors like\xa0conduct and motivation to learn are considered.\nInmates who take up the programme also get financial assistance under a\xa0Yellow Ribbon Fund bursary.\n""All\xa0this\xa0while, I\'ve been working low-skilled jobs that don\'t need me to use my brain, like being a pub manager,"" Wayne\xa0said.\n""I\'m quite interested in improving and upgrading myself. I know that education is important. If\xa0I want to continue to survive in Singapore outside, I need education.""\nBACK TO SCHOOL\nOn weekdays, Wayne and five other classmates will head to the prison school after lunch for half a day\xa0to self-study, complete assignments and work on group projects.\nThey are\xa0given laptops for this, but they cannot send emails, so Wayne writes down the questions he has before asking them during lessons on Thursdays.\nThe Prison School also works with the inmates\' personal supervisors\xa0and correctional rehabilitation specialists to balance their ""academic and rehabilitative needs"", Mr Leong said.\nThe inmates can bring reading materials back to their cell\xa0for revision when they have free time. The classmates\xa0also bunk together, which Wayne said\xa0is helpful as they can discuss the coursework and solve problems together.\nWayne said the lessons and quizzes have been manageable, and that his interest in the coursework means he\xa0has had ""no problem"" so far.\n""We have plenty of time here, so I don’t think anything has been stressful,"" he said, calling the prison environment ""conducive"" for learning.\nMr Leong said\xa0SUSS and the Prison School are encouraged by the inmates\' results for the July 2020 semester. ""We have confidence that the students have the potential to do well and handle more modules,"" he said.\nNevertheless, Mr Leong said those who need more help will get the support, adding that the Prison School works closely with lecturers from SUSS.\nWayne said he has gone for lessons with three lecturers so far, adding that they have been helpful and will provide students\xa0with ""whatever we need"".\n""THEY ARE REALLY GOOD""\nSUSS lecturer Zhou Zihan, who teaches the inmates how to generate and interpret\xa0statistical findings, said she was initially a ""little worried"" about how the inmates\xa0would cope with the workload, as she was unsure about their backgrounds.\n""But in the first seminar, after I went through several concepts, asked them several questions and did\xa0some class activities together, all of these concerns\xa0were gone,"" she said.\n""I understand that they are really good. They have done a lot of work.""\nA typical lesson will start with a lecture on some concepts, then a class activity and finally a question-and-answer session, similar to what happens in SUSS, she said.\nDr Zhou said the teaching experience has been ""quite smooth"", with inmates performing\xa0better than she expected. There is ""not much difference"" in the learning attitude of\xa0her prison students compared to their SUSS counterparts, she added.\n""The inmates are\xa0curious about the knowledge, and actually they ask me a lot of questions,"" she said, smiling.\n""All of them are very related to statistics; I think they have done a lot of preparation before they come into class.""\nThe soft-spoken Dr Zhou replicates this enthusiasm in class. In one lesson, she speaks into a microphone and points to a slide on a statistical test. She beams\xa0as an inmate raises his hand.\nBut a poster beside the whiteboard, stating that bullying is a crime, is a reminder that this is not the average classroom.\nWhile the usual learning tools like projectors and laptops are available, mobile phones and access to online platforms are not.\nBefore her first lesson, Dr Zhou attended an SPS briefing to familiarise herself with the new teaching environment and its\xa0""strict rules and regulations"".\n""For example, I cannot bring a bottle of water but only an empty bottle, or I cannot wear a smartwatch,"" she said. ""There are many more things like that, but the colleagues in SPS have been very helpful.""\nWith limited access to external information, Dr Zhou said she gives her students more examples of how to apply the knowledge to different real-life situations.\n""I rely more on traditional interaction, such as asking students for their opinions one by one,"" she added. ""But this kind of traditional interaction is feasible, because I only have six students here.""\nDr Zhou said she volunteered to teach in prison as she wanted to teach inmates new knowledge\xa0and skills\xa0""for a new chance in their lives"".\n""I believe I have benefited from my previous education, so I want to give back to society through teaching,"" she said.\n""At the same time, SUSS provides strong support for social good initiatives such as inclusive education.""\nPLANS AFTER RELEASE\nPrison School principal Mr Leong said education is one way inmates can ""kickstart"" their rehabilitation and reintegration journey while in prison.\n""The Prison School provides platforms for them to pursue various academic opportunities while in prison, and help them secure good jobs upon their release, which is crucial to helping them reintegrate into society and prevent re-offending,"" he said.\xa0\n""SPS may facilitate other courses of studies if assessed suitable and appropriate.""\nWayne feels it is a ""very good"" opportunity\xa0for inmates to get a degree in prison, pointing out that he could have been ""doing nothing"" during his sentence if not for the programme.\n""Outside, we don’t get a chance (to study for a\xa0degree),"" he said.\n""Even\xa0if we had a chance\xa0to go to university,\xa0we don\'t have the time.\xa0It’s better to add value to ourselves inside than have nothing to do and waste our time.""\nWayne said he hopes to continue going for classes at SUSS during the mandatory aftercare scheme following his release, and complete his degree in fewer than eight years.\nHis eventual aim is to run a chicken rice stall, saying\xa0that the degree will equip\xa0him with the logistical knowledge needed to manage\xa0a business.\nMr Leong said inmates\xa0can complete as many modules as possible while in prison, and finish up the remaining modules at SUSS after their release.\n""I\xa0never actually thought about (my convocation\xa0ceremony), but if I have a chance to put on that kind of (graduation)\xa0hat,\xa0I will feel very proud,"" Wayne added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore University of Social Sciences ', '     education ']}"

      Solar power for most schools as MOE aims for 2030 carbon-neutral target
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Progressively equipping schools with solar panels over the next decade is one way the Ministry of Education (MOE) plans to reach its target of getting at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon-neutral by 2030.\nThe target was first announced in February at the unveiling of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. MOE is also working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector by 2030.\nSpeaking in the joint segment on sustainability during the Committee of Supply debates on Thursday (Mar 4), Minister for Education Lawrence Wong said MOE will start by piloting sustainability features and related concepts in four schools - Elias Park Primary School, Mee Toh School, Commonwealth Secondary School and Tampines Secondary School.\n""These schools have already adopted a holistic school-wide approach to sustainability. We will work with them to further reduce net carbon emissions from the school buildings, and to encourage students to actively reduce their individual carbon footprint,"" he said in his speech.\n""We will learn from the experiences in the pilot, and progressively scale up good and practical solutions across all our schools.""\n\n\nGREEN CAMPUSES\nThe ministry will also continue to enhance school infrastructure with green features, Mr Wong said.\nWith about 130 schools currently on the SolarNova programme with solar panels progressively installed on their rooftops, MOE will extend this to cover most of the remaining schools in the coming decade, he announced.\nMOE will also gradually install LED lights as the main light source in classrooms and more energy-efficient direct current fans, he added.\n""MOE will continue to green our schools and testbed new innovations, so that our school buildings can be more sustainable and our school campuses can become learning laboratories for our students to see sustainability in practice,"" said Mr Wong.\n\n\nHOLISTIC APPROACH\nThe Education Ministry aims to reduce carbon emissions from schools significantly through the Eco Stewardship Programme, added Mr Wong.\nThe programme aims to inculcate ""informed and responsible sustainability habits"" in students for life and ""empower them to make a positive difference"", he said.\nUnder the programme, environmental sustainability will be ""holistically integrated"" into schools through the 4Cs - curriculum, campus, culture and community.\nWhile environment and climate change education is already integrated into subjects such as science, geography and social studies, Mr Wong agreed that MOE can do more to enhance the teaching and learning of sustainability in science and humanities subjects.\n""For example, in the new upper secondary geography syllabus, the topics will be organised around the theme of sustainability where students will understand the impact of sustainability issues. We will also refresh and strengthen the Singapore perspective on sustainable development,"" he added.\nMOE will develop more learning resources that feature sustainability initiatives within the school environment, which will help students ""connect their learning to their actual lived experience in schools"", said the Education Minister.\nMAKING SUSTAINABILITY A HABIT\nEveryday responsibilities for students will also be expanded to include sustainability habits, he added.\n""It could be simple activities like switching off lights and fans upon leaving the classrooms. And in fact, some schools have also encouraged students to reduce and recycle food waste,"" said Mr Wong.\nThese practices will be expanded to more schools, and MOE will pilot ways for students to see that their daily habits can make a ""discernible impact"" on the environment, he added.\n""We will also help students champion sustainability mindset and practices through leadership opportunities so that they can encourage their peers and friends towards more sustainable living.""\nMOE will work with partners to widen and enhance the platforms for students to participate in and undertake ""meaningful""\xa0community projects to care for the environment and promote sustainable living, said Mr Wong.\nThe ministry will also work with partners to strengthen students\' awareness of future green jobs, he added.\n""We have set ambitious plans for ourselves. They are not just hard targets in reducing carbon emissions, but equally if not more importantly, they are about nurturing our young with the values, skills and knowhow to become responsible stewards of the environment,"" said Mr Wong in closing.\n""We hope to see in every student an eco steward for life, where they will have a sensible sensitivity towards the environment, and understand what it means to live sustainably.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     environment ', '     MOE ', '     climate change ', '     sustainability ']}"

He nods and heads back to his seat.\xa0\nIn this classroom, there are only eight students.\nThey are part of the pilot Transition Support for Integration programme, or TRANSIT, designed to support Primary 1 students with social and behavioural difficulties and help them with the transition to primary school in the first six months.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Wednesday (Mar 3) that it will introduce the programme in all primary schools by 2026.\xa0\nBy the end of this year, about 40 schools would have piloted it, with about five to 10 Primary 1 students from each school involved in the programme.\xa0\nThe pilot\'s outcomes have been ""promising"", said Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling in Parliament.\xa0\n“These students will receive support from allied educators (learning and behavioural support) and teachers to develop foundational self-management skills, in small groups and in their classrooms during their P1 year,"" she added.\xa0\n""By the end of P1, students should be able to learn independently in class, with occasional help.""\xa0\nElias Park Primary is one of the schools that has been part of the pilot since 2017.\nTeachers and allied educators observe the students for a week at the beginning of the year and identify those who may need support under the programme. TRANSIT classes then begin, usually in early February.\xa0\n“For example, if they are unable to manage their emotions or simple classroom work habits like moving out of their seat, walking around the classroom … these are some of the children where we will be teaching them explicit skills on how they can manage their emotions and also how they should be behaving in the classroom,” said Mdm Wong, who has been a teacher for more than 20 years.\xa0\nExplaining how teachers and allied educators approach students who may benefit from the programme without making them feel like they are being singled out, she said teachers first have casual talks with the students to build rapport.\xa0\n“We bring them into the classroom gradually. We will not force them to join the classroom for our programme. We get used to them and build a rapport with these children before we really get them to join us in our lessons,” Mdm Wong added.\nPrimary 1 students in the programme take their English and mathematics classes separately from their form classes for the first six months.\xa0\nAfter that, they rejoin their form classes permanently, and allied educators check in on them every day. In the classrooms of their form class, there will be stickers on their desks to remind them of the strategies they learnt.\xa0\nEven after Primary 1, teachers and allied educators check in regularly on the children to monitor their progress.\xa0\nThe transition back to their form classes is “gradual”, Mdm Wong said. “Before they go back to the class, we get the classroom ready, the children ready and teachers are ready to accept them.”\xa0\n“TRANSIT is important to support the inclusiveness in the school, and at the same time it helps to support students in terms of self-management skills, where at times if they’re lacking in different areas.\n“And it benefits those students who want to be integrated positively in class,” said senior allied educator (learning and behavioural support) Madam Mastura Hashim, who has been with Elias Park Primary for 15 years.\xa0\nAdding that there is an increase in awareness of the need to be inclusive, Mdm Mastura said: “That\'s why it is important to have this programme now to include students who have skills deficit in the area of self-management skills.\xa0\n“This programme actually helped them to develop positively in the area of social and communication skills, self-management skills and emotional regulation.”\nIn supporting these students, teachers and allied educators use evidence-based approaches like positive behaviour support - praising and affirming the child - across different classroom settings, said Mdm Mastura.\xa0\nAt Elias Park Primary, students in the TRANSIT programme are rewarded with tokens that can be exchanged for rewards each time they display good behaviour, said Mdm Wong.\xa0\n“We want the children to know that we reward them for their good behaviour, and not reprimanding somebody who’s doing the wrong thing,” she said, adding that other children follow when they see their peers getting rewarded for good behaviour.\xa0\nROLE OF TEACHERS AND ALLIED EDUCATORS\nStrategy teaching, or implementing routines and structures so that students know what to do, is equally important, said Mdm Mastura.\xa0\n“One of the main differences is that a TRANSIT teacher has to help the AED LBS (allied educator, learning and behavioural support) and support students in the area of generalisation of the skills by infusing those skills in her daily teaching,” said Mdm Mastura, describing the differences between teaching styles for TRANSIT students and the other students.\xa0\n“For example, if she\'s teaching English or math, she might want to infuse those skill sets like maybe raising hands in her lesson because it has been taught during the week or that particular session. This is one area whereby students will then be able to generalise the skills across settings,” she added.\xa0\nTRANSIT teachers like Mdm Wong are trained to teach those classes and support them in regular classes.\xa0\n“We will be there to observe them and remind them using visuals on the expected behaviours that they should exhibit when they’re in a normal classroom,” said Mdm Wong.\xa0\nRaising their hands is one common challenge faced by these students, she added.\xa0\n“I think this is a habit brought up from home. Young children when they talk to their parents they get the full attention of the parents, and so they do not know how to wait for their turn when they need to speak,” she said.\n“When it comes to school, there is more than one child in the classroom, so we have to teach them the skill of waiting for their turn to talk by raising their hands. And not only by raising their hands and shouting out answers, but they have to raise their hands and wait for the teacher’s acknowledgement before they can answer a question.”\xa0\nSome students may also get frustrated when they are not called on and will have to learn that they should put their hands down and wait for the next question, said Mdm Wong.\xa0\nROLE OF PARENTS\nIn the programme, parents also “work very closely” with teachers and allied educators, said Mdm Mastura.\xa0\n“When we teach specific skills, we do share those specific skills to parents, and parents can use that to support them at home and also when they go out, like for example, parties and in social settings,” she added.\xa0\nBut the parents’ receptiveness to the programme can be a challenge, said Mdm Wong.\xa0\n“But we let parents know that we are here to support the child, we are not saying that the child is special. But every child is different, we all learn differently,” she added.\xa0\n“As a parent myself ... we understand that from the teacher’s point of view, if we are trying to help the child with whatever strategies we can think of, this is the job as an educator.”\xa0\nMrs Sharlene Tan, whose son was part of the first batch of TRANSIT students in Elias Park Primary, said that before going through the programme, her son was unable to focus and stay still in his seat. He would also have meltdowns during classroom break times.\xa0\nAt home, he would climb on chairs and tables, hide under the sofa and play with water in the bathroom.\nMrs Tan and her husband were having difficulties managing his behaviour since he was two years old and took him to see an occupational therapist when he was in kindergarten. That helped, but not as much as the TRANSIT programme because he only saw the therapist about once a month, said Mrs Tan.\xa0\n“I have less worries because they really helped my son to know what are dangerous activities. I kept telling him, but he doesn’t want to listen or cannot understand. But from then, he could understand and he could talk to me about it and discuss with me,” she added.\xa0\n“They (the teachers) used a lot of time to talk to him with patience, and he slowly understood what was going on.”\xa0\nMrs Tan used to receive updates about her son’s behaviour in school from Mdm Mastura almost every day. The teachers and allied educators also gave her tips on how to manage his behaviour at home.\xa0\n“For example, if he has a meltdown, give him some time. Maybe give him something for him to hold to manage his emotions. After a while, instead of scolding, (we should) ask him why (he is behaving this way). We have to understand him, understand his situation, understand his feelings and recognise it,” said Mrs Tan.\xa0\nNow in Primary 5, her son still needs support in some areas as he often feels stressed and finds mathematics especially difficult.\xa0\n“He’s weak in that. In the second week of school he told me it’s difficult and he is very stressed. (He) kept telling me it’s really tough and that he can’t make it. I said ‘you have to try’. We keep encouraging him,” said Mrs Tan.\nAdding that she is thankful for the help of the teachers and allied educators, she said: “It helped my son a lot, not just (in his) academics. Emotions, self-management, it built his confidence and supported us as well.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      'Targeted intervention' for Primary 1 students with social, behavioural needs in all schools by 2026
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Primary 1 students with social and behavioural needs will get ""targeted intervention"" in all schools by 2026, announced Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling on Wednesday (Mar 3).\nUnder the Transition Support for Integration or TRANSIT, students will get learning and behavourial support from allied educators and teachers in small groups and within their form classes. The programme aims to ease the children’s transition into primary school by helping them develop self-management skills.\nStudents will learn about good classroom work habits and managing their emotions, and develop their social and communication skills. Students learn these skills through a structured approach involving role-play, independent practice and coaching by trained staff.\n“By the end of P1, students should be able to learn independently in class, with occasional help,” said Ms Sun, speaking in Parliament during the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Committee of Supply debate.\nBy end-2021, the Education Ministry would have piloted TRANSIT in about 40 schools, or one in five primary schools, she added.\nDescribing the pilot outcomes as “promising”, Ms Sun said the programme will benefit about five to 10 Primary 1 students in each school per year.\nGrace Orchard School, which caters to students with mild intellectual disability and mild autism spectrum disorders, will be expanded. The school will take in 600 students between seven and 18 years old, up from 450 students now, said Ms Sun.\n“This is to help meet the demand for places in the west region and enhance the accessibility of SPED (special education) schools serving students with mild intellectual disability,” said Ms Sun.\nMOE will work in conjunction with social service agency staff to\xa0“improve students’ educational experiences”, she said.\xa0\nStudents can look forward to new vocational training facilities, larger classrooms and modulation spaces for students who also have autism spectrum disorders, as well as facilities for physical education classes and sports, Ms Sun said.\nEFFORTS FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS\nA pilot programme by the\xa0Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce, or UPLIFT, that supports disadvantaged students to help them attend school more regularly will also be expanded.\nThe UPLIFT Community Pilot\xa0started in January last year at Woodlands, Kreta Ayer and Boon Lay. It has supported about\xa0100 students, a number which will double by the end of this year and increased to more than 300 by 2022, said MOE in a separate press release.\xa0\nThe community pilot will be extended to Bukit Merah, said\xa0Second Minister for Education Maliki Osman.\nThe programme has “yielded positive outcomes”, with about 80 per cent of the students placed in the pilot in early-2020 attending school more regularly, he added.\xa0\nSince February this year, the programme’s coverage was expanded to include more students, such as those living in rental flats, said Dr Maliki.\xa0\nThe team is working to support students from about 70 schools living in the pilot sites by the end of this year, he added.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      Primary 1 registration framework under review to possibly increase Phase 2C places
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Primary 1 registration framework is undergoing a review on whether the number of places set aside for students without priority admission can be increased, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong on Wednesday (Mar 3).\xa0\nStudents who do not have priority admission apply to a school under Phase 2C, which is based on home-school distance, during Primary 1 registration. Each school sets aside 20 places for this phase.\nCompetition for places in popular schools has intensified in recent years, with more schools having to conduct balloting, said Mr Wong during the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Committee of Supply debate in Parliament.\n“Such popular schools are not limited to a particular locality ... As a result, even with the 20 places set aside for Phase 2C, some children do not get to attend a school near their home,” he said.\nHe agreed with suggestions from MP Patrick Tay (PAP-Pioneer) and Shawn Huang (PAP-Jurong) that the number of places in Phase 2C should be increased.\xa0\nMr Wong also said that MOE is sympathetic to appeals from these parents, “because there are many good reasons why children should be able to get a place in one of the schools near where they live”.\nThe ministry recognises that any increase in places for Phase 2C would mean greater competition in the earlier phases for more popular schools, he added.\nPhases 1 to 2A of the Primary 1 registration exercise are for children who have prior connections, such as those with siblings in the school or whose parents are former students.\nPhase 2B is for children whose parent is a volunteer at the school or is a community leader or a member endorsed by the church or clan connected with the school. Each school sets aside 20 places for this phase, in addition to the 20 places for Phase 2C.\n“We will have to study this carefully and balance the competing demands to give Singaporean children and their families a better chance at their school of choice, particularly if it is near their home, while still recognising the merits of providing some priority to certain groups,” said Mr Wong.\nCLASS SIZES\nIn his speech, Mr Wong also addressed Mr Patrick Tay, Associate Professor Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) and Ms Hazel Poa’s (NCMP) concerns and suggestions about class sizes.\nNoting that MPs compared Singapore’s larger class sizes to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) norms, he said: “I hope they understand that it is not that we have fewer teachers as compared to the OECD countries.”\xa0\nWhile there has been a “slight decline” in the teaching force in recent years, MOE has broadly maintained it at about 32,000, said Mr Wong.\xa0\n“Also, it is more relevant to compare our teacher numbers with our student enrolment numbers,” he added.\xa0\nThe pupil-teacher ratio has improved over the last decade, from about 19 in 2010 to 15 currently for primary schools, and from 16 to 12 for secondary schools. This is “comparable” to OECD averages, said Mr Wong.\xa0\nTeachers are deployed to where they can “maximise their impact”, such as at the earliest grade levels or where students have greater needs, he said.\nFor example, learning support programmes run in class sizes of eight to 10, said Mr Wong. Foundation classes in upper primary are taught in smaller classes of between 10 and 20 students, and classes for secondary students in the Normal (Technical) course are generally smaller.\xa0\n“Compared to other OECD countries, we also devote a larger share of our teachers’ time to important activities that are crucial for students’ holistic development, such as CCAs (co-curricular activities), like professional development and lesson preparation,” he added.\xa0\nAddressing Assoc Prof Lim’s suggestion that private tuition plays a role in Singaporean students doing well in international studies, Mr Wong said this is ""not being very fair"" to school teachers.\xa0\n“In fact, the OECD and other research point to teacher quality as being the critical element in influencing student learning and performance,” he said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ', '     MOE ', '     parliament ', '     Lawrence Wong ']}"

      Singapore's first university of the arts to be established in NAFA and LASALLE alliance
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore’s first arts university will be established in an alliance between the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) and LASALLE College of the Arts, Minister for Education Lawrence Wong announced on Wednesday (Mar 3).\xa0\nIt will be a private university supported by the Government, with LASALLE and NAFA as its two constituent colleges, and both will continue to remain as distinct schools offering their own programmes, he added.\xa0\nSpeaking during the Ministry of Education (MOE) Committee of Supply debate in Parliament, Mr Wong said: “MOE believes strongly in the need to nurture more diverse talents through our multiple\xa0education pathways. In our next phase of development, we will need this diversity of talent in STEM, and also in the arts, design and media.”\nAdding that the two institutions have\xa0“grown from strength to strength”, he added: “Because of the quality and standards that both LASALLE and NAFA have achieved, I\'m happy to share that MOE will grant the alliance its own degree-awarding powers, and also confer it university status. This\xa0will be our first university of the arts in Singapore.”\xa0\nThe university is expected to be set up within the next three to four years, MOE said in a press release.\nCurrently, LASALLE and NAFA award degrees in partnership with well-known overseas universities such as Goldsmiths, the Royal College of Music and the University of the Arts London, said Mr Wong, adding that programmes are subsidised by MOE.\xa0\nLASALLE and NAFA took in about 300 and 130 Singaporeans and permanent residents respectively for their degree programmes in the academic year of 2020, said MOE in a separate factsheet.\xa0\nThe Education Ministry, with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, will work with LASALLE and NAFA to establish the alliance, he added.\xa0\n“The university will draw on strengths from both colleges and drive synergies between them. For example, students in future can benefit from a more diverse range of offerings, with more opportunities to access cross-institution modules and projects, as well as share\xa0learning resources. Faculty can also look forward to more opportunities for joint academic collaborations,” said the Education Minister.\xa0\n“More importantly, we envisage the university to contribute more to cultural life in Singapore and the region, and to offer a stronger value proposition to its students and stakeholders.”\nFor example, a student enrolled in LASALLE could take modules at NAFA through the alliance and have those credits recognised in their curriculum at LASALLE.\xa0\nMOE has appointed a pro-tem committee to work with the two schools to develop the structure and operating model of the new arts university, and its work is expected to be completed by early 2023, said the Ministry in the press release.\xa0\nThere are similar models overseas, such as the National University of Ireland, the Conservatoire for Dance and Drama and the University of the Arts, London, where specialised tertiary institutions for the creative arts have come together as one body, said MOE in the factsheet.\xa0\nThe committee will take reference from these overseas models in working closely with LASALLE and NAFA to develop a model ""unique and relevant to the Singapore context"", said the ministry.\nFULL SUBJECT-BASED BANDING\nAbout 30 more secondary schools will implement full subject-based banding in 2022, Mr Wong said, in an update on the scheme.\xa0\nAdding that the initial findings from the first 28 pilot schools have been “very encouraging”, he said: “Students in the\xa0mixed form classes are learning well. They\'re making friends with classmates from different courses. More importantly, they are learning to respect and appreciate each other’s differences and strengths. And with a greater diversity of perspectives, classroom discussions are richer and livelier.\xa0\n“Some students attempting subjects at a more demanding level were naturally apprehensive at the start. But with support and encouragement from their teachers and classmates, they have been progressing well in their learning and enjoying their lessons.”\nThe remaining secondary schools will implement full subject-based banding over 2023 and 2024, he added.\xa0\nMOE is also reviewing post-secondary education pathways so that students have more opportunities to go to post-secondary courses aligned to their strengths and interests, said Mr Wong.\xa0\n“In particular, we will take steps to enhance our polytechnic and ITE education, to ensure that it remains responsive to the aspirations of our students and the needs of our future economy,” he added.\xa0\nSecond Minister for Education Maliki Osman is leading an ongoing review of opportunities and\xa0pathways in\xa0applied education.\xa0\nNoting that about 30 per cent of Nitec graduates today do not progress to Higher Nitec or other publicly funded upgrading pathways, Mr Wong said MOE is reviewing the curriculum structure to enable more students to attain a Higher Nitec certification.\nFor example, the ITE curriculum will be streamlined to allow more students to attain a Higher Nitec qualification in a shorter time, said Dr Maliki in his speech on Wednesday.\xa0\n“This will equip our ITE graduates with deeper industry-relevant skills, which provide stronger foundation for future skills upgrading. We will also ensure sufficient flexibility for students of different profiles under this new system to cater to different learning needs and paces,” he added.\xa0\nWith many ITE students also wanting to pursue a diploma, MOE will also expand the distinctive diploma offerings in the ITEs, said Mr Wong.\xa0\nThe ministry is also studying if the Polytechnic Foundation Programme can be expanded to cater to more students, beyond the current pool of Normal (Academic) students, said Dr Maliki.\xa0\nThe Common Entry Programmes, which target students interested in a polytechnic course cluster but are undecided about the specific course, will also be expanded to the arts, design and media and sciences clusters in all polytechnics from 2023, he announced.\xa0\nWith this change, about 25 per cent of Year 1 diploma students will enter polytechnic through a Common Entry Programme, up from the current 20 per cent, added Dr Maliki.\xa0\nThe programmes were last expanded in 2019 to include the business,\xa0information and digital technologies clusters, on top of the engineering clusters, he said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     NAFA ', '     parliament ']}"

      Commentary: Teachers can focus better if subjective, irrelevant factors removed from annual appraisals
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: I saw first-hand the dedication of our teachers last month when my daughter Ella started her Primary 1 journey.\nIt was not an easy transition for her. In her first week, she entered school every morning in tears.\nBut it was comforting for us to know the teachers were there. I saw them holding Ella’s hand and offering her a tissue to wipe her tears.\nThese experiences reminded me of how much the work of a teacher go beyond teaching to involve a larger labour of love.\nTeachers have a tough job. They devote time to create a nurturing environment for our children. We, in turn, should ensure they too have a nurturing environment to work in.\xa0\nYet today, teachers are ranked in their annual appraisal, a practice for some time that has gained concerns.\nSTRIDES IN MAKING EDUCATION A NURTURING EXPERIENCE\xa0\nMOE has done a lot to make education a more nurturing experience.\nWe stopped reminding students of how they are ranked in both class and level. We stopped grouping them into form classes based on academic abilities. We stopped comparing students to their peers when grading the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).\nThe message to students has been clear: Focus on your own learning. Don’t be distracted by how others are doing.\xa0\nAs then-Education Minister Ong put it in a 2018 address to school teachers: “Learning is not a competition, but a self-discipline you need to master for life”.\nIndeed, we have achieved much in helping our students focus on their own learning. But we have not done enough for our teachers.\nAs teachers tell students they will no longer be ranked and compared relative to their peers, they themselves ironically continue to be ranked and compared relative to other teachers.\nSTANDARISE APPRAISAL PROCESS\nI spoke up about this in Parliament last week. Instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water, I suggested we make the appraisal system more standardised, transparent, fair and formative, to better support our teachers to do their best work.\xa0\xa0\nMy first proposal is to standardise the appraisal process and require schools’ adherence.\xa0\nTeachers have shared with me that subjective and irrelevant considerations are sometimes taken into account in their assessment. One teacher said that some Reporting Officers (RO) who assesses the teacher, prefer “yes men”.\n“If you are one who asks questions and give alternate suggestions, you are deemed to be uncooperative and calculating”. It should worry us that some teachers feel this way.\xa0\nEven if the RO thinks that a teacher has met or exceeded his or her targets, strangely this doesn’t mean that the teacher will get a good grade. They have to fight for the teacher at the Ranking Panel, consisting of senior staff members who decide on the rank and grades of all teachers in the school.\nMany ROs, themselves, feel frustrated by the Ranking Panel. They flag the role of personalities and politics.\nOne RO said those on the panel tend to play up their own teachers while criticising others so that they themselves can be ranked as effective supervisors.\xa0\nAnother RO fretted about retaliation, saying that to speak up for unfairly ranked teachers means to risk “suffering the same fate”.\nWe should be concerned that some ROs feel this way.\xa0There is more that we can do to standardise the process. First, MOE can provide greater clarity to its guidelines.\nJust like the detailed marking rubrics used for students, existing guidelines like the Key Result Areas should be broken down by grade so teachers know what the specific standards required to achieve an A, B, C and so on are.\xa0\xa0\nClearer appraisal standards given to ROs and Ranking Panels make it harder for subjective and irrelevant considerations to enter into decision-making.\nSecond, MOE should formalise its guidelines on teacher appraisal. Good guidelines are not so useful if they can be ignored or circumvented.\xa0\nTeachers and ROs alike have said that the appraisal process varies sharply from school to school. These stricter standards will move us towards consistency, limit biases and emphasise the performance of teachers.\xa0\nFORMALISE GUIDELINES FOR APPRAISAL AND FEEDBACK\nMy second proposal is for MOE to enforce a clearer and more consistent feedback policy for performance appraisals. The feedback I hear is that teachers do not feel the process of ranking has been made transparent.\nCurrently, the feedback policy schools must follow when conducting their annual appraisal exercise are merely guidelines.\nSome teachers say the process is opaque, with information not proactively offered to some. One teacher even said: “The grades were never explained to me for the years I joined service”.\xa0\nEven when some teachers asked about the process, they are given no explanation. One teacher sought to understand why they received that grade, but their RO said that there was no way to discuss the performance grade.\xa0\nThere are many more stories like these.\xa0\nHow can anyone do better if they don’t know what they are doing wrong? It must be frustrating to be in such a situation.\xa0\nWe can work together with teachers to strengthen MOE’s communication policies and make it mandatory to follow. We can implement a whistle-blowing mechanism for teachers to use when their schools\xa0fail\xa0to abide by MOE’s communication policies on appraisal.\xa0\nTogether, these measures will foster a more transparent system where our teachers will always know how to do better.\nREMOVE QUOTAS FOR EACH GRADE\nThird, I propose we remove the quota for grades, so a teacher’s grade would no longer be affected by the limited number of As, Bs, Cs and Ds.\xa0\nToday, the mandatory quote means that 5 per cent of each school’s teachers must be graded C-, D or E. If you are a good teacher in a school overpopulated with super good teachers, the quota may see a terrible grade forced on you.\nThe quota would not be so painful if bad grades had little implications. But those receiving C- grades and below face a host of punitive measures, including ineligibility for promotion for three years and ineligibility for Professional Development Leave.\xa0\nWe should also remove punitive measures for C- grades and below. Performance management should be formative, not punitive.\nTeachers who have struggled should not be denied resources to grow or the prospect of being rewarded. Three years with zero chance of promotion is enough to make anyone lose interest in their profession.\xa0\nMOE would not be alone in this shift. Some of the most successful companies in the world have moved towards more flexible performance management systems.

      'A lost generation': COVID-19 takes emotional toll on Indonesia’s young
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA:\xa0It was the sudden loud cry of 10-year-old Indonesian Aisyah that caught her neighbours\' attention in South Tangerang, Banten province, one day in January.\xa0\nThey quickly rushed to her house, but since they knew Aisyah’s mother had contracted COVID-19 and was isolating at home, nobody dared to go in to see what had happened.\xa0\nThey decided to contact local authorities, which\xa0swiftly arrived at the scene and later informed them that Aisyah’s mother had died.\nThe case became viral\xa0following\xa0media reports\xa0and many Indonesians donated money to Aisyah, who is now under the care of the city\'s social workers.\xa0\n“She is now living temporarily with one of them for the sake of her trauma healing. If she were to be placed in a social welfare facility with other people, she could be anxious,” said Mr Wahyunoto Lukman, head of South Tangerang’s social affairs agency.\xa0\nAisyah\'s story is not unique, said Mdm Kanya Eka Santi, the director of children’s social rehabilitation at the Ministry of Social Affairs.\n“There are many cases like Aisyah, there’s not just only one,” she told CNA.\xa0\xa0\nWith more than 1.3 million COVID-19 cases and\xa0about 35,000 deaths, COVID-19 has affected Indonesia’s young generation in many ways.\xa0\nThe extent of the problem is significant,\xa0ranging from economic hardship and parental death to lack of access to education and basic rights, such as social interaction\xa0and many more, said Mdm Santi.\xa0\nHowever, she and several other officials CNA spoke to said there is no data\xa0on the number of affected children\xa0in the vast country of 270 million people.\nTo give a rough idea of the scale of the problem, Mdm Santi said that Gresik regency in East Java province alone has more than 150 cases of children impacted by COVID-19.\xa0\nIndonesia has more than 400 regencies and about 100 cities.\nIt has been a year since President Joko Widodo announced the first two COVID-19 cases\xa0in early March last year, and the disease has continued to rage in the country, resulting in an overwhelmed healthcare system and battered economy.\xa0\nThese, along with decreased learning time,\xa0may spell\xa0uncertainty for the future of the young generation,\xa0even though the risk of severe COVID-19 is relatively small in youngsters.\xa0\xa0\nFORMAL EDUCATION HINDERED BY SCHOOL CLOSURE\n“Mummy, when can I ride my bike again? When can I play outdoors again with my friends?”\nSuch was the constant questioning from Ari Santy Purba’s eight-year-old daughter, the younger of two\xa0siblings.\nMdm Purba could only answer: “We have to take care of ourselves carefully.\xa0Look what happened to daddy, he died of COVID-19.”\nMdm Purba lives in Langsa, Aceh province, with her younger child since her husband died of COVID-19 last September.\xa0Her elder son, 13, attends an Islamic boarding school.\xa0\nWhen the pandemic broke out, schools in Indonesia all moved online,\xa0and Mdm Purba’s child was\xa0isolated from her friends. Save the Children, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), estimated that\xa0more than 60 million children have their education interrupted as more than 646,000 schools were closed since mid-March last year.\xa0\n“I didn’t let her go out. I was\xa0very traumatised. She was just at home reading stuff,” said Mdm Purba.\nAbout half a month ago, schools in Langsa reopened as the city was downgraded from a red zone to an orange zone after COVID-19 cases fell.\xa0\nNow Mdm Purba’s daughter, who is in second grade, goes to school twice a week.\xa0\nAlthough she felt it is still not sufficient, the 38-year-old said the reduced learning time is better than nothing.\xa0\nAt the moment, there are about 40 COVID-19 red zones in Indonesia, where schools must remain closed. A survey released by the education agency of Cimahi city in West Java province in mid-February revealed that almost 15 per cent of second graders in Cimahi cannot read and write, though the cause was not stated.\xa0\nIn East Java province, head of Surabaya’s city education agency Supomo, who goes by one name, concurred that the pandemic has disrupted the lives of children.\n“The impact is that they can\'t go to school, their activities are limited.\n""Some have handphones, some don\'t. We send\xa0assignments regularly to their homes, and continue to add various kinds of activities online such as competitions and so on, and hopefully they will continue to concentrate on education,"" he told CNA.\nMr Supomo said online learning is not ideal, but it is the best solution to the current condition.\nIn early February, Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) said it has received 6,519 reports related to the violations of children\'s rights in\xa02020.\xa0According to Indonesian law, a child is a person who is below 18 years old.\nAbout 1,500 of the reports involved rights to education, such as no access to online learning and limited ability to follow\xa0learning activities.\nThe impact and consequences are many and varied, said Save the Children\'s\xa0deputy for programme impact and policy Tata Sudrajat.\nOther than affecting the\xa0children\'s future abilities in accessing higher education as well as landing employment opportunities, the current learning loss may also result in\xa0less motivation to return to schools, he said.\xa0\nThis might cause higher dropout\xa0rates and result in child labour and child marriage due to economic pressure.\xa0""All of these could result in having a\xa0lost generation, because their contribution to society\xa0when they are adults will not be as significant as\xa0other children who have uninterrupted education before the\xa0pandemic,"" Mr Sudrajat added.\xa0\nPARENTAL LOSS DUE TO COVID-19\nMeanwhile, COVID-19 clusters within\xa0families\xa0and alternative parenting make up\xa0the bulk of the reports received by the KPAI.\xa0\nAmong the 1,622 cases were children whose either or both parents passed away due to COVID-19, and have to be placed under the care of relatives.\xa0\nAny form of adoption or foster must be done through a legal process, which was the case when Bandung-based Mr Ismet wanted to be the guardian of his twin nieces last year.\nMr Ismet, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, said when his youngest sister died of COVID-19 last April, she told him that he should take care of her 17-year-old twins who lived in Palu.\nAlthough the twins’ father is still alive, he is\xa0unemployed and believed to have violent tendencies.\nThe father rejected the will but social workers concluded that he is not eligible to take care of the girls, Mr Ismet said.\xa0\nAfter six months, all legal work was done and the twins moved to Bandung to be with Mr Ismet.\nSince they suffer from some form of psychological trauma, the social affairs agency provided them with a psychologist.\nFor their daily needs, Mr Ismet and his other sibling chip in.\n“I don’t mind taking care of them because my children are both adults and have their own job,” he said.\nMdm Fia in Sampang, East Java, who only wanted to be known by her first name, said she is now the caretaker of her youngest sister, who is\xa017,\xa0when their father died of COVID-19 last November.\xa0\nTheir mother had earlier passed away in 2018.\nAs the oldest of five siblings, Mdm Fia, who is a mother of three children aged between three and 12,\xa0felt it was her responsibility to take care of her sister.\n“She is still sad when she thinks of (our father’s) death.”\nBut Mdm Fia was unsure\xa0whether she can continue to provide for her\xa0sister financially. Her sister is currently\xa0in high school and they have another sibling who is still in university.\xa0\n""I do wonder whether I can support both their needs, but\xa0I must until they finish university,” she said.\xa0\nFINANCIAL WOES LEAD TO MORE PROBLEMS\nWith the pandemic affecting daily lives, many adults in Indonesia are facing\xa0economic problems, which has a direct impact on their children.\xa0\nMdm Siti Aisyah in Surabaya lost her husband last October and now wonders what the future holds for her and her children.\xa0\nShe is a housewife and has four children, the youngest being 13.\nEmotional pain aside, it has been\xa0hard for the 48-year-old housewife\xa0as her husband used to provide for their daily needs. They have been depending on the kindness of their relatives to make ends meet.\xa0\n“And since life goes on, I cannot depend\xa0continuously on our family,” said Mdm Aisyah.\nShe plans to be a small trader\xa0to make ends meet once her grieving period is over.\xa0\nThe adults\' struggle could lead to other problems\xa0such as violence.\xa0\nAccording to KPAI’s report,\xa042.4 per cent of mothers and 32.3 per cent of fathers said they have committed physical violence towards their children last year.\nMeanwhile, 73 per cent of mothers and 69.6 per cent of fathers admitted to having committed psychological violence towards their children.\xa0\nMdm Rut Ida Meliani, 56, in Jakarta told CNA that she thought of ending her own life and her disabled son\'s.\xa0\nThe housewife lost her husband last March and was struggling to run his\xa0small bedding business at a traditional market while taking care of her 19-year-old son, who is visually impaired, autistic and has limited communication skills.\xa0\nShe sought help from her son’s school, hoping\xa0that she could place him in their care while she is at work.\xa0\nThe school rejected the idea and reminded Mdm Meliani that her son will soon graduate from the school when he is 20 years old.\xa0\n“I was very stressed out. I thought: ‘Is my son such a burden to you?’ I just wanted to meet my financial needs first because we are in debt.\n“They told me to hire a maid but I can\'t afford one,” she said.\xa0\nThe only family members\xa0she has are her widowed sisters and she does not want to be a burden to them.\n“I thought of taking my life and my son’s. I couldn\'t handle it. I couldn\'t\xa0handle it,” she told CNA while crying.\nNO GOVERNMENT SCHEMES FOR CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS\nSince the pandemic hit, the Indonesian government has\xa0focused on controlling the spread of COVID-19 infections with lockdowns and travel restrictions.\xa0Its vaccination programme recently kicked off with Mr Widodo receiving the jabs, and 181.5 million people are expected to be inoculated by early next year.\nTo lessen people\'s burden financially, the government has provided social aid in the form of staple food and financial aid, as well as tax incentives\xa0for\xa0small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).\xa0\nMdm Santi from the social affair ministry said while it does not have specific schemes tailored for children impacted by COVID-19, social aids\xa0and psychosocial support are provided.\xa0\n“Our budget is limited, but at least we can support …\xa0be it by providing food or clothes.\n“And if the children are still grieving, we can also support them with therapy.""\nA senior official\xa0at the Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection told CNA that it has programmes to empower widows.\n“We have training so they can be empowered and continue with their business,”\xa0said Mr Nahar.\nIf the parent is financially stable, the children will likely be in good hands, he added.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     children ', '     education ']}"

      Tokyo high schools ask students to certify hair colour not altered: Report

      Ghim Moh resident sets up community children’s library at her lift landing to share the joy of reading
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: There are fewer than 50 books in this children’s library, but it has already proven to be a hit among some residents in Ghim Moh.\n“One of the families here, they have young children, and then a few floors down as well. They’re still toddling so they will walk up the stairs, they will come over … Sometimes I see the books being removed or reshuffled and I know they (were) here. And then my neighbours (will say), oh yeah, we see little children coming up,” said Ms Yvonne Looi with a laugh.\nThe self-described full-time mum is the architect behind the Little Library, which is a small reading nook that she set up at her lift landing on the 39th floor. Less than two months old, it boasts two chairs, several cushions and a lot of natural lighting - an ideal environment for a quiet afternoon of reading.\nMost of the books are children’s books, and include classic titles from Enid Blyton and collections of fairy tales and bedtime stories. There are one or two books for adults as well, a bonus for parents sifting through the selection.\nOther than the books, Ms Looi also contributed the chair, left behind by a friend, the wooden crate to hold the books, a plant from her living room and an old frame from her mother.\nThe Little Library gained some attention after Ms Looi posted about it in Facebook groups Books Don’t Throw and Viral Kindness SG in January. Since then, she has received six to eight offers from strangers wanting to contribute their own books to the library, with about five more parents indicating their interest in visiting the library.\nWhile it is called a library, anyone is free to keep the books or share them with others, and people can also contribute any books that they have on hand.\nShe is mindful that some might be worried about the risk of contracting COVID-19, which is why she left a note that visitors do not have to return the books if they do not want to, or to clean and sanitise the books if they intend to bring them back. She also left a bottle of hand sanitiser out and sanitises the library daily.\nCREATING A COMMUNITY OF BOOK-LOVERS\nThe idea for a community library started when Ms Looi, a book lover, came across some well-kept books being thrown away. As she rescued the books, she realised that some people might not know where to bring unwanted books.\nShe also wanted to start something, to get to know the community of “book-loving families” at her place.\nHer neighbours have been “supportive” of the initiative, she said, and Ms Looi has been telling residents she meets in the lifts about her library. She also told her community of young mothers in the neighbourhood - a group which she started - about the library.\nShe feels the “kampung spirit” and a sense of community when people visit her library, she said, as she gets to meet people that she does not really see.\nShe has even made friends through the library. Ms Sundari Paramasivan, 49, who lives nearby, is a contributor who found out about Ms Looi’s library through her Facebook posts.\n“I thought it was very cute and it was coincidental that I also happen to live in Ghim Moh,” said Ms Sundari. Although her children have already grown up, she is still holding on to some books they read as children, she said.\n“(Reading books) is a shared time with your child, so you want to pass it on to somebody you know would use it,” she said. “I thought it was a good initiative, and that if there was any way I could help, that would make it meaningful for me too.”\nRetired librarian Mary Jacobs Mathew, 70, was “so encouraged” when she saw Ms Looi’s Facebook post.\n“I feel that reading is really going to become a lost art … If you can do anything to encourage your child to get books when they’re young and hook them in then, it would be wonderful,” she said.\n“I just feel that the books can send you to different worlds and it helps with your imagination.”\nShe added that young parents might find it difficult to bring young children to the library, and having a children’s library in proximity could help. Books could also be a door to a “bigger world” for children who don’t have the means to travel, she said.\nSHARING THE JOY OF READING\nEven though she had no expectations of the library when first starting out, Ms Looi is heartened to see her two sons take on the spirit of sharing.\n“Sometimes my son will say, 'oh, mummy wait, this one we have two copies, or this one I’m already done, maybe we can give it to other people, who have (no books)' … It’s the idea of, okay, if I have enough or I’m done, somebody else can take a turn,” she said.\nEventually, she hopes that the library can get its own proper space, so that more people have access to the books, and she has already brought it up with the town council.\n“So later on, who knows? Maybe at different estates or different neighbourhoods, we can have that ready to promote the act of book-loving and just giving away,” she said, adding that she envisions a reading nook next to every playground, or even a small library at each lift landing.\nOn what she hopes the reading corners can achieve, Ms Looi said: “I think it would just be to love a book and really to appreciate (them). To connect people together, that’s my aim … and you can share the joy of reading.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Community ', '     education ']}"

      Students in Malaysia to return to schools from Mar 1 onwards: Education minister
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Students in Malaysia will return to schools in phases, beginning with pre-schoolers as well as Primary 1 and Primary 2 students on Mar 1.\xa0\nIn a press conference on Friday (Feb 19), Senior Minister for Education Mohd Radzi Md Jidin said the rest of the primary students will return to schools a week later on Mar 8.\xa0\n""For secondary schools, all levels will attend schools on Apr 4 or Apr 5 (depending\xa0on states),"" he said.\xa0\nThose in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu will return to their classrooms on\xa0Apr 4, while the rest on Apr 5.\xa0\nThe dates apply to all government and private schools registered with the ministry, the minister said.\nDr Mohd Radzi explained that pre-schoolers and the lower primary students have been scheduled to\xa0start schools\xa0earlier to enable teachers to get their young charges familiarised with the schools\' standard operating procedures (SOP).\xa0\n""This also allows teachers and parents to find the best way to handle dispersal at the end of the schooling day,"" he added.\nMeanwhile, he explained that the first week of April had been selected for secondary students to\xa0resume schooling due to\xa0logistics, as the school-leaving Malaysian Education Certificate (SPM) exams would require more space compared to previous years.\xa0\nDelayed from last year, the\xa0SPM exams, to be held from Feb 22 to Mar 25, would take up more space than just an exam hall, the minister added.\n""The SOPs are\xa0very detailed and tight to ensure our children who are going to sit for SPM can do so in a safe and calm manner.\n""This time, we are also prepping alternative rooms for students to take their exams, as well as transit rooms for those who are taking perhaps two papers on the same day,"" Dr Mohd Radzi said.\xa0\nTherefore, the ministry decided to resume secondary schooling after the mid-semester break, which begins at the end of March until the first week of April.\xa0\nCurrently, the states of Selangor, Johor and Penang as well as the federal territory\xa0of Kuala Lumpur is under the movement control order (MCO), while other states are under conditional MCO or recovery MCO.\xa0\xa0\nNational COVID-19 case tally stood at 274,875 as of Thursday.\xa0\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted Malaysian students\' education for most of last year, when Malaysia went into its first MCO\xa0on March 18.\nSchools, along with all non-essential businesses, were closed and interstate movement was curbed. Major school-leaving examinations were postponed to 2021.\xa0\nAs a result, teachers sought workarounds, such as conducting classes via Zoom and other video-conferencing apps, to help students keep up with their studies.\xa0\nHome-based learning proved to be challenging for some, as those in rural areas grapple with connectivity issues while less well-to-do families do not have enough electronic devices for their children.\xa0\xa0\nSchools\xa0reopened later in phases from mid-July onwards as case numbers dropped.\xa0On Oct 14, schools in the states of\xa0Selangor and Sabah and federal territories of\xa0Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya were shut again due to rising infections.\nThis shutdown was later extended nationwide from Nov 9, ahead of the last day of the school year on Dec 17 and 18, depending on states.\xa0\nThis meant most students in Malaysia only attended school\xa0in person for about five to six months in 2020.\nPhysical school sessions began on Jan 20 this year only for those sitting for school-leaving examinations.\xa0\nDidikTV KPM, a\xa0special television channel dedicated to educational content, was launched by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Wednesday as an effort to increase access to education for students nationwide.\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

Graduates on the SGUnited Traineeships Programme made up 16.9 percentage points of this figure.\xa0\nAbout half of this group said they were in involuntary part-time or temporary employment, a sharp increase from the more than one-third of this group in 2019, the survey showed.\xa0\nAbout 1.5 per cent of graduates found freelance work, down from 2 per cent in 2019.\xa0\nOverall, 93.6 per cent of graduates found employment within six months of completing their final examinations, up from 90.7 per cent in 2019.\xa0\nThe median gross monthly salary among fresh graduates in permanent full-time jobs was S$3,700, up from S$3,600 in 2019, said the universities in the press release.\xa0\nSimilar to 2019, graduates from information and digital technologies, health sciences and business clusters registered the highest percentages of permanent full-time employment, the survey showed.\xa0\nMost clusters saw no change in median gross monthly salaries, but those in arts, design and media, engineering, and information and digital technologies saw increases of S$100, S$150 and S$360 respectively in 2020.\xa0\nEMPLOYMENT STATUS OF GRADUATES IN FOLLOW-UP SURVEY\nIn a follow up survey, 827 graduates from NUS, NTU and SMU were surveyed on their employment status on Nov 1, 2020. This was conducted for courses that typically require post-graduate practical training before the graduates can practise in their professions.\xa0\xa0The graduates polled were from the Architecture class of 2017, and the biomedical sciences and Chinese medicine, law, medicine, and pharmacy courses who finished their first year of training upon graduation in 2019.\xa0Of those who were employed, 96.8 per cent had jobs after completing their training last year, a slight decrease from 98.6 per cent in 2019, the survey showed.\xa0\n93.5 per cent of those employed had secured permanent full-time jobs, a slight decrease from 96.4 per cent in 2019. Another 0.3 per cent were freelancing, compared to 0.6 per cent the previous year.\xa0\nThe proportion of those in part-time or temporary employment also increased to 3 per cent, up from 1.6 per cent in 2019. Graduates under the SGUnited Traineeship Programme made up 1.3 percentage points of this figure, said the universities in the press release.\xa0\nOf those in part-time or temporary employment, slightly more than half said this was involuntary.\xa0\nThe median gross monthly salary of those who found permanent full-time jobs in this group dropped from S$4,800 in 2019 to S$4,625 in 2020.\xa0\nThe surveys for SIT and SUTD graduates are currently ongoing and will be released at a later date, the press release read.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     employment ']}"

      Why are kids so motivated to learn Math on this e-learning platform? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'Traditionally, learning has been largely associated with having teachers and students in a physical classroom. But with the pandemic upending life as we know it, the educational ecosystem has had to evolve to enable students to learn effectively beyond the four walls of the classroom.\xa0\nAt a virtual live session last year titled After the Pandemic: Reimagining Education,\xa0Minister for Education Mr Lawrence Wong spoke about the potential\xa0of integrating technology into schools to take learning beyond traditional classrooms and into homes as well –\xa0a blended model of learning.\xa0\xa0\nAN AWARD-WINNING MATH E-LEARNING PLATFORM FOR PRIMARY SCHOOL STUDENTS\nAccording to Mr Stanley Han, chief executive officer of Singapore-based e-learning platform KooBits, KooBits has been a partner of Ministry of Education (MOE) schools for the past six years and is currently being used by nearly half of primary schools.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\nIts flagship product, KooBits Math, is a personalised Mathematics e-learning platform based on the latest MOE syllabus for children in Primary 1 to 6.\nWinner of the 2015 Bett Asia and IDA: EdTech Excellence Award, KooBits currently has the largest user base of primary school students in Singapore compared to other e-learning solutions here, Mr Han shared.\xa0\nKooBits was co-developed with educators and child development experts for effective blended learning. It uses interactive, media-rich animations and personalisation technology to help children practise and learn Math skills on their own in a safe digital environment. An accompanying\xa0app helps parents to track their children’s learning progress.\xa0\nMdm Sabrina Ahmad said she noticed a significant improvement in her son’s Math grades and learning attitude since he started using KooBits in Primary 4.\xa0\n“From borderline passes, his Math has moved up one grade. I hope that by the time he sits for his PSLE, he would be able to get a B or an A,” she said.\nNURTURING CONFIDENT, SELF-DIRECTED LEARNERS\n“We strongly believe that given the right environment and guidance, every child can become a confident, self-directed\xa0learner and an independent thinker,”\xa0said Mr Han. “At KooBits, we want to harness the power of technology to give every child the opportunity and environment to thrive and learn effectively.”\nTo encourage this and cater to different learning styles, such as visual, auditory and kinaesthetic, KooBits features animated explanations that transform complex concepts into easy-to-understand visual instructions.\xa0 This enables children to quickly absorb knowledge, improve their focus and remain engaged throughout the learning process, thereby enhancing their motivation to learn.\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0For instance, if the child has an issue doing a particular problem, he or she can immediately access animated explanations on KooBits to understand how to solve the question. These step-by-step explanations are available at any time, so the child gets instant help without having to wait for teachers or\xa0parents to go through the solutions with him or her, Mr Han explained.\xa0\nMdm Shyamli Prakash said her nine-year-old son Atharva Kohgave, who loves Math, has been using KooBits since he was in Primary 2.\xa0\n“The videos are very clear and even when he makes a mistake, he can learn from the step-by-step solutions,” she said, adding that she has recommended the e-learning platform to her friends with children in primary school.\nThe language used in many learning resources tends to be factual and instructional. However, KooBits uses a child-friendly instructional design formula that engages young minds through questions, affirmations and encouragement, much like having a fun, approachable teacher communicating in an interactive way with your child.\nMr Han shared that KooBits’ personalisation technology tracks the meaningful user behaviour patterns of each child. One way in which KooBits does this is by tracking knowledge-decay\xa0patterns, such as when the child naturally loses touch of older concepts learnt previously.\xa0\nBy converting these patterns into actionable information, in the form of proficiency reports for example, children can then proactively work on closing those knowledge gaps. This allows them to take charge of their learning, Mr Han said.\nIn addition, KooBits uses motivation techniques through the use of gamification like points and rewards.\xa0\n“This makes doing Math a rewarding experience for kids. In this way, they build healthy learning habits, and also end up mastering Math skills,” Mr Han said.\xa0\nSince its foray into the digital learning space in 2014, KooBits has engaged more than 200,000 students on its platform. Students from over 45 countries, such as the Philippines, Australia, United Kingdom and the United States, use KooBits every day.\nBUILT-IN FEATURES TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY LEVELS OF SCREEN TIME\xa0\nDeveloped as a child-safe platform, KooBits incorporates features such as auto-parental control tools to manage screen time as well as time limit settings. For example, there is a 25-minute daily limit for the Math games feature, and activities on the platform are until 10pm, in time for the child’s bedtime.\xa0\nKooBits also verifies users to ensure they are real students, making it a safe online community. The platform is ad-free and all content is vetted by its educator team.\xa0\nInitially concerned about her children’s exposure to excessive online activities and screen time, mother of three Estee Goh said she changed her mind about KooBits after learning more about it and seeing how it benefits her children.\nPractising mathematics on KooBits is now part of the daily learning routine for Mdm Goh’s older children, aged eight and 10, since they were introduced to it in primary school. She especially likes the time limit feature that ensures screen time is kept at healthy levels.\n“My children are very motivated to do the questions and challenges. Initially, I wasn’t in favour of having anything online for them but after looking at the questions on KooBits and seeing how KooBits benefits them, I have peace of mind and there is now one less subject for me to worry about,” she said.\xa0\nLearn more about KooBits and sign up for a free trial.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Commentary: Your PE teacher’s secret headaches during a year of COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Despite the disruption wrought by COVID-19, the pandemic has been a massive learning moment of interest to us educators.\nCompared to many other countries, we should count ourselves fortunate our children had their learning minimally impacted, in part, thanks to a nimble education system and teachers who worked hard to find innovative ways to engage the children even during the circuit breaker.\nThis is no mean feat. Our educators had to re-think and re-design pedagogical practices leveraging technology to sustain and even to some extent, enhance teaching and learning across the school curriculum.\nCredit too goes to parents at home, playing part time IT support and part time supplementary teacher.\nYet in this, one subject stands out: Physical Education (PE). COVID-19 has challenged PE teachers in designing meaningful lessons and ensuring the goals of PE are still intact even as classes are transformed. \xa0\nCHALLENGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY COVID-19\nMore than any other subject, the teaching of PE has been challenged by this pandemic.\nThrowing and catching an object to oneself is different compared to learning in a pair or in small, socially distanced groups, both of which became impossible during the circuit breaker.\nHome-based Learning (HBL) took away the critical platform for students to see one another physically and robbed us of the mainstay of team sports to teach PE. HBL also posed the big challenge of sustaining attention when children have shorter attention spans.\nOver Zoom, teachers have had to pay attention in order to intervene to check on student progression and tailor activities according to each child’s proficiency level.\nWhat has been lost goes beyond the element of play, when PE aims to reinforce decision-making and problem-solving, through physical activities and games.\nCollaborative skills in fair play, teamwork and lessons of sportsmanship that could have been developed with physical communication when playing and interacting with their peers was also absent during HBL.\nThe result is the loss of learning in exercising and developing the muscle as well as the mind for such psychomotor and leadership skills.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nListen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys\xa0in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\nMAINTAINING THE GOALS OF PE IN THE FACE OF COVID-19\nMost people tend to have poor, rudimentary ideas of what PE is about and how it contributes to a child’s development.\nMany have in mind an image of PE as having our children run around a field. The PE educator is often seen as the Regimental Sergeant Major dictating instructions for the session.\nThis cannot be further from the truth. PE lessons have evolved from the days where physical fitness overwhelmingly is the chief goal of PE.\nToday, the objective of effective PE programmes is to spur the holistic development of an individual in the major domains of learning: Psychomotor, perceptual, cognitive and affective so our children can enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.\nIn Singapore, one key goal is developing a child’s range of fundamental movement skills (throwing, catching, hopping, running, bouncing a ball) that supports their participation in a variety of lifestyle activities.\nBut in this, PE is not about getting our children to repeatedly practise kicking a ball to get some sort of a correct form.\nRather, effective PE is about providing opportunities for our students to move, develop self-awareness along with agility, endurance and strength and make good-decisions to enjoy physical activity in and out of school. The aim is to develop a healthy level of physical fitness that also strengthens mental health and general well-being.\nADJUSTING TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC: THE NEW NORMAL\nOne can imagine when COVID-19 struck and when our PE teachers had to quickly transit into HBL, the impact on the way our children acquire movement skills, knowledge and values was huge.\nEspecially challenging was the fact that the venues where PE lessons were conducted – i.e., school fields, indoor sports halls, the swimming pools or even the neighbourhood parks - were now inaccessible.\nTechnology kicked in, as PE lessons shifted online to platforms like Zoom and Google Classroom or lessons delivered through the Student Learning Space (the nationwide digital platform for interactive teaching and learning) where asynchronous learning could take place.\nFor example, students could record themselves on video, learning or being involved in physical activities (e.g., like aerobic exercises, basic strength conditioning) at their own time even beyond the fixed lesson slots and post it online for evaluation.\nIndividual learning with home-made equipment or minimal need of equipment became the order of the day for HBL PE lessons (for example, using towels as objects to throw with the laundry basket as a target).\nEven after moving out of the circuit breaker and back in schools for face-to-face lessons, PE teachers had to think out of the box to adhere to strict physical-distancing measures to conduct lessons, requiring new activities to be designed.\nThere was greater emphasis on individual learning activities where students were provided with their own physical space during PE lessons to develop fundamental movement skills.\nI have personally witnessed how students were assigned to small groups for every PE lesson and what the constraints on mingling among groups posed, as a teacher educator and mentor to student teachers in the National Institute of Education.\nMore time also had to be allocated at the start and end of each lesson to allow students to clean the equipment used and to observe strict personal hygiene.\nThis was disruptive yet necessary. In retrospect, this essential exercise may have had aided the PE curriculum, as it reinforced lessons of developing good habits. It also heightened the importance of collective safety, with PE providing the platform to exercise taking personal responsibility for the common good.\nPE has not been divorced from the varied impact on groups of students. Some students were excited by the opportunity to don their PE attire and experience PE lessons in the confines of their homes while being active together with their classmates via online platforms. Some with smaller homes were not as fortunate.\nSo it is no surprise that even with the new safe distancing restrictions, most students were thrilled to just get out to the courts and fields during PE lessons when they returned to school.\nINNOVATION AS A WAY FORWARD: PEDAGOGY LEADING THE WAY\nPE lessons today continue to be very different compared to pre-COVID-19 days. We probably are some time from returning to that state.\nIt is not ideal but PE teachers demonstrated grit and adaptability across the island in rising to meet these challenges and leveraged technology to engage students.\nWhile technology has shown new possibilities of doing old things during this global pandemic, we should also be aware that there are still learning experiences that technology cannot fully substitute - i.e. the role of an educator and especially one in the context of PE.\nPerhaps this coronavirus will unleash a new PE pedagogy that harness the fresh potential technology offers.\nAfter all, the sole use of technology had constrained PE lessons at first but as educators designed lessons for the channel, the tide turned.\nChow Jia Yi is an associate professor at the Physical Education and Sports Science Academic Group, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ']}"

      No jobs for a fresh grad? She discovered it’s not true — if you learn how to tap the opportunities
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: When she graduated in May, in the middle of Singapore’s worst recession since independence, Margaret Anthony played it cool at first.\nMonths earlier, before COVID-19 was a thing, the Arts, Design and Media student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) had wanted to have a job waiting for her right after graduation. So she started sending out her résumé.\nWhen nothing came of her applications, even after May arrived, she thought it best to “adapt” and “accept” that finding a job would be difficult.\n“Just take it slow and take it easy,” she told herself. “Everybody around me is facing the same issues … I think it’s okay.”\nThe first signs that things were not “okay” came in June when a few friends from school started going for interviews and even landing jobs.\n“I was like, ‘Huh? So maybe something’s wrong somewhere.' Is my résumé not good enough?” she wondered. “Was there not enough … experience?”\nShe soon started to blame herself for being “idle” and not doing internships from her first year at university. “Aiyo, Margaret, why did you just slack off?” she chided herself.\nDiscouraged, she had a half a mind to give up on the job hunt.\nPREPPING FOR THE WORKFORCE\nEven before Margaret graduated, she had envisioned working in a creative agency or a company doing “tech-based art work”.\nAs an undergraduate specialising in interactive media, she did a lot of assignments involving interactive art installations, using technology like sensors and “spatial design”. She had also done an internship in graphic design in her third year.\nAnd to boost her chances of getting into an agency, she took up another internship — in user interface design — last March, three months before graduation, while trying to complete her final-year project.\n“I was kind of overwhelmed by schoolwork,” she said. “(But) I decided to take the opportunity to try out something new to build my portfolio in user experience.”\nThe internship at the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth involved helping to create material to raise public awareness of the COVID-19 situation, she said.\nThus “fully occupied”, she put her job search on the back burner. It did not strike her as significant that the eight job applications she’d submitted at the end of 2019 via just one job portal had met with silence.\nBy the time she graduated, the job market had shrunk considerably.\nWATCH: A fresh grad's job hunt in a recession (7:33)\nShe took a while to realise there were more job search platforms, like LinkedIn and Indeed.com, that she could try. She continued looking to join companies only in the creative industry. Not casting her net wider was not her only mistake, however.\nHITTING THE RESET BUTTON\nWhen Margaret was not getting replies from employers, she checked her résumé again and sought guidance from her friends, NTU’s career and attachment office, and the MyCareersFuture.gov.sg national job portal, which offers customised advice.\nShe realised she needed to rework her job-hunting strategy. “The biggest mistake I made was applying without customising based on what (employers) required,” she said.\nI had just sent the same application to everyone.\nShe also re-read the requirements for those jobs and saw there were some technical skills she lacked. She could not help feeling that she was “not good enough”.\nBut that’s when she began to draw on some past life lessons.\nA playful student in junior college, she was retained in her first year. She also took her A Levels twice to get better grades.\nIt was a wake-up call at the time. This “made me realise I had to focus and plan ahead”, she said. “I didn’t want to end up in a situation of not knowing where to go.”\nAlthough she did not get into NTU the first time she applied, she kept working on her portfolio by picking up new skills like calligraphy and creating new artwork. She also enrolled in a communication degree course at the Singapore Institute of Management.\nThe second time she submitted her portfolio, she impressed the NTU lecturers, and got in.\nLooking back on that journey, she now steeled herself for the job search once again. “If there’s anything that’s a shortcoming, I’ll know how to prepare to overcome it,” she told herself.\nShe also took heart from her father’s advice. “(He) told me, ‘I understand that it’s difficult, but it’s important for you to keep trying, and also try different things because … you’ll learn a lot more,’” she recounted.\nBREAKTHROUGH\nThe turning point for Margaret came in June, when the SGUnited Traineeships Programme started accepting applications from fresh graduates to boost their employability. “It was quite amazing,” she said. “There were so many jobs available.”\nAnd they were in a range of industries. “I stopped just looking for creative companies and creative agencies, and went beyond that.”\nShe applied for nearly 90 traineeships, each with a duration of up to 12 months, which would equip her with industry experience. In late August, after a 10-month job search, she had good news at last.\nPSA International offered her a traineeship contract for the position of innovation executive, which entailed administering, developing and executing engagement programmes to bring a more innovative culture to the port operator’s 50 locations across 26 countries.\nDescribing her “relief”, she said: “Finally, there’s someone who thinks that the skills I own can (have) some usefulness or some meaning.\nIt was during my birthday season, so the job was like a present.\nThe opportunity also brought back memories: Her maternal grandfather used to be a forklift driver at the port. “My mum used to tell us stories of how he had to be very careful with (the cargo),” she recalled.\nSTEPPING OUT OF HER COMFORT ZONE\nWhile Margaret wondered if she could adapt to a different industry, she knew that if she was able to, it would prove her versatility.\nHer “enthusiasm” was something the company welcomed, said Victor Ang, the regional head of technology and innovation at PSA International, Middle East and South Asia.\n“We were looking for somebody who’s … very open to new ideas (and) willing to try things that are different from what they were used to in school,” he said.\nSince starting her traineeship in September, Margaret has realised that “creativity isn’t limited to a single industry”. Her team has data scientists, auditors, engineers and more, and “the interesting aspect is that everybody in the team is creative”.\n“As a fresh grad going into an industry that’s completely different from what I’ve studied, I thought that I wouldn’t be able to contribute to the best of my skills,” she said. “(But) my colleagues/supervisors … gave me confidence.”\nWhen her traineeship ends, PSA will review its operational needs and her performance to decide whether to offer her a full-time job. Even if that does not happen, she is optimistic that the stint will benefit her.\n“I’ve learnt a lot about communication (and) teamwork,” she said. “These are the things that would help me a lot in other jobs to come.”\nHer struggle to find a job as a fresh graduate also affirmed to her the importance of perseverance.\n“Had I given up some time back, I wouldn’t have ended up here,” she said. “If you keep trying, somehow somebody will feel that your skills are meaningful and that you can contribute.”\nThis story by CNA Insider was done in collaboration with Gov.sg.

      NUS Press says it chose not to publish essays on Thai politics after consulting with 'stakeholders inside and outside the university'
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The National University of Singapore (NUS) Press said on Monday (Jan 25) that its decision to withdraw the publication of a volume of essays titled ""Coup, King, Crisis: A Critical Interregnum in Thailand"" was made after it had consulted with stakeholders inside and outside the university.\xa0\nIts director, Mr Peter Schoppert, said this in response to CNA\'s queries, after more than 100 academics signed an open letter accusing the university press of withdrawing the publication of the volume, which touches on sensitive aspects of Thai politics, due to ""political pressure"".\xa0\n“NUS Press understands the real concern academics may have over a university press’ late stage decision not to publish. These decisions are not taken lightly, but a university press has many stakeholders inside and outside the university whose concerns have to be considered,"" Mr Schoppert told CNA.\xa0\n""That includes of course the scholars who are concerned about our decision, our many publishing partners, commercial partners and so on,"" he added.\xa0\nWhen asked to identify the stakeholders that had offered their considerations, Mr Schoppert said: ""We have many stakeholders. We did our best to take different concerns into account.""\n“As a publisher based in the region, in a very small home market, the decisions we take, considering our stakeholders’ views, may be different than those taken by presses without a stake in the region,” he said.\xa0\nIn the open letter addressed to Mr Schoppert and NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye, the editor of the volume Associate\xa0Professor Pavin Chachavalpongpun said he had proposed the manuscript to the NUS Press in October 2018.\xa0\n“Following the Press’s guidelines, the manuscript went through proper and vigorous peer review process, and all contributors revised their essay accordingly, and in a timely manner,” wrote Assoc Prof Pavin, who teaches at Kyoto University.\xa0\nIn August 2019, he signed a contract with NUS Press on behalf of the contributors and “completed necessary steps” to ensure the publication deadline of Spring 2020 was met, he said.\xa0\nBut when the manuscript was “about to go to press”, Mr Schoppert emailed Assoc Prof Pavin on Mar\xa020, 2020 to inform him of the NUS Press’ decision to cancel the publishing contract.\xa0\nMr Schoppert “failed to give any explanation” regarding the last-minute withdrawal from the planned publication, but advised that the decision “was taken after consultation with stakeholders within and outside the university community”, said Assoc Prof Pavin.\xa0\n“It seems reasonable to assume that the NUS Press’s decision was due to political pressure. The unexplained and last minute decision violates the fundamental principles of academic freedom,” he wrote in the letter.\xa0\n“The reference to outside stakeholders indicates that individuals and/or interest groups outside of academia have the final say in the publications process. This makes a mockery of the independent peer-review process, calling into question the academic integrity of the press itself.”\xa0\nIn response to the claims, Mr Schoppert confirmed to CNA that NUS Press did decide to withdraw the planned publication of the volume\xa0in March 2020.\xa0\n“This decision was made at a late stage in the publishing process,” he said.\n“Making that kind of decision is not something a publisher ever does lightly, but the decision was made after consultation with our stakeholders,” said Mr Schoppert.\nWith the permission of peer reviewers, NUS Press shared their anonymous reviews with other university presses who contacted them with an interest in the book, he added.\n“We could only apologise to the editor, Prof Pavin, for the lateness of the decision and do what we could to help him secure a new home for the manuscript ... We did whatever we could to minimise the inconvenience to him and his contributors.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     NUS ', '     National University of Singapore ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: O-Level results and the problem with expecting youth to figure out their life based on an exam
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: What do you want to be when you grow up?\nIt’s a loaded question we’re bombarded with from young. As soon as we understand the concept of a career, we are asked to pick one — just one — for supposedly the rest of our lives.\nBut what starts out as a fun mental exercise when we’re young becomes more existential as we get older.\nOn Monday (Jan 11) after the O-Level results are released, 16-year-olds will revisit the question in their minds, as they decide whether to head down the junior college (JC) or polytechnic route.\n\n\nAside from understanding their preferred learning style, whether it’s an academically inclined JC environment or a hands-on approach in a polytechnic, they’re told this decision largely depends on the work they want to do in the future.\nAs 16-year-olds go, some will have a rough idea of their basic interests, skills and talents. Even fewer will know exactly what lights the fire in their belly.\xa0\nThey see with absolute certainty the career trajectory they wish to take over the next 10 years and the academic qualifications needed to get there.\nMany, however, will fumble in quiet. They may not know what they want to be when they grow up, even after attending several JC and polytechnic open houses.\nThey may end up picking a course or a school because their peers do so or because their parents expect them to. They may resign themselves to the path of least resistance to placate their families.\nAnd more unfortunately, they may feel shame for being lost or less sure about their future than their high-achieving peers.\nYOUNG AGE, HIGH PRESSURE\nUnlike at PSLE where grades seem to be the main deciding factor for the next step in education, the narrative around O-Level results no longer hinges on scoring good grades. Getting an excellent O-Level score isn’t enough — knowing what to do with it matters more.\nBut pressure by any other name is just as stressful.\nSchools, teachers and counsellors — an entire ecosystem exists to be helpful to a young teenager in figuring out what might suit them.\nYears before they even sit for the O-Level examinations, youth are already exposed to education and career guidance in secondary schools, such as having JCs and polytechnics invited to share their offerings and attending career talks conducted by alumni.\nThis knowledge is invaluable and even better if a friendly career guidance counsellor is on hand to help you uncover your true calling. The aim is altruistic — to match skills and talents so that money and time can be well-spent.\nIn the best of circumstances, it can also fuel ambition and drive, when we know clearly the path we want to take. Take the recent news about the 19-year-old polytechnic student running a US$25 million tech start-up.\nYet, this heavy, single-minded expectation to figure life out at that pivotal point implies our choice is somewhat cast in stone forever.\nIt also encourages an intrinsic relationship between career and our identity, where we’re expected to dedicate our lives to finding a singular professional purpose if we haven’t decided on a career that will determine our passions and pursuits.\nIn reality, our choice at this point in life is not a done deal, even if it feels like our entire life rests on this one decision.\nADULTS STILL DON’T HAVE IT FIGURED OUT \nAs a teenager on the precipice of making a decision after my O-Level results, I distinctly remember thinking, “I can’t wait to be an adult so I can feel sure about my life choices.”\nThe joke was on me.\nSome adults remain miserable, because they’re stuck on a career trajectory they’re too afraid to change, or they’re constantly afflicted by a sense of wishing they could do something else.\nOf course, many others lead happy and meaningful lives regardless of their jobs, because they’ve learnt to make the best out of what they have, even if they’re unsure about their calling.\nA famous quote by English actor and writer, Stephen Fry, comes to mind:\nOscar Wilde said that if you know what you want to be, then you inevitably become it — that is your punishment.\xa0\nBut if you never know, then you can be anything. We are not nouns, we are verbs. I am not a thing — an actor, a writer. I am a person who does things — I write, I act — and I never know what I am going to do next.\xa0\nI think you can be imprisoned if you think of yourself as a noun.\nIt reminds me of my friends who’ve strayed from the paths supposedly dictated by their decisions they made at 16.\nA friend, who was the valedictorian for his mass communication course in polytechnic, went on to practise law in university. He completely abandoned the media industry despite having done well in his diploma.\nAnother friend got into the science stream in a JC, studied geography in university and graduated with honours, and became a content strategist in a media agency.\nEven among more well-known Singaporeans, switching careers is not unheard of. Chef Willin Low and fashion designer Ong Shunmugam, for instance, studied law once upon a time.\n\n\nIt’s increasingly common for adults to change careers and to land up in vastly different paths than the one they imagined for themselves when they were 16.\nThat’s even encouraged today in a world of disruption. They call this “career mobility”.\n\n\nNOT THE DESTINATION, BUT THE JOURNEY\nNot being fixated on a clear path after your O-Level results has its underrated benefits.\nFor one, not being chained to a projected career path that you chose at a young age, or that your parents and peers expected you to pursue, leaves you open to explore varied interests. From business to biology, art to architecture, this inadvertently cultivates a keen sense of curiosity.\nIt also teaches you how to fail or how to accept failure, when some interests inevitably don’t pan out or when you realise some personal passions make poor careers.\nHaving curiosity and resourcefulness, the ability to weather uncertainty, and the ability to find meaning and happiness that’s independent of professional success, is far more valuable than simply being sure about what you want to be as a teenager.\nSo perhaps, rather than expect 16-year-olds to have the next 10 to 20, or even five years of their lives figured out, we should normalise feeling clueless about what they want to do. Certainly never berate or belittle these feelings, but encourage them to use such sentiments to figure out what's next.\nIt’s wonderful if you know what you want to do from a young age. But few of us are Tiger Woods.\nFor those who haven’t got a clue, here’s a secret I’ve uncovered since becoming a working adult: Many of us, even the conventionally successful ones, are often winging it. We’ve taken many varied paths; some delightful, others dreary.\nSome of us still wish we could do something different — but despite or because of how life hasn’t worked out the way we planned, it’s all the more interesting and meaningful.\nAnd strangely, to end up with such a life beats any answer we could’ve given when we were asked what we wanted\xa0to be when we grew\xa0up.\nGrace Yeoh is a senior journalist at CNA Insider.\nListen to three working adults\xa0reveal\xa0how their PSLE results\xa0shaped their life journeys\xa0in a no-holds-barred conversation on CNA's\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Singapore women’s national football team player Putri Nur Syaliza Sazali has accepted an overseas athletic scholarship,\xa0becoming the first local female footballer to receive one.\nThe 17-year-old attacker will depart for Cumberland University on Saturday (Jan 9) after accepting the four-year scholarship offer at the university in Tennessee, United States.\nShe will major in Sports Management and turn out for the university’s team, the Cumberland Phoenix. The team takes part in the Mid-South Conference Tournament of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and is preparing for the new season, which begins mid-February.\xa0\nPutri started exploring overseas football scholarships last year, and focused her efforts on the US.\n“To be honest, I didn’t rate my chances at all, and I just wanted to try my luck,” she said in an article on the website of the Football Association of Singapore (FAS).\nAt 14 years and 353 days old, Putri became Singapore’s youngest debutant and scorer at the international level after coming on as a substitute in March 2018 and scoring the opener in a 2-0 friendly win over the Maldives. Those marks have since been eclipsed by\xa0Danelle Tan.\nPutri has since gained another five caps, and told the FAS\xa0that she hopes she will be able to gain a top-level football education in the US.\nWhile none of her family members will be able to accompany her due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the young star is excited about the next step in her footballing journey.\n“I will take it slowly step-by-step but I really hope to make the most of my experiences aboard and hopefully do well enough to play professional football overseas one day,” she said.\n“I hope that me being offered the athletic scholarship will spur and motivate other girls to pursue their passion in football since they now know that it is actually possible to achieve something like this,” she added.\n“We just need to work hard and have faith in ourselves, and eventually everything will work out well.”\nFAS’ head of Grassroots and Women’s Football Julie Teo said: “We are very pleased that Putri received the scholarship through football into Cumberland University, as it does show that we do have the talent pool for women’s football, and it is definitely something for us to build on.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     football ', '     education ']}"

      IN FOCUS: Prolonged school closure in Malaysia due to COVID-19 shakes up learning experience
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: For most of 2020, school lessons for Siti Najihah Najwa Ridzuan, 17, were very different from normal.\nInstead of going into classes, she had to turn on her laptop at 8am and sit\xa0through five hours of online lessons, with breaks in between each hour of class.\n“That is how it has been since they started online classes, because schools were closed as part of the Movement Control Order (MCO),” said\xa0Siti Najihah, who lives in Ulu Bernam, Selangor, and attended\xa0school in Tanjung Malim, Perak,\xa0just across the interstate border.\xa0\nSiti Najihah, who was in Secondary 5, was due to sit for her Malaysian Education Certificate (SPM) examination between November and December, along with 400,000 other students. The O-Level equivalent is a rite of passage and a determining factor in\xa0future studies.\nHowever, the exam and the A-Level equivalent, the Malaysian Higher School Certificate (STPM) exam, have been postponed to February and March this year.\nThis has caused consternation among some students due to the long wait, but relief for others as there was more time to revise their studies in what has been a tumultuous year in their learning journey.\nMalaysia’s school closures, which were put in place\xa0as part of the MCO to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted the education of students.\nSchools were first closed from Mar 18, with all non-essential businesses closed and movement curbed. While primary and secondary schools later resumed in phases from Jul 15 onwards, educational institutions in Selangor, Sabah, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya were shut again from Oct 14 due to a surge in COVID-19 cases.\nAll schools nationwide were subsequently closed on Nov 9 as cases spiked, ahead of the last day of the school year on Dec 17 or\xa0Dec 18, depending on states. This meant students in Malaysia only attended school\xa0in person for about five to six months in 2020.\n\n\nWhile SPM and STPM examinations were postponed until 2021, the Primary School Achievement Test (UPSR) for students in Primary 6 and the Secondary 3 Assessment (PT3) examinations were entirely cancelled.\nWhen schools were closed, some teachers turned\xa0to online methods of instruction, developing workarounds and utilising video-conferencing and other productivity tools.\nLessons were also produced by the education ministry and aired on television channels, but their quality has been questioned.\nEffectiveness of online learning aside, the prolonged school\xa0closure\xa0also shone a spotlight on the income disparity and digital divide between the haves and the have-nots.\nParents working from home had to juggle between work and supervising their children’s online education, while coping with the stress presented by the pandemic. Students, on the other hand, had\xa0to adapt to lack of social interaction and inactivity as a result of school closure.\nWith the 2021 school year due to begin on Jan 20, how would the students fare academically following a challenging year that has kept them mostly at home, restless and bored? \xa0\n\n\nTAKING CLASSES ONLINE AND MISSING SCHOOL LIFE\nWatching their teachers on the screens of their devices required a fair share of discipline and\xa0concentration, as the students found out.\nFor Siti Najihah, online classes only started in April even though schools were\xa0closed from Mar 18. She felt that online learning was not adequate, especially as she was due to sit for SPM.\n“I’m more comfortable learning face-to-face, and at times problems also crop up when you’re learning from home. For example, the data connection gets broken\xa0and it can also be noisy at home,” she said.\n“Learning online, it’s difficult to understand ... because we’re just looking at the screen.\xa0But\xa0there’s no other method, so we just continue,” she added.\nChiam Kai Li, who studies in Petaling Jaya and was also due to sit for SPM, said she was relieved there was more time for her to better understand the\xa0syllabus and master answering techniques.\n“But the process of constantly doing past year papers over and over can be quite exhausting. It’s no longer about learning new things, but relearning and regurgitating the same words over and over again,” Kai Li, 17, told CNA.\nFor her, the repetitiveness of online classes resulted in boredom creeping in.\n“I tend to get bored easily listening to my teachers, and I end up scrolling through social media. It’s quite tiresome to sit in front of the laptop for hours listening to what has already been taught,” she said.\nAdditionally, Kai Li told CNA that she missed the non-academic aspects of school, such as seeing her friends and spending the last year of secondary education together. Even when schools were reopened briefly between July and October last year, students were required to wear masks, observe social distancing and spend recess time in classrooms.\n“Being with my friends is much livelier than the four walls staring back at me at home. Also, being in an environment where all my classmates were\xa0diligently studying also motivated me to study, back in July when school reopened for a short while,” she recounted.\nAs it is, Kai Li and her cohort have already missed out on activities their seniors enjoyed, including graduation ceremony,\xa0school prom and sports day.\n“My class was struggling to figure out how to take our class pictures for the school magazine, but we had to come to terms with reality,” she recounted.\nThe postponement of SPM and STPM has also created anxiety for some school-leaving students as to how they would be able to further their tertiary education.\nThe post-secondary education system\xa0in Malaysia allows for new school leavers to apply at local private colleges using their SPM trial results, and start their pre-university or foundation courses in January, pending the final results which are usually published in March.\xa0Others may choose to go for later intakes with final results in hand.\nBut now that the results for the SPM and STPM\xa0will only be known in the second half of the year. This could potentially mean delaying six months of tertiary studies.\xa0\n“I also don’t know when my SPM results will come out, so it makes me slightly anxious about what I am going to do after SPM next year (in 2021),” Kai Li shared.\xa0\n\n\nCHALLENGES OF\xa0ONLINE TEACHING\nFor the educators, online teaching presented a whole new set of challenges, even more so when it was introduced hastily when schools were first closed.\nA Malacca-based teacher,\xa0who only wanted to be known as L, opined that teaching online has its drawbacks, especially for subjects like mathematics and additional mathematics.\n“These are very hands-on subjects … They are\xa0very hard to teach lecture-style because a lot of the skill is acquired by doing.\n“Only then you will know where your misconceptions are, and you get feedback from your teachers and peers,” he shared.\nFor the stronger students, L said, online learning did not impact them so much, but his worry was\xa0more about the weaker students.\n“When we go online, it’s very hard to get feedback on whether the student understands the concepts or not as we teach.\n“I do randomly call out students during the online classes to see if they’re paying attention, and we also hand out assignments,” he said.\nFor him, student attendance in online classes was close to 100 per cent. This is because\xa0his principal would liaise with teachers, students as well as parents and emphasise the need to attend the online classes.\nHowever, a lot of the students’ participation had to do with their individual self-motivation, L explained, as the lack of direct teacher supervision meant students had to work on the syllabus by themselves.\n“Still, nothing replaces face-to-face classes, because you can catch their body language, you know who the students are with weaker grasp on the concepts.\n“You can answer their questions there and then. Or even hold them back after school for some extra tutoring,” L said.\n\n\nA teacher from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, who only wanted to be known as E, said that her biggest worry was the nearly perfect answers she was getting on the assignments her students emailed back to her.\xa0\n“This is the only feedback I get ... But the answer could have been easily copied from their more competent friends,” she noted.\nBoth L and E taught\xa0secondary classes.\nThey noted that priority was given to mathematics and science subjects, with the amount of time for teaching languages and history reduced according to guidelines from the Education Ministry.\n“That allowed us to finish covering certain subjects, such as additional maths, within the normal schooling time frame,” E said.\nBoth teachers voiced a similar worry that they could not accurately assess their students’ progress last year.\n“While online teaching and learning have opened new doors, new avenues to explore, we’re so used to working face-to-face with students. My main worry is I have no idea how well, or not well, my students are doing,” L said.\n“Some students emailed or privately messaged me to ask for help or guidance, but there wasn\'t\xa0a lot of them. The homework was too good to be true, but I might be speculating,” he added.\nPARENTS PLAY EXPANDED ROLE IN HOME-BASED LEARNING\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about changes in many aspects of life, and having to make sure their children kept\xa0up with their studies even as schools were closed could be a stressor for some parents.\nFor Simon Balan and Carrie Hew, who have four school going children\xa0including one son who was supposed to take the SPM last year, the situation has been challenging.\n“It’s fortunate for us that we live in the urban part of Kuching (Sarawak’s state capital), so Internet connection is not a problem, and we have phones and computers so our kids can follow lessons,” said Balan.\nThe challenging part, Hew said, was monitoring and ensuring that their children were indeed concentrating on their lessons.\n“Even though we work from home, it’s not as easy as you think. You don’t know if they’re focusing on what the teacher is saying, or if they just turn on Zoom and leave the video off, and do something else,” she added.\nFor their son taking the SPM, this meant\xa0relying on his word when he said he had\xa0no issue with classes.\nBut they made sure to include study time in their family schedule, mandating everyone to sit down to do their homework and revision after dinner.\n\n\nIn Tawau, Sabah, Valerie Ooi lamented that online classes did not take place until mid-November for her son, who\xa0just completed Primary 4 in a Chinese vernacular school. All homework was assigned through WhatsApp or Google Classroom prior to that.\n""It was only from Nov 16 onwards when teachers began using Google Meet to have \'face-to-face\' lessons with their students. That\'s because tests were going to be held on Google Meet and Google Classroom the following week,"" she recounted.\nOoi felt that even with more parental involvement, she and her husband were unable to help their child\xa0as well as a professional teacher.\n""Both his parents have chemistry degrees, but how do you effectively impart primary school lessons to your kid? You still need a proper teacher who can effectively transmit the knowledge to primary school students,” she said.\nOoi also has another son due to start Primary 1 this year, and his home-based kindergarten lessons have not been smooth sailing either.\n""The private kindergarten produced its own education videos, but the kids were\xa0not interested in the videos. He caused havoc or disturbed his older brother.""\n""Even though we followed the video to teach, the kid didn’t take the lessons seriously and\xa0only (wanted) to complete his homework. After some time, we tested the kid’s progress and found out he has completely not learnt his lessons,"" Ooi said.\nJoey Wong, another parent in Lahad Datu, Sabah, also shared that her children’s schools did not provide online classes due to connectivity issues. Teachers only issued homework via WhatsApp and parents were expected to play the role of a tutor at home.\n“Such a learning style lacks interaction. Students did not understand the lessons and there’s nothing parents can do.\n“And yet the teachers kept rushing the students to submit their homework and even held online tests. This felt like self-deception,” she said.\nOn a more positive note, there was a silver lining in the year of disruptions, as Selangor-based Kok Mei Yee experienced.\nHer son, Chong Zeng Yi, had just completed Primary 3. She was more relaxed about his health and safety. Learning from home also meant she could accompany him in some of his classes.\n""This helped\xa0me to understand his studies better, and I also got to know his teacher and classmates.\n""He has enough sleep and is in good spirits, so studying isn\'t a problem. But there is a lot of free time, so it can become a little monotonous,"" Kok said.\nFamily life has also improved, she said, as her son participated in housework and the increased free time\xa0allowed for more family conversations and activities.\n""We do a lot of home activities, like camping in the living room. His father also accompanies him to watch movies and discuss homework, so their relationship is very close,"" Kok noted.\n\n\nThere are indications that lockdown and school\xa0closures may have exacted\xa0a mental toll on students and parents.\nStudents not only had to deal with\xa0being confined at\xa0home nearly 24/7, but also the anxiety of missing out on their studies.\nCounselling psychologist Katyana Azman told CNA that the number of her counselling sessions has gone up since the pandemic broke.\n“We used to get probably two new clients a week and that was our usual turnover. But since the start (of COVID-19), we’ve gotten between eight to 12 new clients coming in for counselling each week,” she said.\n“Mental health professionals are preparing for the huge mental cost when this is over, especially with young children.”\nKatyana, who works exclusively with children and teenagers, said confinement, social isolation and uncertainty were prime conditions for developing mood disorders such as depression and anxiety-related disorders.\n“The situation is especially telling for teenagers, for them not to socialise and many parents are kind of invoking this as a tactic to keep them at home.\n“Like, the parents will tell them ‘Don’t do this’ or ‘Don’t go out, you will get sick\',” she said.\n“This somewhat generates fear, that you can’t talk to your friend, and you can’t do this or that,” she added.\nMeanwhile, as exam dates were shifted, demotivation was also a common problem faced by her clients who were sitting for SPM exams.\n“It’s like any other human being. If you put them through a position where something is too challenging with no end in sight, we all kind of give up. That’s how the human brain works,” she said.\nWorking with a child coming in for counseling also means working with the parents, who themselves are on unfamiliar ground as they were stressed from working in the confines of home and dealing with household matters simultaneously.\n“I ended up giving families techniques on how to navigate these issues. Because if parents at home are taking all of their frustrations and anxieties out on children, it’s not healthy. It\xa0also sets the standard for the child as to what behaviour is acceptable,” Katyana said.\n\n\nBRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE\nThroughout the school closure period, one sticking point has been equipping schoolchildren with the tools to learn online.\nWhile urban households in the middle and upper-income rungs could afford items such as laptops and expanded data plans to accommodate learning from home, others were not so lucky.\nIn addition, data connectivity was also an issue for rural populations, with geography and cost hindering online learning.\nIn Sabah, 18-year-old Veveonah Mosibin, a foundation student at a local public university, went viral after vlogging herself setting up a shelter in a tree, just so she could catch a data signal to sit for her online exams.\nThe Malaysian media has also carried news of students in rural areas going to great lengths to obtain a data signal for their online classes, sometimes with disastrous consequences.\xa0\nIn late November, three students from Kampung Gusi in Sabah’s mountainous Ranau district were injured, one severely. This happened after the suspension bridge, the only local area where there was a data signal, collapsed as they gathered to try and access the Internet.\nIn Sarawak, teacher Sambau Dugat was featured in local media after taking his students and their parents on a jungle and hill trek of over two hours in Lubok Antu, near the Kalimantan border, in search of a data signal.\nSimilarly in Kelantan, Mohd Azmi Ahmad set up a shelter on a hilltop for his daughter, undergraduate Nurlieda Khaleeda Mohd Azmi, to access the Internet for her studies and semester exams.\nIn July, Minister for Education Mohd Radzi Md Jidin said in a written parliamentary reply that 36.9 per cent of students did not possess\xa0any devices which allowed them to follow online lessons, based on a survey of 670,118 parents of 893,331 students between March and April.\nOnly 5.8 per cent owned a tablet computer, while 46.5 per cent had to rely on smartphones.\nL, the teacher in Melaka, said while the digital divide among students in his school was a mild problem, less well-off households were still affected by the shift to online learning.\n“For instance, one household might have only one phone, or the dad holds the phone, but he needs to go out to work. Certain households have more than one kid and both are in different levels of schooling, but they only have one phone to work with, that’s a challenge,” he said.\nFrom E’s perspective, connectivity was more of an issue in Sabah.\n“For those earning lower incomes, or to save money, a prepaid plan might have saved money in normal times. But now, I have students who end up having to top up their prepaid data every day,” she said.\nNon-governmental organisations and some politicians have launched campaigns to equip more students with devices. One of them, Rotary District 3300, which comprises 72 Rotary Clubs\xa0covering Peninsular Malaysia (except\xa0Melaka and Johor),\xa0initiated ""A Student A Laptop"" charity campaign in August in collaboration with local private higher education provider Brickfields Asia College.\nRotarian Siti Subaidah Mustafa, who is heading the campaign, said the project had come about after they had raised about RM1 million (US$246,913) to provide emergency food relief for underserved communities.\n“As the MCO slowly relaxed into CMCO and so on, we saw the need for education assistance as well.\n“We came across students who said they couldn’t attend classes because they had no computers or the family had only one smartphone, so we started this campaign focusing on digital poverty in August,” she said.\nThe target was to serve 2,000 Malaysian students in both Secondary 4 and 5. They accepted donated laptops from the public and companies such as local telco provider Celcom.\n“We also do post-donation monitoring, to make sure they’re properly connected and that there’s no hidden issues with the laptop after we refurbished them,” said Siti Subaidah.\nIn a written reply to CNA, the Malaysian Education Ministry stated it was aware of the limitations of online learning, and the challenges posed to families who did not possess any electronic devices.\nExplaining that it was looking into the best ways to deal with the issue, the ministry pointed out that one such step is the ""Cerdik Programme"", a joint effort by Yayasan Hasanah (the corporate social responsibility arm of Malaysia\'s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional), the Education Ministry and other government-linked business entities.\nThe programme aimed\xa0to provide 150,000 students with devices and connectivity to access online learning by early this year, the ministry added.\n\n\n""ADAPTIVE AND REALIGNED CURRICULUM"" FOR 2021: EDUCATION MINISTRY\nAware of the effects of disrupted learning in 2020, the Education Ministry said it has planned for a transitional programme and an adaptive curriculum in the new school year.\nIn response to CNA’s queries, the ministry said it would implement a transitional programme when schools reopen to accommodate and prepare Primary 1 students who had missed out on a huge chunk of learning time in preschools.\nThis programme would help the students adapt emotionally, physically and socially to their new learning environments, as well as prepare them with basic literacy and numeracy before introducing the Primary 1 syllabus, it said.\n“For other students in 2021, teaching and learning will be based on an adaptive and realigned curriculum. It is a curriculum that takes into consideration content not covered in 2020, the content for 2021, and the number of schooling days available for 2021,” the ministry said.\nOn Jan 2, the ministry reiterated in a press release that the 2021 academic calendar would begin on Jan 20 as previously scheduled.\nThis would involve even those in CMCO areas, and all these institutions\' operations would be subject to guidelines and standard operating procedures set by the authorities.\n“The ministry will continuously monitor the operations of these institutions along with the National Security Council and the Health Ministry,"" the ministry statement added.\nHowever, the rising number of cases has some parents concerned. As of Jan 8, Malaysia has 25,140\xa0active cases, out of a national total of 131,108.\nHew, the parent in Sarawak, noted that for the last few weeks in December, case numbers in the state capital of Kuching appeared manageable before spiking again in early January.\n""So now I\'m a little torn, and I\'m more worried for the younger students, not just my own children,"" she said.\nHew, whose youngest will be in Primary 4 this year, added that the older kids could comprehend what was happening, as they already had a taste of what pandemic-affected schooling was like last year.\n""More concerning, however, is how the schools are going to organise the flow of classes. Is everyone going to be let out at the same time and so on?"" she said.\xa0\n\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ', '     COVID-19 ', '     In Focus ']}"

      Commentary: Let’s stop overstating the value of a university degree beyond your first job
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: It’s no secret that degree holders generally start their careers on a better footing than most.\xa0\nFor one thing, graduate employment surveys in Singapore have consistently shown their starting salaries are higher than that of diploma holders.\nIn many parts of the world, which university one graduates from also often ends up playing a part in remuneration.\nIn the United States, since 2015, US Bureau of Economic Analysis figures show\xa0Ivy League graduates start their careers with much higher salaries than their non-Ivy League peers. In 2019, the median starting salary of Ivy League graduates was 55 per cent more than that of private university graduates.\nThese factors serve to entrench the perception that university degrees are a powerful determinant of success, thus propelling students towards a relentless pursuit of academic qualifications, even while more employers are beginning to recognise other types of proof of domain knowledge and expertise.\nRECOGNISING THE COMPLEXITIES\nThe inherent complexities of the correlation between paper qualifications and an individual’s employability and starting salary must also be acknowledged.\nAt any one time, certain types of qualifications will prove to be more equal than others.\nThe state of the economy, business requirements and the skills that employers deem valuable at the time determine which degrees and qualifications influence an individual’s employability and starting salary.\nUnderemployment among degree holders is another reality that cannot be ignored during tough economic times or when certain industries experience a decline.\nLet’s also consider today’s context where more and more of us are having to pivot to job roles and fields that have very little to do with the degrees we graduated with, especially if they were general degrees.\nThis should spur students, job seekers and employers alike to take a step back to re-evaluate the true meaning of a degree.\nThis is not to say there is no value in a degree.\nThe structured approach to learning that a degree offers is certainly beneficial especially pertaining to fields such as medicine or law which require individuals to have a large amount of domain knowledge and to have gone through rigorous testing and hands-on training.\nA university education also provides other advantages such as the opportunity to hobnob with academics and participate in debates with one’s peers and professors. All of this can contribute to intellectual and creative growth.\nSKILLS ACQUIRED THROUGH OTHER MEANS: EQUAL TO DEGREES\nHowever, generally speaking, can those without one excel in their fields and in fact surpass degree holders in terms of competence?\nEmployers in Singapore are certainly waking up to this.\nA Ministry of Manpower report published in 2019\xa0showed that academic qualifications were not the main consideration for employers hiring PMETs in 2018. This applied to 52 per cent of PMET job vacancies and included occupations such as software, web and multimedia developers, systems analysts and commercial and marketing sales executives.\nInstead, employers were looking for candidates with relevant skills, work experience, soft skills and the right attitudes.\nOur recent straw poll of HR leaders has reinforced this.\nThere is also a greater openness now to candidates who acquire hard skills through massive open online courses designed by institutions such as MIT and giants such as Microsoft. Platforms such as Coursera have been offering these for the past 10 years.\nThese certification courses are more affordable than degree programmes and offer students who require flexibility to complete them at their own pace. New methods of learning are certainly a game-changer.\nAN AGE-OLD DEBATE\nThe debate over the value of a degree is a long-standing one.\nIn 2017, then Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung, urged Singaporeans not to be “overly fixated” on the university cohort participation rate, stressing that skills, rather than paper qualifications, are what carry a premium in the new economy.\nHe said there should be “diverse and multitudinous” paths for people to enhance their skills. These could be academic upgrades, apprenticeships, industry certifications, overseas experience, or simply gaining work experience and making a name for oneself in one’s respective field.\nIn the past, having a degree indicated one had advanced training and superior ability. Today, it is possible to achieve this through other means.\nVITAL SKILLS THAT DEGREES DON’T TEACH \nThe last decade has also shown us that whether or not one has a degree, continual learning is imperative.\nIn an age of ubiquitous disruption and massive unpredictability, both employers and job seekers we interact with concede that the knowledge and skills gained from a university degree can easily become obsolete.\nIn fact, as early as 1971, research by Harvard Business School suggested that academic achievement does not determine a person’s managerial or business success.\nOur conversations with HR practitioners also reveal a realisation that even a candidate’s years of experience can be a poor predictor of job success since operating environments are volatile and past experience can become irrelevant in the blink of an eye.\nA 2019 IBM study which included surveys with executives across 50 countries found that the biggest skills gaps are not digital but behavioural. These include complex problem solving, teamwork, leadership, communication, agility and adaptability.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has increased the demand for such skills.\nInstead of being fixated on candidates’ academic qualifications, employers should use tools that test an individual’s ability to learn, reason, and think logically, and their willingness and ability to learn new skills.\nThese include psychometric tests and situation-based interview questions. 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies reportedly use such tools. \xa0\nThe unprecedented pace of digital transformation we’re seeing today is also making people realise the importance of developing other skills that machines are not likely to be able to replicate.\nFor instance, in the field of medicine, while AI and other disruptive technological tools can assist with diagnosis, helping people make informed decisions about treatment options requires contextual input and empathy that only a human healthcare professional can provide.\nTechnology development in itself is predicated on humans being able to observe society, identify problems that require technological solutions and design and build these solutions. \xa0\nAs the world grows more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous, for higher education in general to be relevant, it needs to catch up with real-world needs and equip students with such skills.\nBREAKING OLD HABITS – JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND GRADUATE EMPLOYMENT SURVEYS\nWhat is troubling is that while employers realise that a degree is not necessarily an accurate indicator of a candidate’s abilities, a quick scan of job portals still shows that the prerequisite for many roles is at least a Bachelor’s degree.\nAs recruiters, we often present employers with candidates who possess the skills and experience necessary to get the job done, even if they don’t have the degree stated in job descriptions.\nWe have found this approach to be generally successful. If the candidate has a proven track record, a portfolio of work and possesses traits such as adaptability and a willingness to learn, the absence of a degree hardly ever negatively influences hiring managers’ decisions.\nWe have seen this happen for various job roles and fields including, but not limited to project management, software development, digital marketing and business strategy development.\nFor entry-level candidates, a lack of experience tends to cause hiring managers to focus on the degrees they graduated with and the schools they attended. But even this is changing today as more employers use alternative screening tools to assess the candidates.\nThese include behavioural and situational job interview questions, psychometric tests, and in some cases, proposals to solve a particular business challenge.\nWhy then is a degree stated as a prerequisite?\nWhen asked this question, one hiring manager said that because of the value society has put on degrees, it is an easy manner of signalling to applicants the complexity and status of the position.\nUnfortunately, this practice only serves to reinforce the mistaken perception that individuals without degrees are less employable.\nAs the education landscape evolves, employers should take a more considered approach.\nSeveral global companies including IBM, Google and Apple no longer list a degree as a prerequisite in job descriptions for engineers, strategists, analysts and data scientists among other roles.\nDoing so not only sends out the right signals- that not having a degree is not a barrier to entry if you have the requisite hard and soft skills - but is also more reflective of ground realities and better informs job seekers of what’s expected of them.\nAs we reassess job descriptions, we should also reassess the merits of graduate employment surveys.\nConsidering that more employers are placing a greater emphasis on individuals’ skillsets and key traits than they are on a piece of paper, surely such surveys are on their way to becoming an anachronism.\xa0\nIn fact, they send out signals that lead to a vicious cycle of raising degree holders’ expectations and employers having to meet those expectations whether or not the individual merits a higher starting salary than another candidate without a degree.\nCHANGING THE NARRATIVE AS THE VALUE OF DEGREES DIMINISHES\nGoing forward, those who believe that having a degree will increase their earning power should also recalibrate their expectations.\nSocial economists Phillip Brown, Hugh Lauder and David Ashton have sought to debunk this belief in their book, The Global Auction: The Broken Promises Of Education, Jobs And Incomes.\nTheir survey of businesses around the world uncovered a global auction for high-skill, low-wage work. Employers looking to maximise profits and minimise labour costs traditionally hire skilled workers who are willing to accept modest wages.\nWith the explosion of higher education across the world, there is a steady supply of such workers.\nThey also discuss a phenomenon known as Digital Taylorism. This involves deconstructing, standardising, codifying and computerising the work of white-collar workers to enable lower-skilled and cheaper workers to deliver components of it.\nWe have already seen examples of this in the legal profession when it comes to drawing up certain types of legal documents, in the medical profession when it comes to analysing X-rays and in accountancy when it comes to processing tax returns.\nConsidering these realities, we urgently need to rethink how we assess the value of educational pathways and individuals’ competencies, and how they contribute to human endeavour going forward.\nWhile degrees are certainly not bereft of value when it comes to knowledge and skills acquisition, let’s also recognise that the skills of the future can be acquired through other equally, if not more credible means.\nThis means rewarding individuals for the value they bring to the job rather than the paper qualifications they walk in with.\nJaime Lim is Group Business Leader of\xa0PeopleSearch, an executive search and outplacement services firm with a presence in six cities including Singapore.\nHow much does PSLE grades impact life?

      2 family COVID-19 clusters a 'sobering reminder' about how easy it is for clusters to break out: Lawrence Wong
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The two COVID-19 family clusters identified in recent days are a\xa0“sobering reminder of how easy it is for clusters to break out”, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong on Monday (Jan 4).\nSpeaking to journalists at Waterway Primary School in Punggol, he said it is\xa0a reminder that the pandemic continues and that all necessary precautions have to be taken.\nTwo Raffles Girls\' School (RGS) students were part of a family cluster reported in the last week. The first student\xa0is a family member of a marine surveyor at Lloyd\'s Register Singapore who tested positive for COVID-19 on Dec 29.\xa0\nThe first student was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Dec 31.\nThe second RGS student visited her schoolmate at her home for a few hours on Dec 27\xa0when the marine surveyor was present. She was identified as a close contact and quarantined after the surveyor tested positive.\nAfter she developed a fever, she was taken to hospital where she tested positive for COVID-19 on Dec 31.\n""Fortunately, this took place during the school holidays, and so the contacts among\xa0students and friends were quite limited. I think if it had happened under a different circumstance and they had a lot of contact\xa0and intermingling, we may have well had a larger cluster,"" Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force,\xa0said on Monday.\n“It\'s once again a reminder to all of us that the pandemic continues, the virus is still circulating and we need to take all the necessary precautions. That will be our priority, continues to be ...\xa0even in Phase 3 we maintain all the necessary safe management measures throughout our schools.”\xa0\nAbout 3,500 Kindergarten 1 and 40,000 Primary 1 students across Singapore reported to school on Monday for their first day of the academic year.\nThe Ministry of Education announced previously that Kindergarten 2 and Primary 2 to Primary 6 students would report to school on Tuesday. Secondary schools and Special Education schools also started the academic year on Monday, while junior colleges and the Millennia Institute will start on Jan 11.\nThis “special arrangement” was made so that teachers can focus on students who are entering school for the first time, and also engage with parents with COVID-19 safe management measures in place.\xa0\n“Because these are students entering the school for the first time, they are understandably going to be quite anxious and their parents as well, (as) there are new safe management measures that are necessary,” he added.\n""I think it\'s a good arrangement and from what I\'ve seen so far, it is working well.""\nAs students entered Waterway Primary School with their parents from 7am, they were greeted by teachers and had their temperatures taken\xa0at the school gate. There were also multiple stations for temperature taking, spaced out for safe distancing, to ensure that there would not be a queue or overcrowding at the gate.\xa0\nAfter entering the school, they proceeded to check-in via SafeEntry at the school foyer. Students and their parents who were early were ushered to the canteen, where they sat at designated tables for each class.\xa0\nTeachers brought students up to their respective classrooms, where they sat in desks that were spread out individually across the room to ensure safe distancing. Parents were directed to another classroom\xa0to speak to\xa0their children’s form teachers.\xa0\nUnlike previous years, parents were not able to observe the first lessons\xa0or to follow their children closely while their first day of school unfolded. Instead, they had the opportunity to meet and interact with their children’s form teacher on the first day, said the principal of Waterway Primary\xa0School Wee-Kwan Liam.\xa0\nThe school welcomed about 280 P1 students and 160 K1 students on Monday, she added.\xa0\n""Onboarding the Primary 1\xa0and kindergarten\xa0children in a way is not different from other years, because ... it\xa0is about getting them settled and adapted to a bigger environment, with more children in the classroom and a more structured routine,"" said Mrs Wee.\xa0\n“What\'s additional this year is about safety management measures. The basic approach is about personal hygiene, personal responsibility and social responsibility.\xa0\n""So in a way, they\'re not entirely new because the kindergarten children coming into our Primary 1\xa0are familiar, and the kindergarten children having\xa0seen all this in public, they are also familiar.""\nMr Wong added: ""These (safety measures) are basic, but I think they have been effective measures throughout last year, we have been able to keep out\xa0COVID-19 from our schools and keep classrooms, keep learning going, we will continue to maintain all of these measures.""\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      Home-based learning to be held regularly for secondary schools, JCs and Millennia Institute from Term 3 next year
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Home-based learning days will soon become a regular part of the school year at secondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institute, with some levels adopting a new “blended learning” model from Term 3 next year, announced Minister for Education Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Dec 29).\nThe blended model is aimed at helping students develop the “mindsets and habits for self-directed learning”, said Mr Wong.\xa0\nOn home-based learning days, students will have time for curriculum work, as well dedicated time and space for them to pursue their own interests, said Mr Wong.\xa0\n“HBL (home-based learning) days will also be less structured than a typical day in school to allow students to exercise initiative in learning. Students who require closer supervision and those who lack a home environment conducive for learning, or need access to certain school facilities may return to school on HBL,” he added.\nAll secondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institute will implement blended learning at all levels by Term 4 of 2022, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a separate press release.\xa0\nONCE A FORTNIGHT\nThere have been calls for home-based learning to be made a regular part of school life to complement classroom teaching, after educators noticed the benefits to students during full home-based learning over the COVID-19 “circuit breaker” period earlier this year.\n""The question now is how we can lock in these gains, mainstream the new practices, and build on the progress made by our teachers and students during home-based learning,” said Mr Wong in a speech at the appointment and appreciation ceremony for principals at MOE.\xa0\nBlended learning, he said, combines independent learning and exploration with the in-school experience, helping students develop their ability to be “self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners”.\nUnder the new model, home-based learning will account for about 10 per cent of curriculum time at secondary schools and up to 20 per cent at junior colleges and Millennia Institute, according to the press release by MOE.\nThis translates to around once a fortnight across terms, excluding examination periods. Junior colleges and Millennia Institute will also have the option to add some shorter home-based learning days or another full-day home-based learning day per fortnight.\nTeachers have asked for more support with training and resources, Mr Wong said. The Education Ministry has implemented a professional development programme to help teachers design effective blended learning experiences for students, he added.\nPERSONAL LEARNING DEVICES\nTo facilitate blended learning, MOE will ensure that every student is “well equipped” with a personal learning device and Internet connectivity, said Mr Wong.\xa0\nAll secondary school students will own a personal learning device by the end of 2021, under the National Digital Literacy Programme, said Mr Wong, reiterating Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam’s announcement in June.\nThis will be rolled out in two phases, with 86 schools receiving the devices by Term 2 of 2021 in the first phase, and 66 schools receiving the devices by Term 3 in the second phase, said MOE in the press release.\xa0\nThe rollout comes seven years ahead of the original target announced by former Education Minister Ong Ye Kung in March.\xa0\nA small-scale pilot with personal laptops and tablets will also be conducted with upper primary students at five schools next year, said Mr Wong.\nMOE is taking a “calibrated approach” for primary school students because they are younger, he added. “And through this pilot we hope to better understand how the use of such devices might impact younger students and improve their learning outcomes, before deciding on next steps.”\xa0\nThe five schools are Chua Chu Kang Primary, Frontier Primary, Junyuan Primary, River Valley Primary and Yio Chu Kang Primary.\nWhile teachers and parents welcome these initiatives, they also have several concerns, including how to make the devices and Internet connectivity affordable for all students, and ensuring that it is used appropriately for education, Mr Wong said.\xa0\nMOE’s bulk tender will also lower the cost of the personal learning devices for students, said the ministry in the press release.\xa0\nNoting that MOE has provided a one-time S$200 Edusave top-up for all eligible Singaporean citizen students, Mr Wong said this would ensure most students have enough in their Edusave accounts to pay for the device.\xa0\nThere may also be students from lower-income households who may still need assistance, said Mr Wong.\xa0\n“The schools can help them by further subsidising the cost of the PLD, and if their accounts are insufficient, then they will be provided with additional financial support so that no out-of-pocket payment will be required for the PLD,” he said.\xa0\nThe ministry is also working with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) to provide subsidised broadband access for students from lower-income households, he added.\nTo ensure that the devices are an “enabler for learning” rather than a distraction, device management applications will be installed in each device to “provide a safe and more regulated digital environment”, said Mr Wong.\xa0\nStudents will also learn to keep safe, and be respectful and responsible users in the digital landscape during cyber wellness education in character and citizenship education lessons, he added.\xa0\n“Our curriculum in schools will continue to provide a wide range of learning experiences, including a balanced proportion of technology-enhanced learning activities. The amount of time that students spend on their devices will be managed. This will be further supported by classroom rules and routines,” said Mr Wong, adding that MOE will also work with parents to help their children use the devices meaningfully.\nStudents who are graduating in 2021 will not be included in the rollout of the personal learning devices because they have less than one year left in the school, said the Education Ministry in the press release.\xa0\n“Nevertheless, schools will be given flexibility to decide if they wish to facilitate the purchase of PLDs for their graduating students,” it added.\xa0\nThe Education Ministry is also working with special education schools to develop and implement plans to strengthen students’ digital literacy using personal learning devices, it said in the press release.\xa0\n“These schools will customise their plans to cater to the special educational needs of their students, and likewise, arrangements will be made for those who are on financial assistance to be given additional support for a school-prescribed PLD,” the press release read.\xa0\n“As we embrace a future of learning with more possibilities, we will support students who might come from homes with less support or who struggle to progress through school,” said Mr Wong.\xa0\n“Over the years we’ve rolled out many programmes for such students ... We will continue to do more in the coming years.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     Lawrence Wong ', '     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      MOE to work with schools to standardise modules on gender education and respect
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) hopes to work with institutes of higher learning (IHL) and schools to standardise the modules used for teaching respect and boundaries, and the protocol and response for issues that arise, said Minister of State Sun Xueling.\xa0\nThere has been a\xa0recent spate of sexual misconduct cases in universities here, more than a year after undergraduate Monica Baey spoke out online about how the National University of Singapore (NUS) responded after she was filmed taking a shower in her\xa0hostel by a fellow student.\nSeveral cases involving faculty members have also emerged in the past few months. Most recently, the dismissal of a professor\xa0by NUS marked the third time in less than two months that the institution had taken action against a current or former\xa0staff member over allegations of inappropriate behaviour or sexual misconduct.\n“The various IHLs actually have their own curriculum as well as modules on the teaching of respect and boundaries for the staff, as well as the students,” said Ms Sun, speaking to journalists on Monday (Dec 21) after a virtual engagement session organised by MOE and National Youth Council.\n“What the MOE hopes to do is to work with the IHLs closely to ensure greater standardisation of the modules that are used, and also to share resources so that there's an alignment, and to look at the cases that have come up and to also standardise the protocol and our responses to issues that arise.”\nProviding “age-appropriate” gender education to the youth about self-respect and respect for others is important, said Ms Sun.\xa0\n“There were suggestions that there should be greater alignment among schools, when it comes to the materials that are used, the standards,” she added.\xa0\nThe education ministry will work with general education schools and institutes of higher learning on topics like gender education and respect, said Ms Sun, adding that there is room for schools to share resources.\xa0\nThe dialogue on Monday involved 124 students from\xa0institutes of higher learning, and the discussion touched on issues that women face, including gender stereotypes, gender imbalance at work and the need for more gender and sexuality education.\nThis is the first such dialogue with students, as part of a\xa0national review of issues that affect women at home, in schools, workplaces and the community.\nThe ideas and suggestions gathered through these dialogues will form the basis of a White Paper to be tabled in Parliament in the first half of next year. Ms Sun is co-leading the review with Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth and Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling, and Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam.\xa0\nAddressing the call for gender and sexuality education from students who spoke during the dialogue, Ms Sun noted that the updated character and citizenship education curriculum in the upcoming school year, there will be greater emphasis on moral values, cyber wellness, and understanding the importance of respecting boundaries for self and others, both online and offline.\xa0\n“It will also recognise the importance that family has to play in the process, so schools will also engage and work closely with parents because they play a critical role in imparting values and providing guidance to their children,” she added.\xa0\nOther students spoke about the infrastructure and security improvements in institutes of higher learning in response to the recent spate of sexual misconduct cases, said Ms Sun.\xa0\n“Other participants spoke about the need to equip students with age-appropriate knowledge, so they can know how to protect themselves against online sexual grooming sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and also how to recognise inappropriate behaviour, and to understand the legal consequences, and the social, economic or social-emotional impact that such offences can have,” said Ms Sun.\nNoting what one student said about the need for “even standards” across schools for gender education about developing healthy relationships, self-love and mutual respect, Ms Sun added: “I acknowledge the feedback, and the MOE will work with the schools and the IHLs to ensure that there is alignment across institutions on gender education and respect.”\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     education ']}"

      NUS steps up approach to sexual misconduct cases; swifter police reporting, exploring bystander training
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After a spate of sexual misconduct cases, the National University of Singapore (NUS) outlined plans to step up its approach to such incidents, including reporting offences to the police promptly\xa0and exploring bystander training.\xa0\nIn an email to students, alumni and faculty members seen by CNA, NUS president Professor Tan Eng Chye noted the recent cases of sexual misconduct in local universities, with some in NUS involving faculty members.\xa0\n""Regardless of whether these incidents took place on or off-campus, such behaviour threatens the safety and well-being of our NUS community. It desecrates the campus atmosphere which is precious to all of us,""\xa0he wrote.\n""The sad truth is that no matter how hard we try, sexual misconduct cannot be completely eradicated. Yet, we must be unrelenting in our desire and effort to tackle the issue head-on. Our approach has to be holistic, just, transparent and sensitive.""\nAfter a recent review, NUS has ""further strengthened""\xa0its framework in handling cases of sexual misconduct, wrote Prof Tan.\xa0\nBuilding a culture of respect is a top priority, he said, adding that all students and faculty in NUS should be aware of the risk of sexual misconduct, are committed to averting it and know how to ""manage it institutionally"".\xa0\nBYSTANDER TRAINING\nWhile all students and staff currently undergo training about respect and consent, NUS plans to introduce refresher courses to reinforce this, said Prof Tan.\xa0\nThe university is also exploring bystander training ""to emphasise the important role and social responsibility of bystanders""\xa0in spotting sexual misconduct and taking appropriate action.\xa0\n""There are additional plans to conduct workshops to build an inclusive and respectful culture on campus, and to strengthen training for staff who are likely to be first responders in cases where sexual misconduct has occurred,""\xa0he added.\xa0\nChanges have also been made to the university’s internal process to ensure that police reports are made more promptly. NUS is required by law to report any arrestable offences, including voyeurism, outrage of modesty and rape, Prof Tan said.\xa0\nFor arrestable offences, NUS will now ensure that a police report is made no later than two weeks after the conclusion of Board of Discipline or Committee of Inquiry deliberations, he wrote. A police report may be filed earlier if circumstances warrant.\nNoting that being more open and transparent about sexual misconduct offences is ""critical to building trust""\xa0and cultivating a culture of respect on campus, Prof Tan said the university will share pertinent information about the allegations and investigation findings with the NUS community in a ""proactive and timely""\xa0manner.\xa0\n""We will continue this practice, where feasible, without compromising the privacy and well-being of victim(s),""\xa0he wrote.\xa0\nIn the recent case of Dr Jeremy Fernando, who was dismissed from Tembusu College in October after his intimate relations with a student came to light, students had criticised NUS for its handling of the case, citing a lack of communication. The first complaint against Dr Fernando was lodged on Aug 27, and the first email to the student body on the matter was sent on Oct 18.\xa0\nHALF-YEARLY REPORT\nTo raise awareness of sexual misconduct in the NUS community, the university plans to issue a report every six months on cases of sexual misconduct involving staff and/or students, said Prof Tan. The facts of each case will be redacted to prevent victims from being identified.\xa0\nTouching on two recent cases - the dismissals of Dr Fernando and Professor Theodore Hopf -\xa0the university’s president said this is evidence of NUS treating cases of sexual misconduct involving staff seriously.\xa0\nAdding that disciplinary action will be swift for staff members who have breached the Code of Conduct, he said: ""There are instances of sexual misconduct involving the interplay of unequal power relations, which are more egregious. This is why the University must treat them very seriously.""\xa0\nThe university’s Victim Care Unit will also be renamed the NUS Care Unit. It currently supports student victims, but by the second quarter of 2021, it will extend its care programmes to NUS staff, announced Prof Tan.\xa0\nThe Victim Care Unit was set up in August 2019, months after undergraduate Monica Baey spoke out online about how NUS responded when she was filmed in a hostel shower by a fellow student.\xa0\n""Many of the above measures will be progressively introduced over the next few months. This is the University’s commitment to all staff and students. As NUS management -\xa0it is our duty. You have my assurance that no effort will be spared on our part to ensure a safe and conducive campus environment,""\xa0wrote Prof Tan.\xa0\n""Yet, we need to face the reality that we are dealing with a highly complex and multifaceted challenge. We need to work together and not against each other.""\nCOMMON POLICY FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS\nOver the last 18 months, the Office of the Senior Deputy President and Provost at has reviewed the university’s staff sexual harassment and misconduct policies and set up a cross-campus committee on sexual misconduct by staff, said the university’s president.\xa0\nThe team is now evaluating how to best implement the committee’s recommendations, and more details will be shared later,\xa0he added. The university will also develop a common sexual misconduct policy applicable to all staff and students.\xa0\nReaffirming the university’s stand against sexual misconduct, Prof Tan wrote: ""Every victim of sexual misconduct is one too many. The University takes a zero-tolerance approach towards sexual misconduct.""\n""We have instituted strict policies and regulations to tackle such misconduct.

      The Big Read: Goodbye T-score, goodbye PSLE stress? Not so fast, as anxious parents size up new scoring system
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Parents of Primary 6 pupils across the country heaved a collective sigh of relief last month when their children collected their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results, closing the chapter on what had been a particularly stressful year.\nThe national exams have always been a source of anxiety for both parents and pupils each year, but the COVID-19 pandemic had brought with it a new set of challenges that made the race to the finishing line even more arduous.\xa0\nOne parent who survived the ordeal with “battle scars” to show is Ms Kelly Chen.\nInitially, the 47-year-old chief operating officer of a vet clinic had not expected to be overly concerned or worried about her 12-year-old son’s preparations for the PSLE, long viewed as a high-stakes examination that could determine one’s academic future.\xa0\nAfter all, when her eldest son took the exams two years ago, she was quite at ease.\xa0\nThe mother-of-two could go about her daily activities, such as attending yoga lessons and having a meal with friends and family, with peace of mind.\nBut this year was different, Ms Chen said.\nFor one thing, the curriculum was disrupted earlier this year when schools closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus and lessons went online.\xa0\nA full day of classes were\xa0crunched down to one 30-minute lesson each day, far shorter than the usual contact time that teachers would have with students in-person.\xa0\nBecause of this, teachers and pupils had to play catch up when physical lessons resumed.\xa0\nFor instance, teachers would usually finish teaching the Primary 6 syllabus by April and move on to revision and dishing out mock exam papers, said Ms Chen.\nBut this year, because of the pandemic, her son completed the syllabus only in July — less than three months before the actual exams in early October.\xa0\nThat was when the panic mode set in, said Ms Chen. She started to supervise her son more closely, even coming back about three hours earlier from work to ensure that the Rosyth School pupil was focused.\nEven then, she could not help but feel anxious about whether her son would be able to achieve his goal of getting into NUS High School of Math and Science.\n“I felt stressed because even though (my son) is the happy-go-lucky type, he still wants to go to his desired school and I didn’t want him to be disappointed later if he didn’t,” she said.\nWhen it was finally over and her son managed to get into the school he wanted, Ms Chen could really feel that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n“I kept telling my son: ‘I finally can feel how you feel’,” she quipped.\nOther than crossing the first milestone in the education system here, Ms Chen’s son Hong Zen was also one of the final batch of 39,995 Primary 6 pupils who took the PSLE under the T-score system.\nFirst introduced in 1960, the T-score system will be scrapped after this year as part of ongoing efforts to reform the educational system.\xa0\nReplacing it from next year onwards will be a new scoring system where pupils are assigned Achievement Level (AL) scores from AL1, the best, to AL8, instead of the current alphabetical grades.\xa0\nIn the AL scoring system, a student’s score is not linked to his or her peers’ performance. This is unlike the T-score, which is calculated based on how well a student did in relation to others in the cohort.\nWhen the changes were first announced in 2016, then-Acting Minister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng said the new scoring system is intended to ease the pressure which students face in competing against their peers’ performance.\nIt will also be a better gauge of a child’s performance as pupils will no longer be as finely differentiated on the basis of every mark, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) then.\nDespite the intention of the policymakers which was welcomed by parents in general, some parents whose children will be taking the national exams next year remain uncertain that the revamp will do much to change the pressure-cooker environment of the exam system.\xa0\nFor one, they do not quite know what to expect in the first year of the new scoring system’s implementation. This anxiety could see some parents becoming even more kiasu to make sure their kids do well. For these parents, better the devil you know, as the saying goes.\xa0\nNevertheless, for the parents of 12-year-olds taking the PSLE this year, nothing could quite prepare them for it, no matter how familiar they were with the old scoring system — given how the pandemic had severely disrupted all aspects of life as we know it.\xa0\nListen to two parents share their front-row experience to their kids\' educational journey of home-based learning during the circuit breaker\xa0on CNA\'s\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\nPSLE IN THE TIME OF COVID-19\xa0\xa0\nLike Ms Chen, other parents recounted how the coronavirus had thrown a spanner in the works, adding even more stress to students — and parents — preparing for the PSLE.\xa0Ms Elaine Tan’s 12-year-old son also went through a “mad rush” to finish the entire Primary 6 syllabus due to the disruptions to physical lessons.\xa0\nAs a result, the time for revision before the actual exams was compressed as well.\nBecause of this, the mother-son pair had to be more strategic in their exam preparations — placing emphasis on the major topics and question-spotting in order to cover as much ground as possible.\nAdding to the anxiety was the fear of contracting the virus. Concerned that her son may be stricken with COVID-19 before the PSLE, the family chose to stay mostly at home to minimise their risk of being exposed to the coronavirus.\nMaking use of all the tools in her arsenal, Ms Tan also took advantage of her employer’s PSLE leave accommodation scheme, which lets employees with children taking the PSLE to carry forward up to 15 days of leave from the year before, to aid her son in his revision. She took a total of about a month off spread out throughout the year.\n“The kids had to cope with an inordinate amount of stress during this period,” said the vice-president at OCBC Bank.\xa0“Imagine taking a major exam just three weeks after seeing the material for the first time. It was cutting things very close,” said Ms Tan, who is in her 40s.\nBefore the pandemic, homemaker Angela (not her real name), 45, was already feeling the pressure of making sure her son could qualify for a top Integrated Programme (IP) school.\nThat meant enrolling her son for multiple tuition and enrichment classes and adhering to a strict revision schedule to hit the 260 to 262 T-score goal that they had set together.\xa0\nOn most days, Angela shared that her son would eat his lunch and change in the car so that he could race to tuition class after he was released from school.\xa0\nA typical day for him would start at 6.30am, when he would wake up for school. After school, he would attend a tuition class from 3pm to 5pm, before heading to another one from 7.30pm to 9.30pm.\xa0\nFrom 9.30pm, he would do his own revision and pore over exam papers given by the school until around 11pm, when he would go to bed.\nThis schedule would be repeated on the weekends, but school hours were replaced with more personal revision, she said.\nUltimately, all the hard work bore fruit — her son got 272 for the PSLE and attained a spot in Raffles Institution.\nAngela, who is a Chinese national married to a Singaporean, said a lot of her stress stems from cultural beliefs back in China, where children are under even greater academic pressure than they are here.\xa0\nSuch beliefs are difficult to shake off even though she has lived here for a decade, she said.\xa0\nQUALMS ABOUT NEW SCORING SYSTEM\xa0\nWhile the likes of Angela, Ms Chen and Ms Tan are relieved to see the back of the PSLE, parents of pupils taking the Primary 6 exams next year expressed concerns that the new scoring system may create more, not less, stress for them and their children.\nOne point of contention which came up repeatedly in\xa0interviews with parents is the belief that the AL scoring system favours all-round pupils while putting those with clear strengths and weaknesses at a disadvantage.\nFor example, a student who does poorly in one subject may end up with an overall “poorer” score even though he or she has done better in the other three PSLE subjects.\xa0\nThen, there is also the worry that the AL system may result in even greater competition to get into some of the more popular secondary schools, as the smaller range of possible PSLE scores might lead to more clustering of cut-off points across secondary schools.\xa0\nFor Ms Carrie Ng, 41, her concern over the new scoring system deepened after her 11-year-old son Bryan in Primary 5 received his end-of-year report card this year, which had his grades indicated as ALs to familiarise parents and pupils with the new PSLE scoring system.\nThough her son usually performs well in school, he received a poorer than expected AL score because the AL bands are narrower at the top of the score system.\xa0\nMs Ng hopes that Bryan can qualify for an IP school next year but his Primary 5 simulated score would not be good enough. And this set off some alarm bells within the household.\xa0\n“We were pretty shocked,” said Ms Ng, who works in the logistics sector.\nShe added: “The benefit of the T-score system is that it takes into account every subject … so the stronger subjects can really pull up your whole score. (But with the AL system), you can easily slide into a lower band.”\nIn light of this, Ms Ng has chosen to sign her son up for English writing classes as languages are his weaker subjects. This is something that she would not have done had the T-score system remained in place for next year’s PSLE, she said.\xa0\nThese sentiments were echoed by Gwen Seah, 11, who will be among the first batch of pupils taking the PSLE under the new system. She, too, felt that it “can be unfair” and “favours all-rounders”.\n“It’s harder for those who are only good in one or two subjects,” said Dylan Seah, her 12-year-old brother who sat for the PSLE this year.\xa0\nPRESSURE OF GETTING INTO TOP SEC SCHOOLS REMAIN\xa0\xa0\nMs Gina Low, 46, is the mother of Dylan and Gwen.\nWith her son being in the final batch of students under the old scoring system and her daughter among the pioneers of the new one, she does not think the change will make too much of a difference as the stress for parents and students ultimately comes during the school selection process.\n“Frankly, at the end of the day, the drive to go to the top schools is still there,” she said.\xa0\nWith a smaller range of scores under the AL system, there would potentially be more students applying for the same popular schools, she added.\nUnder the new scoring system, MOE said a new “tie-breaker” of choice order of schools has been introduced for pupils with identical PSLE scores vying for places in a particular school.\xa0\nThis means a student who picks the school higher in his or her list of six will have priority.\xa0\nHow the new scoring system will affect the school selection process is also a top concern for Ms Desiree Yaw, whose 11-year-old son will be taking the PSLE next year.\nThough the 43-year-old business research assistant believed that the new scoring system will place less stress on pupils, she felt the wider banding makes it difficult to judge which secondary schools would be best suited for her son’s capabilities.\nUnder the T-score system, pupils were more clearly differentiated in terms of their scores and the different standards of the schools were also indicated by specific cut-off points.\n“But with the banding, (it’s not clear where he would stand compared to his peers) and I am not sure which school I should choose for him,” said Ms Yaw.\xa0\nSeparately, some parents and educators have also voiced concerns over how the banding of grades makes it harder for Foundation students to move up to the Express stream if they take two or more Foundation-level subjects.\xa0\nUnder the new system, Foundation subject grades will be placed into three broader bands — AL A, AL B and AL C. At the PSLE level, AL A is equivalent to AL6, AL B to AL7, and AL C to AL8.\xa0\nTo enter the Express stream, pupils will need to have an AL score of 4 to 22.\nNEW SYSTEM REDUCES UNHEALTHY COMPETITION: TEACHERS\xa0\nStill, there were parents who welcomed the new system and believed that it will take time for the benefits to be truly felt.\nOne parent, Dr Chinnu Palanivelu, 43, said: “Overall, the change is a good move because a student’s score will not be affected by other students’ performance.”\n“Hopefully, once it’s implemented and things get started, then there will be a consensus,” added the managing partner at Stamford Assurance.\nEducators\xa0interviewed also believed that the revamp will help to alleviate some PSLE-related pressures.\xa0\nThey cannot be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.\nOne Primary 5 science teacher said: “Especially in the best class, students always want to be the best. You have children crying because they are one mark away from a full score.”\nWith the new AL system, such scenarios are less likely to happen as students do not know their exact scores. This helps to reduce unhealthy competition and stress, he added.\nThough he acknowledged that the uncertainty of the new school selection process can lead to “real fear” for parents and students, the Primary\xa05 teacher believed the new system would force them to think very carefully about their choice and ranking of schools — for instance, by looking at co-curricular and leadership opportunities\xa0\xa0— instead of “blindly putting emphasis” on academic scores.\nAgreeing, Mr Darryl David, deputy chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Education, said the main advantage of the new scoring system is that it does not go down to the granular detail of every single mark, which leads to an ultra competitive culture.\nHe noted that this new way of banding scores together is akin to the way secondary school students are graded in the GCE O-level examinations, where students are also given an overall aggregate score rather than an absolute number.\n“In that regard, I think (the new PSLE scoring system) is something that we are quite familiar with,” said Mr David, who is a Member of Parliament (MP) for Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency.\nMr Patrick Tay, chairman of the GPC for Education, noted that improvements can still be made to the new system, but a first run will be needed to see where the gaps lie.\n“We need to let the first batch run its course and then tweak accordingly, especially since there are subjective elements such as the choices which parents or students make for their secondary school admission,” said Mr Tay, who is an MP for Pioneer Single Member Constituency.\nThe Primary 5 Science teacher disagreed that the AL system favours all-rounders.\xa0\nEven with the T-score system, it was difficult to pull up a pupil’s overall score if the pupil is particularly weak in one or more subjects to the point of failing, he said.\xa0\nHe added that in fact, the new system might actually reduce the stress on students when it comes to their weaker subjects because the AL5 and AL6 bands are wider.\xa0\nHowever, another Primary 5 English teacher acknowledged that such concerns are valid, and that some parents might send their kids for extra lessons to compensate for weaker subjects.\xa0\n“Education is supposed to give everybody equal footing,” she said. “But the richer can afford to have all these extra lessons, so they are moving up higher and faster.”\nAs for Foundation-level students, the English teacher said some parents of such students have actually welcomed the change.\nThese parents are generally not too concerned about the cap of AL A (equivalent to AL6) for Foundation-level subjects, as they already know that their child is most likely to enter the Normal Technical stream in secondary school, she added.\nIn fact, the parents are “very happy” and “more relaxed” as their children are happier, she said, partly because achieving a passing score of AL B\xa0\xa0— or a minimum of 30 marks\xa0\xa0— in their Primary 5 exams this year boosted the students’ morale.\nShe added that she can now afford to focus less on the students’ academic grades and more on helping them understand concepts, and incorporating storytelling and life skills into her lessons.\xa0“Teaching is less stressful,” she said.\xa0\n“I can concentrate on teaching, and not be so calculative.”\nIn a\xa0previous reply addressing these concerns, MOE had said that students taking Foundation-level subjects are still eligible for Express, Normal Academic or Normal Technical courses as they qualify based on their overall PSLE scores, and that individual subjects do not directly affect which stream the student is admitted to.\n""UP TO PARENTS TO EMBRACE CHANGE""\nWhether the new scoring system achieves its intended outcome depends on how parents react to the changes starting next year, said the Primary 5 Science teacher.\nMuch of the stress and pressure does come from peers and parents, noted Australian national John McGrath, who had his first encounter with the Singapore educational system when his 12-year-old daughter Kirana took the PSLE this year.\xa0\n“I’m definitely not used to 12-year-olds being under so much pressure here,” said the 49-year-old finance director, who has been a permanent resident in Singapore for more than two decades.\nEducation experts and MPs spoken to reiterated that ultimately, parents have a key role to play in bringing about improvements to the system.\xa0\nAfter all, no amount of changes will bring about a perfect educational system, said Mr David, as any system will have its own set of challenges and concerns.\xa0\n“Pressure, worry, stress is what we feel. It’s how we react to the system that determines our level of stress,” said the Ang Mo Kio GRC MP.\nHe added: “As parents we have a job to also help manage the impact of the system and filter the stress of the system for our children.”\xa0\nA major overhaul of the system will not be so easy if parents stick to their own beliefs based on their prior expectations and experiences with the old system, said Dr Jason Tan, associate professor of policy, curriculum and leadership at the National Institute of Education.\nWhile some parents take a more laissez faire approach, others with high aspirations might engage in “high-stakes planning” to ensure that their children get into top schools, he noted.\xa0\n“(This new scoring system) is part of the move to bring across the idea that there are different pathways in the education system,” he said.\xa0\n“There can be a variety of pathways, but for some (parents), there is a clear and definite hierarchy.”\nHe added: “As long as this kind of thinking endures, there will still be some parents and students going all out to access what they believe to be more prestigious pathways.”\nListen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys\xa0in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA\'s\xa0Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\nDr Ho Boon Tiong from educational training and consulting firm ClassPoint Consulting suggested that parents discuss with their children how to monitor their learning and develop their interests as well as how to choose secondary schools, rather than simply focusing on their academic performances.\xa0\nMr David called on parents to see the revamp as a “blank canvas” — an opportunity to cast aside the baggage of the old scoring system.\n“Starting with the new system perhaps allows us to recalibrate and reassess how we view this creature concept of the PSLE and how we make our choices for post-PSLE education,” he said.\nOn the whole, Mr Tay said the PSLE revamp also needs to be viewed together with the new subject-based banding system that has been introduced in secondary schools.\xa0\nThe new banding system allows students to take subjects at a higher or lower level based on their strengths.\xa0\n“(These changes have been made) so that each and every student can realise his or her full potential without compromising on interests, passions and strengths,” added the Pioneer MP.\xa0\xa0\nAgreeing, Dr Ho said: “I think (parents) have to set realistic expectations for themselves. It means (having) to redefine what it means to be successful in education.”\xa0\nIndeed, judging by\xa0interviews with parents and their children, more often than not, it is the adults who appear to be more anxious than their kids taking the exam.\nFor more news like this, visit\xa0todayonline.com\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     The Big Read ']}"

      Commentary: PSLE scores could impact life outcomes. So don’t let them
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Last month, the\xa0Primary School Leaving Examination\xa0(PSLE)\xa0results were released.\nEvery year, right around the time this happens,\xa0we often see\xa0people sharing stories on social or traditional media about how they didn’t quite do so well in the PSLE but nevertheless attained success in life.\nFilm-maker Royston Tan, for instance, has notably shared that he scored 168 for the exam, placing him in the normal stream. Today, however, he is a celebrated film-maker.\n“You just have to give your best in whatever you do and believe that the dots will connect in the future”, he said in 2018.\nOften, these stories go viral because of the feel-good vibes they create. The main message from these stories seems to be: Don’t take the PSLE scores too seriously. They do not define you.\nYet\xa0these stories would be challenged by netizens and criticised for being\xa0insensitive\xa0anecdotes which lack generalisability.\nNOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH IMPACT A DIFFERENT PSLE SCORE MIGHT HAVE HAD ON YOU\nHow Singaporeans have learnt to cope with this high-stakes exam has evolved over many years. In particular, there is a growing realisation that while grades shouldn’t define us, they do shape subsequent pathways.\nOne reason why PSLE scores\xa0still receive attention\xa0is because\xa0they\xa0do\xa0determine your course of study in secondary school. Less ideal grades may mean being tracked to a less demanding stream.\nThis could alter life outcomes since the type of education received (whether academic or vocational) and the peers one\xa0will encounter\xa0are different.\nHow different would your life be had you been tracked into a different stream? The people sharing their stories seem to argue it did not matter much, because despite doing badly in the PSLE and being tracked into a less demanding stream, they ended up in a well-paying job anyway.\nBut frankly, no one knows. You will never know what lies at the end of the road not taken.\xa0\nPerhaps\xa0you\xa0might have enjoyed an even better job had\xa0you\xa0gone to a more demanding stream?\xa0Perhaps you might have encountered vastly different connections that would have led to down another career path?\nWHY COMPARING OUTCOMES ACROSS STREAM IS PROBLEMATIC\nNetizens often suggest that one way to tell if streaming has had an effect is to compare the outcomes of people who studied in different streams. For instance, compare the salaries of graduates from the express stream to those from the normal (academic) stream.\nHowever, such comparisons are unlikely to reliably capture the effect of streaming.\xa0Graduates from the express and the normal streams are not the same to begin with.\nThey may differ, on average, in aspects like family income, parental education, innate ability, and\xa0more.\nConsequently, part or even all of the difference in salary may be reflecting differences in these attributes,\xa0rather than\xa0the effect of streaming.\nA more reliable approach to tell if streaming has made a difference would be to use what economists call a regression discontinuity design. This approach compares people who fall narrowly on both sides of some PSLE score which determines stream status.\nFor instance, suppose that students would qualify for the express stream only if they scored above or equal to a cut-off like 188 for the PSLE.\nIf so, we can compare the salaries of people who narrowly scored above 188 (and so managed to get into the express stream) to those who narrowly scored below (and so failed to get into the express stream).\nSince people immediately on both sides of this fence are likely to be similar on average, any difference in salaries would be capturing the impact of being tracked into a different stream.\nSuch a study has yet been done in Singapore due to the lack of publicly available data. But there is value in pursuing it because it allows us to better understand the consequences of streaming\xa0and\xa0ability-based grouping in general.\xa0\nBUT SUBJECT-BASED BANDING MAY CHANGE THAT\xa0\nSuch an exercise\xa0might have been overtaken by events\xa0given that Singapore will from 2024 be entering a new era where streaming will be replaced by subject-based banding (SBB).\nOne of the greatest merits of SBB is it retains the benefits of customised education\xa0-\xa0by ensuring students receive instruction in specific academic subjects tailored to their learning needs\xa0-\xa0yet avoids the labels\xa0accompanying\xa0being tracked into a less demanding stream.\nLabels are harder to ascribe under SBB since, in theory, each student can pursue each subject at a pace which is either more or less demanding.\nIt also opens up the possibility of greater social mixing between students of different abilities since students are no longer grouped into self-contained classes based on their overall previous academic achievement across all subjects. Instead,\xa0they\xa0attend different classes for\xa0various\xa0subjects based on their specific subject ability.\nSchools can also organise students into\xa0mixed\xa0form classes\xa0for\xa0common curriculum subjects like art. Each class would then\xa0comprise a mixture of students with different abilities.\xa0\nENSURING PATHWAYS REMAIN POROUS\xa0\xa0\nOf course, the only exception is if a student takes all of his academic subjects at a less demanding level\xa0and face inevitable invidious comparisons with his peers.\nFor such a student, his received secondary school education could still limit his progression\xa0since taking all subjects at,\xa0say,\xa0the least-demanding level (i.e. G1 level) could ultimately leave\xa0him or her\xa0unprepared to take on an academically-oriented post-secondary education.\nSuch a student must be\xa0willing to take a less direct route\xa0(for example, going from an ITE to a polytechnic before becoming eligible for university)\xa0– which could be long and arduous – to overcome that and eventually be placed into an academic track. This may deter many.\nThat is not to say that all students should be allowed to access an academically-oriented post-secondary education. Some students will naturally be less suited for such a track.\nRather, it says that pathways\xa0must remain open and porous\xa0with criteria for entry into university sufficiently diverse to ensure secondary school accomplishment doesn’t become an obstacle for students who should be admitted.\xa0\nEven then, such a student\xa0with an unconventional educational background\xa0could continue to be labelled and stigmatised.\nMAKING SBB FLUID\nAs we move towards SBB, continuing to find ways\xa0to keep pathways flexible and open\xa0will be key to\xa0ensure we do not close\xa0off life opportunities for late bloomers.\nOne way to do this is to make the “promotion process” simpler\xa0and remove\xa0obstacles\xa0teachers face\xa0in trying to promote students to read subjects at more demanding levels\xa0as students’ abilities improve.\nIn particular, requirements for teachers to write lengthy reports justifying why a student should be “promoted” should be avoided because this creates incentives for teachers to maintain the status quo.\nFurther, flexibility should be built into the system so that students will be able to be identified for “promotion” any time during the school year as long as he/she is ready and school resources permit.\nThis will enable students to transit into the new curriculum more quickly instead of having to wait for pre-specified junctures, as has been proposed.\nThese\xa0could\xa0help to\xa0achieve the policy intent of SBB better and\xa0minimise\xa0its\xa0downsides.\nWhile SBB will make PSLE scores less of a make-or-break, the system has room for improvement to ensure that education will be an enabler, not a stumbling block.\nListen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys\xa0in a no-holds barred conversation on our Heart of the Matter podcast:\n\nKelvin Seah Kah Cheng is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Economics, National University of Singapore and a Research Affiliate at the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Why the percentage of pupils going from primary to secondary school has remained the same over 5 years
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: PSLE scores of primary school students are not “force fitted” into a bell curve by the Ministry of Education (MOE), a spokesperson said on Monday (Dec 7).\nThe percentage of students “assessed suitable to progress” from primary to secondary school has remained the same over the past five years - 2016 to 2020 -\xa0at 98.4 per cent.\nThe percentage of those going into the Express stream in this same period has stayed between 66.2 per cent and 66.6 per cent, while those going to Normal (Academic) has remained between 20.6 per cent and 21.4 per cent.\xa0\nAbout 10.6 per cent to 11.2 per cent of pupils went to the Normal (Technical) stream.\nThe number of students who have taken the\xa0PSLE\xa0over the last five years was\xa0between 38,800 and 40,300.\nNO BELL CURVE GRADING: MOE\nIn response to CNA’s queries on the consistent results in recent years, the MOE spokesperson said bell curve grading is not used in any of the national exams.\xa0\n“In the current PSLE T-score system, the T-score uses a statistical method to represent how well a student has done in relation to his/her peers. T-scores are not forced into a bell curve,” said the spokesperson.\nAccording to the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board's (SEAB)\xa0website,\xa0the aggregate T-score indicates how well a student has performed on average in all four subjects relative to his or her cohort. It is used to determine the priority of admission to secondary schools and the eligibility for the different secondary school pathways.\nFrom next year, PSLE scores will be calculated using achievement level bands and students will receive\xa01 to 8 for each of their four subjects, with their final score made up of the sum of these achievement levels.\nThe A, O, N(A) and N(T) Level exams are standards-referenced, where the grades awarded reflect a candidate’s “own level of mastery in the subject” based on an absolute set of standards, said the spokesperson, adding that this is regardless of how well students\xa0have performed in comparison with their peers.\nThe new achievement level bands system for PSLE will also be standards-referenced.\n“Statistically, test scores of a large population of candidates would tend to fall into a normal distribution or bell curve,” the spokesperson added.\n“This is unsurprising as there will be natural variation in the level of mastery in any subject among a large group of students.\xa0\n“However, this does not mean that we had force fitted the exam scores of students into a bell curve.”\nThe papers\xa0are set with a “balanced proportion” of basic, average and challenging questions, and this proportion remains the same every year so as to “maintain the overall standard of exams”, the spokesperson explained.\nBut the distribution of grades is not “predetermined” by a bell curve.\n“If there are more candidates demonstrating better quality work, a higher percentage of them will be awarded better grades.”\nBALANCE OF QUESTIONS\nThe SEAB\xa0has processes in place to ensure that the overall standards of national examination papers are maintained across the years, said the spokesperson.\nThis\xa0responsibility falls on a panel of experienced school teachers, MOE curriculum specialists and SEAB assessment specialists.\nThe MOE spokesperson said the panel “adheres to a test blueprint” to ensure that the examinations are aligned to the syllabus objectives and that “learning outcomes and standards are maintained from year to year”.\nThere is also an “appropriate balance” of easy, average and more challenging questions in the exam papers,\xa0the spokesperson said.\n“To maintain comparable standards every year and ensure that all candidates receive a fair and valid assessment, grading takes into consideration ... factors such as the overall difficulty of the paper and the overall quality of candidates’ work for that examination year.\n“The percentages of students progressing to each course in secondary school are based on actual cohort performance.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: It took a while but Singaporean workers are finally embracing lifelong learning
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: In education, we believe challenges bring “teachable moments”.\nWe tend to think that despite how much stress and uneasiness adversity creates, these offer fresh opportunities for personal growth and professional development.\nPerhaps many of us educators are optimists.\nBut in a year where so much has been disrupted by COVID-19, a sense of hope can give us greater gumption to stare down the chasm created by the coronavirus to focus on the positives of needed change.\nDIFFERENCES IN FATES EVEN IN THE SAME SECTOR\nMany industries have been upended over the past 10 months. Billions of lives have had to cope with disruption.\nThe pandemic has accelerated mega-trends such as digitalisation and artificial intelligence, which have increased the pace of job displacement.\nThough Singapore has weathered the first phase of the storm well, we cannot underestimate the far-reaching implications.\xa0\nWhile the Jobs Support Scheme managed to put many jobs into suspended animation until firms could get a firm footing, the economy continued to shrink at 5.6 per cent in the third quarter.\nInterestingly, while many firms, beloved restaurants and more, have had to shutter, interesting many sectors are offering record number of positions as organisations pivot towards new business opportunities.\nFood services supplying hotels, restaurants and cafes saw a 40 to 90 per cent dip in sales as of September, compared to a 30 to 70 per cent surge in food manufacturing.\nSuch developments underscore the need for re-training and upskilling: By reminding us that we can thrive amid a generational maelstrom, and even in the same industry, if we embrace lifelong learning.\nCREATING A LEARNING SOCIETY\nA global push towards lifelong learning has been underway for decades. A seminal report addressing lifelong learning was published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in 1996.\nThe report advanced the idea of a “learning society” founded on the “acquisition, renewal and use of knowledge” in response to major contextual factors such as worldwide interdependence and globalisation, growing inequalities in development, and the challenges posed by the new information technologies.\nThe UNESCO Education Commission recommended four pillars of education, among which was \xa0“learning to know”, in the laying of a solid foundation for lifelong learning through the combining of a sufficiently broad general education with the possibility of in-depth study of a selected number of subjects, as well as learning to learn.\nSingapore’s push towards lifelong learning arguably started almost the same time UNESCO released its report.\xa0\nThen Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had launched in 1997, the Thinking Schools, Learning Nation vision, to encourage young Singaporeans to develop a lifelong passion for learning in the nation’s drive towards a knowledge economy.\nYet lifelong learning has often been characterised as a work-in-progress, needing more pushing and prodding in the two decades since.\xa0\nBut in recent years, the education system has evolved to keep pace with the realisation that a digital economy prone to disruption urgently needs to prepare its future workforce. Singapore’s schooling system strengthened the four pillars of education.\nThe Ministry of Education has focused on reducing the emphasis on assessment demands in schools and promote the intrinsic joy of learning.\xa0\nBeginning from 2019, students in Primary 1 and 2 no longer have weighted assessments or examinations while Secondary 1 pupils don’t need to sit for mid-year exams. From this year and next, students in Primary 3, Primary 5 and Secondary 3 will also be exempted from mid-year exams.\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\nBy 2024, streaming will be phased out and full subject-based banding be implemented across secondary schools.\nMore emphasis has also been placed on education and career guidance in schools and institutes of higher learning, while work-study programmes have been instituted in polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). \xa0\nFrom 2018, ITE students can choose to enrol in the work-study diploma programme where about 70 per cent of curriculum time is spent at work and the rest in class.\nLEVERAGING ON SKILLSFUTURE\nRecognising that lifelong learning must involve the creation of strong institutions beyond the education sector, the Government launched the SkillsFuture initiative in 2015 to catalyse a love for learning in working adults.\xa0\nThis initiative has been strengthened to create stronger linkages between training and work, through Adapt and Grow, a mid-career transition programme which placed 30,000 people in new roles in 2018, and Earn and Learn, a work-study programme for diploma holders and ITE graduates.\nAs he announced the expansion of SkillsFuture work-study programmes in August, Education Minister Lawrence Wong explained: “We strive to foster the joy of learning in our students, so that Singaporeans are equipped not just with knowledge and skills, but also with the spark to pursue their passion and fulfil their potential.”\nIn other words, SkillsFuture is not to be narrowly confined to employability concerns, but rather to be part of a route towards self-realisation and personal development, blurring the lines between the life phases of education and work.\nDespite this ambitious attempt at entrenching a lifelong learning society in Singapore, there are issues to it becoming a reality.\nGETTING PEOPLE TO THE CLASSROOMS\nFor one, while the SkillsFuture is a laudable plan, will everyone subscribe to it?\nAn area of concern has long been low levels of skills confidence among seniors who had not completed secondary schooling, particularly when regarding digital or technological skills, which could become an impediment in the mode of learning and possible career choices.\nFor instance, researchers at the Institute for Adult Learning (IAL) have found a relatively sharp decline in engagement with technologies for learning among those between the ages of 40 and 70 years.\nThen-Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong highlighted the struggles faced by low-income households, the differently-abled and seniors in terms of digital literacy and skills.\xa0\n“Some do not have the skills-set to take their work online especially when their previous work was done face-to-face. This can mean loss of income and opportunities to retrain or learn new skills,” she wrote in a CNA commentary in May.\nIn addition, the IAL researchers also found that participation in lifelong learning is significantly influenced by how much recognition certification is given.\nIn a closed-door discussion on SkillsFuture and employability organised by the Institute of Policy Studies in February 2018, one of the guest speakers Nur Ellisa Abdul Rahman, then a Sales Support Manager, said \xa0“that the lack of recognition for Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) by businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, would prevent working adults from taking up SkillsFuture courses.”\nThe problem, she added, was that there was a lack of clarity of how a WSQ diploma measured up to diplomas provided for by private institutes, polytechnics and the ITE.\nThese factors are likely to have contributed to the low take-up rate for SkillsFuture. Official reports show training participation rates are still at less than half (49 per cent) of the eligible population in 2019 despite it rising from 35 per cent in 2015.\nWILL IT MEET ITS AIMS?\nThere is also the danger that the SkillsFuture programme, while well-intended, may result in distorted outcomes.\nFor example, while the SkillsFuture manifesto explicitly promotes skills mastery over mere paper qualifications, there is always the danger pre-existing societal preoccupation with the latter will turn SkillsFuture into yet another paper chase.\nMeanwhile, policymakers have to ensure that the quest for greater employability amid volatile economic circumstances does not jeopardise other valued aspects of lifelong learning, such as inclusivity and personal fulfilment.\nFor someone from a lower socio-economic status, finding a job to put food on the table and pay bills is likely to triumph considerations of personal gain from learning.\nSo even if participation rates in programmes are high, it doesn’t mean that people are necessarily doing it because they enjoy learning. Rather they could be compelled by short-term pandemic-related economic reasons. \xa0\xa0\nPERCEPTIONS AND EMOTIONS MATTER\nMight old mind-sets about the kind of work we each aspire towards hold us back from pivoting to new roles and industries and truly embracing lifelong learning if the subjects are far from our idea role?\nThis traditional devaluing of what author David Goodhart, in his recently published book Head, Hand, Heart, calls “hand” (manual and craft) work and “heart” (caring, emotional) work in favour of “head” (cognitive) work may exert a powerful influence over workers’ willingness to explore alternative spheres of work.\nGoodhart claims that cognitive-analytical ability, or the talent to pass examinations and then handle information efficiently in professional work, has become “the gold standard of human esteem.”\nA “head” professional would not likely consider switching to blue-collar or “hand” work. This may impact the take-up of SkillsFuture courses, largely seen as a programme aimed at training people for “hand” work.\nRecognise that human learning is also a social and emotional one can help uncover encumbrances to learning.\nAfter all, one’s learning attitudes are deeply shaped by one’s social environment and personal circumstances.\nIndividual concerns over a potential “loss of face” and the ease of adjustment to a totally new sphere of work cannot be summarily dismissed as evidence of an overly finicky job-seeker, especially in the case of mid-career individuals.\nA service-level worker in his or her 50s who has had no technological background may be concerned if he or she is able to cope with a new career in IT services against younger and more tech-savvy colleagues despite undergoing a relevant course.\nIt has proven much easier to change “hardware” by instituting new programmes and courses than to change people’s attitudes towards learning, the social environment that shapes those attitudes, as well as to improve access for marginalised segments of the population.\nThere is hope that current education reforms in the direction of developing all four pillars of learning among school students will bear fruit in due course and help shift some of these attitudinal factors.\nEncouragingly, signs show that COVID-19 has warmed people up more towards the idea of training and lifelong learning. \xa0\nAccording to SkillsFuture Singapore, 12,950 training opportunities under the SGUnited Skills programme – part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package to help job seekers during the pandemic - opened up in July and August. Over 13,000 people signed up for them in the same period.\nEmployers too are finding value in training.\xa0\nAs at June, nearly 800 companies had taken up training spots under the Enhanced Training Support Package (ETSP), which gives all employers absentee payroll support at 90 per cent of workers' hourly basic salary.\nPerhaps COVID-19 might provide that needed nudge.\nJason Tan is an associate professor at the National Institute of Education.\n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     jobs ']}"

      College neighbourhoods are 'like ghost towns' as Jakarta university remains shut amid COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': ""JAKARTA: With the majority of their\xa0occupants studying remotely from home, the neighbourhoods near one of Indonesia’s most prestigious universities appeared quiet and desolate.\nOutside the gates of University of Indonesia – a vast, 320ha campus located just south of the Indonesian capital Jakarta –\xa0dormitories and houses for rent have\xa0been mostly vacant since the university decided to cancel all in-person classes in March following the COVID-19 outbreak.\n“This place has been vacant for months,” Ahmad Fathony, a keeper at an all-male dormitory in Kukusan area, told CNA. “I only come here twice a day, in the morning to turn off the lights and in the afternoon to turn the lights back on.”\nBefore the pandemic, the sub-district of Kukusan in the Jakarta suburb of Depok was buzzing with students who frequented its many restaurants, shops, mini marts and cafes.\nThousands, mainly students from the university’s engineering and economics faculties nearby, lived in hundreds of dormitories, rented rooms and houses which occupy almost every corner of Kukusan down to its labyrinthine alleyways.\nThat number had dwindled to just a few hundred, locals and students estimated.\n“In my dormitory, out of the 29 rooms available, only three are occupied,” Faundra Ikhsan, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student told CNA.\nIkhsan’s dormitory, known locally as “kost”, sits right at the edge of the University of Indonesia campus. The further the dormitories are from the university gates, the lower the occupancy rate.\xa0\nMany dormitories have shuttered doors and padlocked fences with tall unkempt grasses and shrubs on their front lawns, an indication that not a soul was inside. Cafes and laundromats have\xa0also closed with little signs of reopening.\nWhile shops and restaurants still opened during the day to cater to university staffers, security guards and students, all economic activities ceased after dark. This is despite the fact that a new semester has begun, after a break in July and August.\xa0\n“It can get really quiet at night. After 8pm no one is outside and Kukusan resembles a ghost town,” 22-year-old Ikhsan said.\nUNCERTAIN TIMES\n“Do you know when the campus will reopen?”\xa0\nMulyadi, who runs a\xa0tiny restaurant and a stall at the engineering faculty’s cafeteria, asked the same question every time a student or campus security guard dropped by for a meal.\xa0\nIt is a question which has been lingering in his mind for months, but no one has\xa0an answer.\nThe 47-year-old, who like many Indonesians goes with one name, had closed down his business earlier when the university decided to cease all in-person classes indefinitely. He\xa0laid off two of his workers and went back to his village in West Sumatra province.\n“There was nothing to do back in my village. After a few months, I decided to return even though I knew the students were gone,” he said.\nHe returned to Kukusan in July and to his surprise there were still students from outside Jakarta who decided to stay put because of better Internet access. There were also staffers who work every other day on campus. The campus cafeteria is still closed.\n“My daily income has dwindled. I used to make 2 million rupiah ($142) a day. Now I make 400,000 rupiah a day. After rent and other expenses, I barely break even,” Mulyadi said.\nOther businesses in Kukusan are also\xa0suffering.\nNina Rahman, 55, said her 15-room dormitory has been a\xa0money pit since the pandemic began and she is considering selling the property.\n“I have tried slashing down the rental but no one is interested. My dormitory is a bit secluded and it is an old building. I cannot compete with newer and fancier dormitories who sit right in front of the (campus) gates,” she told CNA.\n“The cost to maintain the place, the bills, the property tax, it’s just too much for a widow like me. I hope the campus reopens or someone would just take the property off my hands. Whichever happens sooner.”\nThe Ministry of Education has said that only schools and universities located in the green and yellow zones are allowed to reopen. A green zone is an area with zero new cases in a 14-day period while a yellow zone is an area with only a handful of imported cases and no local transmission.\nThe city of Depok, where the university is located,\xa0is considered a red zone with a high number of local transmissions. \xa0\nSOME FIND REMOTE LEARNING CHALLENGING\nThe University of Indonesia campus grounds felt even more deserted than Kukusan. Aside from a few security guards and janitors roaming around as well as a handful of students who needed to use the laboratories, there was hardly anyone else there.\n“Before (the pandemic), it's only ever gotten this quiet during school breaks,” Ova Candra Dewi, an architecture lecturer told CNA.\nHer department used to be filled with students staying until late – sometimes overnight – building architecture models, making technical drawings and getting ready for their presentations.\nThat all changed in mid-March when the university announced that it was ceasing all in-person classes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The announcement, Dewi said, was made on a Friday on Mar 13\xa0and was effective next\xa0Monday.\n“We only had one weekend to devise ways to conduct classes, how students should submit assignments and do consultation for their thesis and final presentation. We scrambled to get the system ready,” she said.\n“No matter how much preparation we did, there were always glitches and unforeseen issues. It was a struggle for both students and lecturers. It took time to get used to the system in place today.”\nBut studying remotely is not for everyone.\n“Online learning is for those privileged enough to have a steady Internet access,” 19-year-old geophysics student Syauqi Muhammad told CNA.\nWhen the university decided to put\xa0in-person classes on hold,\xa0Muhammad returned to his parent’s home, a two-and-a-half-hour bus ride away from the University of Indonesia. But the Internet connection in his small town is patchy at best.\n“That’s why this semester I decided to live near campus again. I can get a steady Internet connection here. I can also go to the campus to get free Wi-Fi,” he said.\nBut even with good Internet connection, remote learning is not completely effective.\xa0\n“On one hand we are happy that learning becomes more flexible. But on the other hand, some subjects require us to do lab work. If lab work is performed by others on a live stream, how are we able to understand?” industrial engineering student Ananda Pasha told CNA.\nAlthough Pasha’s house is just a short train ride away from University of Indonesia, the 22-year-old said that he has only been to campus twice to do some lab work during the pandemic.\n“I miss going to campus, but none of my friends are there so I see no reason why I should go there more often.”\nA QUIET PLACE\nMechanical engineering student Ikhsan said he chose to stay in Kukusan because he needs to spend a lot of time in the lab for his thesis.\nIkhsan said he was initially quite scared about going to campus as Depok, where the first three COVID-19 cases in Indonesia were reported, is still considered a hotbed for COVID-19 infection.\xa0\nThe condition is a far cry from his native city of Serang, three hours away from the campus. On Nov 18, Serang reported just 11 new infections, while Depok had 120 new cases.\xa0\n“In August, I started to come to campus and stayed at a friend’s place. In September, I started coming more frequently. In October, I decided to again rent my own place in Kukusan,” he said.\nIkhsan said the majority of those who chose to stay in Kukusan are final year students and those who are from outside of Jakarta. He is both. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“Internet connection in my hometown is fine. But it is just more practical for me to stay in Kukusan. Because of my thesis, I need to use the labs, I need to visit the library and most importantly, there is less distraction here,” he said.\nBut\xa0staying in Kukusan made him feel quite isolated.\n“Before the pandemic, there can be dozens of people using this one lab. We can ask each other questions, discuss ideas and consult lab technicians and lecturers about our findings. Now, there is only four of us here, two undergrads and two graduate students,” he said.\n“At night, the whole campus and the surrounding neighbourhoods are very quiet. All the restaurants and shops are closed. The students who live in Jakarta have all gone home.”\nMuhammad, the geophysics student, also shared the feeling of loneliness.\n“Before this, I could hang out with my friends, go to campus together, dine out together. The neighbourhood was\xa0pretty much alive even at midnight,” he said.\n“Now, I do everything on my own. It’s quite sad actually. I hope everything returns to normal soon.”\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      PSLE results: 98.4% of students can progress to secondary school
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For the fifth consecutive year, 98.4 per cent of Primary 6 students who sat for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) made it to secondary school.\nA total of 39,995 candidates sat for the PSLE this year, of which 39,361 students were assessed suitable to progress to secondary school, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) said in a press release on Wednesday (Nov 25).\nAbout two-thirds, or 66.3 per cent, are eligible for the Express course, while 21.2 per cent are eligible for the Normal (Academic) course and 11 per cent for the Normal (Technical) course. These proportions are similar to last year’s Primary 6 cohort, MOE and SEAB said.\nThe 634 students who did not qualify for any of the three courses may choose to retake the PSLE next year.\nWith a recommendation from their primary school principal, they can also apply to Assumption Pathway School or NorthLight School for “a more experiential and hands-on learning approach”, the agencies said.\nLast week, MOE announced that PSLE candidates will receive their results in their classrooms instead of gathered as a cohort in the school hall as in previous years, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nCandidates collecting their results in school had to observe safe distancing measures, and could be accompanied by one parent or guardian. Those who were unwell, or on quarantine order, stay-home notice or leave of absence, or who preferred not to collect their results in person, could view their results online.\nSCHOOL SELECTION AND POSTING\nStudents eligible for secondary school may submit their option forms online via the S1 Internet System (S1-IS) from now until 3pm next Tuesday.\n“When choosing a secondary school, parents and students should consider factors such as the secondary schools’ distinctive programmes, co-curricular activities (CCAs), ethos and culture,” MOE and SEAB said.\n“Parents and students are encouraged to take the time to explore the schools’ websites, social media pages, as well as take part in their virtual open houses, to find out more about the schools that interest them before selecting the schools.”\nThe posting results will be released on Dec 22 and can be accessed through SMS and S1-IS, or at the student’s primary school.\nThis year, students do not need to report to their posted secondary schools. Instead, they should refer to the schools’ websites from Dec 22 for more information, such as instructions on the purchase of books and uniforms, booklists and reporting details. Parents will also receive instructions on Parents Gateway.\n“If students are unable to report to their posted secondary school on the first day of school in January 2021 due to valid reasons, they may contact their posted secondary school directly to confirm that they are taking up the place, and the school will be able to reserve the place for them,” MOE and SEAB said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     schools ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: PSLE scores and the problem with the beloved late bloomer narrative
  </h1>, 'text': '\nSINGAPORE: Charlie scores 198 for his primary school leaving examination (PSLE). He barely makes it into the Express stream. Two decades later, he is the creative director of a popular media agency.\xa0\nThe day before the PSLE results are released, he writes in a Facebook post that grades don’t define him, because look where he is now. He is successful, and hence, he says, there is hope for anyone.\xa0\nHis post gets 25,000 reactions, 450 comments and 7,000 shares. Netizens riff off his anecdote by sharing their PSLE results alongside their level of success now.\xa0\nMany of us know a Charlie – the quintessential late bloomer whose story is a permanent and predictable fixture in the social media news cycle around the time that the results of a national examination are released.\xa0\nAnd when the PSLE results are released on Wednesday (Nov 25), we will read another story about another Charlie.\nForgive my cynicism, there is nothing inherently wrong with the late bloomer narrative. In a depressing year like this, in fact, it could just add much-needed hope to our social media feed.\xa0\nBut while this innocuous narrative might intend to help some feel like they’re allowed to bloom in their own time and go against the norm, the problem arises when it ironically reinforces traditional definitions of success, from climbing the professional ladder to obtaining high social standing.\xa0\nIt inadvertently implies being a late bloomer is worth shouting about – if you eventually bounce back on track by achieving conventional success.\xa0\nTake the Life Beyond Grades initiative that launched two years ago to much social media fanfare. It encapsulated the familiar late bloomer narrative by featuring working professionals, who had graduated from primary school decades ago. Many were doing relatively well in life despite having average to poor PSLE results.\xa0\nThe campaign aimed to remind youth and parents alike that PSLE results aren’t the be-all and end-all. After all, these people had made something of their lives.\xa0\nNotwithstanding factors like family background, environment and inborn character traits, which play a part in helping someone bloom at all, albeit later in life, what underscored the campaign was the familiar, attractive idea of rising above the odds.\xa0\nWhile several of the participants delved into the nuances of what success meant to them, and the campaign wasn’t insinuating that grades weren’t important at all, having won against the odds meant they were now considered successful – at least enough to dispense wisdom about not paying heed to the path dictated by their grades.\xa0\nBecause of their feel-good nature and championing of the underdog, these social media posts tend to go viral, making it seem that doing well in life despite your PSLE results is a common occurrence.\xa0\nIn reality, that is likely the exception to the rule. Most of our journeys are far more nuanced.\xa0\nFor many of us, our PSLE scores – whether good, poor or average – were a blip in an adventure that might not conform to a conventional script of what economic success looks like, but nonetheless brought joy, perspective and that priceless sense of ownership of our own version of happiness.\xa0\nMost of us exist on a whole other spectrum from the late bloomers and underdogs we extol, and are probably far more common.\xa0\nBut our comparatively ordinary lives don’t make headlines because we still don’t quite know how to divorce individual achievement from societal worth.\xa0\nWHAT’S WRONG WITH BEING AVERAGE?\xa0\nUnderpinning the narrative about late bloomers that praises them for aligning with society’s traditional ideas of success, after not having made the mark earlier in life, is our inability to accept being average, which we now equate with mediocrity.\xa0\nThe new PSLE grading system might be implemented next year, but it won’t be the silver bullet to alleviate the stress our children face, if we don’t also change the narratives around what we consider success.\xa0\nThe stories we tell ourselves matter.\xa0\nFor once, I would like to see attention given to\xa0folks, who scored, for instance,\xa0270, for PSLE, sharing\xa0that they are now working at an unimpressive job, but that their professional and social status doesn’t bother them because they don’t pin their happiness to achievement.\xa0\nHearing someone explicitly talk about falling short of their supposed potential, but still be able to find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in life, would take the pressure off many kids, parents and even adults, regardless of those three digits once upon a time.\xa0\nWhat if being a late bloomer didn’t mean finally meeting society’s narrow definition of success, but coming into our own and carving out our own expansive definition of success, regardless of whether anyone agrees? What if it simply meant finding our own stride and living up to the person we want to be, not who others expect us to be?\xa0\nYet, being able to shape a healthier, more holistic perspective of success in the long term begins with not looking at mediocrity as a moral failing.\nHOW WE JUDGE SUCCESS\nPersonally, it is a lesson that would have saved me a lot of grief over the last two decades since I received my PSLE results.\xa0\nI was never “meant” to score 253 for PSLE, nor have my name flashed on screen in my primary school’s assembly hall as one of the students who qualified for the gifted examination that would determine entrance into the gifted stream.\xa0\nMy teachers predicted I would score no more than 220. To date, I can still recall their look of shock when they revealed the list of top performers in my school.\xa0\nMy grades weren’t the most stellar, but I was supposedly on the path to success because I had far exceeded my teachers’ and parents’ expectations.\xa0\nI did not realise it then, but getting a taste of conventional success at such a formative age was pivotal in shaping my high-achieving behaviour for the next two decades. Even when I opted out of the junior college route my parents and teachers had hoped for me to head into, in order to avoid the stress of cramming for a national exam within two years, there was immense pressure to excel in a polytechnic.\xa0\nNot only did a teacher half-joke that I was “wasting” my potential, I could never fully escape my personal demons of needing to perform, so I could prove my PSLE score wasn’t a fluke, never mind that it had been five years since my PSLE by then.\nAll I wanted was to continue reaching for that same excellence and the sense of self-worth and pride that was intrinsically tied to success and achievement, even when it wore me down.\xa0\nWithout my surprise score, I wouldn’t have gotten the academic opportunities I did. But the flip side was that I was unable to truly embrace life in the middle without feeling like I would disappoint a parent or teacher who had high hopes for me.\xa0\nA few months ago, a university student asked me how I would define career success in my industry. I don’t think I gave her the answer she was looking for, but I like to think it is the answer I needed to hear as a student.\xa0\nI replied:\nI judge my success by whether I like myself. That is my only criteria.\nGrace Yeoh is a senior journalist at CNA Insider.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      IN FOCUS: Has COVID-19 killed the appeal of studying overseas? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For many Singaporean students, pursuing an overseas university education sounds like a dream come true. A few years spent in a foreign country, making friends from all over the world, studying the subject of your choice in a prestigious institute.\xa0\nEach year, thousands of Singaporeans pursue this dream. Between 2017 and 2018, 7,020 students from Singapore studied in the UK, according to data collected across universities there.\xa0\nHowever, COVID-19 has undermined that dream.\nTravel restrictions could mean getting to your preferred university may be challenging, if not impossible. Coming back to Singapore for vacations will probably involve a 15-day period of isolation. Classes may be conducted remotely. There are likely to be limits on social activities.\xa0\xa0\nWith studying overseas much more expensive than attending a university in Singapore, some might consider whether the current circumstances make pursuing the dream worthwhile.\nBut not everyone is thinking like that.\nNancy Xu, 18, is determined that the\xa0pandemic will not stop her from pursuing her studies overseas. She hopes to study geography or urban planning at a UK university, as she has her eye on certain classes\xa0that are not available\xa0in Singaporean universities.\n""I don\'t think the pandemic is something that\'s super concerning for me or my parents, they\'re more focused on the prestige of the school. If I were to get into a good UK university, I wouldn\'t think that the pandemic would deter them from sending me there, because they\'re not especially worried about it,"" Ms Xu told CNA.\xa0\nAdding that her parents are also not that concerned about the cost\xa0or that most classes may be held online on Zoom, she said that as some Singapore universities are also conducting virtual classes, ""even with the higher fee, it wouldn\'t really deter them from wanting me to go to a more prestigious university"".\nWith international travel at a standstill, students like Ms Xu have to apply and interview for their places in overseas universities from Singapore.\xa0\nMs Xu, who is sitting for her A-Level examinations this year, applied to several universities in the UK, noting that the application process this year is a ""simpler version"".\xa0\n""For example, I applied for Cambridge, and instead of having people (their admission tutors) fly over for interviews like last time, this year they can\'t do that, so everything is conducted remotely,"" she told CNA.\xa0\n""The interviews have all been cut short, and I know a lot of my friends were not able to secure interviews because they could not get their professors to be available to interview them,"" she said.\xa0\nWhile she is relieved that someone was available for her interview, the processes have\xa0been ""not as thorough"", but she is not sure how this will affect her chances.\nApplying and getting accepted is just the beginning. Returning students and those\xa0that have already been accepted need to apply for student visas, sort out a place to live\xa0and find flights that can bring them overseas amid border restrictions.\xa0\nAfter arriving in the country, they may face lockdowns in their student accommodation, or find themselves unable to return home. All this on top of possibly being infected with COVID-19.\xa0\nFor example, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Nov 13 that it would not allow foreign students to return, as priority is being given to the return of locals stuck overseas. Its borders have been closed to all non-citizens and permanent residents since March.\xa0\nWith foreign students worth about A$35 billion (US$25.3 billion) a year to the Australian economy, Canberra had hoped to slowly allow overseas students to return in 2021. Trials began earlier this year.\nBut with thousands of Australians still wanting to return, Mr Morrison said there are not enough quarantine facilities.\nThe UK has the biggest official death toll in Europe from COVID-19 and is grappling with more than thousands of new coronavirus cases a day at the moment. On Oct 31, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England back into a lockdown.\xa0\nUniversities remain open, but people will only be allowed to leave home for specific reasons such as education, work, exercise, shopping for essentials and medicines or caring for the vulnerable.\nThe number of new international students enrolled at US universities online or in person fell by 43 per cent this autumn, according to a survey of more than 700 students released on Nov 16.\xa0\nIncluding both new and returning students, total international enrolment fell by 16 per cent, and the survey found that among those who did enrol, about one in five were studying online from abroad.\xa0\nResponding to a parliamentary question in October, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the autonomous universities (AUs) in Singapore provided more degree places this year, ""in anticipation of higher demand"" from students whose overseas study plans were disrupted by COVID-19.\xa0\n""The AUs extended their application windows by two months, and made around 2,000 more offers to local applicants across a range of courses,"" said the education ministry.\xa0\nMOE is prepared to continue adjusting the number of degree places in the autonomous universities if necessary, taking into account the number of Singaporeans who meet admissions standards and the medium- to long-term national manpower demand for graduates across different sectors, it said at the time.\xa0\nMOST CONTINUE TO FLY OVERSEAS\nBut like Ms Xu, some Singaporean students still appear to have an appetite for overseas university education, despite the hurdles posed by COVID-19.\xa0\nEducation consultancy theRightU saw 80 to 85 per cent of their student clients who had places in UK universities fly there to go ahead with their studies in person.\n""And this batch of students who left for the September intake would have had six months of consideration through this COVID period from March to September. So they would have seen the impact and made a very informed decision, to go or not to go,"" said Dr Chan Khai Leok, director of theRightU.\xa0\n""I think the numbers didn\'t come naturally. The numbers came through quite a lot of work, both from the universities and from our end to help the students understand the situation over there, to help them understand the measures that have been put in place by the universities.""\xa0\nThe team sends ""hundreds"" of students overseas every year, to the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, said Dr Chan.\xa0\nThis year, about 5 to 10 per cent of students decided not to go overseas to study at all because they found it unsafe and had alternatives in Singapore, he added. Another 5 to 10 per cent decided to defer their studies to the next intake.\xa0\nDespite the pandemic, the total number of student clients with theRightU who went overseas for their studies this year is more compared to last year, said Dr Chan.\xa0\n""The number of students who actually braved the climate and decided to fly over was actually a surprisingly large number. We were actually a little surprised as well with the outcome,"" he added.\xa0\nUK-bound students ""haven\'t had major issues"" going overseas to continue their studies, said Dr Chan.\xa0\n""It is still as per normal, meaning that they\'re still able to find flights to the UK, maybe a bit more expensive and a bit less frequent but definitely they are still able to get flights,"" he added.\xa0\nSCHOOLS CONTINUE TO SEE \'COMPARABLE NUMBERS\'\nIn response to CNA queries, a spokesperson for the London School of Economics (LSE) said 2020 has seen ""comparable numbers"" of undergraduates, and a ""marginally lower than average number"" of postgraduate registrations from Singapore.\xa0\nThe university accepts about 86 new undergraduates and 80 new post-graduate students each year from Singapore, the spokesperson added.\xa0\nOverall international student numbers at LSE are higher this year than they were last year, and ""anticipated withdrawals have not occurred"", said the spokesperson.\xa0\nIt is ""impossible to attribute this variation to a single factor"", although the university is currently offering a ""flexible approach"" to teaching, and students can take classes online without travelling internationally to be on campus.\xa0\nTrinity University in Dublin registered more than 200 students from Singapore\xa0in each academic year between 2016 and 2019. In the 2019/20 academic year, before the pandemic emerged,158 Singaporean students registered there. The situation has changed in the current academic year, with COVID-19 being cited as a possible factor.\n""Unfortunately because of the unusual circumstances and delays of this year we do not have a definitive picture for this full year but there has been a sizeable decline at this point in time,"" said a university spokesperson, noting that this figure does not include the joint physiotherapy degree with the Singapore Institute of Technology.\xa0\nThis ""may be"" due to students choosing not to go overseas for university due to health and travel safety concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\xa0\n""We have seen an impact in particular on overseas students who are on one-year programmes and thus took the logical decision not to travel. We assume this is the case with Singapore,"" she added.\xa0\nThe deadline for enrolment this year has been extended, noted the spokesperson, and the university has seen overall declines in the number of international students, but ""generally"" not from students on three- and four-year programmes.\xa0\nAustralian universities saw similar trends. Curtin University in Perth saw 404 Singaporean students in its 2020 intake, comparable with its intake of 413 students in 2019. It accepted\xa0362 Singaporean students in 2018.\xa0\nThe university ""cannot speculate"" on the reasons for the slight decrease in numbers between 2019 and 2020, said a spokesperson. ""However we do know that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the international study plans for some students.""\xa0\nAbout 90 per cent of international students were already in the country preparing for the start of the first semester in March\xa0when Australia\'s borders closed due to COVID-19, said the Curtin University spokesperson.\xa0\nA ""small number"" of students, mainly from Singapore, returned to their home countries during the first semester and continued their classes online.\xa0\n""The international travel ban that has been in place since March has prevented many of our international students from physically returning to campus. Fortunately, most have continued their studies at Curtin online,"" the spokesperson added, noting that some face-to-face teaching has resumed for most classes due to the low rates of COVID-19 infection in Western Australia.\nWhen the pandemic was in full swing in the first half of this year, some international students at the University of Queensland chose to defer their studies, said deputy vice-chancellor of external engagement\xa0Li Rongyu.\xa0\nBut for the second semester, which ended on Oct 31, the university saw ""higher than anticipated demand"" for its programmes from international students, including students from Singapore.\xa0\nThe university sees about 1000 Singaporean students each year.\xa0\nInternational enrolments at the University of Sydney is just 3.6 per cent lower than anticipated, and 40 per cent of the university\'s international students are studying remotely from countries including Singapore.\xa0\nThe university has 850 students from Singapore this year, compared to almost 1,000 in 2018 and 2019, said a spokesperson for the university.\xa0\n""We\'ve been pleasantly surprised by our enrolments figures this year, which have been much stronger than we expected at the start of the pandemic.""\xa0\nDespite the closed borders, the Australian universities were confident that the country would remain attractive to international students, especially with the low rates of COVID-19 there.\xa0\n""We also know the value of the on-campus experience, and are continuing to work with governments on plans for the safe return and arrival of our international students, and can’t wait to welcome all our students back to campus as soon as it is safe to do so,"" said the University of Sydney spokesperson.\xa0\n\'A SINGAPORE PHENOMENON\'\nThe consistent number of students going overseas for their studies could be ""a Singapore phenomenon"", said Dr Chan. Other countries are seeing a ""significant"" drop in the number of students heading overseas.\xa0\n""Singapore might have a little drop, but it\'s not as significant as other countries...because there are other factors at play that maybe Singaporeans are not so affected by,"" he added.\xa0\nFor example, some parents\xa0may decide not to send their children overseas amid an economic downturn because of the expensive fees, but this may be less of an issue for more affluent families in Singapore.\nSingaporean students also have ""no issue"" getting student visas, but students of other nationalities may face problems, Dr Chan noted. These students risk having to drop out halfway, wasting time and money.\xa0\nEven though students can pursue their studies in person on campus, not all of them choose to do so. Master\'s student Orion Dai chose to remain in Singapore because all his classes are conducted online.\xa0\nThe 27-year-old started his course at Imperial College London in September, and made the call to stay in Singapore in July after finding out all his classes would be conducted remotely. His visa was also unlikely to be approved in time, he told CNA.\xa0\n""There wasn\'t really a strong motivating factor to go, as the cost of living there is really high. And since the lessons are already remote, going there is kind of not productive. You need to pay just to stay there,"" Mr Dai said.\xa0\n""I can do the same from Singapore, and I can do other stuff during the day as well...even my course mates are not physically present in London, so there\'s really not much reason for me to go this semester.""\xa0\nMr Dai attends lessons online from Singapore between 6pm and 1am. He spends the daytime on coursework, grouped with students in similar timezones.\xa0\n""The bad part is that we do not get to interact with people from the other side of the world because of the time difference. While it makes strategic sense, I think in terms of the scope and the general takeaway from having an international degree, it doesn\'t really benefit us more.""\xa0\nTaking his classes at night also allows him to work on a startup with some friends during the day. ""Even though the experience of studying overseas is diminished, I feel like it\'s being sort of made up for by the fact that I can pursue something locally and I can balance both sides. That wasn\'t really an opportunity before,"" he added.\xa0\nHowever, the online experience ""definitely does not hold up"" to what students would originally want from an overseas university experience, said Mr Dai, citing the lack of in-person interaction and missing out on experiences outside of the curriculum.\xa0\n""The school I\'m going to is quite prestigious in the European scene, so normally they will have a lot of seminars, a lot of guest speakers coming down to talk to them. That\'s no longer possible,"" he added.\xa0\n""They have it on Zoom, but it\'s really hard to single out the speaker and talk to him after to get some contacts.""\nMr Dai\'s two-year course costs about S$45,000 a year, and he is on a scholarship. He applied in March with ""high hopes"" that the pandemic would improve.\xa0\nTHE VALUE OF OVERSEAS EDUCATION\nAddressing why many Singaporean students are keen to attend university overseas, education expert Jason Tan said that like Mr Dai, many students think a degree from a prestigious overseas university is valuable.\xa0\n""They think that will open up a lot more social networks and work opportunities, internships overseas, and so on,"" said the Associate Professor at the National Institute of Education (NIE) Department of Policy and Leadership Studies.\xa0\n""Of course, we have to remember that there\'s a considerable cost differential between doing your degree here and doing it overseas, especially with the expansion of local university places,"" said Assoc Prof Tan.\xa0\n""So if you are able to qualify for a local university place, then one of the crucial factors that will affect your decision one way or the other is this - what difference will it actually make if I opt to pay much more for an overseas degree?""\xa0\nFor 18-year-old Davis Lim, going overseas for university means meeting new people and new opportunities to engage with people from all over the world.\xa0\nAfter his National Service obligations, he intends to pursue the instrumentalities of arts and humanities, and overseas degrees in this area are ""more prestigious"", he added.\xa0\n""Right now I\'m still keen on going because I\'m thinking that maybe after two years, the pandemic will come down and it will be a lot easier (to go overseas),"" said Mr Lim, who is sitting for his A Level examinations this year.\xa0\n""But if it continues then most likely I\'ll stay in Singapore because it\'s a lot more dangerous to travel. And the tuition fees are very expensive, and if I\'m going to be doing it over Zoom, then it\'s not really worth it.""\xa0\nFor now, the COVID-19 pandemic is ""a temporary dampener"" on students\' plans to study overseas, especially since lessons are conducted online and student activities are cancelled, said Assoc Prof Tan.\xa0\n""So in that case, it doesn\'t make much sense to be paying so much in fees if you\'re not going to be able to enjoy the whole student experience. Especially if you\'re going to be physically based in Singapore, it really doesn\'t make much sense. And of course, the university won\'t reduce their fees,"" said Assoc Prof Tan.\xa0\n""But at the same time though, when the COVID-19 pandemic eventually passes and comes under control, I think that there\'s still quite a considerable demand for overseas education.""\xa0\nAccording to Dr Chan, parents expressed similar concerns. Most parents and students were ""quite keen"" to take classes on campus in person.\xa0\n""Partly because they would have paid so much, so it doesn\'t make sense to stay home and study online,"" he added.\xa0\nThe ""vast majority"" of parents expected schools and the borders to be fully closed like in Singapore, and were concerned about how teaching was going to be done.\xa0\n""But the biggest concerns were around not so much COVID-19 safety, but physical safety. They would have heard of ostracism of Chinese and Asian students, so that was actually the bigger concerns,"" said Dr Chan.\xa0\nCOULD A VACCINE CHANGE THE TIDE?\nWith a COVID-19 vaccine seemingly on the horizon, he predicts that Singapore will see even more students going to study overseas next year.\xa0\nThere is ""a good pool"" of students who delayed their decision to pursue overseas studies this year, and this could result in two scenarios, said Dr Chan.\xa0\n""One, a vaccine is developed, everybody gets vaccinated, and the world is safe again. This pent up demand will lead to an increase in demand,"" he added.\xa0\n""If the pandemic persists, then people who delayed their studies, I don\'t think they will wait any further. Especially for diploma holders, it\'s hard for them to find a job in Singapore in this climate, a lot of them are just sitting at home and not doing much. An alternative would be to spend the time wisely, just proceed and study anyway.""\xa0\nAs this batch of students successfully completes a year of overseas studies amid the pandemic, this would also boost the confidence of hesitant students and parents, encouraging to do the same, said Dr Chan.\xa0\nSince the UK went into a national lockdown on Oct 31, Mr Dai anticipates that classes next semester will also be held remotely. If they are, he would ""definitely"" continue to take his classes from Singapore.\xa0\nHe will only consider returning to the UK for his studies if life returns to ""some level of normalcy"", he told CNA.\xa0\n""Not just classes (have to return to normal), maybe the travel restrictions and all that stuff too, if by some miracle it can be lifted or reduced.\n""Going over there it\'s not just about going to school, but rather also travelling in the nearby regions, going around to visit some friends. If that has been eased as well, I think there\'s definitely stronger motivation to go, not just go there and only go to school.""\nNoting that he will weigh the pros and cons of staying in Singapore and heading to the UK, Mr Dai said: ""In Singapore, we are free to move around. I can meet friends, I can work on my startup.\n""If I were to go there and can only go to school, which I can already do online from here, I think the pros and cons do not really weigh out for me. I think it has to return to some level of normalcy before I can consider that.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     UK ', '     Australia ', '     US ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     In Focus ']}"

      NUS institute to fund subsidies for some master's courses after SkillsFuture aid withdrawn
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: An institute at the National University of Singapore (NUS) will fund the subsidies\xa0for three master\'s programmes for its January 2021 intake, after\xa0SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) withdrew aid for the courses.\xa0\nThe three programmes are the Master of Technology in Enterprise Business Analytics, Master of Technology in Intelligent Systems and Master of Technology in Software Engineering, all offered by the NUS Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS), said a spokesperson for the school on Thursday (Nov 19).\nMany of the modules in the three programmes were supported by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) subsidies between 2018 and 2020, thereby leading to lower fees for Singaporeans and Singapore permanent residents during that time, said NUS-ISS.\nFrom January 2021, however, those modules will no longer be eligible for government subsidy as the funding agreement with SSG has ceased, it added.\n\nJOB PLACEMENT TARGETS NOT MET\nIn a statement on Thursday,\xa0an SSG spokesperson told CNA that funding for the courses was withdrawn because NUS-ISS\xa0did not meet the job placement targets under their funding agreement.\n""As part of the funding agreement with training providers like NUS-ISS, SSG sets targets on job placement to ensure that the training leads to tangible employment outcomes,"" said an SSG spokesperson.\n""NUS-ISS has not met the job placement targets under their funding agreement with SSG. Hence, with effect from Jan 2021, SSG is withdrawing funding for the courses supported under this agreement,"" the spokesperson added.\nStudents who have already been enrolled as part of the 2020 intake or earlier will not be affected, said NUS-ISS .\xa0\n""NUS-ISS will fund the subsidy for the incoming January 2021 intake for the full duration of their course. They will pay tuition fees of S$20,000 to S$21,000 for the course, same as what was indicated during the course application window from June to September 2020.\n""We have reached out to all affected students to update them accordingly, extend our apology for the inconvenience caused, and assist with any queries,"" it said.\nCONCERNS RAISED BY STUDENTSStudents set to join the master\'s programme\xa0initially\xa0raised concerns after seeing their school fees more than double just two months before the first semester starts in January.\xa0\nThe students said that when they were doing their research into the graduate programme, the fees cited for the\xa0Master of Technology in Business Enterprise Analytics (MTech EBAC) for the previous academic year was between S$19,951 and S$21,376 for Singaporeans and permanent residents, after subsidies.\nAn\xa0archived version of the NUS website from October confirms this.\xa0\nOn\xa0Nov 13,\xa0the total fees for the same course starting January 2021 were updated to between S$44,100 and\xa0S$49,770 for Singaporeans and permanent residents, excluding goods and services tax and miscellaneous fees. This applied\xa0to full-time and part-time students.\n\nA 27-year-old software engineer who applied for the programme in August told CNA he was concerned to learn in his first\xa0offer letter from NUS on Nov 4 that the fees were under review.\nIn the original offer letter seen by CNA, NUS told students: ""Please note that the fees and subsidies for the MTech EBAC programme are currently under review. The fees for the Jan 2021 cohort will be put up on the website as soon as possible.""\xa0\nA note on NUS website on Nov 4 also said that students ""should be prepared to pay full fees in the case that no subsidies are available"".\n""I emailed them to check what the fees would be like, because they said we have to accept the offer by Nov 10. Basically as the deadline approached, we didn\'t really have a choice so we just accepted the offer first,"" said the software engineer, who declined to provide his name.\nA 30-year-old analyst said he chose the NUS institute programme because it was more affordable than other alternatives. The analyst said he felt that the manner in which the fee adjustment was communicated was ""unfair"".\n""The thing is, we have already missed out on every other alternative that we have. The reasonable approach if there\'s a fee hike of such a magnitude is that they should tell us during the application process,"" he told CNA.\nAnother student, a 27-year-old engineer, who applied for the programme said he did so as the price was ""reasonable"" and much lower than similar master\'s programmes in Singapore.\xa0\nAn email sent by the NUS institute to him on Sep 1 in response to queries about the course and subsidies stated that the total fees for Singaporeans and permanent residents taking the programme part-time would be S$19,951.22 to S$21,376.46.\xa0\nThere was no mention that the fees and subsidies were under review.\nAll three students CNA spoke to hold full-time jobs and had applied to take the course part-time. They said they withdrew from the course after receiving news of the fee adjustment, but will now continue with their studies after receiving a new offer letter.\nIn an offer letter dated Nov 16 and seen by CNA, NUS-ISS informed students from the 2020 intake that it would continue to offer the ""previously published"" fees.\xa0\n""If you have previously declined our offer, or withdrawn from the programme, we do strongly encourage you to reconsider your decision,"" the new offer letter read.\xa0\n""Initially I wasn\'t expecting (that the fees would be reduced). I was hoping that it would happen, but I didn\'t put that much hope into it,"" said the software engineer.\n""It was a pleasant surprise overall, that I would still be able to pursue the degree.\xa0But overall, I just feel like all this could have been avoided.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     NUS ', '     National University of Singapore ']}"

      Commentary: The education I wished I had when a senior at university touched me
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: My freshman experience was an unhappy one.\nInitially, plunging into a new social context was both thrilling and daunting. When uncertainties arose, I confided in a senior I had met during one of my orientation camps.\nBut in time the relationship became fraught – he demanded more of my time and energy, accused me of leading him on, and spread rumours about my character in social circles that we shared – circles in which he was well-established and well-liked.\nI struggled to appease him, desperate to maintain a sense of normalcy and social balance.\nWhen he put his hand on the small of my back one day,\xa0I froze -\xa0and said nothing. Then it happened again. And again.\nI soon discovered that not being able to say no was just one complex factor which nurtured the insidious presence of sexual harassment on campus.\nWHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE\nIn a recent survey commissioned by The Sunday Times of 440 undergraduates, a fifth of respondents said they knew a friend who had been sexually harassed in the past year. Nine students themselves reported being victims of sexual harassment.\xa0\nWhile harassment is not limited to universities, the unique circumstances of students in universities should warrant careful consideration.\nUniversity is a time of exploration and experiential learning. Students are on the cusp of adulthood, forming new and complex relationships in a highly social environment.\nFor many moving into campus residence\xa0is their first time living away from home.\nThere are several factors at work: Balancing newfound independence with living in close proximity to the opposite gender, exploring new relationships, and in many cases, a greater propensity to consume alcohol.\nTaken together, these can put students in a vulnerable position.\nFor seniors or staff who are established in existing social or institutional groups, it becomes easy to prey on uncertainties and exploit these weaknesses.\nEven for fellow students without ill intentions, the quick thrust into a new depth of intimacy can lead to boundaries being crossed.\xa0\nIn some circumstances, neither party could be aware that a boundary existed, until one side is made to feel unsafe and uncomfortable.\nOnce these situations arise, many victims are unwilling to address the issue, afraid they will be socially penalised for disrupting group harmony, or making things “awkward”.\xa0\nIf the perpetrator is in a position of authority, in cases such as with former Tembusu College professor Jeremy Fernando, the power disparity makes it harder to speak out.\nVictims swallow their discomfort and dismiss their experiences, sometimes even continuing to bear with persistent advances, which can have deep implications on their physical, mental and emotional health.\xa0\nMORE EDUCATION IS NEEDED\nSince the public outcry in April 2019 against the case of National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate Nicholas Lim who filmed then-undergraduate Monica Baey in the shower, universities have been quick to implement new guidelines and measures against campus sexual harassment.\nNUS and Singapore Management University have established dedicated care units to respond to cases of harassment and provide professional support to affected students.\xa0\nNUS and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have launched new anti-harassment online modules, which are mandatory for all students.\nAll three universities announced their planned actions to review disciplinary guidelines and frameworks.\nStill, these efforts have limitations in curbing the issue of sexual harassment.\nAs a co-founder of Girl, Talk, a student campaign against campus sexual harassment, I spoke to many women across universities in Singapore who persistently raised common gaps in education.\nThese included a need for more understanding about sexual harassment which can be nuanced and insidious, more discussions around the principles of consent, and more knowledge about how to react to harassment situations.\nIn all these topics, universities play a pivotal role in foregrounding education, which can help students safely navigate new relationships and boundaries on campus.\nUNIVERSITIES MUST EDUCATE\xa0\nIf universities are truly taking note of the 172 reported cases of sexual misconduct in institutes of higher learning\xa0between 2015-2019, and committed to changing this, they must be proactive in creating and upgrading new and existing avenues of education.\nThe compulsory anti-harassment online modules adopted in NUS and NTU are a positive step forward, but information on these modules must more seriously target student mindsets, and cannot be seen as an inherent chore – something a student haphazardly clears to in order to gain access to report slips.\nUniversities must look to continually refresh and update module content by consulting students and experts to realise gaps in education and opportunities for greater engagement.\nGoing one step further, workshops can play a role in facilitating open and honest discussions.\nRegular, accessible workshops that cover a range of topics – the psychology behind “fight”, “flight”, “freeze” or “fawn” responses, consent and setting boundaries, the existence and eradication of rape culture – can help male and female students break down the issue of campus sexual harassment.\nThese workshops can also be practical, and involve external vendors, such as the Sexual Assault First Responder Training by AWARE's Sexual Assault Care Centre, which equips participants with the necessary skills to be effective first responders to survivors.\nStudents who attend these workshops can possibly be roped into volunteer programmes, stationed in campus or available on call, to provide support when they are contacted or activated.\nUniversities can also explore innovative solutions such as utilising virtual reality (VR) simulations to help students learn how to identify and respond to harassment situations, stimulating their emotions and reactions without compromising on comfort and safety.\nThrough mental rehearsals, students can reduce affective forecasting error, decreasing the discrepancy between the way they imagine they would behave, and how they would actually behave in the situation.\nAbove all, schools must be open to collaborating with student advocacy groups such as Girl, Talk or Students for a Safer NUS, empowering, advising, and uplifting them, instead of attempting to manage or control these efforts.\nBut there are limitations even to the effectiveness of agent-centric, empowerment-based education. Even if students are able to clearly express their needs, the alarming rise of voyeurism and other non-consensual pornography show how circumstances are often completely out of their control.\nIn all cases, universities must take swift action, as well as uphold accountability and transparency within the wider university community.\nIf universities are truly looking to create safe, conducive spaces for living and learning, they need to take more holistic approaches to prioritising student safety and building a culture that is intolerant towards sexual harassment.\xa0\nThree years after the incident in my first year, I contacted that senior to speak about it. To his credit, he was open, apologetic and willing to accept accountability for his actions.\nThat day, I gained closure, but I also gained something else – a foundation for my advocacy.\n“It keeps running through my brain,” I told him, “That if maybe I had known how to establish my boundaries, that if maybe someone had told me I had the absolute right to safety and no one was entitled to take that away, that maybe - just maybe\xa0 - neither of us would need to be here today.”\nToday, I speak up about campus sexual harassment, boldly and unapologetically, joined by many other student advocates.\xa0\nWe spark important conversations, with the strong and fervent hope that these conversations will continue to educate, empower, and impact a generation.\nHeather Seet is the co-founder of youth collective Girl, Talk and an advocate against sexual violence. She graduated from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) this year.\n\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Former East Asian Institute director hugged colleague without consent, NUS inquiry finds following complaint
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The National University of Singapore (NUS) said on Tuesday (Nov 17) it had completed its review of a complaint made against former East Asian Institute (EAI) director Professor Zheng Yongnian and found that he had behaved inappropriately towards a colleague in May 2018.\xa0\nNUS said it established a committee of inquiry to begin investigations after becoming aware of the allegations in May last year.\xa0\nA member of staff alleged that Prof Zheng behaved inappropriately on a number of occasions in 2018, including putting his hands on her shoulder and head, hugging her and patting her rear, and holding her back while taking a group photo.\xa0\nNUS said that ""in the absence of evidence"", the inquiry was unable to verify all the allegations except that Prof Zheng had hugged the member of staff without her permission during a meeting.\xa0\nShe lodged a police report in May 2019, accusing Prof Zheng of outrage of modesty. Following investigations and in consultation with the Attorney-General\'s Chambers, the police issued Prof Zheng a stern warning in April this year.\xa0\nNUS said it suspended Prof Zheng on May 20, 2019\xa0and required that he work from home and stay off the NUS campus for the entire duration of the investigations. He was also issued a no-contact order prohibiting him from contacting the EAI staff member.\xa0\n""The COI concluded that Prof Zheng had admitted to hugging the EAI staff member without her consent during a work meeting on 30 May 2018, but the allegation that Prof Zheng had at the same meeting patted her buttocks could not be established conclusively,"" the statement read.\xa0\n""The COI further determined that it is inappropriate for a male senior colleague in a supervisory role to hug a female junior colleague without her consent at a professional meeting in his office"", said NUS, adding that it thus concluded Prof Zheng had breached its code of conduct for staff.\xa0\n""In accordance with the university\'s guidelines on staff discipline matters, the appropriate sanction for a breach of this nature is a written warning.\n""As Prof Zheng is no longer a staff of NUS, the university will instead place on its staff records the outcome of the internal review,"" said the institution.\xa0\nProf Zheng stepped down as director in June and was replaced by former World Bank country director Bert Hofman.

      Cancer survivor dedicates life to educating school dropouts in Jakarta's poor neighbourhood
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: It was a weekday morning in Kojem, an impoverished neighbourhood in the northern part of Jakarta, and\xa0children as young as seven were coming home from a day of fishing on the rough Java Sea instead of going to school.\nEducation appears to be an afterthought in a place\xa0where crimes, drugs and prostitution are rampant.\nMost of the children here dropped\xa0out of school before they get to fourth grade. There are\xa0kids who left school because their parents could not afford to pay their tuition fees. There are also\xa0those whose fathers or\xa0mothers are in prison for drug offences and violent crimes.\nThen there are children who dropped out because they have undiagnosed learning disabilities. Some kids have never even set foot in\xa0a formal school their entire lives.\n“Ninety per cent of all the children here are dropouts. You can count with one hand the number of people with a high school diploma,” Desi Purwatuning, who has been running Rumah Belajar Merah Putih (Red and White House of Learning) from a tiny rented space in Kojem for the last 14 years, told CNA.\nThe school has been helping school dropouts from Kojem and the surrounding areas to take elementary, junior and senior high school equivalency tests so they can find better jobs and escape the vicious cycle of poverty.\n“No one expects them to be anything\xa0more than fishermen and hard labourers. Not even their parents. That’s why their parents don’t bother to keep them at school after they learn how to read and do simple math. They would rather have their children helping them at sea or work odd jobs,” she said.\n“The children here think that they are destined to work in small fishing boats. They don’t even think that working in steel container ships they see everyday is an attainable dream. I want to open their eyes and make them realise that they can be whatever they want as long as they put their minds into it.” \xa0\nA SAFE HAVEN\nAt least 100 children go to school at Rumah Belajar Merah Putih, studying in shifts for two hours a day at a dilapidated shop no more than 4m by 5m in size.\nThe makeshift\xa0classroom is\xa0so small that\xa0there are no chairs inside. Instead, teachers and pupils sit on detachable, rubber play mats which were starting to show signs of wear and tear.\nThe pupils are taught anything from math and science to social and Islamic studies by a group of university student volunteers.\n“It is important to teach them religion. Because there is so much crime, drug abuse and prostitution around them they need to know right from wrong,” she said.\nIt can get quite crowded at Rumah Belajar Merah Putih, particularly as some children feel more at home being here than out wandering the rough neighbourhood, which is located at the mouth of a river reeking with the smell of rotten fish, industrial wastes and oil spilling from rows of colourful wooden fishing boats docking on either sides.\nSome children even spend\xa0more time at the school than at their own homes.\n“One of our students was raped last year. We also had one former student who was sexually abused by someone close to her. We also had children who were forced into prostitution. For many of the children here, this is their safe haven,” she said.\nHOW IT BEGAN\nPurwatuning, a 42-year-old widow who likes to wear strict Islamic dresses, never imagined life as a champion for free education for the poor.\nShe used to be one of the few female sailors working in a man’s world, becoming a crew member onboard ships and ferries which sail across Indonesia and neighbouring countries.\n“In 2005, I was diagnosed with cancer. The doctors gave me months to live and I felt like I haven’t done anything for my community,” she said, adding that after many operations and chemotherapy sessions, her cancer has yet to be completely removed.\nPurwatuning then set up a library and a play house at an unused portion of her house, less than 1km away from Kojem. She would also host film screenings for children in the area at the makeshift public library.\n“I noticed that some kids were holding up the books upside down,” she recalled. “I asked them where they were from and how come they didn’t know how to read.”\nAlmost overnight, she moved her entire operations to Kojem and dedicated her time to teaching children there how to read, write and do simple math.\n“I did everything myself. Next thing you know, I had 100 pupils. It became overwhelming and so I began to look for volunteers,” she said.\nToday, her staff comprises\xa0five university students and a former Rumah Belajar Merah Putih student who helps out in his spare time. \xa0\xa0\xa0\nPurwatuning also actively seeks out donations to finance her pupils’ equivalency test fees, which can range between 600,000 rupiah and 900,000 rupiah (US$41 and US$62) per student. \xa0\xa0\nPROVIDER OF HOPE\nThe morning classes are dedicated to small children who cannot afford to go to kindergartens, a luxury for many low income families in Indonesia as there are no government-run preschools where students can enrol for free.\n“Elementary schools tend to favour children who go to kindergartens because they already know how to read and write. Those who don’t could not compete with these privileged children,” Purwatuning said.\nMeanwhile, the dropouts usually study after 10am\xa0upon their return from a morning out at sea. \xa0\xa0\xa0\nYogi Pratama Putra said studying at Rumah Belajar Merah Putih afforded him the flexibility that he needed.\n“In the morning, I can help my father fish. In the afternoon, I can help my mother cleaning mussels,” he told CNA.\nThe 14-year-old said that he quit school at fourth grade to help his parents. “I used to hate school. I’d rather work and earn money. But I don’t feel that way about Rumah Belajar Merah Putih,” he said, adding that unlike formal schools, he could learn at his own pace and still have time to help his family.\nPutra obtained his elementary school diploma recently and is now studying for a junior high school equivalency test. \xa0\xa0\nAnother student, Tegar Mahendra, said he quit school at second grade soon after his mother died. Mahendra’s mother worked as a food vendor to supplement the family’s income and after her death, his\xa0public minivan driver father struggled to pay for his tuition.\nThe 17-year-old said he has been working odd jobs since he was 10. He joined Rumah Belajar Merah Putih five years ago and is now studying for his junior high school equivalency test.\n“I am grateful for the education that I have. Without it, I might end up doing drugs or other bad things, because that is what I see around me in this neighbourhood,” he told CNA.\n“I want to be an entrepreneur one day. That way I can create jobs for other people.”\nRead this story in Bahasa Indonesia here.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     Jakarta ', '     education ']}"

      Perempuan penyintas kanker ini berdedikasi mendidik anak-anak putus sekolah di kampung nelayan Jakarta
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Hari masih pagi di kampung nelayan Kojem yang terletak di\xa0Cilincing, Jakarta Utara.\nAlih-alih bersekolah, kebanyakan anak-anak di sana terpaksa membantu orang tua mereka mencari ikan di Laut Jawa yang terkenal ganas.\nPendidikan tampaknya dinomorduakan di Kojem, sebuah kampung di mana kejahatan, penyalahgunaan narkoba dan prostitusi merajalela.\nKebanyakan anak-anak di sini hanya bersekolah sampai kelas 4 sekolah dasar. Rata-rata dari mereka terpaksa tak melanjutkan pendidikannya karena orang tua mereka tak mampu menanggung beban biaya sekolah.\nAda juga yang putus sekolah karena ayah atau ibunya terpaksa dipenjara karena melanggar hukum. Sementara itu, ada pula anak-anak yang tak melanjutkan pendidikannya akibat disabilitas intelektual yang tak terdiagnosis.\nBahkan, ada juga anak-anak Kampung Kojem yang tak pernah mengenyam pendidikan formal seumur hidupnya.\n“Sembilan puluh persen anak-anak di sini putus sekolah. Yang lulus SMA (sekolah menengah atas) bisa dihitung dengan jari,” kata Desi Purwatuning kepada CNA.\nSelama 14 tahun ini, Desi telah mengelola Rumah Belajar Merah Putih di sebuah tempat kecil di Kojem.\nSekolah informal ini telah membantu ratusan anak-anak putus sekolah di Kojem dan daerah sekitarnya mengambil ujian kesetaraan setingkat SD sampai SMA agar mereka dapat mencari pekerjaan yang lebih baik dan keluar dari lingkaran kemiskinan.\n“Enggak ada yang mengharapkan mereka bisa jadi lebih dari sekedar nelayan atau pekerja kasar. Bahkan orang tua mereka sendiri. Makanya orang tua mereka enggak peduli mereka tetap bersekolah apa tidak setelah mereka bisa baca, tulis, dan berhitung. Mereka lebih pengin anak-anak mereka membantu mereka melaut atau bekerja,” kata Desi.\n“Anak-anak di sini juga menanggap mereka cuma bisa bekerja di perahu kecil. Bahkan mereka menganggap bekerja di kapal kontainer besi yang mereka lihat setiap hari itu mimpi yang tak mungkin mereka raih. Saya pengin membuka mata mereka dan membuat mereka sadar, mereka bisa jadi apa saja yang mereka mau selama mereka tekun.”\nRUANG AMAN DI TENGAH DAERAH RAWAN KEJAHATAN\nSaat ini, setidaknya 100 anak bersekolah di Rumah Belajar Merah Putih. Mereka belajar secara bergantian selama dua jam sehari di dalam sebuah bekas warung berukuran tak lebih dari 4m\xa0kali 5m.\nRuang kelas sederhana itu begitu kecilnya sehingga\xa0tak ada bangku di dalamnya. Baik tenaga pengajar dan murid semua duduk di atas alas karet yang sudah tampak kusam dan usang.\nDi Rumah Belajar Merah Putih, murid-murid diajarkan matematika, ilmu pengetahuan alam sampai pelajaran agama Islam oleh sekelompok relawan mahasiswa.\n“Pelajaran agama itu penting bagi anak-anak ini. Karena di lingkungan mereka banyak sekali terjadi kejahatan, narkoba dan prostitusi, mereka harus belajar membedakan mana yang benar dan mana yang salah,” katanya.\nRumah Belajar Merah Putih cepat terasa sesak, apalagi karena beberapa anak merasa lebih nyaman berada di sana ketimbang bermain di kampung Kojem yang terletak di hilir sungai yang dipenuhi aroma ikan, limbah industri dan tumpahan minyak dari deretan perahu yang bersandar di kedua sisinya.\nBeberapa anak bahkan merasa lebih nyaman di Rumah Belajar Merah Putih ketimbang di rumah mereka sendiri.\n“Tahun lalu, salah satu murid kita diperkosa. Pernah juga mantan murid kita dilecehkan secara seksual oleh orang terdekatnya. Kita juga ada mantan murid yang dilacurkan. Bagi banyak anak di sini, tempat ini menjadi sebuah tempat aman bagi mereka,” katanya.\nASAL MUASAL RUMAH BELAJAR MERAH PUTIH\nJanda berusia 42 tahun yang suka memakai busana Muslim ini tidak pernah membayangkan hidupnya akan menjadi seorang pejuang pendidikan bagi orang-orang yang tidak mampu.\nSebelum ia menjadi seorang pendidik, Desi adalah satu dari segelintir perempuan di Indonesia yang berprofesi sebagai pelaut. Pekerjaan ini membawanya ke\xa0pelbagai penjuru\xa0Indonesia dan negara-negara tetangga di atas kapal atau feri yang ditumpanginya.\n“Tahun 2005, saya didiagnosa mengidap kanker. Dokter bilang kepada saya, hidup saya mungkin hanya tinggal beberapa bulan lagi. Saya merasa saya belum memberikan kontribusi saya kepada masyarakat sekitar,” ujar Desi.\nSetelah mengalami beberapa operasi dan kemoterapi, kankernya belum sepenuhnya terangkat.\nAwalnya, Desi mendirikan sebuah perpustakaan dan taman bermain di rumahnya yang berjarak kurang dari 1km\xa0dari Kojem. Tempat itu juga sering mengadakan pemutaran film bagi anak-anak di lingkungan sekitarnya.\n“Saya memperhatikan beberapa anak memegang buku dengan terbalik,” kenangnya. “Saya tanya ke mereka, mereka dari mana dan kenapa mereka enggak bisa membaca.”\nTak lama kemudian, Desi memindahkan taman belajarnya ke Kampung Kojem dan meluangkan waktunya untuk mengajar anak-anak di sana cara membaca, menulis dan berhitung.\n“Saya yang melakukan semuanya. Tahu-tahu muridnya 100. Saya jadi kewalahan sampai akhirnya saya harus mencari relawan,” katanya.\nKini, stafnya terdiri dari lima mahasiswa dan seorang mantan murid yang membantu di waktu senggangnya.\nDesi juga aktif mencari donatur yang mau membiayai biaya ujian kesetaraan murid-muridnya, yang bisa menghabiskan antara Rp600.000\xa0sampai Rp900.000\xa0per anak.\nPEMBAWA\xa0HARAPAN\nSesi pertama di Rumah Belajar Merah Putih dikhususkan bagi anak-anak usia dini yang tidak mampu bersekolah di taman kanak-kanak (TK).\n“SD lebih memilih anak-anak yang lulus dari TK, karena mereka sudah bisa baca dan tulis. Artinya, anak-anak yang tidak pernah TK tidak bisa bersaing dengan teman-teman mereka yang lebih mampu,” ujar Desi.\nSementara itu, anak-anak yang putus sekolah biasanya belajar setelah jam 10 pagi, selepas mereka membantu orang tua mereka di laut.\nSalah seorang murid Rumah Belajar Merah Putih, Yogi Pratama Putra, mengatakan bahwa sekolah informal itu telah memberikannya fleksibilitas yang dia butuhkan.\n“Kalau pagi, saya bisa membantu bapak saya melaut. Sorenya, saya bisa bantu ibu bersihin kerang,” katanya kepada CNA.\nRemaja berusia 14 tahun ini mengatakan bahwa dia hanya bersekolah formal sampai kelas 4 SD demi membantu orang tuanya bekerja.\n“Saya dulu enggak suka sekolah. Mendingan kerja cari duit. Tapi saya enggak seperti itu sama Rumah Belajar Merah Putih,” kata Yogi.\nDi sekolah informal ini, Yogi dapat belajar sesuai dengan kemampuan dan waktunya sendiri sambil membantu ekonomi keluarganya.\nBelum lama ini, Yogi mendapatkan ijazah SD-nya dan kini dia sedang belajar untuk mengikuti ujian kesetaraan tingkat sekolah menengah pertama.\nSeorang murid lainnya, Tegar Mahendra, berkata\xa0dia hanya sempat mengenyam pendidikan formal sampai kelas 2 SD.\nIa putus sekolah\xa0tak lama sesudah ibunya, yang dulunya seorang\xa0penjual makanan, meninggal dunia karena sakit. Ayahnya yang bekerja sebagai sopir angkot tak sanggup lagi menyekolahkan Tegar.\nBelia\xa0berumur 17 tahun ini pun harus bekerja serabutan sejak dia berusia 10 tahun.\nTegar bergabung dengan Rumah Belajar Merah Putih lima tahun yang lalu dan kini\xa0sedang bersiap-siap untuk mengikuti ujian kesetaraan tingkat SMP.\n“Saya bersyukur punya kesempatan bersekolah.

      COVID-19: Is it worth investing in an overseas education if school is online? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Ms Phoebe Chee has been training as an opera singer since the age of 15.\nLast year, the soprano started a degree course at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. Midway through, however, her studies were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. She is now back in Singapore and getting ready for the new academic year – online.\n“Our school allows us to attend classes, because it\'s a hybrid model anyway. But for me I\'m just a little bit afraid. I feel like, it\'s a little bit safer in Singapore,” said Ms Chee, who is now 22 years old.\nMs Chee is not alone in feeling this way. According to a survey by global education network QS, many international students are choosing to defer their studies to next year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThey are doing this not just because of safety concerns, but also because of border restrictions put in place by countries around the world.\n\n\nGlobally, there are more than 5.3 million students pursuing higher education abroad. They typically choose schools in the United States, United Kingdom, China, Canada and Australia.\nThe US alone is host to more than a million international students, mostly from China, India and South Korea. According to figures from the US Department of Commerce, international students contributed US$44.7 billion to the US economy in 2018.\nWith COVID-19 wreaking havoc on global economic activity, experts said immigration policies, the perception of safety amid the pandemic and flexibility will be key for universities to survive the downturn.\n\n\nSo far, online tours and webinars have become essential in how universities interact with potential candidates.\n“It\'s efficient and effective. I think there\'s also going to be more in digital communication, digital content and virtual university tours so the students don\'t have to fly in beforehand to view a campus but can actually view it remotely,” said Mr Nunzio Quacquarelli, CEO of QS.\nTsinghua University in China was among the first to switch to online teaching in February. By the end of March, almost 2,700 faculty members had delivered 4,000 online courses to 25,000 students in different time zones.\nResearchers at Tsinghua University are now looking into how the faculty and student experience will define higher education in the future.\n""Virtual universities ... universities in the cloud, all sorts of ideas are coming out,"" said Professor Hamish Coates is from Tsinghua University’s Institute of Education.\nBut education experts warn that while online learning can be effective in disseminating information, an overseas education is more than just about studies.\n“Online learning is very functional. It can help students access materials, but some students behave very differently online than they do in the classroom. And it doesn\'t necessarily lead to those really important forms of transformation and development that we expect, particularly at the very top end of our professional fields, and that\'s where higher education is most special,” said Prof Coates.\nRedesigning university education could combine online learning, industry immersion and research focus in the course of a four-year degree, said experts. Such a hybrid set-up could spur experimentation in how fees are paid and how courses are designed.\n“There are models where students don\'t pay upfront for their education, but pay through their future earnings, said\xa0QS\' Mr Quacquarelli.\n""There are other models emerging where employers pay when they hire the student. And there is also the unbundling of a degree. So, it may be that you pay for part of your degree at one institution, and the balance at another institution,” he added.\n\n\nCertificate courses may also see a boom - leading to a rethink on whether college degrees should remain a pre-requisite for hiring.\nSo as online learning becomes the norm, is it still worth paying for overseas education?\n“The reality is that delivering a really high quality and engaging online education isn\'t necessarily much cheaper than the cost of delivering a campus-based programme,"" said\xa0Mr Quacquarelli.\n""I do think there will be the ability to offer some lower-cost incentives for study online - it may only be a 10 or 20 per cent. So, I think, student expectations need to be set that combining online and campus learning may be slightly cheaper, but not dramatically cheaper,” he added.\nProf Coates from Tsinghua University added: “We\'ve never been properly able to price in, in a commercial sense, a higher education. And while there are many people in the world who pay a price for their education, that, of course, is just a small part of the value that they derive.\n""The issue isn\'t so much the price of higher education because by any measure, even when it\'s completely overpriced, it returns enormous value to the person who partakes in it.”\nFor soprano Ms Chee, her tuition and other fees add up to about US$47,000.

      Foreign students show less zeal for US since Trump took over
  </h1>, 'text': 'CHICAGO:\xa0On a recruiting trip to India’s tech hub of Bangalore, Alan Cramb, the president of a reputable Chicago university, answered questions not just about dorms or tuition but also American work visas.\nThe session with parents fell in the chaotic first months of Donald Trump’s presidency. After an inaugural address proclaiming “America first"",\xa0two travel bans, a suspended refugee program and hints at restricting skilled worker visas widely used by Indians, parents doubted their children’s futures in the US.\n“Nothing is happening here that isn’t being watched or interpreted around the world,” said Cramb, who leads the Illinois Institute of Technology, where international scholars have been half the student body.\nAmerica was considered the premier destination for international students, with the promise of top-notch universities and unrivalled job opportunities.\xa0Yet, 2016 marked the start of a steep decline of new enrollees, something expected to continue with fresh rules limiting student visas, competition from other countries and a haphazard coronavirus response. The effect on the workforce will be considerable, experts predict, no matter the outcome of November\'s election.\nTrump has arguably changed the immigration system more than any US\xa0president, thrilling supporters with a nationalist message and infuriating critics who call the approach to his signature issue insular, xenophobic and even racist. Before the election, The Associated Press is examining some of his immigration policies, including restrictions on international students.\nFor colleges that fear dwindling tuition and companies that worry about losing talent, the broader impact is harder to quantify: America seemingly losing its lustre on a global stage.\n“It’s not as attractive as it once was,” said Dodeye Ewa, who’s finishing high school in Calabar, Nigeria.\nUnlike two older siblings who left for US\xa0schools, the aspiring paediatrician is focused on Canada. In America, she fears bullying for being an international student and a black woman.\nTrump senior adviser Stephen Miller predicted that after a COVID-19 vaccine, an improving economy would draw talent.\n“Our superior economic position is going to mean that the world’s most talented doctors, scientists, technicians, engineers, etc., will all be thinking of the United States as their first country of destination,"" Miller told the AP.\nRoughly 5.3 million students study outside their home countries, a number that’s more than doubled since 2001. But the US\xa0share dropped from 28 per cent in 2001 to 21 per cent last year, according to the Association of International Educators, or NAFSA.\nNew international students in America have declined for three straight years: a 3 per cent drop in the 2016 school year -\xa0the first in about a decade -\xa0followed by 7 per cent and 1 per cent dips, according to the Institute of International Education, which releases an annual November report. The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center\'s fall snapshot shows a 13.7 per cent drop in undergraduate international students.\nThe government cites high college costs, but students tell another story.\n“I feel I am more comfortable in my home country,” said Priyadharshini Alagiri, 22, of India, who\'s pursuing a master’s in electrical and computer engineering at IIT.\nThe Chicago university known for engineering, computer science and architecture saw a 25 per cent decline in international students from fall 2016 to fall 2018.\nAlagiri said the pandemic exacerbated things, including a short-lived Trump administration rule requiring international students to leave if their schools held online-only classes. Students panicked, universities protested and lawsuits followed.\nThe Department of Homeland Security then unveiled draft rules last month imposing fixed student visa terms. Instead of being valid while students are enrolled, visas could be limited to four years, with students from countries including Iran and Syria eligible for two years.\nFederal officials say it\'s a way to fight fraud and overstaying visas. But colleges call it another barrier.\n“Right out of the gate, you had the first travel ban, and that really crystallised for students and scholars what was perceived as rhetoric really would translate into actual policy and create a tremendous amount of uncertainty,” said Rachel Banks, a director at NAFSA. “If I choose to study in the US\xa0will I be able to finish?”\nThere haven’t been many reassurances.\nThe Trump administration has floated curtailing Optional Practical Training, a popular program allowing international students to work. Roughly 223,000 participated in 2018-19, according to the Institute of International Education.\nThis month, the administration announced plans to limit H1-B skilled-worker visas, often a path for foreign students. It was pitched as a way to address pandemic-related job losses, following a June order temporarily suspending H1-Bs. It\'s prompted a lawsuit.\nDemocrat Joe Biden has promised to reverse some Trump immigration orders. He\'s pitched more skilled-worker visas and giving foreign graduates of US\xa0doctoral programs a pathway to citizenship.\nDodeye Ewa’s brother Wofai Ewa, an IIT senior studying mechanical engineering, wants to stay in America but worries about his options. He understands his sister’s doubts.\nTrump’s disparaging words on immigrants have irked him, including the tone surrounding a January rule to curb family-based immigration from Nigeria and other countries.\n“He made remarks about Nigerian immigrants getting jobs, and that put a weird tension around people who wanted to come here,” he said. “That put us in a bad light.”\nNearly 60 per cent of US\xa0colleges reported the social and political environment contributed to the decline of new international students, according a 2019 Institute of International Education survey.\nMost colleges in the survey said the difficulty in obtaining US\xa0visas was also to blame. Student visas issued under Trump shrunk 42 per cent, from nearly 700,000 in 2015 to under 400,000 last year, according to the State Department.\nThere are signs of waning interest in America in India, which with China, provides the most international students globally.\nIn 2018, about 90 per cent of Indians studying abroad chose the US, with fewer than 5 per cent in Canada. For the 2021 school year, roughly 77 per cent plan to study in America, and nearly 14 per cent chose Canada. That’s according to a survey by Yocket, a Mumbai-based startup helping roughly 400,000 Indian students plan study abroad.\nYocket co-founder Sumeet Jain said there\'s still wide belief America is unmatched for science, technology, engineering and math fields, but students have a backup these days.\nSeveral several nations have made it easier for international students.\nCanada allows foreign scholars to count part of their schooling toward a residency requirement for citizenship. The United Kingdom allows them to stay for two years after graduation while seeking work. Over the summer, Australia announced a pathway to citizenship for Hong Kong students.\n“They are trying to message certainty and flexibility to their international students, and unfortunately, we are messaging uncertainty and rigidity,” said Sarah Spreitzer, a director at the American Council on Education.\nThere are major consequences.\nInternational students contributed roughly US$41 billion to the American economy in 2018 school year. NAFSA estimated that since 2016, the decline of new international students cost the US\xa0nearly US$12 billion and at least 65,000 jobs.\nIn response, college leaders formed the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration in 2017.\nCramb, the group\'s co-chairman, is a Scottish migrant who earned his PhD\xa0at the University of Pennsylvania. He became IIT president in 2015.\n“The greatest thing to happen to me was coming here,” he said. “What we are doing is taking away a richness to the education experience for everyone.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     U.S. ', '     Donald Trump ', '     America ', '     India ']}"

We\'re therefore encouraged to see that the PISA global competence study findings have shown that our students have the skills, knowledge and attitude to thrive in such a world,” said Mr Sng Chern Wei, MOE’s deputy director-general of education (curriculum).\xa0\n“The study found that our students regardless of background have shown a strong ability to examine global issues, interact and communicate clearly with people across different cultural backgrounds, and appreciate multiple perspectives. It also found that our students have a strong belief in the ability to influence positively their own lives, as well as the world around them.”\nBottom quarter socio-economic status students also performed well, with about 26 per cent performing at the highest two proficiency levels, compared to 6 per cent of students from the bottom socio-economic status quarter across all participating systems.\xa0\n“We will continue to provide all our students with varied curricular and cocurricular learning experiences – such as discussions of contemporary issues, learning journeys to local cultural and heritage sites, research projects on various cultures, and immersion programmes with schools in the region – to help them further develop their GC knowledge and skills,” said MOE.\nFAMILIAR WITH CLIMATE CHANGE\nOf the seven topics surveyed in the assessment, Singaporean students were most familiar with climate change and global warming, and least familiar with international conflicts and global health. The PISA 2018 test was administered before the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, MOE noted.\xa0\nThe other topics surveyed were migration, equality between men and women in different parts of the world, hunger or malnutrition in different parts of the world, and causes of poverty.\xa0\nEight in 10 students surveyed in Singapore were confident in explaining issues related to climate change, including how carbon dioxide emissions affect global climate change, compared to the OECD average of 63 per cent.\xa0\nStudents are exposed to climate change in the general secondary science curriculum, as well as economic issues in social studies and elective geography in upper secondary, noted MOE in the press release.\xa0\n“To help students gain a better understanding of global issues, we will continue to encourage them to read more widely. This can also help them develop a deeper appreciation of different perspectives, and respect for different cultures,” added the Education Ministry.\xa0\nStudents reported that their schools have given them opportunities to be exposed to global issues and intercultural interactions both within and outside the classroom, said Mr Sng.\xa0\n“This has affirmed our schools’ persistent effort over the years in providing our students with learning experiences to develop their 21st century competencies,” he added.\xa0\nMOE developed a 21st Century Competency framework from 2010 that includes civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills, said the ministry. Curricular and co-curricular learning experiences have been provided in schools to help students develop these competencies, it added.\xa0\nAREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT\nThe study has also allowed MOE to pinpoint “some areas for improvement”, said Mr Sng.\xa0\nSingapore students performed below OECD peers in terms of their “self-perceived cognitive adaptability”, the study found. Self-perceived cognitive adaptability is defined by PISA as the ability to adapt one’s thinking and behaviour to the prevailing cultural environment or novel situations that might present new challenges.\xa0\nOnly half of Singapore students said they could deal with unusual situations, below the OECD average of 59 per cent. The study also found that cognitive adaptability is positively associated with students’ resilience, or their confidence in managing difficult situations.\xa0\n“For example, our students, compared to their OECD peers, have a lower level of confidence in their ability to adapt in their thinking and behaviour when faced with a novel situation,” Mr Sng noted.\xa0\n“We will certainly want to help them strengthen in this area by promoting a stronger sense of growth mindset in them, and also to provide them with varied learning experiences so that they are exposed to novel situations and making decisions in those situations.”\nDespite these areas for improvement, MOE “can be proud” of what the students have shown through the global competence study, he added.\xa0\n“Their high level of ability in understanding global issues, interacting with people across cultural backgrounds and appreciating diverse perspectives to help them thrive in the world ahead. They have shown us they are progressively growing up into responsible members of our local and global community.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

      Secondary students to learn how to guard against online predators under sexuality education revamp
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Secondary school students will soon learn new topics such as how to protect themselves from crimes such as cyber flashing and voyeurism, as part of changes to sexuality education next year to stay relevant in a digital age.\nThere will also be a greater emphasis on moral values, cyber wellness and understanding the importance of respecting boundaries for self and others -\xa0both online and offline.\nIn a statement to CNA, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said it regularly reviews sexuality education to ensure its relevance to students\' “changing needs”.\xa0\n“Through sexuality education, our schools equip students with age-appropriate knowledge and skills to develop positive self-identity, maintain healthy relationships, and make informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters,” the statement said, adding that sexuality education is part of the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum.\n“Students also learn social and emotional skills such as regulation of their emotions, having a better understanding of their own feelings and actions through developing a sense of perspective, having empathy for others as well as treating others and themselves with respect.”\nThemes such as sexual grooming and abuse as well as cyber flashing are expected to be covered at the lower secondary level. As students get older, themes are expected to include gender stereotypes, and how to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections.\nSchools are free to customise the lessons, subject to approval from MOE.\nAssoc Prof Jason Tan of the Policy, Curriculum and Leadership (PCL) Department at the National Institute of Education (NIE) noted that the key values that underpin the existing sexuality education curriculum, such as self-regulation and responsible decision-making, will be retained in the new curriculum.\nBut several factors lend an urgency to the revamp.\n“There are growing reports about the use of digital technologies for voyeuristic acts and the rise of social media has brought along with it offences such as online sexual grooming,” he said.\n“These factors have probably alarmed many people out there as well as the Ministry of Education into highlighting, even more than before, the dangers associated with strangers online,” Assoc Prof Tan added.\xa0\nDeterring sex crimes and violence against women are part of the focus of an ongoing national review of women’s issues, which aims to bring about greater gender equality.\nThe review will culminate in a White Paper to be delivered to Parliament in the first half of 2021.\nIMPLEMENTATION IS KEY\nParents, counsellors and education policy experts largely welcome the new curriculum, which they agree helps children be more savvy to the dangers posed by sex predators.\nBut they believe the key lies in how the lessons are taught.\nAssoc Prof Tan said: “One of the major difficulties that I see is that human sexuality is contentious, controversial, and also uncomfortable, or even taboo for some people.\n“This means that it is often very difficult for educators to engage with their students in a very frank discussion of issues related to sexuality education.”\nMs Constance Lai, a parent of two school-going children, expressed concerned that students may become curious after the lessons.\n“There may be kids who may think \'Oh, this is something I never thought about\'. They may explore,"" she said.\n“They (may also) ask ‘Why did this person end up doing such a thing?’ These are questions that teachers must be able to explain.”\nMr Martin Chok, who works with young victims and sex crime offenders, said there must be ground rules for group settings to ensure students and teachers can communicate effectively.\nOpportunities should be also be created for deeper sharing, said Mr Chok, who is assistant director at Care Corner Youth Services.\n“There needs to be a very trusting relationship between the educator and the student,” said Mr Chok.\n“They certainly must not feel that they have been judged, or for victims, if they have fallen prey to voyeurism or cyber flashing, there must be an outlet for them to share.\n“Otherwise, it might lead to things like self-blame.”\nMr Chok also stressed that schools must not lose sight of imparting fundamental moral values, which govern notions of sex and marriage.\nThis would help provide a foundation for discussions on more specific topics.\nExperts added that schools are not the only influences in students’ lives and must consider the messages they receive from parents and peers.\nMOE said parents play a critical role in imparting values and providing guidance on sexuality-related matters. It encourages schools to work closely with them to support their children.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ']}"

      ‘Definitely a loss' when students miss out on in-person CCAs, but COVID-19 could bring opportunities: Experts
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For 15-year-old Nur Natasha Mohamed Riduwan, school co-curricular activities\xa0(CCAs) look a little different these days.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the unit sergeant major of the National Cadet Corps Air (Girls) at Changkat Changi Secondary School would train alongside her schoolmates, coaching juniors in drills and physical training.\xa0\nThere were no masks in sight, and the 42 girls could intermingle freely. Once a year, a passing out parade would be held in conjunction with NCC Air (Boys), with about 100 students in attendance.\xa0\nBut with in-person CCAs\xa0suspended when students returned to school for Term 3 this year, Natasha and her peers started having online CCA sessions instead. The students practised drills, went through physical training\xa0and played icebreaker games on live Zoom sessions - together, but apart.\xa0\n“We were actually able to interact and see each other, and also through the bonding games, we actually get to know each other even though we’re not physically there together,"" said Natasha, adding that she was initially ""surprised"" that CCAs could be conducted online.\xa0\xa0\nIt was not easy to supervise\xa0training sessions over Zoom. For instance, it was difficult to observe drills “via the small Zoom window”, said the Secondary 3 student. “It was actually challenging for us to correct their mistakes with verbal cues only.”\xa0\nExperts CNA spoke to stressed that the benefits of face-to-face\xa0CCAs in school cannot be replicated online.\xa0\xa0\n“There is a big difference. For example, (for) musical instruments or even drama, it’s very different to stage a Zoom performance than to stage a live performance ... It is not the same thing,” said Associate Professor Jason Tan of the National Institute of Education (NIE) Department of Policy and Leadership Studies.\xa0\n“For sports, it is also definitely not the same thing to do sports training online. There’s only so much you can do with your coach online. You need that face-to-face interaction with your team members and your coach. So it’s been very tough for everyone this year.”\xa0\nAdding that it will be “very tough” to replicate the experience online, Assoc Prof Tan also noted that while overseas trips and learning journeys could be conducted virtually, it is still “not quite the same thing”.\n“Of course you have to ask yourself, what are you losing in terms of the authenticity of the experience? The whole point is to have that face-to-face human interaction. I don’t see a satisfactory solution to that problem right now,” he added.\xa0\nTreating online activities as “distinctly new” would be\xa0better than “a wholesale conversion” from regular CCA activities, said head of psychological medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital Dr Goh Kah Hong.\xa0\nNoting that some activities are better suited to be held\xa0online than others, he said: “The element of in-person interaction is perhaps the hardest to replicate online. That is not to say that it is always impossible.”\xa0\nThe interpersonal dynamic in school has “changed dramatically” due to pandemic-related measures, Dr Goh said.\xa0\n“Kids are not allowed to play during recess time, let alone participation in CCAs in large groups. Many out of class activities allow our students to be creative, to apply what they learnt, and also help develop social skills,” he said.\xa0\n“It is definitely a loss when children are deprived of these opportunities.”\n""REAL CONSEQUENCES"" FROM LOSS\xa0OF CCA TIME\nChildren from less privileged families may lose out more from missing in-person CCA sessions, said Assoc Prof Tan. CCAs also give students a chance to mix with other students across levels, streams and subject bands.\xa0\n“One thing that comes to mind immediately is the fact that not all homes are able to provide these sorts of experiences on a regular basis. So for some students, these school-organised CCAs or other activities are a major source of development outside of lesson time,” he said.\xa0\n“For example music lessons and sports and so on, especially for parents who can’t afford to pay for lessons outside of school, the school (is) playing a very major role.”\xa0\nExperts also noted that co-curricular activities are important because they give students a sense of accomplishment or confidence outside of the classroom, especially if they may not be experiencing this in their academic subjects.\xa0\n“Specifically, for primary school students, extracurricular activities present opportunities beyond their academic curriculum to build up a child’s self-esteem and confidence when they become aware of the physical and cognitive abilities that they can achieve,” said clinical psychologist at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) Jerlyn Ang.\n""Additionally, students hone problem-solving skills as they navigate through social situations to complete group tasks or activities. Secondary school students seeking out adolescence can also be enabled to explore their self-identity and sense of belonging through shared experience with their peers through goal-led extracurricular activities.”\xa0\nLosing out on CCA time could also affect students who want to use their extracurricular experience in next year’s admission exercises or scholarship applications, said Assoc Prof Tan.\xa0\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) had announced in May that direct school admission (DSA) exercises for students applying to secondary schools and junior colleges would continue.\xa0\nNo physical trials or face-to-face interviews will be part of the DSA selection process, MOE had said, and students may be asked to perform simple tasks during e-interviews to demonstrate their potential in a specific talent area.\xa0\n“We recognise that there might be limitations in assessing students via e-modes for certain talent areas, like team sports,” MOE had said at the time, noting that events like the National School Games and Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation cannot be used to assess students.\n“(In interviews), they talk about leadership potential, about competitions, they talk about demonstrating experiences in the field of study that they’re applying for,” said Assoc Prof Tan.\xa0\n“So this loss of CCA time has very real consequences, I think especially for next year’s admissions exercises.”\xa0\nAfter MOE’s announcement that lower-risk CCAs would be allowed to resume from end-July, Natasha and her schoolmates shifted to a mix of online and offline sessions.\xa0\nEven though they can now train together in person, the safe distancing measures in place mean that they still only train in groups of five, and cannot mingle with the other groups. Having to wear masks throughout training also poses a challenge, Natasha added.\xa0\nAlthough training in small groups is “more time consuming”, she said: “Despite\xa0the challenges, I know that\xa0we understand the need for these measures to keep everyone, including our families safe. I\'m actually grateful for the school for all the efforts to have these measures in place, and also to allow our CCA to continue for all of us.”\xa0\nResponding to CNA queries, divisional director of the student development curriculum division at MOE Tan Chen Kee said CCAs play “a key role” in the holistic development of students.\xa0\nBefore face-to-face CCAs\xa0resumed, schools implemented a mix of online CCAs and class-based ones. For example, CCAs such as computer programming, art and robotics were adapted for online learning, Mrs Tan\xa0said.\xa0\n“While these cannot replace face-to-face CCA sessions, schools have been able to tap on them to continue to provide learning opportunities for our students’ holistic development,” she added.\nFor activities that were more suitable to be conducted face-to-face, schools could implement them at the class level to minimise intermingling. This also meant students could try different CCAs that they otherwise might not have been exposed to, she added.\xa0\n“We know that many students have missed participating in their CCAs, and students who were selected to participate in inter-school competitions were also understandably disappointed - \xad\xadparticularly the graduating students,” said Mrs Tan.\xa0\n“Nonetheless, we appreciate that students understood the need to suspend these activities and the importance of prioritising safety, no thanks to the COVID-19 situation.”\xa0\nFINDING NEW OPPORTUNITIES\xa0\nDespite the challenges, experts said there may\xa0be a silver lining in the move to conduct some portions of CCAs online.\xa0\nCiting examples of CCA organisers uploading video lessons for students, KKH\'s Ms Ang\xa0noted that this can allow students to learn at their own time and pace.\xa0\n“This can also allow more time and flexibility for students who are slower in attaining mastery of skills to practice repeatedly and catch up with their peers,” she added.\xa0\nAt Changkat Changi Secondary, the participation rate in online CCAs has been “relatively high”, and the responses from students were “very positive”, even though they were not compulsory, said the school’s head of department for Physical Education and CCAs Sim Chong Ghee.\xa0\nHe noted that when the school’s netball team spoke\xa0to a former national\xa0player over Zoom, students were observed to be “listening attentively and asking meaningful questions”, and were “deeply inspired” by the sharing session.\n“Students were very satisfied with the learning and were engaged in the activities. And at the same time, most students indicated that they have missed having the CCAs conducted face-to-face, and they have also expressed their readiness to return to normal CCA sessions,” Mr Sim added.\xa0\n“It will not be 100 per cent the same as what it used to be because of all the limitations in terms of the safe management measures and guidelines, but we are trying our best.”\nOn a broader level, the introduction of smaller groups in CCAs could also be applied to class sizes, said Dr Goh.\xa0\nClass sizes in Singapore are “on the high side” compared to other developed nations, and it is now a good time to start planning for more intimate and smaller classes\xa0which will also help with physical distancing amid the pandemic, he added.\xa0\n“The school curriculum has already been evolving, but generally the education system remains very content heavy. Perhaps we could infuse more elements of flexibility and creativity into the normal curriculum, allowing for emphasis on life skills rather than acquiring knowledge,” said Dr Goh.\xa0\n“It is not easy to have a paradigm shift, but the current climate does call for one. This opportunity may just be the one to leapfrog our education into the future.”\nThe CNA Leadership Summit 2020: Navigating the Post-Pandemic World will discuss through a series of TV programmes and webinars how businesses and organisations\xa0have reacted to the pandemic\xa0and applied innovative practices.\nMore details are available at: cna.asia/leadership-summit.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     MOE ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'HONOLULU: Zan Timtim doesn\'t think it\'s safe for her eighth-grade daughter to return to school in person during the coronavirus pandemic but also doesn\'t want her exposed to a remote learning programme that misspelled and mispronounced the name of Queen Liliʻuokalani, the last monarch to rule the Hawaiian Kingdom.\nTimtim\'s daughter is Native Hawaiian and speaks Hawaiian fluently, “so to see that inaccuracy with the Hawaiian history side was really upsetting"",\xa0she said.\nEven before the school year started, Timtim said she heard from other parents about racist, sexist and other concerning content on Acellus, an online programme some students use to learn from home.\nParents have called out “towelban” as a multiple-choice answer for a question about a terrorist group and Grumpy from “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" described as a “woman hater"".\xa0Some also say the programme isn\'t as rigorous as it should be.\nAs parents help their children navigate remote classes, they’re more aware of what\'s being taught, and it\'s often not simply coming from an educator on Zoom.\xa0\nSome schools have turned to programmes like Acellus to supplement online classes by teachers, while others use it for students who choose to learn from home as campuses reopen.\xa0\nAnd because of the scramble to keep classes running during a health crisis, vetting the curriculum may not have been as thorough as it should have been, experts say.\nThousands of schools nationwide use Acellus, according to the company, and parents\' complaints are leading some districts to reconsider or stop using the programme.\n“We wouldn\'t have had this visibility if it weren\'t for all of us at home, often sitting side by side and making sure: ‘Is this working for you?\'"" said Adrienne Robillard, who withdrew her seventh-grade daughter from Kailua Intermediate School after concluding Acellus lacked substance and featured racist content.\nWhen school officials said her daughter could do distance learning without Acellus, Robillard re-enrolled her.\nAcellus officials didn’t respond to multiple calls from the Associated Press seeking comment. In an online message to parents, founder Roger Billings called the controversy “an organised attack” and said “they have not found anything in our content that is really racist or sexist”. An automated closed-captioning system misinterpreted some words, he said.\nKansas City, Missouri-based Acellus was created in 2001, according to its website, which says it “delivers online instruction, compliant with the latest standards, through high-definition video lessons made more engaging with multimedia and animation”.\nIn a video on his website, Billings responds to criticism about his credentials by saying he earned a bachelor\'s degree in “composite fields” of chemistry, physics, engineering and other subjects from a university he doesn\'t name.\xa0\nHe says he started a company focused on hydrogen energy technology and that he later earned a “doctor of research and innovation” degree at the International Academy of Science, the nonprofit that develops Acellus courses.\nHawaii selected Acellus based on an “implementation timeline” as well as “cost effectiveness” and other factors, Superintendent Christina Kishimoto said in a memo.\n“I don’t think it’s unreasonable to think that price was the main factor,” said Charles Lang, visiting assistant professor of learning analytics at Columbia University’s Teachers College in New York City. “And to some extent, you do get what you pay for in terms of content.”\nVetting educational programmes takes time, but with the pandemic, districts needed to quickly find remote learning platforms, said Eric Hirsch, executive director of EdReports, which helps schools review instructional materials.\n“So this spring, we saw a scramble, a dash,” he said.\nAnd evaluating curriculum is like the “Wild West” -\xa0it varies across school systems, Lang said.\n“We were in some serious situations with the pandemic, and we had to figure something out,” Hawaii school board member Kili Namauʻu said at a recent meeting. “And I think schools made some pretty quick decisions. Maybe they weren’t the most accurate decisions.”\nShe later said in an interview that it would be more problematic to pull Acellus in the middle of the quarter.\nBut as a Native Hawaiian, she wants to ensure Acellus has corrected “appalling” and inaccurate information about Hawaiian history: “I’m particularly dismayed with that particular module.”\nSeeing the queen\'s name misspelled and information that the Hawaiian islands were “discovered"" by Europeans was enough for Timtim and her husband to decide their daughter should join Waipahu Intermediate School\'s hybrid remote and in-person programme despite their concerns about COVID-19.\nThen most of Hawaii\'s public schools, which began virtually on Aug\xa017, extended remote learning until mid-October.\n“I just pray we figure out what to do if she does have to go to school once or twice a week,” Timtim said.\nThe Hawaii Department of Education, the nation\'s only statewide school district, is considering what to do about Acellus, but some schools decided on their own to stop using it. Other US\xa0districts, like Alameda Unified in California, quickly dropped the programme after complaints surfaced.\nIn a recent memo, the California Department of Education said it “has learned through examples shared that Acellus lessons may contain highly inappropriate content and may not meet state legal requirements surrounding instructional materials"".\xa0\nThe memo to superintendents and school administrators cited “racist depictions of Black Americans” and “at least one question that perpetuates Islamophobic stereotypes"".\nA Sep\xa017 memo Hawaii\'s superintendent sent to the school board said education officials were working with Acellus to address inappropriate content.\nMariko Honda-Oliver heard concerning things from other parents but didn\'t find anything she considered racist. She was troubled, however, that her son, a second-grader at Makalapa Elementary, blew through more than a week of material on his first day.\nSimilarly, Cassie Favreau-Chung said her son, a freshman at Mililani High School, was looking forward to the independence of remote learning but found he wasn\'t getting a quality education because the programme had no writing assignments.\n“He hasn\'t found anything on his own that he thought was racist or sexist,” she said. “However, I will also say that a lot of kids, it\'ll go over their heads.”\nFor example, “towelban”, Favreau-Chung said.\nShe switched her son to the hybrid programme next quarter to avoid Acellus, hoping the school will let him keep learning from home.\nThe experience has made Favreau-Chung lose faith: “It\'s the first time that I have not been proud to have my kid in public school.”\nHonda-Oliver, whose military family has experienced schools worldwide, also is disappointed.\n“This experience of having to see how other districts and other states are doing distance learning compared to Hawaii has kind of reinforced that Hawaii really is not the place to come if you want to give your children a good education,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Hawaii ']}"

      Commentary: There is no shame in being a Tiger Parent
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It is examination season in Singapore, even if it seems like my 10-year-old has been having an endless wave of “weighted assessments”.\nTwo weeks after school re-opened, the first of the weighted assessments were upon us. Not a test, mind you, just a small “weighted assessment” to see where students are. But, yes, the scores counts towards his overall school grade.\nAnd now as all 12-year-olds are caught in the death grip of the dreaded PSLE, most other students, too, find themselves deep in revision mode ahead of End-of-Year Examinations.\nThe stakes are high: Most schools have this final round of examinations accounting for 50 to 70 per cent of the year’s overall grade.\nThe entire eco-system around exam fever is on high alert. Enrichment centres and private tutors are all on call, furiously packing in extra revision slots.\xa0\nBookshops hold exam-guide sales, a leading media house even has even branched out to offering essay writing workshops. Parents, needless to say, are right there in the ring too.\nPOLARISED WORLD OF PARENTING\nWhile the bulk of the Western world decried Amy Chua’s seminal book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother with many corresponding definitions of tiger parenting tinged with negativity, it finally gave a term to a parenting style that was quite commonplace, if, even celebrated, on this side of the pond.\nWhen Chua, herself, came by our sunny little island, parents clamoured to meet her, if only to hear in person what they already read in her book and recognise themselves in her “ends justifies the means” parenting.\nYet, there were howls of protest from the other side of the fence. These were parents who believed in the process and less interested in outcome.\nPopular blogger Priyanka Sharma-Sindhar used the term “Elephant Parent” who is the exact opposite of a Tiger Parent, the ultra-strict disciplinarian.\xa0\nSindhar advocates strongly for a parenting style that nurtures, protects and encourages children, especially when they are young. Maybe, the kind that does not go into a tirade or sighs too much when a child brings home a fail grade.\nA local response to the tiger parenting drumbeat is perhaps best encapsulated by a social media driven movement a few years back that aimed to highlight that there was #lifebeyondgrades.\nIt is an initiative aimed at driving a mindset shift to alleviate the increasing pressures of school on the children of Singapore.\xa0\nAt their launch, local influencers and celebrities held cards with their PSLE scores with a message about how grades were not always a marker to success.\nThis is echoed by Dr Sanveen Kang, Clinical Psychologist and Founder of Psych Connect: “Over the years, many studies have looked at the correlation between grades and success in life. Generally speaking there is no correlation between grades and success in life.""\n“The only correlation found was between grades and academic success. In other words, for those who aspire to academic studies, scores predict success. However, it has nothing to do with success in life.”\nIndeed, Stanford researchers Alyssa Fu and Hazel Markus found that\xa0both culture-centric approaches can be effective.\xa0\nTheir research seem to suggest that while motivation comes from within an individual in Western families while Asian children find their drive in parental expectations. Both, say the researchers, lead to fairly equitable outcomes.\nCONFRONTING THE SYSTEM AND OUR CHILDREN\nThe research might be interesting intellectually but it cannot change how we parent in real life – if only simply because we still have to confront a system in which every child is assessed by how well he or she does.\nHowever we cut it, life likes winners. It always has and still does.\xa0\nIt celebrates the Kobe Bryants, Serena Williams and the Tiger Woods. In fact, we laud the phenoms that don’t just win, but dominate.\nSo, while we try our darndest to find balance or focus on the process, there is also a part of us that feels compelled to care deeply about the outcome. Which, unfortunately, often can only come through drilling, practice, training, powering through.\nThat is the mantra of the modern—if slightly cautious and closeted Tiger Parent in Singapore.\nWe are driven by this fundamental question: Are grades important? And our answer is, yes.\xa0\nWhy? Better grades means being in a better position to choose.\xa0Better grades give\xa0our children options.\nGOOD GRADES STILL THE CURRENCY\nIn the current system, secondary and tertiary school place allocation is largely based on grades. Everyone is ranked by performance, so, the person with the higher grade gets to exercise his or her choice of school first.\nIt is true that over the years, students who don’t meet grade requirements can get into courses or schools of their choice through other non-academic assessments.\xa0\nBut for the vast majority of students, the better the grades, the stronger your position in choosing what and where you want to study.\nEven the government scholar system (something highly prized and valued by many) is largely predicated on first having good grades.\xa0\nRare if ever do you hear of the president scholar who made it because he or she had mediocre grades (and I don’t mean an A-) but a stellar everything else.\nSure, there are other side roads one could take, vis-à-vis sporting abilities for a start. But that, some argue, favours the better-heeled families.\xa0\nBallet lessons themselves are pricey, and you add to that all the extras that come with it – like tutus and competitions – it is a hefty price tag.\xa0Even soccer these days come with community club memberships and competition fees.\nSo if we laid things bare, movements like #Lifebeyondgrades, while well-meaning and important for the conversations that it allows us to have, are the luxuries of the better heeled.\n“It is easy to say that grades don’t matter when your family has means,” says Jonathan Muk, the co-founder of ReadAble, a stand-in-the-gap provider of literacy and numeracy programs for the underserved.\n“A low-income family typically does not have the time and money to send their child to coding, dancing or swimming class. So, what do you have left, in terms of a formal system that will recognise your effort and reward you for achievement?\xa0And what kind of achievement is recognised in the formal system?”\nMr Muk’s assessment is in line with American writer Kearie Daniel. Writing for Flare Magazine, she titles her essay: Being a Tiger Mum is an Act of Love—and Necessity.\xa0\nHer essay posits that for black parents, pushing your child to excel isn’t a choice, it’s a way to make sure they survive.\nIn Singapore, most of us may not have to excel just to survive as Ms Daniel argues. But I would say the drive to do well is deeply rooted in our psyche.\xa0\nThe sweet spot of parenting – between pushing our children and allowing them to enjoy their childhood – is still elusive, especially in a hyper-competitive environment such as ours.\nIf I am a Tiger Parent, especially as exam fever takes root, then I am guilty as charged.\nIn my defence, while I do my best to ensure my kids still get the time to play, I also have to ensure that the rigor is put in place if I want them to achieve their fullest potential, to lead healthy, successful, productive lives as students in Singapore.\nCherie Tseng is Chief Operations Officer at a local fintech company, a mother of three and editor with The Birthday Collective.\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     school ', '     education ']}"

      At 14 his first start-up failed. Now he’s CTO of a new tech venture at 18
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: There are those who dream of founding a tech start-up like Zoom, Snowflake or Facebook – and the fame, wealth and recognition that they imagine must follow.\nAt 18, Singaporean Dalton Prescott Ng is already the founder of modestly successful tech start-ups, and serves as chief technology officer (CTO) of his latest venture.\nBut if you ask him, he’ll say that his life is anything but glamorous. “What they see on film is people in suits on private jets,” he said.\xa0\nThe reality is,\xa0“a lot of it is sitting in front of a laptop, 10 hours getting work done, writing code. It’s a tonne of work.”\nThere are some, he says, who think he lives in luxury. The polytechnic student who lives with his parents says: “I don’t buy branded clothes. I buy one pair of shoes and I wear it for a year until it breaks. I eat cai fan (economy rice) every day.”\nYoung entrepreneurs like Dalton are shaping this country into a smart nation with their innovative start-ups, building companies that rake in thousands to millions of dollars.\nBut what does it take to be a successful teen entrepreneur – and as the programme On The Red Dot finds out, how can these start-ups succeed in the competitive industry of app development?\nWATCH: At 18, my life as a tech start-up founder (3:56)\nHOW HE GOT HIS START – WITH MINECRAFT\nThere has been a huge increase in demand for\xa0mobile apps\xa0in recent years, and consumer spending on mobile apps is expected to hit US$171 billion (S$232 billion) by 2024, double the amount from 2019.\nMany of these apps are developed by talented designers under the age of 20.\nDalton was only 14 when he launched his first venture with friends. That failed because of their lack of business experience.\nBut he has since gone on to found other start-ups, including MasterApp, that dealt with cognitive learning; and current venture OohSpots, an app that will let users like small businesses conveniently buy out-of-home advertising spots.\nHis journey into programming started when he was 11, when he got bored with the Minecraft game he was playing. He borrowed books on programming from the library and learnt Java programming language to build mods for the game.\nBack then, the computer he was using was an old and slow laptop that was shared with his five siblings, but it didn’t matter.\n“I started to fall in love with programming and the ability to create an experience,” said Dalton. “What was just a hobby eventually became a career choice.”\nAt 14, he told his mother about his plans to launch a software development company, and she thought he was crazy.\n“I think especially for Singapore parents, they want us to play it safe. For her, playing it safe would be going to school, doing well, going to a JC (junior college), then going to university,” he said.\nBut she didn\'t stop him from pursuing his interest. At 16, Dalton became the youngest recipient of the prestigious Apple WWDC scholarship for two years running in 2018 and 2019.\nFor him, going to the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in California was a humbling experience. In Singapore, he was well regarded as an app developer, but in the US, he met younger kids who were able to build higher-level apps than he could.\n“If you are someone with any form of superiority complex, when you go there, you’re going to lose it,” he said.\nFROM POTATO PIRATES TO CYBERSECURITY \nIn four years, Dalton has made thousands of dollars from developing some 10 apps.\nAnd he is aiming to make it big with his new advertising app – but every day, it’s estimated that nearly 5,000 new apps go live, and only a fraction of them will actually turn a profit.\n“There are no major players (in this space) right now. We really need to rush out development because once the foothold in the market has been taken, it’s very hard to get it back,” he said.\nThe original plan to launch it by July 2020 has been delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But his team has also been working on a mobile gaming app, Potato Pirates, for software company CODOMO.\nAnd meanwhile Dalton – who is completing his diploma in infocomm security management at Singapore Polytechnic – was also busy until recently with an\xa0internship at DSO National Laboratories. As a cyber security engineer, he helped build a communications app for Singapore\'s largest defence R&D organisation.\n“I’m working on so many different things, it helps that I have multiple income streams coming in. If one of them were to fail, I can rely on others,” he said.\nMany developers build apps with the goal of monetary gain. But Dalton thinks one should build an app to solve a problem first, and not to squeeze profits.\n“Focus on charging customers the right amount so that you solve their problem and they are happy. That’s how you build a successful business,” he said.\nHAVING TO PROVE HIMSELF\nIt has only recently occurred to him that he shoulders more responsibilities than his average peer: A stressful role as CTO, managing his team, his studies, even having to source for funding.\n“When I talk to my friends, I realise the kind of stuff that I am thinking about is very different,” he said. “I am concerned about the ROI (return on investment) or what if I were to spend this much on developing the product. And (they are) thinking about what they want to eat tomorrow.”\nWhile being a young entrepreneur has its advantages, including having more energy and more time to learn the business, Dalton has to work harder to prove himself because of his age.\n“It is hard (for investors) to entrust someone who’s 17 or 18 with that kind of money,” he said. “So it was definitely a struggle for me.”\nTo reassure investors, his company appointed an older, more established entrepreneur as CEO.\n“So when we go to an investor, he can definitely see that the company is set up properly,” he said. “What a lot of investors are looking for is traction and the ROI. As long as you can show them those two things, then you can most probably get an investment.”\nWATCH: Young and boss: Teen app developers (full episode, 22:40)\nHYPERVENTILATING UNDER A BLANKET\nLearning how to deal with stress, failure and people are skills that this teenager had to pick up.\nAs a younger boy in secondary school, he wasn’t able to deal with feedback and would get upset when someone criticised his coding. He also took failure hard.\n“When things weren\'t going well, when we were running into issues, I’d find myself under my blanket hyperventilating,” he described. “I didn’t know how to deal with these emotions, I didn’t know how to reason with myself that it’s okay, that if things aren\'t going well, you can find another way.”\nThese days, he has learnt to leave his “ego at the door”.\nI think especially in small startups, it is very important that you can take brutal honest feedback.\n“If someone tells you that your design is ugly, they are not trying to insult you, they are trying to help you make your product better,"" he said.\nBut the long hours and workload have taken their toll on his health.\nShowing a photo of himself with ripped six-pack abs two years ago, Dalton pointed to all the weight he’s put on since he stopped exercising and turned to stress-eating.\n“I worked long hours, I drank a ton of energy drinks,” he said. “That kind of led to a bit of a burnout situation, where I stopped working for a while and just took some time to recover.”\nDalton has also missed out on some parts of teenage-hood – like the Marvel series of superhero movies in recent years.\n“In many ways, I wish I could have fewer responsibilities… My job is stressful. But I also know that I wouldn’t be happy doing anything else,” he said.\nAnd while some might think he’s already hit career heights at this young age, he sees himself “at the bottom” with “still has a long way to go”.\n“I hope that I\'ll be successful enough that I can make it to Forbes’ 30 under 30 Asia list,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      COVID-19: Most foreign students back in Singapore for university, some to continue online classes overseas
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Most international students at Singapore\'s\xa0autonomous universities are back here\xa0for classes in the new semester amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with some choosing to continue with online classes from overseas.\xa0\xa0\nFor first-year Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student Mihika Agarwal, coming to Singapore to begin her freshman year meant taking a flight from her home in Kolkata to Hyderabad before flying to Singapore. She arrived on Sep 11 and is currently serving\xa0her 14-day stay-home notice period.\xa0\n“Because I\'m a freshman student entering college right away, college is more about the entire college experience rather than just the academics,” said the 19-year-old, explaining why she decided not to take the semester online from Kolkata.\xa0\n“I have these other friends of mine, who are maybe going to the United States or the UK, and they aren\'t really getting an opportunity to go there right now because their classes are totally online. But since I have been given an opportunity ... I thought it was a good decision to go on campus.”\xa0\nFor the new semester, universities have opted for a mix of online and offline classes depending on the field of study, with\xa0large-scale lectures still held online.\xa0\nResponding to queries from CNA, the National University of Singapore (NUS), the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) said the majority of their international students have returned to Singapore.\xa0\n“We will continue to support the remaining international students with the submission of their applications to the relevant agencies to obtain the necessary approvals,” said an NUS spokesperson. \xa0\nThe majority of SUTD’s students arrived in Singapore to serve out their 14-day stay-home notice before the semester began on Sep 14, said the university’s spokesperson.\xa0\n“Those who are unable to arrive in time, due to difficulties in securing flights out of their home country, will be able to join classes remotely in the meantime,” added the\xa0spokesperson.\xa0\nSingapore Management University (SMU) said ""a\xa0number” of international students have returned to Singapore for the new academic year.\nIt\xa0is also helping the remaining students submit applications for the relevant approvals for them to return to Singapore.\nThe four universities said they remain in contact with the students who are overseas\xa0and are supporting them with online classes.\xa0\n“We acknowledge that online learning cannot fully replace the on-campus education experience, and hope that our international students who are still awaiting entry into Singapore will be able to join us on campus when it is safe and practical for them to do so,” said the NUS spokesperson.\xa0\nFor SMU international students, those who may not want to take on online learning options can choose to take a leave of absence for the term, said the university.\nPROS AND CONS OF ONLINE LEARNING\nFor\xa0second-year NUS student Shreya Sanganeria, she decided to continue her studies with NUS\xa0from India, after finding out that\xa0her faculty\'s classes would be going completely online for this semester.\n“That basically gave me the confidence to continue my semester from India,” the economics major\xa0told CNA.\xa0\nShe returned home in May by an evacuation flight, and in June, a decision was needed on whether she wanted to return to Singapore for the next semester and keep her room on campus.\nAt the time, there were no international flights from India to Singapore.\xa0\n“Technically, I did not have much of an option to not fly back. And apart from that, I was a little sceptical because I’ve not really had a proper virtual semester,” said the 19-year-old.\nDespite deciding not to return to Singapore for the semester, Ms Sanganeria said she was not sure whether she could manage an entire semester taking classes and extracurricular commitments online from overseas.\xa0\nCurrently, all of the lectures are recorded to allow students to watch them in their own time, she said. Students are also given a choice of tutorial slots to ensure that those logging in from overseas can account for the\xa0time difference.\xa0\n“I don\'t feel like I\'m missing out on the knowledge aspect because it\'s pretty much the same. But for the people, the interaction aspect, I do feel that I\'m not able to interact with people as much because it\'s different when you\'re face to face and then you get to know more people,” she told CNA.\xa0\n“When it\'s virtual, it\'s a lot more restricted because people don\'t generally open up virtually and everyone just does their own thing. And then we just end the class, so there\'s not much interaction with students from my module who I do not already know.\xa0\n""So I feel like a virtual semester has this drawback where the interaction becomes less as compared to before.”\xa0\nIt is a view shared by Ms Agarwal.\n""The ease with which you can ask questions to the professor in between classes or lectures, I don\'t think that freedom is already there on a Zoom call with maybe 150 students,"" she said.\nAlthough she decided to travel to Singapore, the decision did not come easy.\xa0\nShe only\xa0received her offer letter from NTU on Aug 14, during the first week of the semester.\xa0\nAt the time, she had already given up on the idea of studying\xa0in Singapore because she thought universities here were accepting fewer international students due to the pandemic and was about to begin her studies in India.\xa0\n“When I received that offer I was actually in two minds, even though going to Singapore was like my first preference because of the opportunities and everything,” she told CNA, adding that it was difficult to “change that mindset”, especially after finally deciding to attend university back home.\n“But my decision mainly was based on the fact that I did not really consider the COVID-19 situation, because I think that would be a very short-term thought process,” added Ms Agarwal.\n“I had to look at the bigger picture, maybe five years down the line. And I\'m sure five years down the line, there is going to be some improvement or maybe a maximum improvement in the COVID-19 situation.”\nAdding that she is “excited” to begin her studies at NTU, she said: “Sure, some classes are going to be online\xa0and some are going to be offline, at least I won’t be missing out on any part of it, either online or offline, I will be taking both of them. So I think that\'s a major plus point being on campus.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

It was uncovered only when an invigilator heard unusual electronic transmission sounds and voices coming from one of the students.\nThe October 2016 papers taken by the six students, aged 17 to 20, were for subjects including English, Mathematics and Science.\nA few hours before each examination, Fiona and Feng would tape the devices on the students and test them to make sure they worked.\nDuring the examinations, co-accused Tan Jia Yan, also a teacher, sat in as a private candidate and used FaceTime on her phone to livestream the question papers back to the tuition centre.\nFiona and Feng worked on the questions and called the students to read the answers to them.\nPony was labelled by the prosecution as the mastermind of the entire scheme. As principal, she decided how the operation would be carried out and approved her co-accused\'s actions, overseeing the entire process on the day of examinations.\nWhile the students were in the exam halls, they wore skin-coloured ""in-ear"" earphones which fed them answers to the tests.\nOf the four, Tan was the only one\xa0who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years\' jail in April last year.\nThe prosecutors had asked for 52 months\' jail for Pony, the longest jail term as she was the director of operations with higher culpability. They called for three years\' jail for Fiona and 28 months for Feng.\nA SOPHISTICATED OPERATION\nThe case involved a ""sophisticated operation involving at least four persons working in concert"", said the prosecutors.\xa0\nThey also employed Bluetooth and FaceTime technology, and their actions ""seriously undermined the integrity of the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board"", said the prosecution.\n""The offences have inevitably caused a loss of public trust and confidence in its administration of an important national examination,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutors Vadivalagan Shanmuga and Cheng Yuxi.\nThey cited the judgment in Tan\'s case, where the judge said that the case strikes ""at the heart of the values of meritocracy which are sacrosanct to our educational system"".\n""The sentence must be calibrated not just to punish the wrongdoer appropriately. It must rectify the wrong caused to the system, and present a sufficiently stark warning to deter those who would seek to profit by way of such audacious deception,"" said the judge in Tan\'s case.\nFor each count of cheating, the accused could have been jailed for up to five years, fined, or both.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     education ']}"

      Differences across race must be accepted and approached ‘constructively’: Maliki Osman
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A “race-blind society” should not be confused with being blind to genuine differences and contexts across race, said Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman on Thursday (Sep 3).\xa0Speaking on the fourth day of the debate on the President’s Address, Dr Maliki said that as Singapore strives for a society without racial prejudice and discrimination, differences exist and must be recognised.\xa0“We must not confuse this with being blind to the genuine differences and contexts across races, neither should we ignore or underestimate the severe and sometimes unintended negative consequences that can easily occur with unrestrained comments on race relations and related issues,"" he said.\xa0He noted several “fundamental principles” of social inclusion, such as accepting differences across race and approaching these differences “constructively”.\xa0These could be differences in cultural traditions and practices, emphasis on priorities and what matters more in life, or specific community issues that a race group has to grapple with, that require dedicated attention and assistance.\xa0“An inclusive Singapore must recognise, appreciate, understand, and accommodate these differences; and\xa0allow this positive sense of racial identity to exist and develop, and have a comprehensive set of policies and community initiatives, including self-help groups, to address\xa0and\xa0be part of a larger ecosystem that provides help and solves problems effectively and with empathy,” he said.\xa0“NO INHERENT CONTRADICTION”\xa0On the issue of the Government’s CMIO (Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others) model, which Workers’ Party Member of Parliament Sylvia Lim referred to on Tuesday as “problematic”, Dr Maliki said there is “no inherent contradiction” in having a strong racial and strong Singaporean identity.\xa0\xa0“To be truly Singaporean does not at all mean that we must forgo or dilute our racial identity, or pretend that we are not of a particular race, or can’t see the race of a fellow Singaporean,” he said, adding that doing away with the CMIO framework “does not mean we will become more Singaporean”.\xa0Ms Lim on Tuesday suggested that instead of the CMIO model, it would be better to talk about “citizenship rights”.\xa0She also expressed her hope for Singapore to become a “race-blind society”, proposing other changes in areas such elections along ethnic lines and the Housing and Development Board\xa0ethnic quotas.\nBeing aware and respecting differences has contributed to the “richness” of Singapore’s culture, said Dr Maliki. As such, policies, practices and public discussions must “avoid playing up (or) misunderstanding the ethnic differences” or “(deny) or mask genuine differences”.\xa0While discourse on race will evolve over time, society must remember to put “concerted effort” to be inclusive - especially when interacting in common spaces - and to build mutual understanding, he said.\xa0“The underlying value and guiding principle must be mutual respect for differences and strengthening social cohesion.”\xa0In July, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said that going forward, younger Singaporeans have to decide the limits on discussions of race and religion and they should lead ground-up efforts to discuss these issues in their respective communities.\xa0ACHIEVING GREATER SOCIAL MOBILITY\xa0Dr Maliki also addressed the need to have progress for all in achieving greater social mobility and reducing inequality sustainably.\xa0Relative social mobility, while important, is a “zero-sum game”, said Dr Maliki. “Where a\xa0step forward for one is a step backward for\xa0the other.”\xa0Therefore, absolute mobility - where everyone progresses - is also necessary for mobility to be “meaningful”, he said.\xa0“If the escalator\xa0is moving up, being overtaken by someone matters less. The differences between each step is less stark,” he said, citing Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who used the analogy at a dialogue in 2018.\xa0Greater equality of opportunity also supports better social mobility, he said.\xa0He cited several initiatives by the Education Ministry to provide opportunities to students, such as changing the education system to recognise students of diverse talents, abilities and learning styles, and allowing students to pursue diverse aspirations.\xa0It also improved access to higher education and pre-school education, while providing more manpower and funding to schools with “greater needs”.\xa0In addition, the Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT) helps disadvantaged students get the help they need, he said.\xa0Greater equality of opportunity is “not just about access to education, health, and other public goods”, said Dr Maliki.\xa0“But rather, that our starting point in life should not dictate our ending point, and that with hard work, ability, and ambition, we can succeed. We must strive as much as possible to level uneven starting blocks, and to provide opportunities at every stage of life.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Maliki Osman ', '     education ', '     race ', '     parliament ']}"

      Want your child to master English and Chinese? Rote learning might not be the way. 
  </h1>, 'text': ""Many people would be familiar with the term “learning by heart”, which is often associated with memorising and doing something over and over again. In fact, many of us might have grown up learning in this manner and believe that it is the best way to master a language.\nBut increasingly, evidence shows that such repetitive drills in rote learning – which focuses on memorising instead of understanding information – might not be the most effective learning method.\nA recent Nanyang Technology University (NTU) study found that a group of children developed high proficiency in English and Mandarin in just six months.\xa0\nThe study, conducted by cognitive psychologist Assistant Professor Setoh Pei Pei from the School of Social Sciences at NTU in collaboration with Little Skool-House, assessed the effects of the preschool’s literacy curriculum on English and Mandarin language development in 68 of its Kindergarten Two (K2) students.\nAt the beginning of the second quarter of the year and the fourth quarter of the same year, the children’s English and Mandarin proficiencies were measured using standardised tests, including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and Expressive Vocabulary Test. Additionally, their home literacy environment and the frequency their family members use each language to interact with them were recorded through a parent questionnaire.\nAssessments revealed that the majority of the children were English-dominant at the beginning of the study. Despite this and the fact that English was the more frequently used language at home for a high percentage of the children, study results showed that nearly 93 per cent of the children were highly proficient in both languages at the end of K2 in October.\nLIVING THE LANGUAGE\nWhat could explain this high prevalence of bilingualism among Little Skool-House students is the school’s approach of allowing children to “live” the languages.\n“The key is to let children 'live'\xa0the language rather than use rote memorisation and drills. Learning only the technical part of the language is not enough,” said Ms Coreen Soh, deputy general manager of Little Skool-House. She explained that the school creates opportunities for students to immerse in a language in what they call “the cycle of learning”.\nTo do this, Little Skool-House uses a specially designed curriculum known as the Pedagogy for Enhanced Mandarin Acquisition, through which children not only learn the technical aspects of the language but also get ample opportunities to apply the language in real life. It allows children to use Mandarin in interactions, such as in situations of negotiation, problem-solving and expressing thoughts, Ms Soh said.\n“These experiences demonstrate the usefulness of the language to children, giving them a sense of competence and spurring them on to want to master the language. This is great news for many parents, who want their children to master the Chinese language without the stress of (making them do) countless worksheets,” Ms Soh added.\nMAKING LANGUAGE LEARNING PART OF DAILY LIFE\nOne of the curriculum’s key pillars is systematic language formation, achieved through a structured reading programme that focuses on comprehension. The goal, said Ms Soh, is to help the children get ready for Primary One. “A strong foundation in both English and Mandarin during the preschool years determines success in school.”\nLearning is customised according to each child’s readiness to help them progress towards daily usage and the communication of more complex thoughts.\xa0\nThe children learn vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure and pronunciation using differentiated strategies and materials. In place of copying and memorisation, they play games and engage in\xa0fun activities like recipe writing, creating their own mini books and writing messages to their friends. There is also weekly journal writing, which allows the children to express their imagination and feelings.\nMs Soh said: “If children use rote memorisation to memorise 10 words for a spelling test, they tend to forget these words easily as only short-term memory is used. But if these words are learnt in context, children understand them and thus remember them better.”\nA PROGRESSIVE APPROACH\nA hallmark activity of Little Skool House's Mandarin curriculum is\xa0the Builder’s and Innovation Project, which\xa0requires children to apply what they have learnt in mathematics, science and language to real-life scenarios through investigation. For their Builder’s and Innovation Project, Nursery Two and Kindergarten One children at Little Skool-House investigated how the digestive system works and the electrical conductivity of different fruits last year.\n“Doing the Builder’s Project in Mandarin allows our children to discuss complex topics that go beyond simple everyday words. They get the opportunity to practise their inquiry skills. Similar to what they do in primary school, the children hypothesise, discuss research methodology, conduct research and interviews, experiment, collate results, make conclusions, share their findings and reflect on what they can do to improve,” said Ms Soh.\nAnother hallmark of Little Skool-House is the Chinese Theatre Pedagogy programme, which offers children a chance to learn and use Mandarin while producing their own play. Their teacher facilitates this by introducing various storybooks and allowing the children to vote for the story they would like to proceed with for their play.\nExplaining the rationale for this activity, Ms Soh shared: “The children negotiate in Mandarin to convince their classmates to choose a particular storybook that they prefer or let them play a role that they want to play. They also write their own adaptations of the story, make and sell their own play tickets and do self-assessments. As the children want to convince their friends and are having fun, they are eager to learn different words in Mandarin.”\nHIGHLY TRAINED TEACHERS WHO EMPOWER CHILDREN\nAnother important pillar of Little Skool-House’s Pedagogy for Enhanced Mandarin Acquisition is its teachers, who undergo a rigorous training programme, overseas learning journeys, mentorship and on-the-job coaching.\nMandarin pedagogy expert in Early Childhood Education Dr Connie Lum, who developed Little Skool-House’s teacher training curriculum, said the training programme equips teachers with the expertise to enable children to “live” Mandarin, rather than rely on rote memorisation techniques and worksheets.\nDr Lum is a committee member of the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism and author of 30 published books on teaching Chinese.\nAs a testament to the effectiveness of Little Skool-House’s approach, the NTU study found that a high percentage of the studied children were highly proficient in English and Mandarin vocabulary. Children who were rated high in both English and Mandarin proficiencies increased from 76.8 to 92.6 per cent from March/April 2018 to October 2018. Parents also reported feeling very satisfied with the school’s curriculum for their child’s development.\nMs Soh said building a high proficiency in language requires children to be involved in every step of their learning process. The goal is for them to develop a genuine interest and love for learning, she added.\nThe Little Skool House is the chosen preschool for many employees of esteemed Singapore institutions, such as the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Social & Family Development and National University of Singapore.

      As US schools reopen, concerns grow that kids spread COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'BOSTON: US students are returning to school in person and online in the middle of a pandemic, and the stakes for educators and families are rising in the face of emerging research that shows children could be a risk for spreading the new coronavirus.\nSeveral large studies have shown that the vast majority of children who contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have milder illness than adults. And early reports did not find strong evidence of children as major contributors to the deadly virus that has killed more than 780,000 people globally.\nBut more recent studies are starting to show how contagious infected children, even those with no symptoms, might be.\n""Contrary to what we believed, based on the epidemiological data, kids are not spared from this pandemic,"" said Dr\xa0Alessio Fasano, director of the Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of a new study.\nSchools across the country are trying out a wide range of strategies to reopen, from all online classes to all in person. They are asking whether reopening schools with stringent mitigation measures is worth the risk to students, families and educators, given that keeping schools closed will likely harm academic progress, social and emotional development, mental health and food security.\nDr Fasano and colleagues at Boston\'s Massachusetts General and MassGeneral Hospital for Children found that infected children have a significantly higher level of virus in their airways than adults hospitalised in intensive care units for COVID-19 treatment.\xa0\nThe high viral levels were found in infants through young adults, although most of the participants were age 11 to 17.\nThe study, published on Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics, involved 192 participants ages 0-22 who were seen at urgent care clinics for suspected COVID-19.\xa0\nForty-nine of them - a quarter of the total - tested positive for the virus. Another 18 were included in the study after being diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a serious COVID-related illness than can develop several weeks after an infection.\nThe research suggests that children can carry a high viral load, meaning they can be very contagious, regardless of their susceptibility to developing a COVID-19 illness.\n""There has been some conflicting data out there about the degree to which children can be contagious,"" said Dr\xa0Marybeth Sexton, assistant\xa0professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, who was not involved in the study. ""This is further evidence that we may see children as sources of infection.""\nShe added more extensive research is needed.\n""NOBODY IS SPARED""\nA separate study published last month in JAMA Pediatrics found that older children hospitalised with COVID-19 had similar levels of the virus in their upper respiratory tract as adults, but children younger than five carried significantly greater amounts.\nHowever, other medical groups show differing information over children\'s potential to spread the virus. The American Academy of Pediatrics on Wednesday updated its guidelines to reflect ""that children under 10 years may be less likely to become infected and spread infection, while those 10 years and older may spread it as efficiently as adults"".\nA recent South Korean study found that people were most likely to contract the new coronavirus from members of their own households, with children aged nine and under least likely to be the first identified case.\nSince most children infected with the coronavirus have very mild symptoms, they were largely overlooked as a demographic in the earlier stages of the pandemic, Dr\xa0Fasano said.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a pediatric COVID-19 hospitalisation rate of 8 per 100,000 for Mar 1 to Jul\xa025, compared with a rate of 164.5 per 100,000 for adults.\nExperts say the incidence of a related issue, which can develop after COVID-19 infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, is concerning. ""The number of these patients is growing,"" Dr\xa0Fasano added.\nConcerns have also been raised about cases of type 1 diabetes among children diagnosed with COVID-19.\xa0\nA small UK study found that the rate of diabetes almost doubled during the peak of Britain’s COVID-19 epidemic, suggesting a possible link between the two diseases that needs more investigation.\n""The more we understand, the more it boils down to nobody is spared in this pandemic,"" Dr Fasano said.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     US ', '     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

The\xa0university\xa0in lower Manhattan is also giving students the options of remote learning or a blended program between the two.\nNew York, once the US\xa0epicentre of the pandemic, has an infection rate below 1 per cent, a benchmark for restarting certain activities coupled with social distancing and mask wearing.\nElsewhere in the United States, colleges, secondary and primary schools are grappling with the new reality of whether to reopen in the middle of a pandemic.\nAt some colleges, a coronavirus test site is the first place students must go when they arrive on campus before going to their dorms. They may not enter any other campus buildings until the result comes back negative, which could take several days in some cases.\nThe\xa0University\xa0of Notre Dame near South Bend, Indiana, on Tuesday reported a spike of 80 positive test results on Monday, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 147 since Aug\xa03, according to the\xa0university\'s website.\xa0\nThe results from 418 tests represented a positivity rate of 19 per cent with overall positivity at around 16 per cent since Aug\xa03.\nBefore returning to campus all students were tested - only 33 of nearly 12,000 were positive, a rate of only 0.28 per cent. The\xa0university\xa0did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on the rise in cases.\nThe\xa0university, with about 8,600 undergraduates, had most students and faculty on campus by Aug\xa010 with restrictions on travel, events and visitors.\nMUSIC FESTIVAL\nIn the Oklahoma\xa0university\xa0town of Stillwater, the city council met on Monday night to discuss their response to viral videos showing crowded bars and clubs near Oklahoma State\xa0University, where in-person classes began on Aug\xa017.\nThe videos emerged as Mayor Will Joyce opposed the annual Weedstock music festival set to begin on Thursday outside the town, expected to attract thousands.\nSchools in parts of the country that have a coronavirus infection positivity rate of more than 10 per cent\xa0would be better off easing into the new academic year with virtual classrooms, Anthony Fauci, the top US\xa0infectious diseases expert, said on Tuesday.\nFauci said primary and secondary schools as a default position should try and reopen for the psychological health of children, but no single approach should apply to every school in the country.\n""To make a statement on one side vs the other and take the country as a whole won\'t work -\xa0we\'re so heterogeneous with the infections,"" Fauci told a virtual Healthline conference.\nSome US\xa0schools have closed almost as quickly as they welcomed back students as the level of new cases per day remains high in many states, including California, Florida and Texas.\nThe United States has more than 5 million cases of confirmed coronavirus infections, the highest in the world, according to a Reuters tally, with more than 170,000 reported fatalities.\nMany colleges have plans to test students who are coming back to campus, even if classes are all remote. Testing availability on campuses will vary.\nNYU plans to test a random sampling of students, faculty and staff each week of the fall semester, adding up to several thousand tests per week.\nFlorida State\xa0University\xa0has set an ""aspirational goal"" of giving COVID-19 tests to all faculty, staff, and students returning to campus.\xa0\nNorthwestern\xa0University\xa0in Evanston, Illinois, said all students living in residence halls will be tested upon arrival and all students partaking in any in-person learning must be tested before the start of the academic quarter on Sep\xa021.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     US ', '     Anthony Fauci ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      British government facing mounting criticism in exam row

      Commentary: Even as universities close lecture halls and go online, studying abroad is still the dream
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, the 23,715 Singaporeans enrolled in universities overseas are wringing their hands.\nWill they be allowed back on campus? Or will they have to stay home and grapple with online lessons, which may take place in topsy-turvy time zones?\nSome may be left hanging with mixed messages from on high. On Jul 6, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced that all non-resident students in American colleges enrolled only in online classes will have to leave the country, or face deportation.\nBut following lawsuits brought by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the decision was reversed within a week.\nIt is unlikely that other countries, particularly those popular with Singaporean students, will impose sweeping restrictions like those that America did.\nMany universities in popular study aboard destinations such as Australia and the UK are dependent on income from overseas students. In 2018, international onshore student revenue accounted for more than a quarter of all universities’ revenue in Australia.\nWith COVID-19 forcing countries to close their borders, what do the prospects for Singaporeans keen to pursue an overseas education look like?\nEDUCATIONAL DISRUPTION\nIt’s an understatement to say there won’t be a return to normal campus life at the start of the new semester.\nPrestigious universities from Cambridge to Harvard will deliver all lectures online for the academic year of 2020 to 2021. Singaporean students, regardless of if they’re overseas or at home, will in all likelihood have to attend virtual classes this fall.\nThe shift to virtual classes rightly prioritises the health of students but could result in some learning loss. The educators we work with have observed how online classes reduces interactivity with their students, making it challenging to personalise lessons based on real-time feedback.\nFEELINGS OF ISOLATION\nMoving overseas to study can be a traumatic experience. My former colleague, a Singaporean who recently embarked on her post-graduate studies in the Netherlands, struggled with loneliness during her first few months of the programme.\nDespite having travelled extensively, she found it trying to adjust to a new culture with few friendly faces to count on.\xa0\nStudents who began their overseas education at the start of this year – before lockdowns were enforced – may not have had the time or opportunity to build up a strong social network. They may feel isolated in a foreign country, and struggle to remain motivated and committed to their studies.\nEven more worrying than a sense of isolation is the rise of racism targeting those who appear East Asian.\nDuring the early stages of the outbreak in February, Jonathan Mok, a Singaporean student at University College London, was the unfortunate victim of a coronavirus-related racist attack.\nSince then, I’ve seen on social media anecdotes from friends and acquaintances of racist abuse, largely verbal, in foreign countries.\xa0 Fortunately, most cases were not as violent as Mr Mok’s, but nonetheless caused great distress to the victims and their loved ones.\nUnfortunately, with increasingly nationalist rhetoric from certain world leaders, it is unlikely we’ll see an end to such antagonism soon.\nIMPACT ON GRADUATES\nRecent or soon-to-be graduates who intend to work in their host country may have their plans thrown into disarray.\nMr Gavin Ng, a Singaporean PhD candidate at the University of Illinois, had received a job offer in April as a data scientist with Uber.\nHowever, that offer was rescinded just a month later. The ride sharing behemoth is struggling to keep afloat, having laid off a quarter of its workforce globally in May due to the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns.\nWith the pandemic likely to cause the worst recession since the Great Depression, most countries would be focused on channelling any available employment opportunities to citizens.\nONLINE DEGREES A SUBSTITUTE FOR OVERSEAS EDUCATION?\nAs institutions worldwide shift towards online learning, many will question the value of enrolling in a university overseas.\nBut online learning in tertiary institutions is not a new trend by any measure. Over the past decade, platforms like EdX and Coursera have offered MOOCs – massive open online courses – designed by universities and companies such as MIT and Microsoft.\nIn some cases, students can earn certifications that are stackable for a degree. EdX has a MicroBachelors programme that provides students with accreditation from established universities like New York University and Arizona State University.\nThese programmes are significantly more affordable than traditional degree programmes, and allow students to complete the course at their own pace, making them particularly popular with mature learners juggling work and family.\nYet MOOCs have not been seen by most as a substitute for a campus-based education, particularly in a premier institutions. In a post-COVID world, Singaporeans considering an overseas education will likely be more discerning about where they apply to.\nThe cost of an overseas university education is still significantly higher than one at a local university. An average three-year undergraduate programme at the latter costs around S$25,000, compared to £10,000 (S$18,000) and upwards per year at a UK university.\nSo if students are going to fork out much more for an overseas education – especially if what they’re getting in return is mostly virtual lectures and seminars – they are going to want the biggest bang for their buck.\nWith the increased proliferation of online learning spurred by COVID-19, a campus-based overseas higher education will only remain attractive at elite institutions.\nPERKS OF GOING TO ELITE SCHOOLS\nBeyond providing their students with quality education, the allure of pedigree schools have more to do with their non-academic perks.\nHigher education is a stratified sector, where the name of the institution is often as valuable as the knowledge gained. Marketing can only do so much – the perceived worth of institutions is often built over long periods of time, even centuries.\nIf pay is any reflection, then employers buy into the brand names of schools too.\nFrom 2015 onwards, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis has consistently reported Ivy League graduates landing the highest starting salary compared to their non-Ivy League peers. Their median starting salary was 55 per cent more than that of US private university graduates in 2019.\nThe other draw of top schools is the opportunity to work closely with world-renowned academics. This will still be possible in an online learning environment, though the lack of face-to-face interaction will dilute the experience and its value.\nThe best ideas are often the result of heated debates between great minds, and despite the advancements in technology, it’s hard to fully capture the nuances of human interaction online.\nSingaporeans also pursue an overseas education to master their craft. Olympic gold-medallist Joseph Schooling, for instance, chose to enrol at the University of Texas at Austin to train with a former coach of the US\xa0Olympic swimming team.\nMusicians and artists would also want to study abroad for the same reasons.\nALLURE OF OVERSEAS UNI EDUCATION WILL STAY\nWhen international students can return to campus remains a huge question mark. Many countries are only beginning to lift lockdowns, while some states such as Victoria, Australia are forced to re-enter lockdowns due to sudden spikes in infections.\nCountries are also more likely to focus on reopening schools before they turn their attention to universities.\nBut the allure of an overseas university education will likely persist. Once the prerogative of wealthy families and brilliant scholars; an overseas university education is now more accessible to Singapore’s growing middle class.\nIn the longer term, as COVID-19 begins to recede or a vaccine is developed, an overseas education, particularly at top schools, will remain the dream for ambitious Singaporeans.\nVignesh Naidu is Director, Operations at The HEAD Foundation.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Primary School registration has gone online and is more straightforward. So why is it still stressful?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The advent of the Internet has been something generally celebrated where the electronic means to apply for a flat, a job and more promised greater convenience and accessibility.\nIn theory, the Ministry of Education’s move towards online registration for Primary School should also be a laudable step that takes the chore of having to take leave from work, head down to a school and wait around for your kid’s ballot to be called – assuming you’re applying in the later phases of a popular school.\nAlthough that high-stakes bingo game was a rite of passage for parents eager to get their child into a desired school, it was admittedly troublesome.\nSo how’s that new arrangement working in practice?\nMOVE TO ONLINE REGISTRATION\nSince 2018, this physical Primary School application process and balloting exercise has shifted online.\nYet, this doesn’t mean that the process has become less frenzied or fraught with anxiety. If anything, the process has become more clinical and feels less stingy if only because you cannot gauge the other players involved in this race.\nInstead of the drama unfolding in one packed day, the application period has been dragged out to between one to three days. Schools have more time to verify submitted information or obtain further supporting documents from parents.\nYet, this also allows anxious parents to call the Ministry of Education (MOE) or the schools to badger the harried school or MOE staff for updates on application numbers and other details.\xa0\nThough moving this process online should have made this Primary School exercise feel more like an administrative exercise, it seems you can take the parents out of competitive physical school registration exercises but you can’t take the competition out of some.\nOther than relying on the schools for information, some resourceful parents even band together in chat groups and forums to exchange information on admission numbers or commiserate with other parents stuck in the same boat.\nOnce the appropriate school is decided upon after some nail-biting deliberation and a hard look at the probability of getting in, the application is submitted online and deposited into the abyss of MOE’s database with only an automated email message to confirm a successful submission of the application.\nBALLOT BINGO REPLACED \nThe cutthroat race doesn’t end there. After submission, parents wait to hear if a ballot needs to be conducted.\nIf a ballot is required, the visceral joy or anguish of physically witnessing your child’s fate being sealed on the spot within the school ballot hall being replaced by an excruciating wait lasting several days while the school staff and MOE tally the information and numbers.\nBallot bingo is replaced with a faceless computerised ballot and a disembodied SMS text from an MOE number which arrives several days after the close of applications.\nOn the one hand, moving the application process online means that parents no longer witness the back and forth verification and exchange of information between school and parent and among parents on the school premises.\nStill, that means parents have to take the initiative and play a more active role in seeking answers to their admission queries from MOE, the school or other parents.\nAnd it would seem parents haven’t quite found their equilibrium. As the online application system is relatively new in the scheme of school admissions, many are still in the process of adjusting and navigating their way around the application maze.\xa0\nYou can be sure future cohorts of tiger parents will do all they can to get first-hand information on how to navigate the system.\nREAL-TIME UPDATES WILL BE HELPFUL\nMoving the application process online, however, looks prescient because applications can be processed smoothly even during a COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere is little disruption to the application process due to COVID-19 as eligibility for priority admissions is dependent on factors which have to be planned in advance, many parents would already have ensured that they met the criteria for priority admissions a year or more prior to admissions applications, before the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our shores.\nBut improvements to the system for parents who are digital natives that appreciate and are used to real-time data is something MOE might want to look into.\xa0\nWhile MOE provides a daily update on the number of spaces vs applicants on its website, the lack of real-time updates on the rapidly changing number of parents submitting and withdrawing their applications seems like an archaic remnant of Singapore’s pre-Smart Nation days.\xa0\nParents applying in two of the most hotly contested phases - Phase 2B, which prioritises those with religious or community links to the school or who have volunteered at the school, and Phase 2C\xa0for those with no links to the school - would not only need to know the number of vacancies vs applicants in that phase but also the number of applicants who live less than 1km or between 1km to 2km or beyond 2km of their school of choice in order to calculate their odds of getting into that school.\nMaybe the better analogy is that the bingo parlour has been swapped out for the blackjack table as parents must make a judgement call without knowing what cards the dealer and other players hold.\nSince applications are now submitted digitally, collating and processing the data required to assess the veracity of the applicant’s information to provide near real-time updates on the numbers.\nMOE may even consider displaying the odds of getting in, and save the hard-pressed school or MOE staff from manually answering calls to field the same queries from parents throughout the application period.\xa0\nThis might have unintended consequences as parents might shift away from some popular schools thinking their chances are low, but that shouldn’t be an overriding factor.\nEnhancing admissions application data processing and making the application numbers accessible to the public simultaneously however, are only cosmetic changes to the online admissions system.\nUltimately the gripe many parents have concerns the criterion for priority admission to schools, where many do not have alumni links nor live in close proximity to some of the most popular, prestigious schools in high-income neighbourhoods.\nMOE’s move in 2014 to reserve 20 per cent of places for families with no affiliation - 40 places for Phase 2B\xa0and Phase 2C\xa0applicants - is a step in the right direction that has aided and helped many Phase 2B\xa0and 2C\xa0applicants get into popular primary schools.\nCompulsory primary education in Singapore has become a great social leveller and indeed, we should fight to ensure that priority admissions does not exclude certain pockets of children from being left behind in the educations arms race.\nAnd maybe that’s why parents may fret about primary school admissions. It is after all one of most important foundations of their children’s educational journey, which could have a deep impact on the rest of their lives – regardless of whether the admissions process takes place physically or online.\nBeyond admission, it is up to the child to prove their mettle.\nCeline Koh is a professional in the finance industry\xa0and a mother of three children.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     schools ', '     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Inspired by COVID-19 restrictions, two 15-year-olds create free online learning platform for kids
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: As part of a volunteer programme to help underprivileged children, 15-year-old Mihika Mishra used to go to a two-room HDB flat every week to do fun activities with a three-year-old girl and teach her how to read.\n“Because of the pandemic, obviously that programme had to shut down. I couldn’t help but wonder what she must be going through,” Mihika said, stating that the girl lived with six others in the flat.\n“I wanted to create a platform that allowed children like her to have an escape, just to have some fun or explore activities.”\nMihika talked about it with Arsh Sheikh, her good friend and classmate from the Overseas Family School. They had both struggled to discover their passion growing up. So in June, the pair brainstormed how they could help children engage in new activities during the pandemic.\n“I wanted to provide children a way to do this for free, considering the unfortunate conditions some children face right now,” said Arsh, 15. “I also knew that there would be other kids who wanted to pursue a passion while staying remote and safe.”\nThe solution they came up with was Explorexa, a platform that uses Zoom to host fun and free 45-minute lessons for children aged three to 18. The thrice-weekly sessions, ranging from art and baking to singing and dancing, are taught by fellow students who have some talent or experience in these fields.\nArsh said the instructors are aged 13 to 18 to make lessons more child-friendly and encourage questions. The co-founders will ask potential instructors to demonstrate their expertise and also tell them the dos and don’ts.\nFor instance, students are not required to switch on their cameras during lessons to protect their privacy. Instructors should also pause every 15 minutes to ask if there are questions. It is about getting the students excited about something, Arsh said.\n“It's not a formal classroom setting, it's more of just an interactive environment where the kids feel safe and comfortable to ask questions and be passionate about the activity,” Mihika added.\nThe lessons can involve basic explanations, pre-recorded videos and live demonstrations. For example, a lesson on graffiti art included an introduction to sketches and pencils, as well as a how-to on drawing popular cartoon character Spongebob Squarepants.\nInterested parties can visit their website for a list of upcoming activities, before filling up a registration form that asks for details like name, age and grade. They will receive a Zoom link a day before the activity. Instructors can also sign up through a separate form.\nSince its July launch, Explorexa has had about 120 sign-ups across 18 lessons, including sports like football and basketball and more serious topics like programming and business. Some of those who signed up come from countries like Norway, Oman and Australia.\n“Most of our audience is from international schools, but we would really like to expand to local schools, or even children who don't have the opportunity to go to school,” Mihika said. “That’s one of our main causes.”\nBUILDING FROM SCRATCH\nBut creating Explorexa did not come without challenges. Mihika and Arsh took quite a bit of time to decide how the lessons would be conducted, and considered starting a YouTube channel.\nWhile some organisations like the National Heritage Board and Wildlife Reserves Singapore digitised their content and launched online activities for children during the “circuit breaker”, Mihika wanted something with a more human touch.\n“We thought that live sessions would work best for kids since they require interactivity, and it would just be the most suitable environment for them,” she said. “Instead of just watching videos, they can ask questions and learn better.”\nAt the start, the pair spent hours watching online tutorials on designing websites using the online platform Wix, delving into details like picking the most suitable interface and colours for children.\n“It was really time intensive because we needed to go through so many tutorials to even understand one feature. Wix is a really broad website with a lot of features,” Arsh said,\n“Because of quarantine we actually don't have anything else to do so, we just put all our effort into this one website.”\nThe pair used their own savings to pay for a domain name and premium Wix plan. Arsh said it was free to use Zoom to host lessons as the platform usually upgrades its time limit on meetings from 40 minutes to an hour.\nOnce that was done, they had to find instructors, something they acknowledged was difficult because everything would be done for free.\n“We asked a couple of our friends but a lot of them were like, ‘We would like to do it for money,’” Mihika said.\n“But I think the fact that we had a ‘be a leader’ page (for instructors) and we made it clear that that was free, caused us to get people who are genuinely interested in teaching. So from that we generated a lot of leaders.”\nA bunch of schoolmates soon agreed to become instructors. More recently, a student from a local secondary school signed up to teach a lesson on baking chocolate chip cookies. Explorexa eventually had enough activities to last several weeks.\n“We had already planned for the next three or four weeks, just to put that off our mind because we need to focus on the marketing, making a social media account and everything,” Arsh said.\nSLOW START\nHowever, Explorexa failed to attract much interest for the first round of lessons starting Jul 18. The website was only getting a maximum of 200 views. Mihika and Arsh felt discouraged after putting so much into it.\n“We weren't sure whether to continue, but we had already put so much effort into it, we just decided to give it a go,” Mihika said.\nThe two of them ramped up publicity efforts on social media, including getting their parents and friends to share it with others from across the globe. In the second week, Explorexa saw a spike in sign-ups.\n“That actually filled us with a lot of confidence,” Arsh said, adding that they thought it would be at least a month before interest picked up. “It just inspired us to do more work, putting in as much effort as we can during this (COVID-19) season.”\nA few weeks in, Mihika said she is “pretty proud” of the feedback so far, although she encouraged more parents and students to give reviews. Students can also suggest what lessons they would like to see.\nStill, Arsh expects to see a dip in sign-ups when COVID-19 restrictions are eventually lifted, but insisted that they will continue to run Explorexa. The platform, like learning through YouTube videos, will remain relevant, he predicted.\nNevertheless, Mihika and Arsh admitted that it is a lot of work. They have to search for new instructors and activities, sit in for lessons to ensure everything runs smoothly, respond to feedback and manage the social media accounts.\nMihika is optimistic as the lessons are usually conducted after school or on weekends. If things start to get really hectic, she plans to get more volunteers on board. Some of her friends have already expressed interest.\n“We can launch clubs in our school where people can actually volunteer to help us maintain the website,” Arsh said.\nGRAND PLANS\nNevertheless, the pair have lofty ambitions for Explorexa. They are currently working on issuing certificates to instructors, and finding more variations of popular activities like arts and sports.\nThis includes introducing lesser-known sports like rounders, which is similar to baseball.\nDown the road, they hope to launch an Explorexa app and a one-to-one tutoring function for subjects taught in school. They also discussed adding in-depth “masterclasses” taught by older and more seasoned instructors.\nBut one thing will remain constant: That the platform is free to use.\n“For starters, we definitely hope to grow in Singapore and neighbouring Southeast Asian countries, as I know they've been hugely affected (by COVID-19),” Mihika said, adding that the aim is to get as many students as possible.\n“I think the main goal of what we believe is that we need to keep it free, because the main goal is just to help out kids, it's never to make a profit.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     children ', '     education ']}"

""Their children deserve better.""\nAbout 470 disadvantaged women including tea pickers and refugees have enrolled for the free degree programme since it started in 2016, and receive a monthly stipend while they study.\nDozens of ex-textile workers are part of the cohort and the AUW\'s vice chancellor, Nirmala Rao, said the university was involved in creating internships to tackle a ""dearth of female middle and senior managers"" in Bangladesh\'s garment industry.\nWhile up to 80 per cent of garment workers are women in largely junior positions such as seamstresses, the majority of senior management positions are taken by men, UN data shows.\nRubana Huq, who heads the nation\'s largest trade association for garment manufacturers and was also involved in designing the academic course, said seeing the graduates taking on management positions in the sector would inspire other women to dream big.\n""They have different exposure and their outlooks are very fresh,"" Huq told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""They will be able to contribute to how we look at female empowerment.""\nWORKERS\' RIGHTS AT RISK\nBangladesh is the world\'s second largest supplier of clothes to Western countries after China, and relies on the garment industry for more than 80 per cent of exports and 4 million jobs.\nYet the sector has been rocked in recent years – first by the 2013 Rana Plaza collapse on the outskirts of Dhaka that killed 1,136 workers, then by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe 2013 disaster sparked efforts to improve labour rights and conditions but the coronavirus outbreak led to thousands of garment workers being laid off in recent months as Western fashion brands cancelled orders due to global store closures.\nAs workers push for overdue wages and the jobless seek to find work, the AUW graduates want to help to steady the sector and push for change by rising through the ranks of management.\n""I want to see everyone with the same eye, it doesn\'t matter what category someone\'s working in,"" said former factory packer Yesmin Akther. ""I want people to behave well towards workers.""\nA recent report by a US Senate committee found Bangladesh was backsliding on garment workers\' rights. Union leaders faced intimidation, hampering their ability to investigate claims of threats and abuse – mainly from women workers – the report said.\nFactory owners dismissed the findings of the report as inaccurate while local researchers said verbal abuse of workers was more prevalent across smaller factories and subcontractors.\nGIVING BACK\nThe university, funded by donors including the IKEA Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has female students from across Asia and the Middle East pursuing degrees in subjects such as public health, philosophy and politics.\nThe students from the garment sector receive full pay – worth about US$100 a month – from their employers while studying.\nThis proves vital as their families rely on the income, according to the AUW, which said it had persuaded several factory owners to back the initiative and allow some of their brightest female workers to leave the workplace for five years.\nThe former textile workers, who had to pass a rigorous entrance exam for a place on their courses, said adapting to academic life was challenging as was improving their English.\nOne of the graduates said she used to ""just stare at people"" at the start because her English was not good enough, while another recalled practising the language in front of the mirror.\nDipali Khatun, who is set to graduate in December, said her ambition was to work for a charity or to return to the garment sector in a human resources role where she could have an impact.\n""I would ... ensure that there is no bad behaviour against any garment worker,"" she said.\nKalpona Akter, founder of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity, said she hoped all the garment worker graduates would return to the sector rather than seek other opportunities.\n""If the 100 girls who are studying get into 100 factories, that can bring change because they have seen how difficult lives are for workers,"" Akter said.

      Commentary: This is the face of Generation COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: The oft-repeated idea that COVID-19 is “the great equaliser” is a myth.\nThere is no equality of suffering or equality of sacrifice during a pandemic that is disproportionately hurting the poorest and most vulnerable.\nWhile the health emergency has disproportionately harmed the elderly poor, the unprecedented education crisis caused by the pandemic is now hurting the poorest children hardest and creating a generation that will lose out on learning.\nLockdowns and other social distancing rules have forced schools all over the world to shut their doors, affecting a peak of nearly 1.6 billion children. While wealthier children have had access to alternatives, such as online learning, the poorest do not.\nThe world’s least-advantaged children – for whom education offers the only escape route from poverty – have thus fallen further behind, placing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all by 2030 even further out of reach.\nA FOREGONE EDUCATION \nEven before the pandemic, the world was falling short of this goal. Globally, nearly 260 million children were out of school, and 400 million dropped out after the age of 11.\nIn some regions, such as rural Sub-Saharan Africa, few girls were completing secondary school, not least because of widespread child marriage.\nNearly 50 countries have no laws banning child marriage, and many more fail to enforce their bans. As a result, about 12 million school-age girls are forcibly married off each year.\nWhen schools reopen, there is a good chance that many poor children will never return. Poverty is the biggest reason why children don’t attend school, and the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis will far outlast lockdowns, especially for the poorest people.\nThe likely result is that more children will be pushed into the ranks of the 152 million school age children forced to work, as 14 countries still have not ratified the International Labor Organization’s minimum-age convention.\nEven more girls will be forced into early marriage. When the West African Ebola epidemic that started in 2014 closed schools in Sierra Leone, the number of 15 to 19-year-old girls who were pregnant or already mothers nearly doubled, rising from 30 per cent to 65 per cent. Most of these girls never returned to school.\nWith the right policies in place, economies will start to recover, jobs will slowly be restored, and social-protection policies will ease the poverty of the unemployed. But there is little protection against the effects of a foregone education, which can last a lifetime.\nA LOST GENERATION\nAs it stands, more than half the world’s children – nearly 900 million boys and girls – are unable to read a simple text by age 10. That is 900 million children who do not receive the knowledge and skills needed to improve their economic lot as adults.\nIf we do nothing to help “Generation COVID-19” make up for lost time, that figure could easily approach one billion or more.\xa0\nWhen schools in Kashmir closed for 14 weeks in the aftermath of the devastating 2005 earthquake, the most affected children lost the equivalent of 1.5 years of learning.\nAs the recently published UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report advises us, children who have fallen behind need the kind of catch-up programmes that in Latin America have increased educational attainment by up to 18 months since the 1990s.\nBut the needed support will cost money. Unless we bridge the gap in education funding, this goal of eradicating poverty will remain out of reach.\nPRESSURE ON INTERNATIONAL AID TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\nUNESCO estimates that before the COVID-19 crisis, 50 countries were failing to spend the recommended minimum of 4 per cent of national income, or 15 per cent of the public budget, on education.\nInadequate funding from governments and donors has meant that many of the 30 million refugee and forcibly displaced children age out of education without ever setting foot in a classroom, despite the efforts of Education Cannot Wait and other groups.\nNow, the pandemic is set to squeeze education budgets even further. As slower or negative growth undermines tax revenues, less money will be available for public services.\nWhen allocating limited funds, urgent lifesaving expenditure on health and social safety nets will take precedence, leaving education underfunded.\nLikewise, intensifying fiscal pressure in developed countries will result in reductions in international development aid, including for education, which is already losing out to other priorities in the allocation of bilateral and multilateral aid.\nThe World Bank now estimates that, over the next year, overall education spending in low- and middle-income countries could be US$100 billion to US$150 billion lower than previously planned.\nThis funding crisis will not resolve itself. The quickest way to free up resources for education is through debt relief.\nThe 76 poorest countries must pay US$106 billion in debt-service costs over the next two years. Creditors should forgive these payments, with a requirement that the money is reallocated to education, as well as health.\nAt the same time, multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks must increase their resources. The International Monetary Fund should issue US$1.2 trillion in Special Drawing Rights (its global reserve asset), and channel these resources toward the countries that need them most.\nThe World Bank, for its part, should unlock more support by replenishing the International Development Association (or borrowing on the strength of it) for low-income countries, and by using guarantees and grants from willing aid donors, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, which stand ready to unlock billions in extra finance for education in lower-middle-income countries through the International Finance Facility for Education.\nBRINGING KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL\nIn the next few days, both NGOs and all international education organizations will begin “back to school” campaigns. Save Our Future, a new campaign launching in late July, advocates building back better, rather than restoring the pre-pandemic status quo.\nThat means updating classrooms and transforming curricula, implementing effective technologies, and helping teachers offer personalized instruction.\nMaking schools safer (over 620 million children lack basic sanitation services at their schools, which particularly affects girls) and ensuring school meals (a lifeline for 370 million boys and girls) would also ease the effects of poverty and improve educational outcomes.\xa0\nSave the Children will add to this pressure with its own grassroots campaign focused on debt relief to pay for education.\nBut investing in schools is only part of the solution. In Sierra Leone, support networks for girls halved the dropout rate during the Ebola crisis.\nIn Latin American, African, and Asian countries, conditional cash transfers have boosted school attendance. The latest Global Education Monitoring Report advocates implementing similar programmes today.\nGeneration COVID has already suffered immensely. It is time for the international community to give children the opportunities they deserve.\nEven when faced with momentous challenges, we remain committed to making ours the first generation in history in which every child is in school and learning. Both national governments and the international community must now step up collective efforts to achieve that goal.\nAbiy Ahmed, Prime Minister of Ethiopia, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.

      Older children spread the coronavirus just as much as adults: South Korean study 
  </h1>, 'text': 'NEW YORK: In the heated debate over reopening schools, one burning question has been whether and how efficiently children can spread COVID-19 to others.\n\nA large new study from South Korea offers an answer: Children younger than age 10 transmit to others much less often than adults do, but the risk is not zero. And those between the ages of 10-19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do.\nThe findings suggest that as schools reopen, communities will see clusters of infection take root that include children of all ages, several experts cautioned.\n“I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won’t get infected or don’t get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore, they’re almost like a bubbled population,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.\n“There will be transmission,” Osterholm said. “What we have to do is accept that now and include that in our plans.”\nSeveral studies from Europe and Asia have suggested that young children are less likely to get infected and to spread the virus. But most of those studies were small and flawed, said Dr Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.\nThe new study “is very carefully done, it’s systematic and looks at a very large population,” Jha said. “It’s one of the best studies we’ve had to date on this issue.”\nOther experts also praised the scale and rigor of the analysis. South Korean researchers identified 5,706 people who were the first to report COVID-19 symptoms in their households between Jan 20 and Mar 27, when schools were closed, and then traced the 59,073 contacts of these “index cases"".\nThey tested all of the household contacts of each patient, regardless of symptoms, but only tested symptomatic contacts outside the household.\nThe first person in a household to develop symptoms is not necessarily the first to have been infected, and the researchers acknowledged this limitation.\nChildren are also less likely than adults to show symptoms, so the study may have underestimated the number of children who set off the chain of transmission within their households.\nStill, experts said the approach was reasonable. “It is also from a place with great contact tracing, done at the point interventions were being put in place,” said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.\nChildren under age 10 were roughly half as likely as adults to spread the virus to others, consistent with other studies. That may be because children generally exhale less air - and therefore less virus-laden air - or because they exhale that air closer to the ground, making it less likely that adults would breathe it in.\nEven so, the number of new infections seeded by children may rise when schools reopen, the study authors cautioned.\n“Young children may show higher attack rates when the school closure ends, contributing to community transmission of COVID-19,” they wrote.\nOther studies have also suggested that the large number of contacts for school children, who interact with dozens of others for a good part of the day, may cancel out their smaller risk of infecting others.\n\nThe researchers traced the contacts only of children who felt ill, so it is still unclear how efficiently asymptomatic children spread the virus, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n“I think it was always going to be the case that symptomatic children are infectious,” she said. “The questions about the role of children are more around whether children who don’t have symptoms are infectious.”\nRivers was a member of a scientific panel that on Wednesday recommended reopening schools wherever possible for disabled children and for those in elementary schools, because those groups have the most trouble learning online. She said the new study does not alter that recommendation.\nThe study is more worrisome for children in middle and high school. This group was even more likely to infect others than adults were, the study found. But some experts said that finding may be a fluke or may stem from the children’s behaviours.\nThese older children are frequently as big as adults, and yet may have some of the same unhygienic habits as young children do. They may also have been more likely than the younger children to socialise with their peers within the high-rise complexes in South Korea.\n“We can speculate all day about this, but we just don’t know,” Osterholm said. “The bottom line message is: There’s going to be transmission.”\nHe and other experts said schools will need to prepare for infections to pop up. Apart from implementing physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks, schools should also decide when and how to test students and staff - including, for example, bus drivers - when and how long to require people to quarantine, and when to decide to close and reopen schools.\nBut they face a monumental challenge because the evidence on transmission within schools has been far from conclusive so far, experts said. Some countries such as Denmark and Finland have successfully reopened schools, but others, like China, Israel and South Korea, have had to close them down again.\n“People, depending on their ideology on school opening, are choosing which evidence to present - and that needs to be avoided,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health in New York.\nAlthough the new study does not offer definitive answers, he said, it does indicate that schools can increase virus levels within a community.\n“So long as children are not just a complete dead end - incapable of passing the virus on, which does not seem to be the case - putting them together in schools, having them mix with teachers and other students will provide additional opportunities for the virus to move from person to person,” he said.\nAt the same time, Shaman said, it’s important for children not to miss out on critical years in education and socialisation, and school districts have the unenviable task of choosing between those options: “It’s hard trying to find the right balance.”\n\nBy Apoorva Mandavilli © 2020 The New York Times\n\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     health ', '     children ', '     South Korea ', '     education ']}"

      MOE's approach to COVID-19 cases is to 'ring-fence' on a ‘small scale’ instead of closing schools: Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education’s (MOE) response when there are COVID-19 cases in schools is to ""ring-fence"" students and teachers, put them on leave of absence and to do it on a ""small scale"" instead of fully closing schools, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Thursday (Jul 16).\nHis comments come after a 13-year-old girl from Jurong West Secondary School was wrongly diagnosed with COVID-19 because of mislabelled samples at a hospital laboratory.\xa0\nBefore the error was discovered, it was thought that she had contracted COVID-19 from another student at the school who had\xa0earlier tested positive for the virus.\nResponding to a question about MOE\'s contingency plan in the event of student-to-student transmission in schools, Mr Ong said: “So the approach is always, you need to ring-fence and quarantine and put students and teachers on that leave of absence, but do it in as small (a) scale as possible.\xa0\n“So if you can do that for a class, to keep the school safe, do so, if not (do it) at (the) level. And if not, maybe a school, as opposed to always reacting to a full closure or full opening. I don\'t think that is appropriate.”\xa0\nSpeaking to reporters after a visit to Tampines Secondary School for Racial Harmony Day, Mr Ong said he was “very comforted” that parents and teachers mostly understood the actions taken by MOE.\xa0\n“Like Jurong West Secondary School,\xa0I was most comforted that when we closed that whole level, (Secondary) 1, the other levels, like 90 over per cent came back to school,” he added.\xa0\n“That means they understood by ring-fencing that level, the rest of the school is actually safe. Because of the measures, they don\'t intermingle. So I think so long as we can keep those procedures in place, parents, teachers understand, students understand. Then I think we can make life as normal as we can.”\xa0\nNoting that many school activities have not resumed,\xa0Mr Ong said MOE will have to understand the virus and its transmission, and constantly review its approach.\xa0\n""We know that the current state seems to work, and we will have to constantly review, work very hard, always be alert, then gradually bring back more activities,"" he said.\n“That\'s how we have to act, moving slowly towards an equilibrium and a new normal. We\'re still in progress.”\nAdditional reporting by Deborah Wong.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     education ']}"

      Fulfilling jobs, fulfilling lives
  </h1>, 'text': 'A healthy dose of respect and trust, plenty of opportunities for professional development and mastery, and a strong sense of purpose and empowerment.\nThese key ingredients work together to build a happy workplace at NTUC First Campus (NFC), which was recognised as one of the best companies to work for in Asia at The HR Asia Awards 2019. Scoring above the Singapore average across measures, the company was acknowledged as an organisation that creates purposeful job opportunities and one that encourages continuous learning.\nWith four decades of experience in the early childhood care and education sector, NFC currently supports over 20,000 children and their families. Even as it creates a nurturing learning environment for young children during their formative years, the organisation places a strong emphasis on building an engaging and happy workplace through various initiatives.\nThey include efforts such as empowering staff through a range of teaching tools and resources, providing opportunities for professional and personal development as well as building trust and respect among colleagues.\nCoupled with NFC’s vision that every child deserves equal opportunities to a good start in life, these efforts have kept the passion for work going strong for its team of staff comprising early childhood and corporate professionals – something that Ms Rita Lim, Ms Dawn Hu and Ms Wu Yingshan can attest to.\nWhile each of them has a different job scope and unique experiences within NFC, they all have something in common: A satisfying and rewarding career.\nA WORK CULTURE OF COLLABORATION, TRUST AND RESPECT\nFor them, a work culture that focuses on collaboration, trust and respect stands out at NFC.\nMs Hu, principal of The Little Skool-House At-Kent-Vale, first joined NFC as an English teacher in 2010. She said that interning at My First Skool and The Little Skool-House while pursuing a diploma course in Early Childhood Education sealed her decision to join the organisation.\n“The positive experiences I had with my mentors and centre principals led me to view NFC as a company that values the importance of working with parents, staff and children,” recalled Ms Hu.\nCurrently holding a Master of Education, Ms Hu said that NFC’s work culture is collaborative and everyone works towards a common goal.\n“There is no ‘I’ but more of ‘we’ moments. Teachers support one another when they have difficulties in coping with a challenging child by sharing ideas and checking in with one another. Teachers share their teaching experiences and collaborate to find better ways to deliver lessons,” she explained.\nEchoing this sentiment, Ms Wu, 38, an assistant director of marketing, said NFC functions like a “big family” where trust and respect take centre stage.\nOther ways in which the organisation builds trust and respect among its staff is through initiatives such as the annual employee engagement survey and townhall engagement sessions where staff can provide feedback to the management.\nEMPOWERED TO DEVELOP PROFESSIONALLY \nExposure to a variety of professional development opportunities empowers NFC’s staff to become thought leaders in their field.\n34-year-old Ms Rita Lim joined NFC as an English teacher in 2009 as she was drawn to its mission to make quality child development and care services accessible to working families, including those from disadvantage backgrounds.\nShe has since experienced an exciting, progressive and varied career. In 2013, she helmed My First Skool as a principal for six years before joining NFC’s headquarters, where she now works as an assistant manager at the child support services department.\nPart of Ms Lim’s work involves managing a joint three-year research project with the National Institute of Education to study the effects of NFC’s Child Support Model, a testament to the wide range of professional development opportunities available for the company’s staff.\nThe NFC Child Support Model is a three-pronged approach aimed at supporting the well-being and learning of children from low-income families and children with learning needs.\nMs Lim said: “When I first joined NFC, I never thought I would one day be doing research management. Initially, I was a bit worried about managing the project as I wasn’t sure if I was up to mark.\xa0\n""However, I was given support and guidance as the project went along. The empowerment the organisation has given me as well as my bosses’ feedback and guidance have been very helpful.”\nFor Ms Hu, the exposure to various learning and training opportunities at every stage of her career has enabled her to grow professionally from a teacher to a centre principal.\nHer training opportunities have gone beyond Singapore. She attended overseas training in Hungary when she was a senior teacher and the experience and exposure helped to enhance her teaching.\n“I also attended overseas learning trips to Bali and Australia to gain more insights into sustainable education and nature pedagogy, which are in line with Early Childhood Development Agency’s focus on outdoor learning,” she added.\nFor Ms Wu, having the opportunity to lead and champion new initiatives at work has been immensely fulfilling.\n“There is space for staff to try new things, which leads to a greater sense of achievement and empowerment. I was given the opportunity to help the team adopt a digital marketing automation platform as well as pick up digital marketing skills,” said Ms Wu.\nPROMOTING PERSONAL GROWTH AND WELL-BEING\nBeyond work and professional skills, NFC also offers support for employees’ personal self-improvement, welfare and well-being.\nOn the personal front, Ms Wu, a mother of two, shared that she received invaluable tips from her teaching colleagues on how to support her children’s learning and development. Her children are aged five and 10.\n“From making learning fun to dealing with picky eaters, I’ve picked up so many tips from my colleagues,” she said.\nAs a working mother of two children aged four-and-a-half and six years, Ms Lim said NFC’s family-friendly policies have helped her maintain good work-life balance.\nOne of the benefits offered is the family care leave scheme, which allows staff to take leave to care for family members such as their spouse and parents. There are also regular sponsorships for interest workshops to encourage staff to explore interests beyond their profession, such as leather crafting.\nNFC’s commitment to staff well-being shone through during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMs Hu shared that during the Circuit Breaker period, the company conducted exercise workshops to motivate staff to stay physically healthy.\xa0\nMs Lim said she was touched when her boss expressed concern after sensing she was pushing herself too hard during the Circuit Breaker period.\n“My boss was very understanding and encouraged me to take some days off to spend time with my children. I appreciate that she takes an interest in my family life and has the view that life is not only about work,” she said.\nA CAREER THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GROW AND GIVE BACK TO SOCIETY \nReflecting on their journey at NFC, the three professionals shared that they hope to continue to contribute to the organisation’s early childhood education model and create an environment that provides children from all walks of life with a nurturing, happy childhood.\nMs Wu said: “I hope to contribute by looking into the digital learning landscape for the preschool sector and see how we can better bridge the digital divide for families.”\nDrawing on her own experience, Ms Hu said support and trust at work are crucial for individuals looking into a career in early childhood education.\n“In NFC, support is always provided and you will have a platform to share your opinions. It is a place where I’ve grown positively as an educator and developed great teamwork with my colleagues,” she said.\nMs Lim believes the best way to give back to society is to build the next generation by giving children a high-quality education. “If you are looking for a career that allows you to give back to society, NFC is the place for you,” she said.\nEmbark on a rewarding career by being part of the NTUC First Campus’ way of life.

      Commentary: Watching foreign-language TV during COVID-19 can help you learn a new language
  </h1>, 'text': 'ONTARIO: With university classrooms and language schools closed because of the pandemic, language students must find new ways to practise and improve.\xa0\nIn recent years, an increasing number of applied linguists have been advocating regular TV viewing to learn English.\nResearch shows that\xa0students are motivated to learn language through watching foreign language television programs.\xa0\nIn the world of professional sports,\xa0baseball players,\xa0ice-hockey players\xa0and\xa0football managers\xa0have also claimed that television was a key resource for their language development.\nSurprisingly, television has played a relatively small role in the language learning classroom. Our research has shown that students learn new words\xa0and phrases\xa0through watching television, and the amount of learning may be similar to what is\xa0learned through reading.\nSUBBED VS DUBBED\nThere is now increasing evidence that language learners can improve their\xa0comprehension skills,\xa0pronunciation\xa0and\xa0grammar\xa0through watching TV.\nResearch reveals that language learners who frequently watch foreign-language TV programs outside of school tend to be\xa0better at reading, listening and vocabulary.\xa0\nThis holds for language learners in primary schools, secondary schools, at university and even for young kids who have not had any English lessons yet. TV has also proven beneficial for\xa0children with more than one language to improve their English-language skills.\nA survey by the European Commission on the use of subtitles to encourage language learning and improve the mastery of foreign languages showed that\xa0regions that use subtitles to make foreign-language TV shows and movies accessible\xa0— like Sweden, Denmark or Flanders — have substantial benefits in terms of language learning compared to dubbing countries, like France or Germany, because subtitles are more widely available, and in more languages, than dubbing.\nAlthough research indicates that\xa0simply watching television programs may contribute to second language learning, initially television may be challenging for people to understand and enjoy.\xa0\nThis is perhaps the reason why books and articles, which can be easily written or simplified according to the level of students, are recommended and used much more often for learning.\nTV WATCHING FOR LANGUAGE LEARNING\nThe following principles were designed to\xa0optimise the potential of television for learning\xa0and encourage students to continue learning with television.\nFirst, the aim of television viewing in a second language should be the same as in the first language: to inform and enjoy. It is not necessary that every word, sentence or phrase is understood.\xa0\nThe goal should be to have an understanding sufficient to motivate further viewing. Comprehension should improve over time with greater exposure to spoken input.\nSecond, regular TV viewing is central to learning. We tend to make very small gains through encountering input, but these gains can become meaningful as they accumulate through encountering more and more input.\xa0\nThis means that we learn very little through watching TV for an hour but can make great gains through viewing a large amount of television. For second language learning, binge watching programs is a good thing!\nThird, because understanding television will be difficult initially, it is important to use strategies to support learning.\nFor example, students might try to progress from viewing episodes initially with first-language subtitles, then with second-language subtitles, and finally without subtitles to support their comprehension.\nAnother way to boost comprehension is to watch the same episode multiple times, because research shows that comprehension and language learning increase through repeated viewing\xa0of the same content.\nMany parents might recognise that their children have learned new words and phrases through viewing the same movies again and again.\nA final strategy is watching one program in sequence from the first episode. Sequential or “narrow viewing” will improve our understanding of subsequent episodes, because we quickly gain knowledge of the characters, their relationships and story arcs as they develop.\xa0\nBy following these principles, students may achieve greater success in language learning with television.\nIS TELEVISION THE ONLY OPTION?\nThere are many useful ways to learn a second language on your own during the pandemic. Language can be learned doing exercises from coursebooks and online apps, as well as through reading, listening, viewing and even playing video games.\nExposure to language plays a large role in vocabulary development and students should be encouraged to learn from whichever source of input they enjoy. Exposure to large amounts of input will promote learning, so watching lots of second-language television has value.\nWhile we are inside during the pandemic, why not embrace television for both education and enjoyment. Learning a second language provides you with a good excuse.\nStuart Webb is Professor of Applied Linguistics at Western University in Ontario, Canada. Elke Peters is Associate Professor at the Research group of Language, Education, & Society, at KU Leuven.\xa0This commentary first appeared in The Conversation.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Entertainment ', '     education ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: Sending international students home will hurt the US more than benefit it
  </h1>, 'text': 'BALTIMORE, Maryland: US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, made a\xa0decision\xa0on Jul 6 regarding international students in the US that will affect far more than just the roughly\xa0870,000\xa0international students themselves.\nBased on\xa0what I know\xa0about the power and influence of higher education in the US, this decision could increase the tuition American students pay, cost thousands of jobs throughout the nation and erode America’s stature in the world.\nUnder this new rule, international students may stay in the country only if they attend a college or university offering in-person classes this fall. Otherwise, they won’t be able to get visas, enter the country or stay here if they plan to attend one of the many schools that are teaching students entirely online.\nIn effect, thousands of students from other countries who attend schools that do not plan any in-person instruction this fall may have to immediately transfer to another school or leave the country. Otherwise, they could face deportation.\nAgainst the backdrop of what top US public health officials describe as an\xa0out-of-control virus, this new immigration rule puts US colleges in a jam.\nSchools must choose between bringing students together on campus to comply with the immigration restrictions, or adhere to public health precautions related to physical distancing.\nIt may be hard to do both if the online option is off the table when it comes to international students.\nWhich means US colleges and universities could take a significant financial hit in the form of lost tuition revenue beyond what they were anticipating as a result of COVID-19.\nCOLLEGES MUST SCRAMBLE \nAs of Jul 6, more than 1,000 colleges and universities have already released\xa0plans for fall instruction. Of those, 60 per cent currently plan to offer in-person classes, 24 per cent plan to offer hybrid and 9 per cent plan to offer courses online. The remaining colleges are still undecided.\nNow, some institutions will have to scramble to develop alternatives that can enable international students to remain enrolled without breaking the new rule. Schools must\xa0report how they plan to proceed by Aug 1, based on the ICE announcement.\nFAR-REACHING IMPACT\nThe impact of this rule is not just limited to the\xa0hundreds of thousands\xa0of international students enrolled at US colleges, who represent\xa04.39 per cent of the 20 million\xa0people who currently attend US colleges and universities. It also affects their institutions, their faculty and the local communities as well.\nConsider that colleges and universities, which are the\xa0largest employers in one in five states, are already reeling from\xa0heavy financial losses\xa0associated with the pandemic.\nWhile many schools have had to slash budgets due to\xa0refunds issued to students\xa0in the spring of 2020,\xa0disruptions to research,\xa0cancelled athletic events\xa0and\xa0cuts to state funding, others are still waiting to see whether or not they will meet their\xa0enrolment targets for fall.\nStill, more than 200 colleges and universities have already announced\xa0layoffs, furloughs or contract non-renewals.\nAt a time when the US is trying to overcome\xa0record unemployment\xa0and manage its biggest\xa0public health crisis\xa0in a century, international students seem to be caught in the middle of a\xa0partisan divide\xa0on reopening the country.\nThe new guidelines could place many colleges and universities in an impossible position: Increase the number of in-person classes and risk that COVID-19 will spread further.\nWHAT THEY BRING TO THE TABLE\nGiven how much international students contribute to the economy, you might assume ICE would find a way to keep them in the US.\nThe students affected by the new rule are the same people who help\xa0support about 460,000 American jobs.\nThe\xa0higher tuition and fees\xa0they pay helps keep tuition lower for American students.

      Commentary: We have much to learn from COVID-19 and the lockdowns
  </h1>, 'text': 'CAMBRIDGE: As with so much else, international development has been severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. How might we use these lessons to reshape the sector, rather than returning to the status quo?\nFor starters, the crisis has reminded us that nature still reigns supreme, and it should spur us to step up efforts to mitigate and adapt to other systemic threats, particularly climate change, which will continue to be the biggest threat to development.\nAccording to the Climate Impact Lab, global warming could lead to as many as 1.5 million excess deaths per year in India by 2100, rivalling the toll of all infectious diseases combined.\nIn addition to applying our current scientific knowledge to existing problems – from improving environmental auditing to deploying flood-resistant varieties of rice – we need to accelerate innovations that reduce carbon dioxide emissions and pollution, help communities adapt to climate change, and provide access to clean energy.\nAnd, most important, we must pilot and evaluate new initiatives, and scale those with the biggest impact.\nMORE THAN AN ILLNESS\nThe pandemic has also taught us that public health is about more than physical illnesses.\nFor many people – particularly in developing countries – staying home simply isn’t a safe option.\nDomestic violence, including both physical and emotional abuse, is expected to rise sharply as a result of lockdowns. Extended periods of isolation could exacerbate anxiety, depression, and other related mental health conditions.\nAnd those battling addictions are struggling to get the support they need. Rather than hoping these problems will simply disappear whenever the lockdowns are lifted - they won’t - we should acknowledge that mental health has long been a neglected issue in policy debates.\nGOVERNMENTS ARE CRUCIAL\nYet another lesson from the crisis is that there can be no substitute for government.\nOver the past decade, many international funders and development organisations have tried to bypass governments, owing to concerns about corruption or red tape.\xa0\nBut the pandemic has made clear that governments are the leading actors when it comes to containing infectious diseases, administering development policies, providing social protection to the unemployed, and alleviating poverty.\nThat is why we at MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) have focused on building long-term partnerships with governments and are now supporting them in scaling up evidence-based policies.\nGovernments also need to be able to transfer cash to vulnerable citizens quickly.\nWhile the United States and other advanced economies have managed to transfer emergency funds directly to their citizens, many other countries that have introduced household stimulus checks, cash transfers, or other social protections have failed to deliver them to those who need support the most.\nClearly, these countries need to rethink how they identify the poorest individuals, so that they can provide them with digital forms of identity and other requisites of financial inclusion. In the future, these will be the key components of the social safety net for countries at all stages of development.\nDIGITAL ACCESS FOR EDUCATION\nAnother critical issue is education.\nAlthough learning is possible outside of physical schools, the pandemic is sure to set back education for many children. Helping them keep up is thus an urgent priority.\nWith schools closed, the obvious response is to pursue Internet-based teaching. Research shows that software allowing students to move at their own pace can be effective.\nBut remote learning obviously isn’t an option for students who lack Internet access, have special needs, or share one computer or phone among many family members.\nThese children’s educations have effectively been put on hold during the pandemic, as was already the case for many of the world’s refugees, over half of whom are children. It will be crucial to help these children catch up when the time comes.\nHere, research shows that intensive, repeated “learning camps” in which students are grouped at their current learning level, rather than by age or grade, can be immensely helpful.\nREACHING OUT TO THE MOST VULNERABLE\nFrom Brazil’s favelas and India’s migrant caravans to France’s banlieues and communities of colour in the US, it is the poor who have borne the brunt of COVID-19’s health, economic, and psychological costs.\nBut reaching those most in need of useful information is a major challenge, because conventional media channels can go only so far, and misinformation is rife on social media.\nThus, researchers are testing whether recruiting well-connected individuals or “influencers” would ensure that messages are disseminated reliably through pre-existing social networks.\nIn the meantime, the pandemic has pushed policymakers everywhere to experiment with different strategies for encouraging social distancing, hand washing, and other infection-prevention measures.\nThey could consider making some of the existing cash transfers conditional on healthy behaviour, as research has found this to be an effective way to mitigate the spread of the virus and improve overall health.\nThis is another strategy that need not be limited to the current crisis. For example, in non-pandemic times, receiving cash disbursements could depend on whether one’s children have been vaccinated or had an annual check-up.\nPolicies that encourage healthier lifestyles have become increasingly urgent, given the rising threat from largely preventable non-communicable diseases, which already kill more than 40 million people worldwide each year.\nIn the absence of in-person data collection during the lockdown, many social science researchers have shifted to using administrative data.\nThe data that governments and non-governmental organisations already collect could be enormously useful in testing the efficacy of new programs. J-PAL’s Innovations in Data and Experiments for Action (IDEA) Initiative, for example, is building partnerships to help governments improve their use of administrative data.\nThe crisis has also forced many research projects to collect data through phone surveys.\xa0\nAgain, lessons learned from this work will inform research that uses phone surveys for data collection well into the future, enabling governments and NGOs to gather much more accurate information in real time from the communities they serve.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is the largest synchronised shock the world has experienced in generations. But this crisis will not be the last of its kind.\nWe urgently need to learn as much as we can from the current experience and adapt international development practices and research accordingly. We must not allow ourselves to be caught off-guard again.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nIqbal Dhaliwal is Global Executive Director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).

      Schools in Malaysia to reopen on Jul 15 for those not taking leaving examinations
  </h1>, 'text': 'PUTRAJAYA: Primary and secondary school students in Malaysia will return to schools beginning July 15, said Senior Minister and Education Minister Mohd Radzi Md Jidin\xa0on Wednesday (Jul 1).\xa0\nSchools have the option to reopen with single, dual or rotational sessions to ensure social distancing, he said.\xa0\n“For secondary schools, Form 1 to Form 4 students as well as those in Remove classes will return to schools next Wednesday, Jul 15.\xa0\n“For primary schools, those in Year 5 and Year 6 will return to schools on Wednesday, Jul 15, while the reopening date for students in Year 1 to Year 4 is Wednesday, Jul 22,” he added.\xa0\nRemove classes are for students who need to spend an additional year on transition classes before they can attend Form 1.\nSchools in Malaysia were ordered to close since mid-March and lessons were moved online when Putrajaya enforced the movement control order (MCO) to curb the spread of COVID-19.\nFollowing the easing of most MCO measures as the COVID-19 situation improved, secondary schools have earlier reopened on Jun 24 for students taking their school leaving examinations.\xa0\nThe ministry had then said that students in other educational levels would return to schools in stages.\xa0\nHaving taken the school closure into consideration, the school calendar for 2020 has also been amended to reduce the number of school holidays.\xa0\nOn Wednesday, Dr Mohd Radzi said the ministry has identified three models of operation for schools to reopen fully.\xa0\nThe first model will see schools opening with one session, provided they can accommodate all students with social distancing measures in place.\xa0\nThe second model - dual session - is for schools that are unable to house all students in one session.\xa0\nThe third model is a\xa0rotational model for schools that do not have enough space to accommodate all students in two sessions.\xa0\n“For this rotational model, the learning method is hybrid, which is face-to-face in schools during school days, and home-based learning on days they are not scheduled to attend schools,” the minister\xa0explained.\xa0\nThe model to be employed by each school will be known a week before schools reopen, he added.\xa0\nThe senior minister said the ministry acknowledged the weaknesses in implementing online learning, as it is a new approach to teachers, students and parents.\xa0\n“In addition, many of the students could not participate in online learning due to limited access to communication technology.

      Hoping to rebound from COVID-19, Johnson sets out school building plan
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out plans for a 10-year rebuilding programme for schools in England on Monday (Jun 29), part of government efforts to help Britain ""bounce back"" from the coronavirus crisis.\nJohnson, whose popularity has flagged over his government\'s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, will make a speech on Tuesday to set out an infrastructure programme, allowing him to return to election pledges that helped him win a large majority.\nMuch of the new spending will be targeted at those areas in northern and central England that had traditionally supported the main opposition Labour Party, but where many voters backed the governing Conservatives at last year\'s election.\nRebuilding schools, which have suffered over the years from government spending cuts, will be his first step, with funding targeted at the buildings in the worst condition in England, especially in northern and central regions.\n""As we bounce back from the pandemic, it\'s important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed, with our younger generations front and centre of this mission,"" Johnson said in a statement.\nThe rebuilding programme will start in 2020-2021 with the first 50 projects and will be supported by more than £1 billion pounds (US$1.23 billion) in funding, the government said, adding that £560 million and £200 million would go to repairs and upgrades to schools and further education colleges respectively this year.\nIt said the £560 million\xa0for school repairs and upgrades was on top of more than £1.4 billion in school condition funding committed in 2020-2021, and that the £200 million would bring forward plans announced by the finance minister.\n""This major new investment will make sure our schools and colleges are fit for the future, with better facilities and brand new buildings so that every child gets a world-class education,"" Johnson said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     United Kingdom ', '     schools ', '     education ']}"

      Home-based learning should be 'a regular part of school life’, possibly once a fortnight: Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Home-based learning should be made a “regular part” of school life to complement classroom teaching, said Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung on Sunday (Jun 28).\xa0\n“Perhaps once a fortnight, there can be an HBL (home-based learning) day,” said Mr Ong.\n“It can be done at home, or in school. The HBL day should not be packed with lessons and curriculum teaching, nor should it be a free-for-all where the student does whatever he wishes.”\nMr Ong was speaking to teachers and leaders in education for the opening of the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) annual workplan seminar, where he highlighted four areas of focus for the ministry.\nIn a video message posted on Facebook, he said some students have told him that they liked having home-based learning.\n“I asked why, and they said that they could learn at their own pace, pose questions to the teachers in private – no peer pressure,” said Mr Ong, noting that students, teachers and parents went through “an unexpected crash course” in home-based learning during the COVID-19 “circuit breaker” period.\xa0\n“Like all lessons and courses, we learn most when we adopt a mentality of humility. When we do, we will accept that HBL can be a useful mode of education delivery, because it encourages more independent, self-directed learning,” Mr Ong added. “This is one of the most important lifelong skills.”\nNoting that home-based learning cannot be a full substitute for school, Mr Ong said: “The sensible thing to do is to complement classroom teaching with HBL and make HBL a permanent and regular feature of education.”\nHome-based learning would be most useful with “a looser structure”, said Mr Ong, to allow students time to read on their own and explore topics outside of the curriculum.\xa0\nDIGITAL LITERACY \nThe COVID-19 outbreak had\xa0highlighted another challenge for schools – many students did not have the necessary devices for home-based learning, said Mr Ong.\nThis prompted the ministry to bring forward its earlier plans to equip secondary school students with a digital device.\nAll secondary school students will now get a personal laptop or tablet for learning by next year, seven years ahead of the original target of 2028.\nIn his video message on Sunday, Mr Ong noted that schools loaned out over 20,000 digital devices and more than 1,600 dongles to students for home-based learning.\xa0\n“Now that we have bridged the acceptance gap of online learning, it is time to also close the digital divide,” he added.\xa0\nThe education ministry will use bulk tenders to keep the devices affordable, at about “several hundred dollars” each, said Mr Ong.\xa0\nAs announced at this year’s Committee of Supply debates in March, students will get a top up in their Edusave accounts to help them buy the devices. Students on financial assistance schemes will receive further subsidies so that their\xa0out-of-pocket expense is zero.\nFor students without a Wi-Fi subscription at home, MOE will also work with the Infocomm Media Development Authority to help them get free subscriptions, added Mr Ong.\xa0\nHELPING STUDENTS FROM VULNERABLE BACKGROUNDS\nFor students from vulnerable backgrounds, the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the challenges they face, said Mr Ong.\n“When schools close, they suffer the most. During the circuit breaker, when agencies and charity organisations tried to render assistance to the students, we faced challenges. With most of them being at home, we couldn’t give them a meal in school,” he said.\nMr Ong noted that when the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund tried to give these students money to buy food, many of them did not have bank accounts to receive the transfer of money.\nThe MOE\xa0later found in a survey that one-third of primary one students do not have bank accounts.\xa0\n“This highlighted another imperative: We need to do more to ensure greater financial inclusion, from young. Digital and financial literacy are synergistic. E-payments are becoming more common – in time, may be the default,” said the minister.\n“To be an active participant of the future economy, you need to be both digitally and financially plugged-in.”\nWhile most students have a bank account by secondary school, some students on financial assistance “fall through the cracks”, Mr Ong added.\xa0\n“We should have a safety net to catch these students, to make sure that they are financially plugged in.”\xa0\nEven though every Singaporean baby is given a Child Development Account (CDA), where the S$3,000 First Step Grant is credited to, not all parents activate the account, said Mr Ong.\nHe added that MOE is reaching out to these parents to encourage them to activate the account and access the grant, which can be used to pay for pre-school fees or medical expenses.\nSecond Minister for Education Indranee Rajah is also getting donors and charity organisations to help top up the CDA account of children from lower-income backgrounds, said Mr Ong.\n“That way, they can take better advantage of the dollar-for-dollar matching from (the) Government.”\xa0\nThe ministry also wants to equip every child with a bank account, Mr Ong said, adding that offering parents the convenience of opening a Child Savings Account at the same time when they open the CDA “makes sense”.\nThe account will operate like a regular personal bank account, with no minimum balance requirement, fees or charges, he added.\n""We will explore options to equip the CSA with digital enablers, like PayNow and SingPass,” said Mr Ong, adding that parents can opt out of the savings account if they do not need it.\xa0\nWith bank accounts and e-payments, it will be “a lot easier” for students to receive awards or financial assistance payouts, said the Education Minister, adding that safeguards will be in place to help families manage the saving accounts.\xa0\nINTER-DISCIPLINARY LEARNING\xa0\nLastly, a “bigger transformative push” is needed to expand inter-disciplinary learning in tertiary institutes, said Mr Ong.\xa0\nWhile older generations believed that a good tertiary qualification could see them through their careers, children today are “growing up in a different world”.\xa0\n“Technology is advancing rapidly, industries are ever-changing. Solving big challenges like climate change or social inequality requires expertise that spans across disciplinary boundaries,” he said.\n“In time, when they step into the workforce, they will already be wondering what skills and knowledge they need a year or two later. COVID-19 will reset the competitive playing field, and accelerate these trends.”\xa0\nIn response, institutes of higher learning are moving towards inter-disciplinary learning, but “they all agreed that bolder moves are needed”, said Mr Ong.\xa0\nFor example, the National University of Singapore (NUS) plans to pilot 10 inter-disciplinary undergraduate programmes, or Cross-disciplinary Degree Programmes (CDPs), in the academic year of 2021/2022.\xa0\nSome possible pairings of complementary disciplines include economics and data science, computing and project management, as well as engineering and business, said the university in a separate press release.\xa0\nTo graduate, a student needs to complete the same number of credits needed for a four-year Bachelor with Honours degree programme. However, the credits will be spread out among fundamentals for each of the two majors, projects integrating both majors, general education modules and unrestricted electives.\xa0\nThis programme is different from traditional double degree or double major programmes, where students acquire in-depth knowledge in two distinct disciplines. The new cross-disciplinary approach “breaks down the boundaries of two disciplines and focuses on the integration of these disciplines”, said the university.\xa0\nSenior deputy president and provost of NUS Professor Ho Teck Hua said: “We believe that this novel cross-disciplinary model will enable our graduates to not just meet market demands, but to have mastery of a unique set of skills which they themselves have created.”\nNUS is working with faculties and schools to implement the CDPs, and more details will be available by the end of the year, it said in the press release.\xa0\nThe other universities and polytechnics are also starting similar reviews of its curriculum structures, said Mr Ong.\nThe four initiatives announced on Sunday are MOE\'s way of “rolling with the COVID-19 punches”, said Mr Ong in closing his message.\n“COVID-19 is a devastating global event - but we have a choice about how we emerge from it, bloodied but unbowed.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON:\xa0British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday (Jun 19)\xa0said English schools would receive £1 billion (US$1.2 billion) in funding to help pupils catch up after missing months of classes due to the coronavirus.\nThe financial boost comes as his government faces withering criticism over its broken pledge to have all primary school children back for a month before the summer holidays.\nIt is also struggling to get all pupils back for the new academic year in September if social distancing rules requiring people to keep two metres apart remain in force.\nThe new money includes £650 million for state-run primary and secondary schools to ""lift educational outcomes"", and £350 million for a tutoring scheme specifically for the most disadvantaged youngsters.\nHeadteachers will be able to decide how to spend the £650 million, but the government said it expects it to be spent ""on evidence-based interventions"", in particular small group tuition.\n""This £1 billion catch-up package will help headteachers to provide extra support to children who have fallen behind while out of school,"" Johnson said.\nBritish schools have been closed to most pupils since late March, when the country headed into lockdown as the virus spread out of control.\nSome primary school year groups were able to come back earlier this month, but the government backtracked on the remainder and some older students returning amid staff shortages and social distancing concerns.\nJohnson is under growing pressure to relax the rules to one metre to make it easier for schools and hospitality businesses to restart.\nIn Northern Ireland, most pupils are set for a return in the autumn after the devolved government agreed Thursday to cut the social distancing measure to one metre for pupils in school.\n""I am determined to do everything I can to get all children back in school from September, and we will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible,"" Johnson said.\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government also hopes to allow providers running holiday clubs and activities for children over the summer to open ""if the science allows"".\n""Guidance will be provided to the sector on how to implement the protective measures necessary to open safely, and to parents on how to minimise the spread of the virus if they choose to attend,"" he added.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Britain ', '     education ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Schools to resume CCAs gradually, PE group activities limited to 5 students per group
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Schools will try to resume co-curricular activities (CCAs) gradually and ensure safe distancing measures are in place even during physical education (PE) classes, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Wednesday (Jun 17).\nPrimary, secondary and junior college students will return to school every day from Jun 29, while university, polytechnic and other institute of higher learning students will return progressively to their campuses.\xa0\nSchools reopened on Jun 2\xa0following the end of the ""circuit breaker"" period, with graduating students attending school every day\xa0and other students rotating between home-based learning and going to school every week.\xa0\nOn Monday, the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce announced that Singapore will move into Phase 2 of its reopening from Jun 19.\xa0\nWith students returning to school every day, the Education Ministry intends to ""gradually bring back"" CCAs,\xa0which are “essential elements of school experiences”, it said.\n“Schools will try to restart CCAs that can be conducted by coaches, instructors or CCA teachers through digital means. Such activities include\xa0dance, art and robotics,” said MOE.\xa0\nFor activities that are better conducted face-to-face, schools are looking at\xa0doing so at a class level, meaning students may not be participating in an\xa0activity that is their original CCA choice.\n""Schools won’t resume CCA activities as we know it,"" Education Minister Ong Ye Kung\xa0said in a Facebook post.\xa0\n""This may be a new experience for some students, as they may not be doing an activity of their original CCA choice. But they will get to learn something new, as a class.""\nMINIMAL PHYSICAL CONTACT DURING PE CLASSES\nFor PE classes, schools will allow group activities and small-sided games that involve minimal physical contact, including badminton, table-tennis, volleyball and sepak takraw, with a limit of five students per group.\xa0\n""This may require some creative change in game formats and rules,"" said MOE.\nSchools will continue with their safe management measures, such as daily temperature-taking and visual screening for students and staff, the ministry added. Those who are unwell,\xa0or have household members on quarantine order, stay-home notices\xa0or who have flu-like symptoms, must not come to school, it said.\xa0\nStudents will continue to wipe down tables and shared equipment after use, and high-touch surfaces will be cleaned frequently. School premises will also be disinfected daily, said MOE.\xa0\nIntermingling across classes and levels will be reduced, with fixed exam-style seating and staggered arrival, dismissal and recess timings. Students will sit in spaced seating arrangements in canteens where possible, and fixed groups of up to five students from the same class will also be allowed.\xa0\nStudents and staff are required to wear masks, but in situations where the wearing of masks “may not be practical”, they may wear face shields instead. For example, this would apply to students with health conditions, said MOE.\xa0\nHaving all students back in school at the same time is a ""significant step"", said Mr Ong.\xa0\n""So, we will not ease the restrictions on other fronts such as PE and CCAs too much. We will take careful incremental steps,"" he added.\nThe minister also said that home-based tuition can resume, subject to a cap of five visitors at any time while maintaining a 1m safe distance where possible.\xa0\nMasks must be worn by the tutor and students.\nTemperature screening and health declarations should be conducted, Mr Ong said, adding that home-based tutors must also use the SafeEntry system to support contact tracing.\nUNIVERSITIES, POLYTECHNICS TO GRADUALLY RESUME CLASSES\nUniversities, polytechnics and other institutes of higher learning will also progressively increase the number of students allowed back on campus at any one time for face-to-face learning, “while maintaining a significant amount of online learning”, the Education Ministry said.\nClasses and consultations with no more than 50 people can now gradually resume on campus, said MOE, but all large-scale classes and lectures will continue to be held online.\xa0\nSelected student activities, including project work discussions, fitness training and face-to-face counselling may resume gradually, and will be subject to the necessary safe management measures with at least 1m distance between individuals and with no more than 50 people in a venue.\xa0\n“As of now, large-scale orientation activities will not be possible, but some smaller-scale activities can proceed, with safe management measures in place. These can include briefings, campus tours and non-contact ice-breaking activities,” said the ministry.\xa0\nAll students, staff, vendors and visitors will be required to check in and out using SafeEntry when entering or leaving the campus. Temperature and symptom screening will also be carried out at the entrances.\xa0\nStudents and staff will be required to wear masks at all times, but teaching staff “have the option” of wearing face shields “in specific teaching settings”.\xa0\nTo reduce intermingling between students on campus, the institutes of higher learning will stagger the start and end timings for lessons, with fixed seating and safe distancing in teaching venues where applicable.\xa0\n""While our schools and institutes of higher learning\xa0will continue to implement safe management measures, it remains essential that each one of us exercises social responsibility through maintaining good personal hygiene and safe distancing measures – wash our hands regularly, wear a mask and see a doctor immediately when we are sick,"" said MOE.\xa0\n""As a reminder, staff and students should stay at home if you or a family member living in the same household is unwell.

      Navigating taboos, parents grapple with sexual stirrings of children with special needs
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Jacqueline Ang’s eldest daughter was 10 years old when it happened for the first time.\nThe girl was at home lying on the floor, her body trembling. After a while, she got frustrated and cried.\n“What was she doing?” wondered Ang, who could not imagine at first that her daughter was trying to masturbate. It was also not something she could ask her daughter, whose severe form of autism meant she was non-verbal.\nAfter observing the girl for a period of time, however, her actions became apparent.\n“She’d put her hands at her private parts, and then she’d even try to put things at her private parts,” recounts Ang, 44. “Eventually, she also did it at school. So the teacher also saw it.”\nThe girl’s younger twin sister followed suit a year later.\nBoth of them were diagnosed with a similar form of autism when they were two and a half years old. Now at the age of 18, they have the intellectual development of two-year-olds.\nIn taking care of their special needs growing up, it had not crossed Ang’s mind that she would have to confront the issue of sexuality in a special way too.\n“I thought it would just come naturally and they’d adapt to it naturally, and that was it,” she says. “As parents, we always focused on ... whether they could go to school (or) take care of their own daily living.”\nBut when puberty struck, this conservative mother had to find ways to support their sexual development while coming up against the taboo around the topic.\nIt was only last year when the Disabled People’s Association (DPA) organised its first sexuality workshop for people with mental and physical disabilities, and their carers.\nThe event was a small one and not publicly promoted. But that was when Ang saw that she was not alone in trying to get a handle on sexuality in youngsters with autism.\nShe also found practical advice to put into action — all part of a journey she has learnt to embrace.\nTHREATS DIDN’T WORK\nWhen her eldest daughter started masturbating at school, Ang’s first reaction was to threaten her if she did not stop, for example by taking out the cane to scare her.\n“That’s how we were brought up,” says the mother of three. “When we didn’t behave, our parents punished us, and then we’d fear the punishment (and) not do the behaviour.”\nThat approach, however, quickly got her nowhere.\n“I realised that it wasn’t effective ... The more we scolded her, in fact, (the more) her emotions just broke. The meltdowns were very frequent. Then we also got frustrated,” she recounts.\nShe decided to bring the subject up during a yearly assessment with the paediatrician. The advice she got was to guide her daughter to a private setting and “give her space because she needs to have that space”.\nAng hoped that the issue would go away, but it got to a point where, with both twins trying to masturbate, she had to deal with it daily.\nWATCH: Sexuality and my teenage children with autism (7:25)\n“I think the more we tried to stop (it), the more they’d come back (to it),” she says. “When they ... didn\'t get to do what they\'d wanted to do, they\'d scream, cry, and we could see that they were frustrated.\n“Even if you gave them toys, food, things that we could give usually, they wouldn’t calm down.”\nThey also tried to masturbate in public, the effect of which went beyond their parents having to face “embarrassing moments”.\n“We wouldn’t feel like wanting to go out, until maybe months later that we manage to pick up the courage,” says Ang, who works at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\n“Because every single time we go out, it requires a lot of planning, especially if we\'re going to new places and we know that they’re going to have new experiences. And we don’t know how they’d react.”\nShe went online to look for more information, but what she found was “very general and (scratching the) surface”. The only solution, it seemed to her, was to give her twins space.\nIt was hard for her to speak to other parents — who seemed to share their experiences only if they had boys, and not girls, with special needs — or even to her husband and other family members.\n“I also had a mental block. As Asians, we’re very shy of talking about such things,” she says.\n“But over the years ... I realised that I shouldn’t stop them but see what ways I can help them to cope with it. But honestly speaking, I just thought, ‘But I don’t know how.’”\nThe best she could do, besides giving them space, was to buy bolsters and big soft toys for them to hug for comfort.\nPRONE TO MISCONCEPTION\nRelationship counsellor and clinical sexologist Martha Tara Lee acknowledges that it is only human for parents of youngsters with special needs to react in the way Ang first did when her twins tried to express their sexuality.\n“Parents are just trying to do what they can, based on what they know,” says Lee, referring to the tendency to punish.\n“Besides deterrence, I think it’s also avoidance, like ‘I don’t want to deal with this — maybe this is just a one-time thing’. But if it goes on for a long period of time, then it can become a habit.”\nHence it is important that youngsters with special needs “learn the difference between public and personal space”. For carers to teach these things, however, it would help to change their misconceptions first.\n“We just assume people with disability don’t think about sex (or) have sexual needs,” cites Lee, who attributes this to a lack of representation of people with disabilities in popular media.\n“With people with mental disability, they may not understand what’s going on, but ... as they come into puberty, they find themselves getting horny. They may find themselves getting erections (or) having wet dreams.\nIf nobody explains all these to them, then they may feel confused (or) scared.\nDPA advocacy lead Sumita Kunashakaran agrees that carers are often taken aback because these sexual awakenings “seem to come out of nowhere”.\nShe also thinks these are hard conversations for parents to have because of “the environment that we’re in”, where the topic of sex and “what healthy sexual relationships look like” is “culturally sensitive”.\nFor this story, CNA Insider had reached out to other parents too, and all declined to talk.\nDiscussing sex is not something that is often done for people with mental disabilities even in clinical settings, acknowledges psychiatrist Chong Siow Ann, the Institute of Mental Health’s vice chairman of its Medical Board (Research).\n“To be honest, sexuality is rarely discussed during clinical consultations with mental health patients, unless it’s in the context of some specific sexual disorder or as a possible side effect of some of the medications we prescribe,” he says.\n“The normal and natural sexual interests and desires of people with serious mental illness don\'t often seem as important or even relevant, and are usually submerged by other clinical priorities.”\nSEX ED FOR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS\nIn schools, mainstream sex education for students with special needs focuses a lot on personal hygiene and care rather than emotions and relationships, says Kunashakaran.\n“For example, for females, what do you do when having your period, how do you put on a pad, how you use a pad, when you should change it, how often you should wash your private areas,” cites the 32-year-old.\nIt’s helpful, but I don’t think that’s the be-all and end-all of the conversation.\nThe Ministry of Education started a pilot in sexuality education in six special education (Sped) schools in 2013.\nIn 2015, the ministry also awarded a S$24,000 tender to a company to develop a guide to help Sped schools design programmes in personal safety and relationships — amid growing concern over youngsters becoming sexually active and lacking a good understanding of consent.\nResearch overseas has shown that without proper guidance, people with developmental disabilities are more likely to be sexually exploited than others.\nThis is one of the reasons disability organisations in Singapore also run sexual education programmes.\n“Most of them tend to focus on what’s appropriate behaviour in public, what’s safe (and) what are unsafe touches,” says Kunashakaran. She sees a need, however, for “a lot more of an in-depth conversation” on relationships.\n“(Sex education) is very much about how you can address (your feeling or urges) in a safe manner, whether for yourself or the other person that you’re with.”\nAt the MIJ Special Education Hub, where there are youths in their 20s, the topic of boy-girl relationships is covered under the school’s sex education.\nIn co-founder and director Faraliza Zainal’s experience with her students, however, behavioural issues tend to be the kind of thing the school mostly works on with parents.\nFor example, one 15-year-old boy with moderate to high autism used to masturbate up to five times a day in the toilet.\nSo the teachers gradually increased the interval between his toilet breaks while educating him on masturbation according to Islamic teachings, until the point where they were confident that he had stopped.\nFaraliza has been open about discussing masturbation with her son Ashraf, who has autism too and is now 20 years old. But it has not become an issue for her.\n“As he grew older (and) went into puberty, there were a lot of mood swings ... I had to handle. Sometimes he could be happy, then in a split second, he could be very upset about something,” the 49-year-old recalls.\n“But nothing about masturbation ... I think because we never allowed him to be on his own, doing nothing. Because the moment he’s doing nothing and he’s exploring ... touching his private parts, that’s when it would lead to something else.”\nLET’S TALK ABOUT SEX\nFor parents with a lot of questions about their children’s sexuality, the DPA held its first such workshop last year, run by Lee.\nIt was open to association members, whose children have a range of disabilities: Physical, sensory, learning, intellectual and psychosocial. And the response was “overwhelming”.\n“We opened it up to about 20 slots, but I think we had about 50 parents,” says Kunashakaran. “We had to close the registration.”\nThe workshop topics included personal boundaries, bodily changes, sexual reproduction, emotional and physical sexuality, sexual diversity and societal expectations.\nThe parents were shy at first, recalls Ang, who attended with her husband. But when she saw Lee “speaking so openly” as a Singaporean woman about the same age as herself, she determined to “take it as a normal (discussion)"".\n“When I started to share, I realised that the other parents were like, ‘wah, this mother is sharing’. So they also shared. In that way, we started to understand ... this wasn’t an isolated problem,” Ang recounts.\nUntil that point, even the DPA had reservations about the workshop content because it was “so far out” compared with the association’s usual policy-related work, says Kunashakaran.\nWe were concerned that ... (it) would be a little bit out there for the parents whom we work with, but they’ve embraced it, and a lot of them were a lot more excited than we expected.\nLee and the DPA are now planning an expanded programme called Di-Sex, including one-on-one consultations as requested by some parents — so people with disabilities or their parents can get “customised information about how they can go through their sexual relationships or the journey through puberty in a healthy way”.\nCOVID-19 has derailed plans for classes this year, but the DPA hopes to resume the programme in March.\nAng is keen to learn more. She has already been advised to show her twins more physical affection, which she “didn’t do that much” in the past.\n“Now, I’m more relaxed. So every day I’d tell my elder one, ‘come let’s have a hug’, or things like that. I just want to give this kind of emotional assurance,” she says.\nThe girls, who go to Rainbow Centre — where they pick up daily living skills like getting dressed — are now masturbating “much less”, she adds.\nShe even bought a sex toy online, after hearing from Lee that it could be a useful outlet for their needs. But now she “can’t imagine” them using it, or bringing herself to test its safety and guide them.\nHaving to grapple with their sexuality, however, meant she was able to overcome her inhibitions to talk through the birds and bees to her youngest daughter, who is neurotypical, studying in a mainstream school and seven years the twins’ junior.\n“I practically showed her everything — what a male and female part is ... the science part and the emotional aspect,” recounts Ang. “She seemed to understand when she was eight. Now she’s 11, she knows.\n“She did tell me, ‘Huh? I don’t want to have puberty, can or not? It’s a lot of trouble.\'”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     education ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      COVID-19: Singaporeans enrolled in overseas universities unsure about future studies
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Student Carolyn Tan was on the bus to the airport to board a plane back to Singapore when she received an email from her university informing students that it would be closing all its facilities and moving classes online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\xa0\nMs Tan, who is in her second year studying for an Economics degree at Cambridge University, told CNA she was relieved at the time that she had already booked her plane ticket before receiving the news, avoiding the scramble for flights home.\xa0\n“Deep down you hold on to that little hope that maybe things will get better and they’ll still ask us to go back for the third term as usual. But I think by that point, that hope was very, very small.\xa0\n“When that email came, it was more of a relief that okay, I know that I\'ve made the right choice to go back home and that it was a wise decision to make my plans before they sent the email.”\xa0\nOn May 20, Cambridge University announced that all its lectures would be delivered online over the next academic year, until summer 2021, because of the COVID-19 outbreak.\xa0\nThe university, in a notice posted on its website dated May 22, later clarified that\xa0while online lectures will make a ""key contribution"", it is ""determined"" to ""bring the Colleges and the University back to life"" with ""intensive in-person learning in the traditional locations"".\xa0\nThe university had shut its campuses to students in March after the British government introduced a strict lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19.\xa0\nThe 21-year-old landed in Singapore on March 19, just days after the Singapore government announced that all travellers from the UK, Switzerland, Japan and ASEAN countries would be subject to a 14-day stay-home notice\xa0(SHN).\xa0\n""From what I\'ve heard, they\'re not planning to cut fees, which is definitely something that students aren\'t very happy about,"" said Ms Tan.\n""But I understand that there\'s quite a lot of layers of decision making, that we can\'t even just appeal to our own university about these because they take the cue from the education ministry in the UK.""\nShe pays about £10,000 (S$17,500) per term for her degree at Cambridge University, inclusive of £1,600 for rent.\xa0\nThe university has waived rent for students who may have gone home and no longer live on campus, she added.\xa0\nFor students like Ms Tan who\xa0pay\xa0thousands of dollars to study for a degree at an overseas university, handing over full school fees for remote classes and lectures can be a sore subject. The students CNA spoke to said that while the situation is not ideal, they also recognise that these are extraordinary times.\xa0\nFor Ms Germaine See, who is currently in the third term of her second year at Durham University in the UK, her university did not offer any refund of school fees for foreign students who returned home. The 21-year-old returned to Singapore at the start of the Easter holidays on Mar 24.\nMost of the teaching has been halted and revision lectures have been occasionally posted online on the school portal, to support students studying for the upcoming exams, she added. A 48-hour window for examinations was implemented to accommodate students who may be overseas and in different timezones.\xa0\nHer studies at Durham University cost\xa0£18,000 per year.\xa0When asked about having to take remote classes\xa0while\xa0paying full school fees, she said: “At the start when I first came back to Singapore, it was a sense of relief, that I was back home and I was safe from everything.\xa0\n“But slowly the disappointment did sink in after a while, especially during the SHN for 14 days,” she said, adding that she had envisioned her second year in university to be ""a certain way"" and having part of that experience taken away was “quite a big hit”.\xa0\n“Granted, I do feel that is quite a waste to spend (the money) because my fees are £18,000 per year. That will translate to about £6,000 per term. So I couldn’t justify to myself why I was paying about six grand to do an online course in Singapore without the university experience.”\xa0\nWith her third year ahead of her, Ms See has also already signed the lease for her accommodation in the next school year and paid the sum in full.\xa0\n“Should we be unable to return to school, my main concern would really be my accommodation plans and belongings. Should I not be able to go back to the UK, I am unsure of how to go about negotiating the lease and whether or not a refund would be possible,” she said.\nMost of her belongings are still in her old apartment, and that lease ends in September, she said. If she is unable to head back to the UK by then, her belongings will likely be disposed of, or shipped back at additional cost.\xa0\nAnother one of her concerns about returning home was her final examinations this year.\xa0\n“Given that I am in Singapore, I was worried that the time difference between Singapore and the UK would affect my ability to perform,” she told CNA.\n“The lack of communication from the school coupled with the fact that I was bound (by a) stay-home notice for 14 days didn’t really help with the stress and anxiety of this period.”\xa0\nAs for Ms Ho Kah Yoke, who has just completed her first year studying for a Masters’ degree in public administration at New York University, paying a significant sum for remote learning was “a complicated feeling”.\xa0\n“Of course, I don\'t want to pay such a rate for just remote learning but at the same time, I was one of the very few, I think there were only a handful of international students from my course and my school who decided to fly back home.\xa0\n“Being such a small, tiny minority, I felt like this was my choice that I made. So I just have to live with the consequences of paying this exorbitant fee for online learning, while the rest of my classmates were still in New York. They have the option to continue face-to-face (classes) in the next semester.”\xa0\nThe 32-year-old returned in mid-March, just as the number of COVID-19 cases spiked in New York.\xa0\nSome students at her university even started a petition to the school to request for a refund of school fees. Adding that no one knows how the situation in New York will change in the coming weeks, she said: “I feel like I’m very unhappy about this, but I made this choice.”\nMs Ho is also still paying US$1,250 per month for the lease on her apartment. Since the lease has been signed until July, she and her roommate\xa0tried asking her\xa0landlord for a rent reduction, but her request was turned down.\xa0\n""It\'s been sitting empty. My roommate has put up the listing but of course, nobody has taken it up.""\xa0\nHowever, some students have chosen not to come back to Singapore amid COVID-19 travel restrictions, citing school and work commitments, and having already made the necessary preparations for their stay overseas.\xa0\nMr Hillary Tan’s mother was very worried about his decision to remain in the US and had asked him to return home, leading to several heated arguments.\xa0\n“In the end, they gave me a list of precautions to take and ordered some masks and had them shipped to my apartment. I\'m still using that stash,” said the 26-year-old, who is a graduate student at the University of Missouri.\xa0\nHis university closed in March, with classes and coursework moving fully online.\xa0\n“It was a bit of a struggle to find the motivation to do a lot of it. But I finally had more time to cook my own meals and save more money, so that was fun.”\xa0\nMr Tan, who is pursuing a Masters of Arts in Journalism, is supposed to graduate at the end of this year, and is waiting to see if he can complete his Masters’ project as scheduled.\n“If I get an early confirmation that my photo project\xa0is impossible to do, it\'s not a sure thing that I\'ll come back, but it\'ll push me in that direction more,” he said.\xa0\nMs Jess Ng, 25, flew to Seoul to study Korean Language at the Yonsei University Korean Language Institute at the end of February, just as South Korea saw a rapid surge in the number of COVID-19 cases after a cluster of infections emerged from a religious sect in Daegu.\n“Studying a language is mostly for self-development, so I thought the sooner I finished it the better. Plus there was no guarantee when COVID-19 would die down, so I didn’t feel that there was a need to delay it at that time,” she told CNA.\xa0\nWhile she “can’t say they weren’t worried”, her parents were “quite supportive” of her decision, especially since the preparations were already complete, including her travel visa and accommodation. She had already finished applying to the school and paying the necessary fees by December.\xa0\n“All the preparations were done and I wasn’t sure when would be the next best time to go ahead with it, so I just went ahead. I think it’s been pretty good here so far, I just need to constantly keep a lookout for the health advisories,” said Ms Ng, adding that she was subject to a 14-day quarantine in a single room in the school dormitory after arriving in Seoul.\xa0\nTHE FUTURE OF UNIVERSITY LIFE\nFor students like Ms Tan, Ms Ho and Ms See who have returned home in the middle of their studies, many are uncertain about the future of their courses\xa0amid widespread COVID-19 travel restrictions.\xa0\nEven if she can return for her third year at Cambridge, student activities on campus are likely to face the same restrictions as lectures, said Ms Tan.\n“For some of us, what we’re thinking of are the implications (the announcement) has for other activities that contribute to university life,” she said, adding that student society meetings and church services that see the same kind of attendance as lectures were likely to be affected.\xa0\n“Them making the announcement sort of solidifies all the fears that we had about next year not being back to normal which, I guess we should have already known. But it just makes it more of a reality.”\xa0\nAdding that her studies will be “very dependent” on the situation in the UK in a few months, Ms Tan said there were several considerations - whether travel restrictions would be lifted, and whether it would be safe to return to the UK.\xa0\n“And the other side is,\xa0if things are really going to be so disrupted, do we want to go back?” she added.\xa0\nSome of her friends have jokingly discussed taking a gap year because they feel they would miss out on university life if they return to the UK to complete their studies amid COVID-19 social distancing measures.\xa0\n“Even though they can do teaching pretty decently through virtual platforms, I think a lot of us feel that university life is so much more than that, and we just really want to treasure the time that we have there. Especially because it\'s overseas, you know, it\'s kind of this once in a lifetime opportunity.”\xa0\nMs See said while there is “an optimism” that she and her friends will be able to head back to Durham for the next semester, they are unsure about how different classes and teaching will be.\xa0\n“While virtual teaching may be viable in the short run, I genuinely feel that it is not as effective as teaching in real life and am worried how this mode of teaching would impact my learning, especially now that I’m in my final year and am required to write a dissertation,” she said.\xa0\nAdding that university is “more than just getting good grades”, but also about “forming deep bonds and memories” with her friends, she said: “Should I be unable to go back to the UK, I will be missing out on the social aspect of university. One that cannot be easily replaced nor recreated in this lifetime.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian schools will reopen in phases, starting on Jun\xa024 for those taking their leaving examinations, said Education Minister Mohd Radzi Md Jidin on Wednesday (Jun 10).\nIn a press conference, he said the first phase of reopening will involve 500,444 students from more than 2,500 schools taking their secondary and international leaving examinations.\nAs for students in other educational levels, the dates for school reopening have not been finalised, he said, adding that an announcement will be made two weeks before classes resume. In the meantime, students will continue with home-based learning.\n“The opening on Jun\xa024 is for students sitting for Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM), Sijil Vokasional Malaysia (SVM) and Sijil Tinggi Agama Malaysia (STAM).\n“These students as well as their parents and guardians will have to\xa0adhere to strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) as set by the National Security Council,\xa0Health Ministry and\xa0Education Ministry,” he said.\nHowever, the school\xa0hours have\xa0not be finalised, he said. Students will attend school in batches, he added.\nOn Jun\xa04, the education ministry released a set of guidelines\xa0on reopening of schools. The guidelines detail the necessary steps to be taken to ensure students, teachers, staff and visitors are protected during the\xa0pandemic.\nElaborating on the SOPs, Dr Mohd Radzi said on Wednesday that all students will have their temperatures scanned as soon as they arrive in\xa0school.\nHe said that teachers will be assigned to check every student entering the school premises, and any student with a temperature above 37.5 degrees or showing any relevant symptoms will be asked to go home immediately.\xa0\nIf the students came to school\xa0via public transportation, school bus or others, they would be kept in an\xa0isolation room to wait for their parents or guardians to come and get them. The\xa0district health office will also be notified.\n“Other students will need to follow a designated pathway to their respective classrooms and each classroom will only accommodate enough students to ensure the one metre distance between the tables are maintained,” he said, adding that the maximum capacity for each classroom will be\xa020 students.\nPRE-PACKED MEALS, STAGGERED RECESS HOURS\nAs for meal times, the minister said that school canteens will serve pre-packed meals. Students can then purchase their meals and make their way to their classrooms to eat while under the supervision of a teacher.\n“Recess hours will be staggered to ensure there is no crowding anywhere at any point in time.\n“Similar SOPs will apply to boarding schools, where their beds will be arranged one metre apart and their meal times will be staggered,” he said, adding that all schools will constantly sanitise surfaces touched frequently such as door knobs and stair railings.\nCo-curricular and outdoor activities will not take place until further notice.\nAsked if it was compulsory for students to wear masks, Dr Mohd Radzi said there were no restrictions.\n“If parents want their children to use masks, they can, there are no restrictions. But if a teacher notices that a student is showing symptoms, then the school will provide a mask and the student will be isolated,"" he said.\nThe minister said that the SOPs would be updated from time to time depending on feedback from schools and the Health Ministry.\xa0He stated\xa0that the guidelines did not only apply to students, but also to\xa0teachers, staff and visitors.\nSchools in Malaysia have been closed since Mar 18.

      4 students and 1 school employee contract COVID-19; all had 'low viral loads': MOE
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Four students and one non-teaching staff member have tested positive for COVID-19, as part of the Ministry of Health\'s (MOH) extended surveillance testing.\xa0\xa0\nThe five are not a cluster, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Sunday (Jun 7), as they are from five different schools - Anglican High School, CHIJ Katong Convent, CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent, Geylang Methodist Secondary School and Hwa Chong Institution.\nAll five displayed mild symptoms.\xa0\n“While positive, the tests for all five cases revealed low viral loads. A repeat test using new samples showed that all five cases were negative,” said MOE in a press release.\n“The evidence suggests that they were likely infected during the circuit breaker period, and not after school reopening.”\nThe cases were picked up as a result of surveillance testing, conducted since Jun 2, on all school employees\xa0and students above the age of 12 who were\xa0diagnosed with acute respiratory infection when they first saw a doctor for illness.\nSpeaking to reporters, Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung said that the five cases tested negative on Saturday, adding that they can be discharged if they produce another negative test on Sunday.\n“So MOH has based on all this evidence, their assessment is that they are not likely to be infectious currently, or when they were in school,"" he said.\nThe Hwa Chong Institution student was last in school on Apr 7, before the start of the “circuit breaker” period.\nThree of the other cases were last in school on Jun 3, and one went to school on Jun 2.\xa0\nSchools had reopened on Jun 2 after about two months of full home-based learning during the circuit breaker period.\nContact tracing and investigations are ongoing, said MOE.\nA total of 29 staff members and 100 students who were in contact with the confirmed cases in school have been issued\xa0a 14-day leave of absence or home quarantine order.\xa0\n“Those who are on HQO (home quarantine order) will also be swabbed for COVID-19 twice – once before the start of HQO, and once at the end of HQO,"" said MOE.\nThe learning arrangements for all schools, including the five affected schools, will remain unchanged, the ministry added.\nResponding to questions about parents who may be concerned about schools remaining open, Mr Ong noted that schools continue to have an “entire suite of safe management measures”, and all the contacts of any confirmed cases will be on leave of absence or home quarantine order.\xa0\n“As we step out and exit circuit breaker, and we step up our testing regime, we will from time to time discover new cases and have to quarantine more people. This is actually indicative that our strategy is working, that we are able to pick up the cases early, segregate them, isolate them, quarantine the rest, so that our schools remain as safe as possible,” the minister said.\n“COVID-19 will be here for a while - one year, two years, maybe more. And these are all part and parcel of our gradual learning journey to live with COVID-19 safely.”\nMOE will consider closing a school if there is a cluster within the school, said Mr Ong, although this has not happened.\nAlthough safe management measures have been “very consistently applied” throughout all schools, the confirmed cases are “a good reminder for all schools to not be complacent”, he added.\xa0\nApart from the five cases announced by MOE, the Health Ministry also reported one case from Ascensia International School in its daily preliminary update on COVID-19 cases.\nTESTING STRATEGY\nThe five cases announced by MOE on Sunday are well and “making good progress” recovery, said MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak.\nOne student experienced the onset of symptoms on May 31, and the remaining students and non-teaching staff member reported that symptoms had started between Jun 2 and Jun 4.\xa0\n“If we remember, it takes a while between the time a person is exposed to the virus to actually manifesting with symptoms and this may be, on average, something between four and six days,” said Assoc Prof Mak.\xa0\n“It is highly likely that all of them had the exposure to the virus before the circuit breaker period ended. And then, only after the circuit breaker period had ended did they manifest their symptoms.”\xa0\nResponding to questions about why only children above the age of 12 are undergoing surveillance testing, Assoc Prof Mak said MOH recognises that there are “difficulties in imposing such a strategy across the board”.\xa0\nAdding that it can be an “emotionally trying experience” for the student, parents and the individual carrying out the test, he said that MOH has decided it “might be more appropriate” to be “more selective and targeted” in its surveillance, since the current risk of community spread is low.\xa0\n“We will be testing students below the age of 12 with symptoms as they present to doctors, and if these tests cannot be done by a general practitioner in his clinic, these students will be referred to the hospital where more experienced people, experienced in looking after children can then do that test.\xa0\n“We are going to also look at children below the age of 12, but it would be for symptomatic children, and we will not be routinely performing the swab tests for asymptomatic children, below that age.”\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Ong Ye Kung ', '     education ', '     health ']}"

      Commentary: Are we ready to send our children back to pre-school?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Come Monday (Jun 8), younger pre-school children are set to return to school, following the heels of their kindergarten 1 and 2\xa0seniors who resumed classes this week.\nHowever, this may be easier said than done as parents of these younger ones find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place.\nUp until recently, pre-school-linked COVID-19 cases were still emerging.\nAfter the initial celebratory moment when partial and staggered school re-opening was announced, the unspoken question of how to keep our children safe flooded our minds.\nThere are competing factors at play. On one hand, parents would love to reclaim some personal time, even if it’s just for three hours a day.\nOn the other hand, the safety of our offspring cannot be ignored even if pre-schools are going the extra mile to assure us that all precautions have been taken.\nGetting our kids to adhere to these social distancing measures is another consideration. How many two or three-year olds can have a mask on their faces for three hours or more?\nParents have their work cut out for them in getting their kids social distance-ready for school.\nMAKING A CALL\nIn the first few hours of the news breaking that circuit breaker will be ending and schools re-opened, many parents were busy texting friends and fellow parents, checking to see what everyone’s plans were.\nSome also started shopping for child-sized disposable masks and face shields online.\nThere are also parents who are adopting a more cautious, wait-and-see approach.\nA friend whose child in Nursery 2 (N2) has a pre-existing heart condition, will not be sending him to school.\nShe has calculated the risks and rewards involved and figured that it will not be worthwhile.\nSome parents will similarly choose to opt out of school for now, which is understandable given that there is less academic learning at stake for younger pre-schoolers.\nHowever, she acknowledged that it will be a matter of time, and the final decision of when to resume school will be dependent on the number of community cases and the peace of mind from knowing what the pre-school is doing to maintain safe distancing measures.\nShe elaborated:\xa0“Knowing that the school has a plan that is communicated well and implemented effectively helps.”\nFor parents with similar considerations in not sending their young ones to pre-school for a prolonged period of time, they need to bear in mind that there are implications. \xa0\nAlthough the younger ones may not do much academic learning at this stage, it is the overall development and growth that they get during this period that matters.\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the period from birth to eight years old in a child’s life “is a time of remarkable growth, with brain development at its peak.”\n“Early childhood care and education is more than preparation for primary school. It aims at the holistic development of a child’s social, emotional, cognitive and physical needs in order to build a solid and broad foundation for lifelong learning and well-being.”\nMoreover, there is also the consideration for our children’s need for socialisation and normalcy.\nAs Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung puts it:\xa0“COVID-19 will be with us for some time … We can’t keep our kids at home for so long. It will severely impact their socio-emotional well-being and their whole person development.”\nPRE-SCHOOLS DOING ALL THEY CAN\nTo ensure that our little ones are kept safe during this risky period, pre-schools are doing the necessary, with some going the extra mile.\nFor example, another friend shared that her child’s pre-school has rejigged the curriculum to focus more on outdoor activities and learning, in the interest of social distancing.\nHaving prepared masks for her N2 child, she is not overly worried about any perceived health risks and is choosing to focus on the things she can do such as reminding her child that his school experience will now include new habits of wearing a mask and washing his hands more often.\nSpending more curriculum time outdoors makes sense if the physical environment allows for different groups of children to be outdoors at different timings.\nStudies have indicated that coronaviruses do not thrive in hot and humid environments, though these are not conclusive. They are also less likely to spread in well-ventilated areas.\nMost pre-schools have also adopted staggered reporting and dismissal timings. They have also tried to space out their children through using long tables and larger spaces such as the assembly hall.\nSo far it seems like the slightly elder children are coping well.\nJasmine Koh, Centre Director of MapleBear Hillview, said:\xa0“Surprisingly, majority of the K1 and K2 children are happy to wear their masks for the entire time that they are in school. They do remove it during mealtimes, nap times and active playtimes and hence, we have taken time to practise safely removing and storing the mask.”\n“We have also provided a MapleBear face shield for children to use when they are uncomfortable or need a breather, which will also come in handy for the younger children who may need a little more time to adjust to the change.”\nEVERYONE HAS A PART TO PLAY\nSchools are doing their best to implement safe distancing and stringent hygiene practices, but to be clear, everyone is treading new and unfamiliar ground here. So we can’t fault parents for their apprehension.\nWhile the government has provided guidelines, it is still up to each school to translate these new rules into clear protocols that work in their day-to-day operations and interactions.\xa0 \xa0\nA friend of mine noticed on the first day of dropping off her K2 child that a teacher was using gloved hands to pull down her child’s mask to do an oral check, a standard procedure to guard against HFMD.\nShe immediately raised a red flag, suggesting instead that each child be allowed to pull down their own mask. This minimises the risk of a staff unknowingly passing on germs from child to child.\nSo apart from teaching our kids how to don and keep a mask properly, as well as how to wash their hands and sanitise them, parents need to be alert to any unsafe practices that we see around us and provide constructive feedback.\nCHILDREN WILL ADAPT IF PARENTS LEAD THE WAY\nAs we prepare to send our youngest ones out of our nest, it will undoubtedly be a tentative and quivering step into the unknown.\nWe may find ourselves like a broken recorder, repeating the new rules of COVID-19 life again and again – “hands away from your face”, “wash your hands”, “keep your mask on at all times”.\nPre-schools would do well to help ease some of the anxieties by communicating regularly and implementing their measures diligently.\nIt is a formidable task ahead for teachers so parents also need to respond with patience.\nPre-schoolers may struggle with wearing a mask for the entire duration of school but they do have strengths that will help set them up for success: Adaptability.\nThey may be young but they are amazingly adaptable to changes in the environment, given some practice and encouragement. \xa0\nIf we keep a positive outlook, and partner our children’s schools effectively, we may find our kids more receptive to change.\nBut we must first shore up sufficient mental and practical resources and manage our own anxieties well. Only then will our children stand a good chance at adapting and thriving – even amid\xa0this crisis.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Study loan repayments suspended for graduates, IHLs to provide free training modules
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0The Ministry of Education has suspended the repayment and interest for all study loans for a year, to give graduates ""peace of mind"" during their job search, said Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung in Parliament on Friday (Jun\xa05).\xa0\nHe was responding to questions by Member of Parliament Cheng Li Hui on the efforts between the\xa0institutes of higher learning\xa0(IHLs) and government agencies to connect graduates with companies to provide employment opportunities.\xa0\nThe IHLs, from universities to polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education, have “a significant network of companies and employers” and have been leveraging them to provide internships and work-study programmes, said Mr Ong.\xa0\nThe institutes\' career centres will also provide career guidance, labour market information\xa0and organise job fairs, he added. The intensity of efforts\xa0has been stepped up this year, with the use of online outreach and counselling tools to support graduates remotely.\nFREE TRAINING MODULES\nInstitutes of higher learning will also offer two to four Continuing Education and Training (CET) modules free of charge to graduates who decide to delay their entry into the job market.\xa0\nMr Ong said: “We are in the process of structuring all these modules into a continuous programme, and provide credentials at the end of it.\n“And that way, graduates can take up this programme and delay their entry into the labour market, (by) doing something very meaningful.”\nGraduates can also enrol for further studies, including advance diplomas, specialist diplomas\xa0and graduate certification programmes.\xa0\nIn response to Ms Cheng’s question about internship opportunities during this challenging period, Mr Ong said that they have been disrupted\xa0due to the ""circuit breaker"" measures to curb the community spread of COVID-19.\xa0\nHowever, he emphasised that IHLs are working hard to identify alternatives to mitigate impacts on learning outcomes and graduation timings.\xa0\n“If rescheduling the internship is not possible, IHLs will offer substitutes such as working on industry-related projects and take additional modules,” Mr Ong added.\nWhile employers are facing difficulties amid\xa0the COVID-19 pandemic, many are “still prepared to hire” or offer SGUnited traineeships. The Government has set aside S$100 million to fund the SGUnited Traineeships Programme to boost graduates’ employability.\nIn addition, IHLs will contribute to the pool of about 100,000 opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package that the National Jobs Council\xa0is overseeing, said Mr Ong.\xa0\n“COVID-19 will be a defining moment in our graduates’ lives.

      MOE to review how to 'blend' classroom and digital online learning as schools reopen after COVID-19 circuit breaker
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) will review how to “blend” classroom learning and digital online learning to “harness the best of both worlds”, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (Jun 2).\xa0\nWith schools reopening on Tuesday after the end of Singapore\'s\xa0""circuit breaker"" on Monday, Mr Ong noted that a\xa0month of full home-based learning has ""taught us a lot"".\n“We totally understand home-based learning\xa0and digital online learning cannot substitute classroom learning. But having forced ourselves to do this for a whole month, we also learned how to do it better, and that there are certain strengths in online learning that actually, classroom learning does not have,” he told reporters during\xa0a visit to Xingnan Primary School.\xa0\nStudents can engage in self-directed learning outside the classroom, said Mr Ong, describing this as a ""strength of digital learning”.\xa0\n“Moving forward, there is a big review happening in MOE to see how we can better plan to blend the two. Not too far into the future, I think we want to do this quite soon, (we want to) blend the two so that we can harness the best of both worlds in a modern education system,"" the minister said.\nBecause schools entered full home-based learning ""at such a short notice"", there are still ""many areas for improvement"", Mr Ong added.\nThe resilient response from teachers, parents and students was ""extremely encouraging"", he said.\nLEARNING FROM SOUTH KOREA\nResponding to questions about South Korea imposing limits on school attendance due to a spike in COVID-19 cases after schools there\xa0reopened on May 20, Mr Ong said\xa0that this was “unfortunate”.\xa0\n“We have been monitoring what other countries do. In the case of South Korea, unfortunately, when they opened, they extended to bars and clubs and many of the entertainment outlets and this resulted in certain big clusters being triggered off,” he said.\xa0\nSingapore is reopening in three phases after exiting the circuit breaker on Monday.\nAdding that the clusters in South Korea\xa0were\xa0“a good reminder” to open up\xa0“step by step”, Mr Ong noted that many Singaporeans think Phase 1 of the reopening\xa0is “a bit tight”.\xa0\n“We are erring on the side of being more careful, learning from South Korea,"" the minister said.\nSchools\xa0and ""most other places"" in Singapore are “big enough” to accommodate safe distancing measures, he added.\xa0\n“Safe distancing is only breached only when people congregate during certain places at a certain time ... so it\'s a lot about the processes about this that we will slowly, in the next few weeks, inculcate in the students,"" Mr Ong said.\n\'PALPABLE SENSE OF ENTHUSIASM\' IN STUDENTS RETURNING\nWith students in Primary 4 to 6 and Secondary 1, 2, 4 and 5 returning to school on Tuesday, Mr Ong said the return has been\xa0“orderly” and “very calm”, and that there was “a palpable sense of enthusiasm” among teachers and students who came back to schools.\n“There are bound to be many teething problems,"" Mr Ong said, adding that students are getting used to the safe distancing measures.\nSome parents remain\xa0apprehensive about schools reopening, said Mr Ong, adding that he has received requests from parents to open schools only a month or two later.\n""Very practical considerations"" were taken on board\xa0before the decision was made for schools to reopen, he said.\n“Many parents are going back to work, and schools and work come hand in hand. You have to provide a safe environment in school so that parents can go to work with a peace of mind, leave their kids here to study,"" the minister said.\nWith the end of the circuit breaker, more people will want to go out, and it is better for students to go\xa0to school to study in a safe environment instead of letting them go out into the community, he added.\xa0\nNoting that Singapore saw no\xa0new community cases on Monday, Mr Ong stressed that the number of COVID-19 infections is\xa0likely to rise in Phase 1.\xa0\n“So if we are not comfortable opening up now when we have zero, very low daily infections, what more later? You will end up having the possibility of very prolonged school closure and that impact will be quite significant,"" he said.\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said students and teachers returned to a ""different environment"" than when they were last in school.\n""Parents will understandably be anxious for their children. Rest assured that the Ministry of Education has taken comprehensive measures to keep students, teachers, and staff safe,"" Mr Lee wrote.\n""We will take time to get used to the precautions, but they are necessary to protect everyone.\n""Meanwhile, we are watching the situation closely, and will do everything necessary to gradually resume our normal activities while keeping teachers and students safe.""\nPSLE AND NATIONAL EXAMS\nAs for concerns from parents about the Primary School Leaving Examination\xa0(PSLE) and other national examinations that graduating cohorts will take, Mr Ong noted that\xa0some topics have been removed from this year\'s exams.\nAs part of the gradual easing of circuit breaker\xa0measures, schools were allowed to reopen for students in small groups for face-to-face lessons from May 19.\nPriority was given to graduating cohorts and those who needed additional support or school facilities for coursework and practical sessions during the May school holidays.\n“I think the load and the pressure on children, students will be less this year. And then as to whether you find the paper is going to be harder this year or harder next year, people always speculate,"" he said.\xa0\n“Just try your best. And ultimately, PSLE is still just the first gateway of a very long learning and education journey.”\xa0\nUrging students not to be\xa0""too hard""\xa0on themselves, he added: “You still have a long journey ahead of you and discover your passion, to learn to grow and to be a better person.

      Back to class: How different pre-schools address parents’ worries about COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In the lead-up to pre-schools re-opening on Tuesday (Jun 2), NTUC First Campus’ My First Skool reached out to parents with a 32-page document packed with tips and activities to prepare children for their return to class.\nThe Safe Return Transition Resource Kit covers topics like wearing, removing and disposing of masks safely, and how to understand germs. Teachers and principals from the anchor operator’s various centres also produced self-help videos to guide parents and children on habits such as hand-washing.\nAll this, according to My First Skool’s general manager Thian Ai Ling, was developed because they anticipated children would take some time to re-adjust to a school environment after weeks of being at home.\nLike My First Skool, many preschools – from anchor operators to private players – have been reaching out to parents and children to help ease the transition, as those in Kindergarten 1 and Kindergarten 2 return to school on Jun 2 followed by younger ones later on.\nBut while the engagement has helped alleviate concerns over sending their children back to school for many parents CNA Insider spoke to, a few remain worried and have decided to keep their children at home for now.\nTake Haikal Guntor, who received a letter on Friday from his son’s Ministry of Education (MOE) Kindergarten briefly outlining the measures it is taking. This did not change his earlier decision to have his two children – his son who is in K2, and a daughter who attends nursery at a PCF Sparkletots pre-school – stay home.\nWhile his son had an online group call with his classmates and teachers sometime during the circuit breaker, the father described it as “more of a catch-up session” with nothing mentioned about measures taken in the school to keep children safe and healthy.\n“Even with the masks, we’re not sure our kids will be safe,” he said, pointing to the “20-plus children” his son has in his class. Besides, he added, his wife used to be a pre-school teacher and can teach them at home. \xa0\nAccording to the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), pre-schools will be required to adhere to measures such as mandating the wearing of masks or face shields by all staff and children above the age of 2; and keeping staff and children within their own bays, floors or classrooms as far as possible.\nStaff of all pre-schools and early intervention centres have also completed a one-time swab test. \xa0\nMOE’s director of schools Liew Wei Li said the MOE Kindergartens have been engaging parents via letters. In addition, prior to re-opening tomorrow, they will “also be sharing infographics, photos or videos with parents” so as to “reassure and give parents a better sense of how these safe management measures will look like in each centre”.\nAnother parent, Siti Saliha, whose 4-year-old daughter attends a PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots centre, also does not plan to send her daughter back to school on Jun 8 when children in Nursery 1 and 2 are slated to return. \xa0\nThe centre held an online parent-teacher conference earlier this month, she said, but she was not satisfied with the answers to her questions – such as how the centre would keep the children from touching each other, and how they would ensure her daughter’s mask would be worn properly.\n“They are just nursery kids,” she said. “The teacher kept saying they will guide them and keep reminding them (about the measures) … but I still don’t have confidence.”\nOn Saturday, she received a letter covering topics such as the items each child should have when they return, and the school’s safe management measures, but she has not changed her mind.\nAccording to Marini Khamis, senior director of PCF’s pre-school management division, the remote parent-teacher conferences were meant to “serve as a platform for teachers to address parents’ concerns”, while the letter was another way to “reassure and alleviate parents’ concerns”.\xa0\nPCF Sparkletots is the largest pre-school operator in Singapore.\xa0\nGETTING KIDS IN THE HABIT EARLY\nBut while mother Nur Afiqah also has concerns, she will be sending her four-year-old to his My First Skool centre tomorrow. She cites the trust and good relationships she has developed with its staff as one factor.\n“I’ve been sending him to the same centre since he was an infant, and I know the principal and teachers well,” she said. “I can ask them anything… there’s no communication barrier.”\nAndre Lim, a father of three whose two sons attend Catholic Kindergarten, says he has “no qualms” about his children returning to class.\n“I think the risk I face going to the supermarket is higher than (the risk of) sending them to school,” he said.\nSome pre-schools are making sure by reaching out to the children even before their return to class, and getting them accustomed to important new habits such as washing their hands frequently and wearing a mask for extended periods.\n“Habits take time to acquire and be formalised,” explained My First Skool’s Ms Thian, noting that the 32-page toolkit was designed to help parents get the ball rolling with their children.\xa0\n“Have many conversations with your children… What makes good, healthy habits, and what should you not be doing, like rubbing your nose and not using a tissue. Parents can help us go through a few of these things.”\nTeachers at Pat’s Schoolhouse @ Claymore have been masking up while they conduct home-based learning, “so the children can recognise them… like, ‘this is going to be how I look when you come back to school’,” said Ada Teo, the centre’s senior principal.\xa0\nThe children were also asked to put on masks during the video calls, to get used to doing so for lessons.\nTeachers have in addition been reminding children to continue to practise contactless greetings such as air hugs, fist or elbow bumps with their friends when they return, which they had started doing before the circuit breaker kicked in.\n“If we prepare them socially and emotionally, it’s a lot easier for them to adjust when they come back,” said Mdm Teo. \xa0\nGETTING KIDS TO WEAR MASKS IN CLASS\nOne big reason why Siti Saliha has decided against sending her daughter back to nursery school is the girl’s inability wear a mask for long.\n“My daughter only wears a mask for short distances, such as from the house to the car,” she said. “And when I bring her out, the mask will slide down her nose when she talks, and she keeps touching and pulling it up.\n“The kids might not know how to re-adjust it the right way, and what if her hands are dirty?” she added.\nThe use of masks is one of parents’ biggest concerns, and pre-schools have acknowledged the challenges.\nFor instance, in circulars from three pre-schools that CNA Insider saw, parents were instructed to pack extra masks for their children in case their child drops or soils theirs.\nAt My First Skool, customised mask holders were created to give children a place to leave their mask when they remove them for mealtimes or naps.\xa0\nPre-schools also noted that being in a social setting can encourage children to comply with wearing masks. “During the circuit breaker where we provided limited services, we saw that children observe common practices”, said PCF’s Ms Marini.\xa0\n“They tend to be more open to following practices such as wearing a mask when they see their teachers and friends doing the same.”\nThen there are other kinds of encouragement. Principal Pua Yoke Ting of Star Learners at Bishan Central said they would let younger children “choose their favourite sticker and paste it on the mask, so they feel happy and are more inclined to (put it on)”.\nBut what if a child simply refuses to keep a mask on? Pat’s Schoolhouse’s Mdm Teo said they would not force the child, but offer him or her the alternative of a face shield instead.\n“We’ll let the child put it on, and continue to explain why we want the child to do that,” she said. “But if the child needs more time, it’s fine.”\n“We just have to be very empathetic towards them,” she added. “I will tell them, ‘I know it’s very hot, I am also feeling very hot, but we try again, and we persevere, okay?’”\nGETTING KIDS TO KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE\xa0\nMaintaining a safe distance between children is another worry with parents.\xa0\nOne, who only wanted to be known as Mrs Tian, pointed to the number of children in her child’s K2 class at an MOE Kindergarten.\xa0There are about 25 children in a space she described as about half the size of a primary school classroom.\xa0\n“When I was there, I saw different learning corners, a kitchen area, tables and chairs, which makes the classroom very packed. So how are they going to keep a safe distance between the children?” she said, adding that children across different classes would also be using the same entrance, exit and common corridor.\nShe also pointed out that while K1 and K2 children will have their arrival and dismissal times staggered, they would arrive around the same time that the primary school students – also returning to school on Jun 2 – are dismissed.\nMOE’s Ms Liew said that schools will work with their respective MOE Kindergarten to minimise intermingling between primary school and kindergarten children by, for example, adjusting the timings for both.\nTo decongest common areas during arrival and dismissal, schools will make use of multiple access points or gates, and regulate movement of students at gates and drop-off or pick-up points.\nAs for classroom size, Ms Liew said the MOE Kindergarten classrooms are “larger than the average kindergarten classroom” and are well ventilated. Children were segregated into groups of five or six before the circuit breaker period, she noted, and this will now be further reduced to four.\nProgrammes and activities that involve close physical contact among children and staff will also be avoided – for example, there will be no sand and water play, she added.\nOther pre-schools have implemented similar measures.\xa0\nAt My First Skool, for example, children and teachers at centres with “extended outdoor spaces” on their premises can use these for outdoor walks and to get sunshine and fresh air. The operator is also working with SportSG to introduce customised physical activities that can be done indoors with children.\n“These include activities where children learn about underarm throws with newspaper balls, and simple obstacle courses for children,” said Ms Thian.\nAll outdoor play will also be moved indoors at Star Learners Bishan Central. “Thankfully, we have an indoor playground,” said Ms Pua. The playground will be sanitised after every use, and only up to 10 children can be there at any one time.\nThe centre has also split classes up into smaller groups of up to 10. “The same 10 children will be having lessons together, playing together and having meals together,” she said. “They will never mingle with children from the other groups.”\nAt Pat’s Schoolhouse @ Claymore, classrooms will be split into two sections using shelves and dividers, with one group per section. Children will also wear coloured tags to identify which group they belong to.\nEach group will have their own toys and books, which will be cleaned daily during the children’s nap time. High-touch areas, such as low shelves and door knobs, will be disinfected every time the children are out having their meals or at the playground, said Mdm Teo.\n“In the first half of the morning, we should be able to do it about three times, compared to ECDA’s advisory of twice a day,” she added.\nGETTING TEACHERS TO PACE THEMSELVES\nOn the manpower front, pre-schools have worked to ensure their staff are not cross-deployed across different groups. For example, at My First Skool, there are those who teach more than one level, such as Malay language teachers.\n“The arrangement for June is that the teacher will stay put in one level, and she will continue to deliver (content) for the other level online,” said Ms Thian. “So the teacher will be on a screen delivering content to the other level, with a teacher in the classroom to monitor the children and help them give their responses to the teacher on the screen.”\n“We have advised teachers to pace out a lot of things,” she added. “They are all going to be masked, and breathing can be a little unusual for them. So we told them that all activities can be slower for the first two weeks … they can afford to go slow, step back a little bit.”\nIndeed, with all the preparation work necessary and additional duties when school re-opens, teachers might see an increased workload.\xa0\nFor example, Chee Shu Yan, a teacher at Star Learners Bishan Central, pointed out that she has had to plan the curriculum to cater for smaller group teaching.\nWith the suspension of outdoor activities, teachers have also had to think up new ways to make the experience fun and engaging for their children, she added.\nEllis Lee, a senior teacher at Pat’s Schoolhouse @ Claymore, noted that there will be additional duties such as sanitising and sunning toys daily, as well as the playground, bicycles and tricycles after each use.\nNonetheless, she takes it in a positive light.\n“I feel that it’s really not about focusing on these additional duties, but rather about keeping a positive mindset that we are also contributing and doing our part for the community,” she said.\nSOME PARENTS CAN’T WAIT\xa0\nFor all the lingering concerns, there are also parents who are looking forward to their children returning to school.\xa0\nStar Learners’ Ms Pua said she expects 100 per cent attendance on Tuesday, while Pat’s Schoolhouse’s Mdm Teo said all but one of her 50 K1 and K2 children will be returning.\n“When our teachers check in with them online, the children are all really looking forward to coming back,” Mdm Teo added. “We also currently have one K1 child in school right now, and she was so happy when I told her that her friends will be coming back.”\nParents feel home-based learning just cannot measure up to the actual pre-school experience.\n“My children are becoming very bored and socially isolated being at home every day,” said Camille Tan-Mahendran, whose two boys attend an E-Bridge pre-school. “Home-based learning just isn’t doing it for them.”\nAllan Fuller, whose son Leo is in K1 at Pat’s Schoolhouse, said: “Physical attendance in school is critical to our son’s overall development … There is simply no substitute for the in-person classroom dynamic, and we’re grateful he can return.”\nAnd as father of three Andre Lim quipped: “It’s great to have them home these two months, but I think it’s gotten to the point where we’re saying … ‘Please go back to school now’.”\nAdditional reporting by Deborah Wong\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     COVID-19 ', '     circuit breaker ']}"

      Malaysian boy lives alone in Singapore for months, so that he won’t miss school during COVID-19 outbreak
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Malaysian student Koh Ji Sen is in a hurry for school to start on Tuesday.\nFor more than two months, this 14-year-old has been living on his own in Singapore, isolated from his family in Tebrau, a suburb of Johor Bahru.\nMore than anything, he misses the social interaction with others.\n“I feel lonely sometimes because of a lack of support and human contact,” said Ji Sen, who studies at a school in Yishun. “I’m just happy for school to start; it’ll be easier to pass the time.”\nWhen Malaysia declared a nationwide movement control order on Mar\xa016 — during the school holidays — his parents decided that he would have to move to Singapore as soon as possible.\nHis father, Koh Choon Meng had reservations about leaving his son without adult supervision, but he did not want Ji Sen to miss out on school.\n“We were a bit nervous … We didn’t know if he could do it (live alone),” Koh said. “He’s been dependent on my wife all along. If he can’t cope, we’d have to bring him back.”\nThe 51-year-old scrambled to sort out accommodation for the boy, making calls to relatives and friends in Singapore before his uncle offered the use of his place.\nKoh’s uncle had temporarily moved in with his daughter to help take care of his grandchild, so his flat was vacant.\n“I initially said no … I’d be alone. I’d be separated from them (my family),” said Ji Sen. “(But) I was also worried that if I didn’t go to Singapore, I’d miss my lessons.”\nCNA Insider has changed his name and that of his father in this story, for his safety as a minor living alone.\nOn Mar\xa017, the Secondary Two student packed a small bag of clothes, his school backpack and came to Singapore.\nHE HAD TO GROW UP FAST\nWhen his parents dropped him off at his great-uncle’s place, after having dinner together at a nearby shopping centre, Ji Sen’s mother was teary-eyed and his father gave him a long hug.\n“(My mother) was scared that we wouldn’t be able to meet until the end of this year,” said the teenager.\nHe, on the other hand, began to feel “excited”. “I thought I could be independent — no one to control me, to tell me what time to sleep.”\nWith his newfound freedom, he frequently stayed up till past midnight and watched documentaries on YouTube.\nBut while on his own, this boy realised he had to grow up quickly — and learn to do housework such as mopping the floor and balance his S$400 monthly allowance. Previously his mother did all the chores.\n“Suddenly, I had to be an adult. I have to manage money and household chores … buy groceries by myself and choose the vegetables,” said Ji Sen, who has an elder sister studying in Malaysia. “I appreciate my mother more now.”\nFor the first time in his life, he also had to learn how to cook.\nHis first few attempts did not go too well; for example, he overcooked some frozen dumplings, causing the skin to break. He also burned the scallion pancakes he was pan-frying on another occasion.\nBut these days, his cooking is getting better, he reckoned. He can make spaghetti with tomato sauce or heat up frozen Chinese glutinous rice balls on days when he is sick of his usual takeaway food.\nInitially, however, he was reluctant to spend money on groceries. He called home frequently to complain that everything in the supermarket was three times more expensive than in Malaysia because of the exchange rate.\n“I told him to stop comparing the prices and just buy what he needed,” said Koh, who owns a factory in Johor Bahru.\nThrifty by nature, Ji Sen budgets S$12 daily for his meals, which usually would be cai png (economy rice) from a nearby coffee shop. And he keeps a ledger listing his daily expenditure, he said.\nHe does grocery shopping once a month, he added, and tries not to spend more than S$20 each time on frozen food, milk and snacks.\nHe also had to buy more clothes as the weeks became months with Malaysia’s movement control order being extended four times, now until June 9. When he left home in March, he had packed only a week’s worth of clothes.\nMISSING HOME\nBecause of the “circuit breaker”, Ji Sen spends most of his day at home revising his schoolwork, watching YouTube videos and napping. Fearful of contracting COVID-19, he leaves the house only to buy his meals and groceries.\nWithout fail, he calls his family every night, and his father also makes frequent video calls to him to ensure that he is safe.\nBut with every passing week, he has grown homesick and has struggled with feelings of loneliness, especially during the school holidays this month. Previously he had been attending school with a handful of students and was kept busy.\nIt does not help that he can see the Johor Bahru skyline from his bedroom window.\n(The view) makes me miss my parents … Sometimes I’d just look (at Johor Bahru) because I have nobody to talk to and engage (with).\nHe misses playing basketball with his friends, he added, as well as going to the water and adventure park near his home in Tebrau.\nHis father said that when Ji Sen initially called home, he complained that he was homesick and lonely.\n“I encouraged him … and I saw that he was slowly adjusting … He could even cook his own breakfast,” said Koh. “He took this opportunity to grow and has become more independent.”\nTo stave off loneliness, Ji Sen made friends with a neighbour who, upon finding out that he was living alone, offered to help if he needed anything — and also passed him a bowl of home-made green bean soup once.\nHis great-uncle also visits him regularly to check on his well-being.\n“When (the movement control order) was extended, I felt quite sad. I didn’t expect it to be so long,” said the boy. “But school is opening on Tuesday. I feel very good. (There’s) more time to spend in school.”\nSince Primary One, he had been commuting by bus to Singapore, waking up at 4am every weekday to reach school on time, like some other students he knows from Johor — until now.\nMONEY FOR ONLY ONE SON\nJi Sen’s childhood friend and fellow Malaysian, Kenan Chan, wants to continue his studies in Singapore too, but it may be too expensive for him.\nKenan and his elder brother were attending schools here, but they returned home for the March holidays. Both of them were doing home-based learning last month.\n“Going to school is better than doing home-based learning. I can interact with my friends and ask (them) questions in class,” said the 14-year-old.\nThe brothers are unable to commute to school for the new term because of the current travel restrictions. Moving to Singapore temporarily would mean incurring rental costs, said their mother Wong Kaye.\nShe calculated that renting a room for one child would cost about S$300, plus an allowance of S$400, or about RM$2,150 a month.\n“For two boys, (the financial cost) would be too much,” said Wong, who is planning to send only her eldest son to Singapore, as he is taking his N Levels this year.\nShe is in the midst of applying for approvals from both governments so that he can travel out of Malaysia. She is still sorting out his accommodation, as they have no relatives in Singapore.\n“It’s a major decision. Once he goes to Singapore, I won’t know when I can see him. This lockdown could drag till next year. As a mother, I’ll miss him like crazy,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      'I cannot move the lessons online': Educators in remote Indonesia visit students one by one during school closure
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: Rahima Malik, 29, has dreamed\xa0of being a teacher since she was pursuing a teaching degree with a major in Indonesian literature.\xa0\nHer dream came true eventually, with her accepted as a temporary contract teacher at the Folangkai public primary school in her hometown in rural Central Wolwal village on Alor island, East Nusa Tenggara province.\xa0\nHer four\xa0years of teaching made her realise that teaching is full of challenges, especially during a lethal pandemic like COVID-19 where face-to-face interaction is cut down to slow the spread of the virus.\xa0\nMalik has not seen her 11 third-graders for almost two months after the government instructed schools to close and to conduct online learning.\xa0Even though no COVID-19 cases have been reported in their village, the school - built with bricks, woven bamboo and iron sheeting- has to comply with the nationwide closure.\xa0\nBut online learning is not possible, Malik told CNA.\xa0\n“I cannot move the lessons online because the students don’t have a mobile phone or laptop,” she said, adding that not all of their parents own a mobile phone due to poverty and patchy Internet connection.\xa0\nThus, she has no means of communicating with her students during school closure, unless she visits them one by one.\xa0\nTo ensure some form of learning is still taking place amid the pandemic, Malik decided to drop by the kids\' houses every few days to assign them some schoolwork - exercises in their school books. She walks to their houses, which are all located in the same village.\xa0\nMost of the students complete their homework, she said, adding that they do not seem to mind being assigned tasks when school is closed.\xa0\n“I miss teaching,\xa0because at school we used to laugh a lot, they liked to make jokes,” Malik said.\nAcross Indonesia, there are at least\xa03.1 million teachers affected by the pandemic, according to the education ministry.\xa0\nSince schools are closed,\xa0educational programmes prepared by the ministry have been aired on the country’s state-owned public broadcasting television TVRI for the students to watch.\xa0\nBut Malik said the village has no access to TVRI, as they can only receive the signals of two private stations on\xa0their televisions.\xa0\xa0\nNO REGULAR PAYCHECK AND LITTLE INCOME\nAs a temporary contract teacher, Malik\xa0receives her salary\xa0from Indonesia’s school grant programme known by its acronym BOS.\nThe grant, transferred by the central government directly to schools,\xa0can be used to fund school maintenance and contract teachers\' salaries, among others.\xa0\nThe sum received by each school depends on the school status and the number of students it has.\xa0\nMalik earns about 150,000 rupiah (US$10) every three or six months, she claimed, even though\xa0the minimum monthly wage for 2020 in East Nusa Tenggara province is 1.95 million rupiah.\n“But what can I say?\xa0Rather than losing the knowledge (by not using it), it’s better for me to serve the people (despite the low\xa0wage),” she told CNA.\nMalik explained she can survive with the low\xa0wage because her parents are farmers and they live modestly in the village.\nBefore the COVID-19 outbreak, she collected\xa0candlenuts in the mountains every Saturday and sold\xa0them for money.\xa0\nNow that schools are closed, Malik roasts locally-produced coffee beans and grinds them into powder\xa0in between grading her students\' work.\xa0\nShe can earn 5,000 to 10,000 rupiah per day from selling\xa0coffee powder from her home.\xa0\nSince January, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO)\xa0focusing on providing social and humanitarian aid is helping\xa0Malik by providing her with 500,000 rupiah per month and occasionally staple food.\nQURAN TEACHER WITH DISABILITY COMMITTED TO TEACHING\nRidwan Sitorus, 30, a private Quran teacher in Toba Samosir regency, North Sumatra province\xa0is also reeling from\xa0COVID-19.\nBorn with one leg, Sitorus relies on a crutch to walk and has been teaching Quran for 10 years. Prior to the outbreak, he has about 20 students, ranging from pre-schoolers to high school kids.\xa0\nHe was offered a place just about 200m away from his home in 2017 to teach Quran. The premises is owned by a local NGO focusing on Islamic teaching and Quran reading.\xa0\nStudents would drop by after school to study Quran in groups.\xa0\nBut once\xa0the pandemic broke out, the NGO decided it is best to close the premises, and conduct online learning by way of adhering\xa0to the social distancing guidelines.\xa0\n“But we cannot conduct online learning because some students live in areas which do not have Internet connectivity at all.\n“Some of their parents are also poor and unable to teach their children, so I visit them at their homes even if it is just briefly,” Sitorus told CNA.\nNorth Sumatra province has not implemented the large-scale social restrictions, a partial lockdown which enables local governments to enforce regulations on physical distancing and impose sanctions on people who flout the rules.\nNevertheless, residents in Toba Samosir are trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by minimising human contact. Locals are only allowed to visit each other for five minutes, even though no COVID-19 cases have been reported in the remote agency as of Friday (May 29).\xa0\nBut since Sitorus is a teacher, he is allowed by the locals to meet his students for up to 30 minutes.\xa0\nIt is, however, still a challenge to Sitorus, who is dependent on a friend to take him on a motorbike from one village to another to his students\' homes. No public buses serve the routes.\xa0\nConsidering that his\xa0friend has other commitments, Sitorus\xa0cannot set a regular schedule to teach\xa0his students.\xa0\nHe prioritises the preschoolers and primary school kids because the older students can mostly study on their own, he said, adding that he visits about 10 houses a week.\xa0\nSome of the secondary school students also own a mobile phone so they can reach him for a chat.\xa0\n""The students understand that COVID-19 is dangerous, so they don\'t mind the new learning arrangements,"" he said.\xa0\nFor the kindergarteners, he teaches them how to read the script used in Quran. Those who can already understand the script will be taught history as well as the meaning of the verses.\nSitorus said growing up, he was not taught how to read the Quran and had a hard time catching up later in life. Therefore, he\xa0is determined to continue providing Quran lessons to the kids.\xa0\nNot being able to pray together and read the Quran together during the just-concluded Ramadan\xa0made him sad, he added.\xa0\nHowever, he said he was\xa0touched by\xa0the willingness of the locals to still allow some sort of learning during the pandemic.\xa0\nPROBLEMS NOT SOLVABLE WITHIN SHORT PERIOD: MINISTER\nWhile acknowledging the challenges faced by some Indonesian teachers in online learning during school closure, Education Minister\xa0Nadiem Makarim said the solutions cannot be immediately sorted out.\xa0\n“All the solutions to tackle these are future-oriented\xa0and have to be dealt with by\xa0solving the root cause of\xa0equity issues in infrastructure,” Mr Makarim said during an online press conference in mid-May.\nThe minister said he would be working with other ministers to solve the problems.\nFor now, Malik, the contract teacher in Central Wolwal village, hopes\xa0to teach her students at school again soon.\n“I want to teach them soon because they seemed to have forgotten a lot of things I previously\xa0taught\xa0them.\n“I miss them badly.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Don’t expect your kids to return to school seamlessly
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The start of a new school term is a popular parenting meme.\nAmidst a giddy mix of sweat and sun-drenched holiday memories, children say “goodbye” to freedom, stay-at-home mums say “hello” to peace and quiet, and everyone generally braces themselves for pre-dawn alarms and homework. We all know the drill.\nThe upcoming new school term, however, feels like nothing before it. Set to begin on Jun 2, it will be displacing the June holidays – a cherished fixture for many generations.\nIt also follows on the heels of one of the longest school breaks in Singapore’s education history. As part of the COVID-19 circuit breaker measures, schools across the island would have been closed for nearly two months by Jun 2.\nIf that wasn’t complicated enough for students and their families, the month preceding the school reopening has been the most un-holiday-like school-break ever, with a nation of children stuck at home and literally bouncing off the walls.\nEven short jaunts outdoors have been somewhat unsettling, as children emerge into eerily quiet streets, armed with hand sanitisers and a listicle of rules.\nOld haunts such as playgrounds, open fields and garden benches suddenly scream danger with a barricade of red barrier tape. Familiar neighbourhood faces are now to be warily avoided. And a sea of masks hides our children’s smiles and muffles their carefree laughter.\nIndeed, the May holidays was a disorientating time of inactivity and de-socialisation.\nAnd while we look forward to school reopening, it may be good to note that we cannot expect life to instantly snap back to normal. Some children will understandably find it more difficult to assimilate to school life.\nHOW Social Distancing AFFECTS OUR CHILDREN\nIn fact, as schools gradually gear up to reopen around the world, one of the things that educators have been forced to reconsider is the socialisation of children during this great pandemic.\nLast month, a primary school in Zhejiang, China, came up with the idea of asking their pupils to wear self-designed social distancing hats.\xa0\nMade with wooden sticks and colourful cardboard, these hats measure out the one-metre safe distance recommended. This multi-hued dystopian image reminds us of how COVID-19 has invaded and reshaped our children’s world.\xa0\nWhile this headgear will not be sported in Singapore, on May 19, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced new measures for the reopening of schools in Singapore.\nIn primary and secondary schools across the nation, only graduating cohorts in Primary 6 and Secondary 4 and 5 will attend school on weekdays. Other cohorts will rotate weekly between classroom-based and home-based learning.\nStudents from Assumption Pathway School (APS) and North Light School (NLS), as well as preschools will have their return staggered over a period of approximately a week.\nStudents and staff will also be required to wear masks or face shields, and be vigilant about hand-washing and social distancing.\nOn a deeper psychological and social level, the new school term and these new rules may cause general anxiety associated with social relationships and physical contact.\nFor very young children who are learning the basics of socialising, this experience can be disruptive, alienating and stressful.\nAs a mother of a toddler, I find myself struggling to explain to my daughter why it is now bad to stand close to people she likes or spend time chatting with them when we cross paths.\nThis is gradually affecting my daughter’s social experience. When she bumps into her favourite classmate in the park, she seems uncertain about how to spontaneously interact with her friend.\nShy and introverted children of all ages will find it even more difficult to adjust to school reopening. Separated from their peer groups and having socialisation replaced by screens for an extended period, they may find their social anxiety exacerbated. \xa0\nWith parents spending more time with their children during this period, returning to school breaks the comforting routine and will be stressful for kids who may suffer from separation anxiety, according to Stony Brook University’s child and adolescent psychologists Jennifer Keluskar and Debra Reicher and psychiatrist Judith Crowell.\nParents of younger children may expect some crying, screaming or feet-dragging – in many ways, a replay of the first day of school in the middle of the year.\nHelping Our Children With Anxiety\nSocial and separation anxiety are not the only feelings our young ones struggle with.\nHaving lost vital contact with important attachment figures such as grandparents, relatives and friends for a period of time, they may also feel a heightened sense of fear, instability and loneliness.\nWhile adults may be able to rationalise this as a temporary change, albeit without a clear end in sight, children may find it harder to understand or process.\nFor some, it can feel like the world as they knew it and their entire social support system has been threatened or razed to ground overnight.\nGlimpses of news coverage, snippets of adult conversation and the shift in their parents’ mood and behaviour may also affect them on a subconscious level.\nThese stressors will be magnified for families facing job insecurity, financial difficulties or increased domestic conflict and abuse.\nIn fact, studies by humanitarian organisation Save the Children suggest that close to one in four children living under lockdowns, social restrictions and school closures are dealing with feelings of anxiety.\nAnother study conducted in Hubei province, China, where the virus was first reported, found that close to one in five students reported depressive or anxiety symptoms.\nSome of this stress and anxiety may manifest or become more apparent when children return to school. Psychologists suggest that some may be more sensitive or clingy, throw tantrums or cry for no clear reason, appear more withdrawn, or suffer from poor concentration.\nAfter the two-month break in routine, sleep-ins and extended screen-time, they may also take a longer time to adjust to the pace and structure of school.\nHaving said that, parents may celebrate the reopening of school as the return to normalcy but instead of rushing to catch up on lost time, perhaps it will help if they instead focused on the emotional needs of their children during this period of transition.\nIn fact, experts from the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) in the United States recommend talking to children about their fears, empowering them by answering their questions honestly, and showing them lots of love and affection to help them cope with anxiety throughout the pandemic.\nIt also helps to give children time to ease back into the routine of school, and break unwanted habits acquired during the circuit breaker such as extended screen time.\nAccept that some regression such as separation anxiety, social anxiety or discipline issues is understandable. After all, like us, our children have been thrown into the deep end of one of the most surreal and scary global disruptions of our time.\nOver the past few months, many of them have subconsciously carried more worries and anxiety than they may have words for. Armoured with their little masks, they continue to confront a new school term in a socially-distanced world with rules they may not fully understand.\nThey are little heroes in their own right.\nIf we validate their feelings, commend their courage, trust in their resilience and support them through this confusing period of transition, our children, and our bond with them, may yet be strengthened by this trial.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nAnnie Tan is a freelance writer.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     education ', '     circuit breaker ', '     COVID-19 ', '     mental health ']}"

      COVID-19: Graduating primary, secondary students to attend school on weekdays after circuit breaker ends; others to rotate weekly
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Students will return to school in two phases following the end of the “circuit breaker” period on Jun 1, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Tuesday (May 19).\xa0\nGraduating primary school and secondary students, or those in Primary 6 and Secondary 4 and 5, will attend school from Mondays to Fridays when Term 3 starts on Jun 2.\nStudents in other cohorts, or those in Primary 1 to 5 and Secondary 1 to 3, will rotate weekly between home-based learning and returning to school for lessons.\xa0\nFor example, in week 1 of Term 3, Primary 4, 5 and 6 students will attend lessons in school while Primary 1 to 3 students have home-based learning. In week 2, those in Primary 1 to 3 will go to school, while Primary 4 and 5 students will have home-based learning.\xa0\nFor junior colleges and Millennia Institute, “arrangements will be made” for about half of the students to return to school at any one time.\xa0\nA “system of rotation” will be implemented to ensure that all students have “more than adequate” face-to-face time with their teachers, especially the graduating cohorts, said MOE.\n“They are taking their examinations this year. I know we\'ve been trying to dial down the overemphasis on examinations, but I know these students and their parents are getting a lot more anxious,” said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Tuesday.\xa0\n""We want these students to come back on a daily basis to support them because national examinations are coming.""\xa0\nStudents from Assumption Pathway School (APS) and NorthLight School (NLS) will return to school from Jun 2 in a staggered process, allowing all students to be back in school by Jun 8.\n“This arrangement will enable APS and NLS students to make full use of the school facilities for their learning, which is more hands-on in nature.\n“Given the high level of need of students from SPED (special education) schools, we will also stagger their return to school from Jun 2 and allow all students to be back in school by Jun 8.”\xa0\xa0\nK1 and K2 children in MOE kindergartens will also return to school from Jun 2, said the ministry.\xa0\nPhase 2 will take place “in tandem with broader easing at the national level, possibly in a few weeks’ time”, which will see all students return to school from Mondays to Fridays, said the education ministry.\xa0\nFor parents who work in essential services or those who need to return to work after Jun 2 and cannot find alternative care arrangements, their children can do their home-based learning in school.\xa0\n“Contact the school, we are able to take in the child. The child will have a place to do his own home-based learning with some supervision,"" said Mr Ong.\xa0\n""We have always done that for essential workers and children with high needs, and we will continue to do that and extend (it) to the parents who need to work after Jun 2 and don\'t have alternate arrangements.""\nMEASURES IN SCHOOLS TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE\nWith the return of students, schools will implement safe management measures to keep students safe.\xa0\nAll students and staff will have their temperatures taken daily. Any students and staff members who are unwell, or have adult household members who are on home quarantine, stay-home notice or are unwell, will be required to stay at home.\xa0\n""We have 29 student infections so far\xa0since the beginning of this epidemic,"" said Mr Ong.\xa0\n""Two are from overseas, two are unlinked, and the rest are from adult members from their household,"" he said, adding that students will also be asked if any of their family members have respiratory symptoms.\xa0\n""If there is, we\'ll isolate the child, get the child to go home. When the family member recovers, the child can come back,"" he said.\xa0""I think that is really from an abundance of precaution, given the infection pattern of students so far.""\nFixed exam-style seating will be implemented in classrooms, as will spaced seating in canteens or alternative venues. Arrival, dismissal and recess timings will also be staggered to reduce crowds, said MOE.\xa0\nStaff and students will be required to wear their masks or face shields, and schools will clean high-touch surfaces more frequently and disinfect the premises daily.\nTo “ensure that students remain active and keep healthy”, schools will resume Physical Education (PE) lessons when students return, with “strict adherence” to safe management measures.\xa0\n“During PE lessons, students and PE teachers will not be required to wear masks when engaged in strenuous physical activities such as running and workouts,” said MOE.\n“Taking into consideration that students may not be sufficiently prepared physically, the National Physical Fitness Award (NAPFA) this year will be cancelled.”\nAs for the upcoming GCE A Level H3 examinations on May 28, and the GCE O Level and A Level mid-year Mother Tongue Language examinations between Jun 18 and 19, candidates will be required to wear masks or face shields during the examinations, the Education Ministry said.\xa0\nStudents on a home quarantine order, stay-home notice and leave of absence will not be allowed to sit for these examinations and will take year-end examinations instead.\nThose who are on medical leave or are unwell with flu-like symptoms, such as fever or coughing, will also take the year-end examinations instead of mid-year ones.\n“For the examination on H3 subjects taught by Autonomous Universities, there are no year-end examinations. SEAB will apply an established procedure to derive a subject grade for students who miss these examinations due to valid reasons,” said MOE.\nWhile\xa0all tuition and enrichment centre-based learning will continue to be suspended because they bring together students from different classes and schools, MOE centre-based lessons will resume for graduating cohorts from Jun 2, said Mr Ong.\xa0\n“There are students that attend centre-based learning to prepare for their examinations, they are part of the graduating cohort,"" he said.\xa0""These could be ... centres that teach Mother Tongue languages, or examinable subjects such as music and art.""\n“After angsting about it, we decided for this group of (the)\xa0graduating cohort, we will allow their centre-based teaching to continue, but it will be done in small classes, 20 maximum, short periods, one-and-a-half hours, and staggered timings.”\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     MOE ', '     Ministry of Education ']}"

It’s definitely very challenging for me to work on my coursework with such limited items,” she said, adding that she much prefers the school environment where she has access to the necessary resources.\xa0\nAdding that she is “especially stressed” about completing her revision and coursework amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Farisah said she had told her teachers multiple times that wanted to go back to school.\xa0\n“HBL (home-based learning) was very hard and challenging for me and I didn’t want to do it anymore,” she said, adding that she faced challenges across all her subjects, but felt the most stressed about Art and Elementary Math.\xa0\n“I didn’t understand a lot in math (classes), so it was definitely harder for me to just do HBL work online. It was definitely challenging.”\nAs part of the gradual easing of ""circuit breaker"" measures, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced on May 2 that schools would be allowed to reopen for students in small groups for face-to-face lessons from May 19.\nPriority would be given to graduating cohorts and those who needed additional support or school facilities for coursework and practical sessions during the school holidays, which was brought forward this year to May instead of\xa0June.\nCOURSEWORK AND ADDITIONAL SUPPORT\nAbout 70 graduating N-Level and O-Level students returned to Dunearn Secondary school on Tuesday for Design and Technology, Home Economics and Art classes.\nEight teachers and several other technical staff were in school to guide them.\xa0\n“Our priority is for the Secondary 4 and 5 (students), particularly for the coursework. Because during home-based learning there is really this element that cannot be done at home. It has to be conducted under the guidance of the teacher and of course the facility and the equipment is necessary for the students,” said Dunearn Secondary principal Tan Miao Ling.\xa0\nNoting that the Mother Tongue departments are also looking into allowing students to come back to practise for the approaching oral examinations, she added: “Certainly there will be many more subjects as well. We will also have plans in Term 3 in our timetable to support our students further.”\xa0\nAt CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace, teachers identified students that needed more support during home-based learning and invited them back for classes during the holidays.\xa0\nAbout 16 students, all from one Primary 6 class, returned to school on Tuesday for English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue lessons, said principal Karen Tan.\xa0\n“During the HBL, when they submitted their work and teachers were looking through the work, students who had doubts and needed more clarifications or one-to-one time with the teachers, we actually got these children back today,” she added.\xa0\nADDITIONAL SAFE DISTANCING MEASURES IN PLACE\nStudents who came to school on Tuesday were “very cooperative” and all arrived wearing their masks, said Mrs Tan.\xa0\n“One of the things we did have concerns about is whether teachers would be teaching too long, because the girls are in school from 8am to about 1.30pm,” she added.\nThe school has arranged for other teachers to take over some classes to ensure that teachers also get breaks.\n\nAt both Dunearn Secondary and CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace, students were instructed to check in and check out when they entered and left school at staggered timings.\nThey also had their temperature taken, and sat apart from each other in class and during recess.\xa0\nIn response to questions about whether teachers and students will be swabbed before school reopens officially, a Ministry of Education (MOE) spokesperson said that “there is no need to test everyone who has to leave their home, including students and teachers”, because the risk of transmission is significantly lower now, as compared to before the circuit breaker period.\xa0\xa0“Testing is a limited resource and should be prioritised for individuals deemed to be of higher risk or who have close and constant contact with more vulnerable populations such as the elderly and young children,” said the spokesperson.\xa0\n“As for schools, we may do selective testing taking a risk-based approach, for individuals who may have a higher risk of infection, as part of our overall strategy to keep schools safe.”\xa0\nThe Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) had said on May 14 that all teaching and non-teaching staff at pre-schools will be tested by May 26, to reduce the risk of transmission when centres resume full services.\xa0\nAbout 30,000 pre-school and early intervention staff, including teachers, principals, programme staff, administrative staff, cooks and cleaners, are scheduled to take the one-time swab tests.\n\nBoth principals told CNA that some parents have chosen not to have their children return to school for the small group lessons.\nAt CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace, about one-third of the Primary 6 cohort, or 50 students, will not be returning to school either because their parents have opted out or they do not need to come back for academic reasons.\xa0\n“Some of them would be being cautious and not wanting their children to come back, that would be the main reason we see. Because if we talk about the situation before home-based learning and before the holidays, we already had parents who did not want to send their children to school because they wanted to protect their kids and keep them at home,” said Mrs Tan.\xa0\nPrimary 6 student Erica Seah said that while her mother was not so worried about her going back to school, she reminded her to remember to wear her mask at all times and wash her hands often.\xa0\n“She knew that I would want to go back as I did tell her that I was nervous about PSLE (primary school leaving examination) and studying for it on my own for the past month,” said the 12-year-old.\xa0\n“I was extremely excited to come back to school as I could not wait to see my friends and talk to them face-to-face. Over the past month of talking to my friends through social media, texting and video calls, I felt that talking face-to-face was better,\n“Also it felt really good to be back in school as I was reminded of how much school meant to me and how much I love going to school to see my teachers and friends and catch up on work and revision.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      Early admissions exercise for ITE and polytechnics to open in May and June, selection process adjusted for COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Students seeking early admission to the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) for entry in 2021 will be able to do so from\xa0next Wednesday (May 27).\nThe Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) for all five polytechnics will also proceed in June,\xa0despite the COVID-19 situation.\nDue to social distancing measures, EAE selections will largely be conducted via electronic means,\xa0the Education Ministry (MOE) said in a press release on Monday.\xa0These include online interviews and portfolio submissions over email.\nHowever, ""on-campus selection will still need to proceed for some courses, where the selection process cannot be meaningfully replicated in a remote manner,"" MOE said.\nExamples of such courses include\xa0ITE’s Nitec in Nursing and Higher Nitec in Performance Production, as well as Nanyang Polytechnic’s Diploma in Oral Health Therapy, for which an in-person dexterity test will be conducted for shortlisted candidates.\n“In all instances where applicants need to come onto campus, the polytechnics and ITE will ensure that appropriate safe management measures are put in place,” MOE said.\nSuch measures will include staggering assessment slots and designating waiting areas to avoid inter-mingling of applicants. The total number of applicants expected to go to campus for EAE selection is “low.”\n""The EAE is an important admissions route that takes into account students\' demonstrated aptitudes and interests, beyond academic grades,"" the ministry said, explaining its decision not to delay the EAE.\n""Institutions will make appropriate adjustments to their assessment rubrics and criteria, to account for the changes to the selection format this year.\n""They will also continue to document the EAE selection process, including recording interviews where appropriate, and the evaluations made by the selection panels.""\nInstitutions will also continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak and facilitate on-campus selection for more courses if the situation allows, MOE added.\nMOE last week announced similar adjustments to the Direct School Admission exercise\xa0for secondary school and junior college applicants, which has moved entirely online.\nIT SUPPORT\nStudents\xa0from disadvantaged backgrounds who experience difficulties with the EAE’s online selection process will receive support from ITE and the polytechnics.\n""Students who require\xa0additional support with the online process can also approach their schools for assistance,” MOE said.\n""For example, the online interviews and assessments may be conducted in school instead of at home, with IT equipment loaned from the school. School staff will also be present to provide technical support where necessary.”\nStudents seeking early admission to ITE may do so through an online portal from May 27 to Jun 3. For polytechnics, applications for final-year ITE students and O-Level students can be made online from Jun 11 to Jun 17, and Jun 25 to Jul 1 respectively.\nUnder the EAE, successful student applicants are given conditional offers before receiving their final examination results.\nWorking adults who wish to apply to polytechnics can do so online from Jun 8 to Jul 5. They will be assessed based on employment records and employers’ recommendations, in addition to past academic grades.\nInterested applicants can check the MOE website for more information on the ITE EAE and polytechnic EAE.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     education ', '     ITE ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: The coronavirus is sending universities back to school
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Six months ago, few of the world’s academics had taught an online class. Now they’re almost all doing it.\nI asked dozens of them about their experiences. My conclusion: Online education won’t replace the in-person variety, but will complement it.\nUniversity teaching after the pandemic will be blended: A mix of both methods.\nThat could revolutionise universities, help them survive the economic crisis and bring higher education to tens of millions of people who have never set foot on campus.\nLIMITS OF TRADITIONAL TEACHING\nMost academics I heard from aren’t enjoying teaching online. They plunged into the global experiment untrained, to a backdrop of children at home, poor Wi-Fi and lockdown anxiety.\nSome students in online classes are embarrassed by their homes, or are struggling to follow PowerPoint presentations on mobile phones.\nThe human factor is lacking: Zoom kills most jokes. One professor told me the experience had reassured him he would never be replaced by a robot.\nThese accounts fit the long-term record of online education: Though it has grown, dropout rates remain high.\nThe yearning to return to the classroom is reasonable, but also reflects the traditionalism of most universities. Academics, parents, alumni and employers inevitably accord status to the types of learning they themselves experienced decades before.\nSomebody from 1800 walking into a college last year would have recognised most teaching methods.\nThe ancient campus model probably works well for those aged 18 to 24 with several years to spare and well-off families. Yet even this small privileged cohort has just taken an economic wallop.\nIn the largest academic market, the US, fewer families can now stump up US$200,000 or more for a degree. Cash-strapped states won’t help them. Some colleges may fold.\nBut blended education could expand the university market to all ages, classes and countries. In many poorer countries, including China and India, fewer than one person in 20 aged 15-plus had completed tertiary education in 2010, according to the World Bank.\nMany “left-behind” adults everywhere would love to learn from home, get qualifications and change their lives, especially if the pandemic has left them jobless.\nTHE CASE FOR BLENDED EDUCATION\nWe need more adult learners. Their numbers in the UK almost halved between 2004 and 2016, write Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton in The New Long Life.\nDavid Blake and Kelly Palmer of Degreed, an educational technology company, point out that if you ask someone about their current health, the answer, “I ran a marathon 20 years ago” would make no sense.\nYet ask people about their education and they tell you where they studied 20 years ago.\nAs lifespans expand, and technology changes, we should top up our education over the decades, while keeping our jobs and families. University is wasted on the young.\nBlended teaching could help more students enter higher education, argues Chris Stone of Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government.\nHe proposes a model in which some students spend a month on campus, then months studying from home, before returning to campus for the final weeks. That would allow universities to teach multiple cohorts a year, cutting tuition costs.\nStone believes this model could give students all seven elements of university education: Knowledge (what is quantum physics?), skills (doing a case study at business school), content, a credential, networks (with fellow students, faculty or alumni), an institutional affiliation (“I’m a Duke alum”) and, in some cases, entry into elite society (“my college roommate is a senator”).\nAnita Pilgrim, who teaches at the UK’s Open University, which pioneered blended learning, cautions that remote learners need lots of support. Her university has educational advisers who help students find a study-life balance, apply for funding, access resources for dyslexia and so on.\nShe tries to meet students in person when possible. “You can’t just expect them to have a laptop and log in and get on with education. They probably spend their first year … figuring out how to study,” she says.\nINNOVATIVE ONLINE TEACHING\nOther academics, who are innovating daily, gave me examples of online methods that show promise. One is the trend to “flipping”: Students first watch a lecture on video at home, then do assignments in an online class, where the teacher can help them.\nZoom’s “chat” function can get shy students talking. The added value of a classroom is interaction, so anything that isn’t interactive should be done outside class.\nAcademics report seeking more contact with locked-down students, through emails or Zoom calls. They are inviting star speakers for guest appearances, ditching rigid timetables to give short lectures when appropriate and recording videos that answer students’ questions. Some have even reworked their jokes for Zoom.\nTeaching online has shortcomings – but so does in-person teaching. Patrick McDevitt, a historian at the University at Buffalo, says: “Many professors are not brilliant lecturers. Many students skip lectures or spend them on their phones or daydreaming.”\nPersonally, I’ve embraced online education. My wife and I have set up a free lockdown-era “university”, Pandemonium U, which is bringing expert speakers to people stuck at home worldwide.\nThe experience has given me a glimpse of the countless untapped adults yearning to learn.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      All pre-school staff to be swabbed for COVID-19 before centres resume full services
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: All teaching and non-teaching staff at pre-schools will be tested for COVID-19 by May 26, in order to reduce the risk of transmission when centres resume full services.\nAbout 30,000 pre-school and early intervention staff, including teachers, principals, programme staff, administrative staff, cooks and cleaners, will take the one-time swab tests, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said in response to questions from CNA on Thursday (May 14).\nThe Government will pay for the one-time exercise in May, according to documents sent to pre-school staff by ECDA and seen by CNA.\nBATCHED, INSTEAD OF INDIVIDUAL TESTS\nTo facilitate faster testing, swab samples from up to five pre-school staff will be tested in one batch instead of individually, said ECDA in the circular.\nSome people may have to return for a second individual test if the batch test is positive, it added.\n“After pre-school services fully resume, we will consider a risk-based testing system to protect children and staff,” an ECDA spokesperson told CNA.\nSWABBING CENTRES AT POLYTECHNICS\nThe tests will be conducted between Friday and May 26 at four swabbing centres at polytechnics, according to the documents sent to pre-school staff. These centres will be segregated from the rest of the campus.\nThose being tested will not be allowed to make their own way to the designated swabbing centres. They will have to take authorised shuttle buses, which will pick them up from either Woodlands MRT, Tampines West MRT, Dover MRT and Khatib MRT.\n\nThey will be informed of their appointment slot, pick-up time and pick-up venue by their respective pre-schools.\nAs part of ""circuit breaker"" measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, all pre-schools, kindergartens and student care centres suspended their general services on Apr 8.\nThey remain open to provide limited services  to students whose parents are in essential services such as healthcare.\nAbout 10,000 children, or 5 per cent of all children enrolled in pre-schools in Singapore, have made use of those limited services during the circuit breaker period, ECDA has said previously.\nThe circuit breaker period, originally set to end on May 4, has since been extended until Jun 1.\nFurther updates on the approach for the reopening of pre-schools will be announced “in due course”, said the ECDA spokesperson.\nCLOSE AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH CHILDREN\nPre-school staff have been given priority for testing due to their close and constant contact with children in an enclosed setting, said the ECDA spokesperson.\nThis is part of increased monitoring to “provide assurance to preschool staff and families to support the phased opening up of general services”.\n“We recognise that these precautionary tests will bring inconvenience to pre-schools and staff, and seek their understanding and support to safeguard the health and well-being of our preschool community,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe tests are the latest precautionary measures to be implemented in pre-schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among children.\nTo enable contact tracing, pre-schools that continue to operate during this period are now required to use the SafeEntry system to log the entry and exit of children, staff and visitors, ECDA said in its circular.\nEarlier measures include travel declarations for staff, children and visitors, health checks, suspension of group and communal activities, restriction of visitors and safe distancing measures.\nAll staff, as well as children who are at least two years old, are also required to wear masks.\n\nThere have been several cases of infections in pre-schools.\nOn Apr 13, ECDA announced that the Jurong branch of E-Bridge Preschool would be closed temporarily after a child tested positive for COVID-19.

      Commentary: Arts and humanities can set you up for life in post-coronavirus world
  </h1>, 'text': 'ANN ARBOR, Michigan: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed many things about the world and our lives in it.\xa0\nAs more places reopen from shutdowns, preparing for the post-pandemic future has taken on new urgency, not least for those concerned about education and employment prospects in a reshaped world economy that may take years to recover from the deepest recession in nearly a century.\nIt might seem obvious Singaporeans should increase our longstanding focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), given the pandemic’s origins and solutions in these fields.\nYet it is the involvement of humanities scholars that is being credited with enabling the German government to reopen its economy. \xa0\nPhilosophers, historians, theologians, jurists and pedagogical experts outnumbered scientists and medical specialists on an advisory group convened to decide reopening issues relating to ethics, law, human and social behavior, political power and the role of government in balancing the needs of health, the environment and the economy.\xa0\nThis has not happened in the United States, which has not been notably successful in combating the pandemic.\nYet here the arts and humanities are becoming increasingly important to technological advance, business, tech employment, and STEM education itself.\xa0\nAs Microsoft President Brad Smith, and Executive Vice President of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Research Harry Shum wrote in 2018: ""Skilling up for an AI-powered world involves more than science, technology, engineering, and math. As computers behave more like humans, the social sciences and humanities will become even more important.”\n“Languages, art, history, economics, ethics, philosophy, psychology and human development courses can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that will be instrumental in the development and management of AI solutions.""\nHUMANS AT THE HEART OF A WORLD OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY\nCOVID-19 will accelerate trends toward digitalisation, automation and AI.\xa0 We already know that in the future workspace, humans and machines will work together as a team, collaborating intelligently to enhance each other’s complementary strengths.\nHumans are good at solving problems requiring adaptability, creativity, and social skills. Machines can analyse large amounts of data at a high speed impossible for humans, and can outperform humans on well-defined questions — for example, enabling much faster analysis of the COVID-19 virus and development of treatments for it.\nFor the human-machine partnership to function optimally, we should understand how the two agents can most effectively augment each other, and how to redesign the interaction process to support this.\nTake automated vehicles, which have huge economic and safety benefits. According to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), vehicle automation ranges from level 0 (no automation) to level 5 (full automation).\nAlmost all automated vehicles on the road are at level 2 (partial automation), where the vehicle can control steering, accelerating and decelerating but the human driver is responsible for monitoring the environment and retaking control from the automated vehicle if it reaches its performance limit.\nAt level 3 (conditional automation), the vehicle will have “environmental detection” capabilities, but still require human override in corner cases. In level 4 (high automation), the vehicle can perform all driving functions under certain conditions and in certain areas.\nFor other conditions and areas, humans still need to drive, which hinges on the design of novel human-machine interfaces.\nCan we expect a human driver who has been watching movies or texting friends in a level 3 automated vehicle to quickly move attention to the driving task, comprehend what is happening in the environment, and perform an appropriate maneuver, all within seconds?\nHow do we design better interfaces to help the human driver negotiate takeover transitions? To answer such questions, we need to better understand humans, their cognitive, physical and emotional capabilities, for which the arts and humanities are necessary.\nECONOMICS AND BUSINESS\nAccording to Northwestern University professors Gary Saul Morson and Morton Schapiro, economic models fail when they lack human understanding, specifically culture, stories and ethical considerations.\nThey recommend studying literature, since novels help develop empathy by requiring readers to see the world as their stories’ characters do.\xa0\nNobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller also argues that popular stories which affect individual and collective economic behavior are what move markets.\nFor example, fear of ""technological unemployment"" -- a narrative that robots were taking people\'s jobs — created panic which exacerbated the stock market plunge during the Great Depression of the 1930s.\nOn the personal career front, top executives interviewed by the World Economic Forum in 2016 identified ten essential skills for business success: complex problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, people management, coordinating with others, emotional intelligence, judgment and decision making, service orientation, negotiation skills and cognitive flexibility.\xa0\nAcademic commentator Richard Greenwald concluded that these skills are rooted in liberal arts education, explaining that so many Fortune 500 and tech startup CEOs have liberal arts degrees because “the liberal arts alone provides the basis for leadership, lifelong learning, and a meaningful life.”\xa0\nThe late Steve Jobs famously said at a 2011 Apple product launch: “It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough — it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our heart sing.”\nAlong the same lines, a 2018 Linked-In survey found that 57 per cent of leaders said that soft skills like leadership, communication and collaboration were more important than hard skills.\xa0\nA 2015 British Council study in 30 countries found that 55 per cent of the 1,700 corporate, non-profit and government leaders surveyed had either a social sciences or humanities bachelor’s degree, more common among younger leaders (aged under 45).\nOther US labour market surveys show liberal arts graduates’ employment in STEM fields in the US has grown much faster than that of computer science and engineering graduates; and that liberal arts graduates make up a larger percentage of today’s tech workforce than technical graduates do.\xa0\nThis is because STEM companies need employees who can understand and communicate with diverse users and partners, and contribute to the creative and ethical processes of developing technology for the market.\xa0\nMost jobs in STEM fields are non-STEM, from sales and marketing, to people and product management, training and support services. Among humanities graduates, the biggest group go on to management positions (15 per cent), followed by office and administrative positions (14 per cent), sales (13 per cent), education (12 per cent), business and finance (10 per cent).\nRapid technological change and increased volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity mean most people will change jobs, perhaps frequently, during their careers. Liberal arts education helps provide the broad disciplinary preparation, flexibility and adaptability, critical and imaginative thinking, that will facilitate the constant reskilling required.\xa0\nTHE IMPLICATIONS FOR SINGAPORE\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \nSingapore comes second only to the US in the Swiss business school IMD’s 2019 world digital competitiveness ranking.\xa0\nYet without developing greater competencies in the arts and humanities, we risk losing out as higher levels and ever greater portions of global tech value chains are increasingly accounted for by activities and skills derived from them, and “hard” skills become obsolete or more readily automated.\nA 2019 Brookings Institution study forecasts that computer programmers, financial advisers, and certain types of engineers and software developers are among those whose jobs are most likely to be displaced by AI. More of the jobs which remain will require more durable “soft” skills, which engagement with the arts and humanities can develop.\nBut the arts and humanities are also desirable for their own sake, both as expressions of our humanity, and as a valuable consumption good.\xa0\nThe COVID-19 lockdown experience saw an explosion of arts activity online, with choirs, orchestras, bands, dance concerts, play readings, art lessons and the like spontaneously self-organizing, even across national boundaries.\n“Streaming wars” among “hard” tech companies like Amazon and Apple as they venture into the entertainment space, chasing an “old-line” company like Disney, illustrate the growing importance of arts content in the world of tech, and of tech in the world of the arts, something already familiar to millions of video gamers the world over.\nThe arts and humanities are also necessary for understanding consumer behavior, since the consumer is a human being evolving in particular historical, sociological, psychological and cultural contexts that they study and express.\nIt is impossible to serve her without understanding these contexts, for example through “design thinking”, increasingly viewed as a core business capability.\nMachine learning and data analytics can yield patterns of consumer behavior, but interpreting them relies on insights gleaned from the arts and humanities.\xa0 Thus employers’ demand for such graduates has increased as developments in data analytics and AI progress.\nFor Singapore, the unique value we can deliver to the nearly all-encompassing world of global tech is our understanding of people and societies in our own regional neighborhood. For this, we will need to expand our competencies beyond STEM and the Western world of digitalisation to include the humanities, and the visual, performing and literary arts of our Southeast Asian neighbors.\xa0\nIn education, the arts and humanities provide a means of engaging students with STEM disciplines and with business. There are STEAM (A for Arts) programmes in many American K-12 schools, and in Singapore.\nThe professional theater company Shakespeare-in-Detroit collaborates with Detroit Public Schools educators to teach “the Science of lighting production, the Technology of sound design, the Engineering or construction of a form or costume, the Art of classical performance, and the Mathematics of building a set … along with development of soft skills such as communication and confidence” and increased literary competencies.\nOxford University’s Said Business School uses the performing arts to teach business leadership in its MBA programme.\nThe US’ National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2018 report on The Integration of the Humanities and Arts with the Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in Higher Education concluded that integrating arts and humanities with STEMM education (the second M standing for Medicine) is strongly associated with improved written and oral communications skills, teamwork skills, ethical decision making, critical thinking and deeper learning, strong content mastery, general engagement and enjoyment of learning, empathy and resilience, ability to apply knowledge in real-world settings and science literacy.\nAll of these have labour market, job performance and broader economic payoffs.\xa0\nOne example is the University of Michigan’s Integrated Product Development course jointly taught by an art and design, and a business professor, in which students from engineering, design and business explore together the creative, technological and business-related questions involved in developing new products from ideation and prototyping to production and bringing to market.\xa0\nFinally, arts practitioners are often at the frontier of unearthing and examining social issues.\xa0\nThe COVID-19 crisis among foreign workers reminds us of the Singapore arts community’s proactive role in highlighting and creating empathy for their dilemma in our midst, through numerous plays, poetry, stories, photography exhibitions, and films which have won showings and awards at international festivals, like Ilo Ilo (Cannes, 2013), I Dream of Singapore (Singapore, 2019;\xa0Berlinale, 2020) and A Land Imagined (Locarno, 2018). Heeding their efforts could have pre-empted our current crisis.\nTo advance in technology, which requires human engagement, we need to also advance in the arts and humanities.\xa0 Transition to a post-COVID-19 world more heavily dependent on technology, and more aware of both the shortcomings and potentials of human society under crisis, is a good time to do this.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nLinda Lim, Gunalan Nadarajan and Jessie Yang are Singaporean professors at the University of Michigan.

      Direct School Admission applications to open May 12, selection process tweaked due to COVID-19
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Students applying to secondary schools and junior colleges through the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise for entry in 2021 will be able to do so from Tuesday (May 12).\nDSA exercises will proceed despite the COVID-19 situation and will not be delayed “unnecessarily”, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said in a press release on\xa0Monday.\n“As part of our continued emphasis on holistic education and broadening definitions of success, we want to preserve this pathway for this year’s primary and secondary school graduates, and not delay the exercises unnecessarily.”\nEducation Minister Ong Ye Kung previously announced that the DSA exercise this year will proceed, with some adjustments in how schools evaluate students in light of COVID-19 social distancing measures. This includes conducting interviews through video-conferencing tools.\nNo physical trials or face-to-face interviews will be part of the DSA selection process, MOE said on Monday.\n“Instead, all interviews and selection for shortlisted DSA candidates will be done via electronic modes (e-modes).\n“This avoids inter-mingling of students across schools, in line with safe distancing measures.\n“It would also provide all students with access to video-conferencing capability, suitable venues and equipment, with standardisation of the setting and equipment to ensure fairness in the selection process.”\nDSA EXERCISE AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nDuring the selection assessment, MOE explained, DSA schools will use e-modes which students are already familiar with like video conference and performance tasks.\n“Students may also be asked during the e-interviews to perform simple tasks that can demonstrate their attributes and potential in a specific talent area, such as via simple pencil sketches or musical performances.\n“We recognise that there might be limitations in assessing students via e-modes for certain talent areas, like team sports,” MOE said, noting that events like the National School Games and Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation cannot be used to assess students.\n“DSA schools will need to rely more heavily on students’ track records in school and information provided in their application.”\nSchools will also look at other information about students, like their co-curricular activity (CCA) records and past achievements.\nAddressing whether this would put students with little or no prior training or formal certification at a disadvantage, MOE said DSA schools will also consider various qualities and attributes.\n“Schools will continue to shortlist students with potential, exemplary character and desirable personal qualities, regardless of whether they had prior training or formal certification.\n“This ensures that students from less advantaged backgrounds, who may not have the resources to acquire formal training, are given due consideration.”\nDIRECT ENTRY TO SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR COLLEGES\nThe DSA allows students to gain direct entry to secondary schools or JCs based on their talents and achievements, beyond their performance at the national examinations.\nHowever students are still required to take the PSLE or the GCE O-Level examination. If a\xa0DSA offer is made, students will need to make a decision to take up the offer by the deadline, which will be before the release of the national examination results.\nFor students applying to a secondary school, they may do so through an online portal from May 12 to Jun 5.\nApplicants need to fill in\xa0one online form to apply to multiple schools and talent areas, and can indicate up to three choices. A parent’s SingPass login will be needed for application through the online portal.\nFor those applying to JCs, MOE urged applicants to check the DSA-JC website for important dates and timelines or the respective JC websites.\nThere will also be financial assistance for students who need it through schemes like the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), Opportunity Fund, Independent School Bursary (ISB), the Edusave Scholarship for Independent Schools (ESIS) and the UPLIFT Scholarship.\nIn total, there are 146 secondary schools and 20 JCs participating in the DSA this year.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Commentary: It is time to rethink how we do online education
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: According to the joint guidance issued by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the United Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), schools in countries that have confirmed transmission of the novel coronavirus have been urged to support students holistically and through strategies such as remote learning as the world copes with this emerging health crisis.\xa0\nAs of Apr 26, 189 countries across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America have implemented school and university closures. Singapore is one of them.\xa0\nSchools and colleges have been rolling out virtual instruction and online learning, allowing students to continue their studies without interruption.\xa0\nNaturally, there is a surge in the demand for high-quality and effective learning solutions to bridge the transition into home-based learning.\nSome of the leading institutes of higher learning in our country like the Singapore Management University and Singapore Institute of Technology have been ahead of the curve in embracing technology and integrating online learning in their curriculum.\xa0\nHowever, for most other institutions, this is all a bit sudden and they have minimal experience in online learning solutions. Before the pandemic, online learning solutions were considered as a ""nice to have"" option but now they have become a necessity.\xa0\xa0\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY\nThe Edutech industry is set to be worth in excess of US$252 billion (S$357 billion) by the end of 2020.\xa0\nWith an estimated future market value of US$5 trillion, it is easy to see the scale of the opportunities at hand.\xa0\nHowever, with its current value sitting at only 5.4 per cent of the entire education sector, Edutech is still far from reaching its full potential.\xa0\nNo wonder then that there is a lack of adoption of education technology solutions in schools in Singapore – a gap that has been highlighted by COVID-19.\nRight now, educational institutions in Singapore are forced to adopt the quickest and most easily available online learning solutions at hand. And, there is no doubt that apps like Zoom and Hangouts are helping the world survive.\xa0\nFrom home-based learning to parent-teacher-meets - everything is easily possible on these platforms.\xa0\nThe thing is parents will be more receptive to Edutech\xa0only if they are sure that it is a safe space with one of the biggest challenges with online learning solutions is ensuring privacy and security.\nUnfortunately, hackers are already taking advantage of the pandemic to prey on unsuspecting online learners.\xa0\nEarlier this month, there were\xa0hacking incidents reported by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore when some classes on video-conferencing platform Zoom were hijacked mid-stream, with pornography shown.\xa0\nFor a brief period, the MOE banned the use of Zoom apps in Singapore schools after this incident.\xa0\nHowever, MOE has progressively allowed schools to resume the use of Zoom after introducing three additional layers of defence.\xa0\nThey include an all-encompassing ""security button"" which consolidates the conferencing platform\'s security features.\nThe lesson here is that if an incident of this magnitude can happen on a global video-conferencing app like Zoom, one can only imagine the limitations of unverified small organisations.\xa0\nSecurity is one of the most important concerns when it comes to online learning solutions, however, it is not the only concern when it comes to online education.\xa0\nGOING BEYOND VIRTUAL CLASSROOMS\nEducation is not just about imparting the syllabus in whatever means possible - it entails tracking progress, sharing feedback, interacting with students and helping them learn in a holistic manner.\xa0\nWith artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, technology today provides the tools to take education to an altogether different level.\xa0\nThen, why are we limiting it to virtual classrooms?\xa0\nAs the education sector embraces digital transformation as a necessity, amidst this pandemic, it is barely scratching the surface.\xa0\nWith the current means being used, education has almost been reduced to content dissemination.\xa0\nEventually, the priority needs to shift from finding the quickest option at hand that broadcasts information to finding solutions that capitalise on the relationship between students and teachers to augment teaching and create learning personalisation and independence.\nHOLISTIC ONLINE LEARNING WITH LMS\nAs students’ expectations around technology-enabled learning rise, now that they have had a taste of it, they will seek flexible alternatives to traditional on-campus learning models even after the pandemic.\xa0\nEducational institutions need to move beyond Zoom classes and embrace online learning holistically.\xa0\nOne way to do that is via the Learning Management System (LMS) - an online platform where you can develop, administer and track educational programmes and courses.\xa0\nLMSs are used to create and deliver curriculums that students can follow both online and offline. You can provide all types of content that include videos, courses and documents while managing and tracking everything online.\xa0\nLMSs include features such as rubrics, discussion boards, a syllabus and teacher-led learning.\xa0\nIt is secure, easily accessible and allows for student-teacher interaction. Additionally, an LMS is far more secure than live streaming online platforms that are free to the public.\nFor starters, all users are authenticated before they are granted access. A reliable LMS uses cryptographic protocols and encryption to ensure the confidentiality and security of user data.\xa0\nPlus, there is an asynchronous encrypted data transfer to off-site storage to ensure that client services can be restored in the event of a disaster.\xa0\nWith standard compliance regulations for data integrity and confidentiality in place, institutions can opt for certified LMS service providers for maximum security.\xa0\nSome LMSs integrate live streaming capability in a seamless manner, like the one deployed by SIM Global Education, which can deliver a virtual classroom experience while allowing users to access related learning content, all done within a secured environment.\xa0\nThe LMS market is already booming.\xa0\nAccording to a report by Market Research, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest-growing LMS market in the coming years, with the highest compound annual growth rate of over 19.75 per cent during the years 2019 to 2027.\xa0\nSeveral countries in the region, including Singapore, China, Japan and South Korea\xa0have adopted LMS solutions in their educational institutes owing to the growing Edutech industry and ever-increasing mobile usage and internet penetration.\xa0\nKey industry stakeholders have realised the significance of effective integration between connected devices in the eLearning process. Students are increasingly accessing online learning on mobile devices.\nIncreasing computing power and rich features on these devices make for a dynamic and holistic learning experience. Institutions offering post-secondary education need to embrace mobile learning to engage students and provide them with better accessibility.\xa0\nThe one size fits all approach that has dominated education for so long does not work anymore. Using an LMS allows teachers to identify areas of weakness and assign work to help each individual student improve. Custom made study plans in this manner are the future of education.\xa0\nIMMERSIVE LEARNING FOR BETTER ENGAGEMENT\nImmersive learning or blended learning is yet another way in which technology can make education more holistic, interactive and insightful.\xa0\nWith immersive learning, students can be engaged through an artificial environment that simulates situations, in which the information could be applied. Traditional immersive learning approaches involve field trips or adaptive learning in the classroom.\xa0\nA focused example of this could be flight simulator training for pilot-learning schools or virtual dissections during biology classes.\xa0\nAn added benefit to the online simulations is that students can practice repeatedly with no time limitations or peer pressure giving them better opportunities for success.\nSimulations like this are great homework assignments or practice assessments to support face-to-face instruction. Immersive learning is a great way to create competency-based programmes and is also an authentic assessment tool.\nAnd, with the ever-increasing growth of augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality and extended reality, immersive learning experiences can be richer and more effective now.\nACTIVE LEARNING WITH VIRTUAL WHITEBOARDS\nResearch shows that one-third of instructors who try online teaching eventually end up with passive classes. Perhaps a key reason is that some fail to exploit the full potential of web conferencing tools to overcome passivity.\xa0\nThis is where virtual whiteboards can be used to influence student motivation levels by creating an active learning environment.\xa0\nFirst, it is important to understand that a virtual whiteboard is different from an interactive whiteboard.\xa0\nA virtual whiteboard is basically a software solution that includes white-boarding functions like writing, drawing, and annotating.\xa0\xa0\nVirtual or digital whiteboards often exist as part of a software suite, online, or both for easy sharing and collaboration.\xa0\nThese online whiteboards are versatile teaching tools that allow screen recording, screen sharing, virtually infinite board space, multimedia options, multi-device integration as well as remote input.\nVirtual whiteboards not only work as a means of delivering content but they allow collaborations within lessons and saving results for review or re-use.\xa0\nThe rush of rolling out online learning may leave a sour taste about home-based learning and this could impact the decision of whether schools are revolutionised by the experience or will revert to what they know.\xa0\nHowever, to be ready for a better, more holistic online education system, schools need to embrace technology in the form of more holistic solutions like the LMS and move beyond content dissemination eventually.\nNick Hutton is the Regional Director of Asia at D2L.\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Children bored during the COVID-19 circuit breaker? Try these family-friendly online activities
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Framed maps, artefacts placed in shining glass cases\xa0and a voice guiding you through the display halls.\xa0\nThese are physical elements of the National Heritage Board’s (NHB) An Old New World exhibition, now painstakingly replicated online for anyone to enjoy.\xa0\nLocated on NHB’s heritage portal Roots.sg, the virtual exhibition offers a 360-degree pan of the exhibition hall and a guided tour exploring Singapore’s story up to its founding in 1819.\nIt is one of many activities offered by NHB\xa0under\xa0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bthe tagline #SGCultureAnywhere on Roots.sg, NHB’s heritage resource portal, which provides people with their “heritage fix from home”.\n“Digitising our heritage content so that more people can have access to it has always been one of NHB’s priorities\xa0and the public has\xa0been very receptive to such digital measures so far,” said deputy director of organisation design and innovation Jervais Choo.\n“Especially during these challenging times, we hope that the digital offerings we have lined up will provide a much needed ‘culture boost’ to uplift spirits for all of us at home and allow us to take the opportunity to learn something new about the world around us.”\nThese activities would also give children and families a chance to explore and discover Singapore’s heritage and culture together, he added.\nWith almost a month left to the end of the ""circuit breaker"", other family-friendly attractions including Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) and KidZania Singapore have also rolled out activities for children to do at home.\n“As a conservation-minded wildlife organisation, education is a key pillar for WRS and we see our zoological parks as living classrooms for early childhood and multi-disciplinary learning,” said director of education May Lok.\nWith its in-house education arm, WRS was able to quickly convert its resources into digital content for its online platforms.\n“Our online resources include STEAM (Science, Technology, Environment, Arts, Maths) components so that children learn other disciplines while learning about wildlife,” said Ms Lok.\nSome of these activities include the “Animals We Love” series, which offers online activity packs for pre-schoolers and primary school children to teach them about animals from River Safari and the Singapore Zoo.\nFor now, children will learn about orangutans, giant freshwater stingray and Komodo dragons, but the list will expand as WRS moves across its four zoological parks.\nChildren may also access ebooks on giraffes at the Singapore Zoo, with content on tigers, elephants and giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia coming up. The ebooks will have a voiceover feature.\nMeanwhile, indoor family entertainment centre KidZania Singapore is introducing craft activities, science experiments, stretching and breathing exercises and kid-friendly recipes on their Facebook and Instagram pages for children.\nThis is part of a worldwide #KidZaniaAtHome initiative, said acting general manager Wayne Lim.\nMembers of the public seem to have have responded well to the initiatives so far.\n“Feedback has been encouraging and parents have welcomed the idea of bringing the zoo right into their homes to vary the learning experience for their children,” said Ms Lok.\nMr Lim also reported an average organic engagement rate of 2 per cent and growing for its #KidZaniaAtHome initiatives, as it introduced more interactive elements such as quizzes and contests to encourage active participation.\n“Our #KidZaniaAtHome content has been performing above industry average and we are confident that it will continue to perform better,” said Mr Lim.\nWhile most of these initiatives will last only until the end of the circuit breaker, the\xa0attractions said that digital content could become a staple after that.\nKidZania Singapore will move towards using more digital content, said Mr Lim, as they have “seen a shift” in how their target audience view and access content.\n“We will continue to offer engaging digital content that complements our core belief of learning through role-play,” he said.\nWRS too will use online resources as part of pre- and post-park engagement for parents to prepare their children for their experience in the parks and to continue even after the visit, said Ms Lok.\nThere will also be autism-friendly resources like sensory maps and social scripts to help families plan ahead and have a stress-free experience in their parks.\nHere are some more online initiatives offered by other attractions:\nGARDENS BY THE BAY\nThe #StayHomeWithGB initiative offers craft activities and e-books for children. Parents can also play videos that feature Gardens by the Bay’s horticulturalists showcasing parts of the Gardens. They may also email plant questions in to the Plant Doctor\xa0and the horticulturalists will answer them.\nESPLANADE – THEATRES ON THE BAY\nThe Esplanade Offstage offers free content for children, from comics and stories to videos, podcasts and quizzes. Children can sing along to songs from the Esplanade’s PLAYtime! Productions with karaoke sing-along videos.

      Commentary: Don't stress over your kids' education this circuit breaker. There are other ways they are learning
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: There is a lot of information currently available online showing the high expectations people are setting for themselves during the circuit breaker.\nThis can be anywhere from working longer hours because the clarity between home and work is fading and\xa0feeling that they should come through the circuit breaker with new skills or goals.\nI have seen many instances where people are learning a new language, coding or pushing themselves to complete fitness challenges.\nWhile\xa0these are great ways to improve oneself during the circuit breaker and keep occupied, they can also represent the high expectations we\xa0place\xa0on ourselves to remain productive.\nEngaging in such activities allows us to feel that we are contributing somehow to our lives because we have been accustomed to the need to be constantly productive and gainfully engaged.\nKEEPING KIDS ENGAGED\nFor parents, these expectations are heightened by the feeling that they ought to be able to support their children in their home-based learning (HBL) curriculum effortlessly.\nAgain, I have heard of parents feeling guilty around their difficulties in teaching their children while\xa0also engaging them through a relentless list of creative exercises – like art and craft or social media dance videos - that they receive from other well-meaning parents.\nEven during the circuit breaker, the race to keep up is real.\nNeedless to say, this adds to the expectation that parents ought to be able to do it all. And if they can’t meet these expectations, it heightens\xa0their sense of anxiety.\nFor parents with school-going aged children or children who will be sitting for national examinations like the PSLE or GCE O-Levels, there is immense fear around their children’s preparedness.\nFeeling the pressure, parents may also set these expectations for their children - ensuring\xa0that the kids not only keep up with their academic learning but also engage in new and creative undertakings.\nPARENTS TAKE THE LEAD\nThe most important thing parents can do is recognise that they play a huge role in their children’s emotional and psychological well-being. Children model themselves after their parents.\nSeveral theories in psychology, such as the social learning theory, explain that children pick up on the slightest changes in their parents’ mood and behaviour.\nSome children internalise these changes and feel responsible for their parents’ well-being.\nAs such, the first thing to do as a parent is to recognise times when you are placing pressure on yourself.\nConsider what you’d like to achieve for yourself. What are the emotions underlying these pressures?\nApply these to your children. What are you hoping to achieve? What would you like them to gain?\nSTRUCTURE IS NOT ALWAYS NEEDED\nChildren respond well to structure and consistency. Set a routine and follow a schedule.\nBut children also naturally tap into their creative minds. They do not need structure or learning for that.\nPsychological approaches will tell you that it is important to allow your child the free time to play and be creative.\nPlaying is not a passive act. Children do not play idly. During play, children think, connect and create.\nFor example, by learning in school about gravity and motion, children think about those experiences, incorporate them into their play and then create new connections.\nPlay, in this view, is just as important as education and is also a form of education.\nPlay also teaches prosocial behaviour and allows the development of imagination and creativity.\nENCOURAGE PLAY, NOT DEVICES\nIt is also important to remove devices during this time. Children may be spending increasingly more time on devices during the circuit breaker as HBL\xa0gives them the flexibility of time to do so.\nThis leads to pent up frustrations and restlessness. Research has also shown that notifications on electronic devices can stimulate the release of dopamine, a brain chemical involved in cravings and desire, which can make the use of such devices addictive.\nIt is recommended that screen time is limited and used in moderation.\nParents can consider creating a space to play at home; consider placing materials that tap into their kids’ creativity during this time.\nYou may consider leaving story books, blocks, pretend-play toys, puzzles and art supplies around so your child can explore their environment and tap into their own creativity.\nGet creative together. Art can be so powerful because it makes you escape for a little bit as it puts you in that mindfulness zone.\nArtwork has been shown through years of research to promote emotional regulation as well as to facilitate the communication process. As such, it serves as an effective coping mechanism. Art can be accessed by children regardless of their age and verbal abilities.\nIt is also a great hack for parents looking for something to occupy their kids for a longer period of time, while giving kids\xa0a tangible outcome of their efforts to be proud of and to boost self-esteem.\nThey can actually reflect and say: ‘I did that and it looks good’.\nLEARNING CAN COME IN MANY WAYS\nAs adults, if we are doing this ourselves, then we are showing good habits to our children.\nTake time out of your busy, strange lives at the moment, by doing something like cooking, crochet or colouring with your children.\nDoing such activities together will go a long way in teaching your children life skills and allowing you to bond as a family.\nAbove all, recognise that this is an unprecedented time. No one has ever had any experience to prepare for this. We are all learning and adjusting at the same time.\nWe are in a huge transition and it is extraordinarily difficult. Be kind to yourself and your children.\nI can sense the anxiety parents might have about children falling behind, but just make sure they do a little bit, often, so that they are still engaged in the daily routine of learning.\xa0\nThis goes back to the importance of routine and also the process of learning, which is made up of a series of building blocks – each at a time.\nKnow that learning is a journey – so there is no time lost. The expectation of continuous learning during times of uncertainty is hard to achieve.\nA child needs to be physically and psychologically well to be ready to learn so focus on your children’s psychological wellbeing knowing that it is directly tied with yours.\nWhen your children feel connected to you, they will feel safe and secure and ready to face the world. When their anxieties are at bay and they can make sense of their emotions, they will be ready to take on new challenges and be ready to learn.\nKnow that they will be able to bounce back, some requiring more help than others, when normalcy returns and when they have a perceived sense of control over their lives.\nUntil then, children of today are learning many lessons – the biggest lesson is that of resilience and that they can and will bounce back from life’s adversities. We just need to be kind to ourselves.\nDr Sanveen Kang is a Clinic Manager & Principal Clinical Psychologist at Psych Connect.

      ‘Not worth the risk’: Parents in Malaysia apprehensive about sending children to daycare despite easing of COVID-19 curbs
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Parents in Malaysia are refraining from sending their children to daycare facilities and adopting a wait-and-see approach for now, despite the easing of COVID-19 restrictions this week that allowed such centres to resume operations.\nMs R Vichitra, 29, told CNA that despite the need for someone to care for her two children while she is at work, she was “not quite ready” to send them to daycare.\n“No matter how many precautions we take, even if one person lets it slip, it can harm not only our children but other children too,” said the nurse on Tuesday (May 5).\nHer husband is a doctor and before the movement control order (MCO) was eased, they had to rely on a live-in helper to take care of their children, who are one and four years old respectively.\nWith the easing of restrictions, they can now send the children from Kuala Lumpur to Selangor to be cared for by their grandparents. The plan is for the children to be looked after by their elders until the end of the month.\nSimilarly, legal consultant Danial Ashfari, 36 said he and his wife felt it was too soon to send their two-year-old daughter to daycare.\n“Now with the easing (of the restrictions), I have brought my parents to our house here to be with my daughter. Honestly, it is not worth the risk of sending her to daycare. Don’t get me wrong our daycare is very clean and careful, but you can’t be too sure overall,” he said.\nMalaysia imposed the MCO to restrict domestic and international travels on Mar 18 with the aim of curbing the spread of COVID-19. Six weeks into the MCO, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced last Friday that the government would ease some of the restrictions to allow the majority of the businesses to resume operations.\nBefore the restrictions were eased on Monday, people from different households were discouraged from visiting each other. Only one person per household was allowed to go out at any given time, making it impossible for parents to send their children to be cared for by others.\nParents interviewed by CNA also noted that those who have alternative childcare arrangements and can afford to do without daycare in the short term are actually in a fortunate situation.\nBody wax retailer Nadirah Radzi, 34, said she does not intend to send her daughter for early childhood intervention sessions for now.\xa0\n“I recognise that I’m privileged, in the sense that I can afford not to send my daughter and still care for her at home,” said Ms Nadirah. Her daughter has special needs and attends regular early childhood intervention sessions in Petaling Jaya.\n“I have a helper on standby to assist me with my daughter, but this isn’t the case for many parents, so I understand the move to reopen childcare centres.”\xa0\nMs Theresa Chetty, 40, also said she will not send her son to kindergarten for now. The principal for her son’s kindergarten said it would only open on May 12 after the MCO is slated to be lifted entirely, she added.\xa0\n“As a parent, I’m lucky that my company said we could work from home. My husband is working at home too, and we can juggle.”\xa0“But the moment they ask us to go back to the office, then I’ll need to start looking for someone to help take care of my son … It really depends on the employer,” the writer added.\nDAYCARE CENTRES PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY\nThe daycare centres also appear to be adopting a cautious approach for now, both in terms of sanitisation and social distancing.\nA childcare centre operator in Petaling Jaya, who only wanted to be known Ms Mary Anne,\xa0said they have tried to adhere to the standard operating procedures as prescribed by the authorities, and have begun operations on Monday.\n“We took two days over the weekend to clean up the facility and set boxes on the floor to ensure our children maintained social distancing,” she told CNA.\nAccording to the guidelines issued, employees at the childcare have to test negative for\xa0COVID-19 prior to the reopening.\xa0\nWhen the centre resumes operation, it has to be sanitised and disinfected twice a day. The operator has to demarcate the 1m social distance on the floor.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nChildcare staff are also directed to don masks, and educate their young charges on the importance of social distancing and frequent handwashing.\nMs Mary Anne noted that the attendance rate has been low for the first two days. Two students turned up on Monday and five were there on Tuesday, out of 30 enrolled children in total.\xa0\nShe said that although the teachers have found effective teaching methods and activities to avoid contact between the children, many parents have indicated that they would not be sending their children in at least until the end of the month.\nMeanwhile, Little Footprints childcare centre in Kuala Lumpur said it was still mulling over whether to open for business, despite the conditional MCO being put in place.\nThe operator, who only wanted to be known as Yen, pointed out that it would be difficult to enforce social distancing among young children.\nShe also said: “When you talk about the standard operating procedures that we have to follow like sanitisation and all, it is not really a concern because we usually are very stringent in keeping our premises clean.\n“The children will all be sent by their parents, so that is not a worry either. It is my teachers I am worried about because they travel by public transportation.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      COVID-19: More than a third of GCE coursework subjects to have assessment tasks reduced
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: More than a third of GCE coursework subjects will have their assessment tasks reduced, in light of the shift to full home-based learning and adjustments to school holidays\xa0amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\nThe Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) said reduction\xa0will now apply to 12 out of 34 subjects with a coursework component,\xa0including\xa0N(A)-Level Food & Nutrition, O-Level Design and\xa0Technology and A-Level H2 Theatre Studies and\xa0Drama.\nPreviously, only two subjects had their coursework requirements adjusted, namely\xa0N(T)-Level Music and O-Level Exercise and\xa0Sports Science.\nSEAB said the move aims to “alleviate stress on students and teachers ... without compromising the validity of the assessment"".\nAccording to the exam board, the recent ""circuit breaker"" measures\xa0- such as bringing forward the mid-year school break - have implications on coursework with deadlines originally due in late July or early August.\nTeachers will also be focusing on preparing students for preliminary exams when school reopens,\xa0SEAB said, adding that it considered if students would need access to special facilities or tools, or if they had to perform in groups, before making its decision.\nThe 12 GCE coursework subjects affected are:\nTEACHERS AND STUDENTS RELIEVED\nSt Margaret\'s Secondary School has 12 students taking O-Level Drama this year. With the adjustments, the students\xa0will need to perform an individual piece, instead of an individual piece\xa0and a group piece.\n""My students have actually finished writing their script. It\'s fine, as I explained to them, the learning is not lost,"" teacher Kwang Wan Yi said.\xa0\n“Whatever they have created in their devised piece still helps to develop their analytical skills,” added Ms Kwang.\n“The ideas of stage design, character motivation and vocal quality of characters can still be applied to other components.”\nShe added that she was\xa0""relieved"" as\xa0the adjustments would give her students more time to focus on the written examinations, which will\xa0include an extract from a play that will be issued to them.\nBut she noted that her students are disappointed because they were looking forward to performing their group-devised piece.\nSecondary 4 student Kwan Jia Xin said: “It was supposed to be our last piece before leaving secondary school and possibly the last time many of us would be performing.\n""It saddens me that we could not perform one last time together.""\nBut she\xa0added that they would not\xa0have been able to put up as good a performance since they were spending a long time away from school, which has hindered their progress.\n“We need to be physically present in the same place to rehearse our piece and we are unable to do that during this home-based learning period.”\nVictoria School student Harshen Koban, who is taking his\xa0O-Level Exercise and Sports Science examinations this year,\xa0needs access to facilities such as\xa0his school gym. This is so he can\xa0keep in shape for his chosen activities –\xa0cross country and hockey.\nWith the circuit breaker\xa0in place, he is\xa0doing simple body weight exercises at home or going for runs around the neighbourhood, but he is worried his grades will be affected.\n“It may not exactly be the same environment as what we are assessed on,” said Harshen.\nThe SEAB adjustments mean he can now focus on one sport, with\xa0assessment tasks\xa0also being reduced.\n""It\'s given us more time to focus on training for that particular sport,"" said Harshen. ""If we have more time to train, then I think it will be an advantage for everyone.""\nINITIAL CONFUSION ABOUT WEIGHTAGE\nHarshen said\xa0he was ""confused"" about the weightage of the various components after the adjustments were announced. Among the coursework components, the two sports activities were supposed to account for 40 per cent\xa0of his grade, while a development log was to count for 20 per cent.\xa0\nSEAB said\xa0that these will be ""scaled appropriately"". For O-Level Exercise and Sports Science, this means the remaining practical activity will now have a weightage of 40 per cent, while the weightage for the development log remains\xa0unchanged.\nHis teacher Sheikha Fadzleen said one of the biggest challenges during this period is updating the development log.\nStudents normally have to log an eight-week to 10-week training plan, but this came to a halt during the home-based learning period as it required\xa0strict teacher supervision.\nThey have been given a two-week extension to their submission deadline.\xa0Mdm Sheikha said: “Even with the two weeks\' extension, to be honest, it will be really quite a rush as well.\n“So our focus will be to complete the development log and at the same time ensure that the students are fairly assessed.”\nShe said the school is hoping to give students about three weeks to train for their sport before assessing them,\xa0since competitions such as the National School Games have been suspended.\n""It\'s not about doing that 100m just one time, it\'s about training for it, and then for us to be able to at least give them two to three times of assessment,” said Mdm Sheikha.\n“We want to make sure that they are assessed when they are at their best physical state, because we don\'t want to disadvantage them at all.”\nSEAB is also allowing special provisions. The exam board will consider timings or footage recorded as far back as last year, which the school is helping students to collate.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Direct School Admission exercise to continue amid COVID-19 pandemic with tweaked evaluation method: Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise this year will proceed, with some adjustments in how schools evaluate students in light of COVID-19 social distancing measures, said Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (May 5).\xa0\nResponding to a parliamentary question on the topic, Mr Ong said that schools will accept applications between mid-May and early June, similar to previous years.\xa0\n“But there will need to be some adjustments in how schools evaluate the students,” he added.\nThe DSA exercise for secondary schools\xa0allows Primary 6 students to apply to some schools before taking the Primary School\xa0Leaving Examination (PSLE).\nAdding that while the ministry strives to maintain the same number of DSA placements as last year, traditional selection methods such as trials and auditions would have to change because of safe distancing measures, said Mr Ong.\nThere were about 3,500 DSA placements in last year's exercise.\nSchools will instead conduct interviews through video-conferencing tools, he said.\nTo “ensure an even playing field with a common setting and equipment” for the e-interviews, students will go to their own primary schools for the e-interviews.\xa0\n“Their sessions will take place from early July to mid-September, so quite a couple of months away, and they will be scheduled and spaced out to avoid intermingling of students,” Mr Ong noted.\xa0\n“Schools may also conduct simple e-auditions in a similar way, for arts categories such as singing, dancing or drama.”\xa0\nWith the suspension of the National School Games and in the absence of selection trials, secondary schools “will need to give more recognition to the student’s talent, potential, passion and character” through their school track record and online DSA applications, he added.\xa0\n“Schools will look out for the student’s demonstrated dedication to a sport and training attitude, even without a placement in the National School Games.\xa0\n“This is not entirely new, but if the circumstances this year force schools to re-evaluate their definition of a good sportsperson, I think it’s not a bad outcome at all. Each school will have to decide how it wants to evaluate a student and apply it consistently and fairly.”\xa0\nPrimary schools will “step up efforts” to encourage students with ability and potential, especially “those from less advantaged family backgrounds”, to apply.\n\n“This will ensure that students from less advantaged backgrounds have equitable opportunities to access DSA,” said Mr Ong, adding that the Ministry of Education (MOE) will announce details at a later date.\xa0\n“COVID-19 has taken away regular classes, and also our tried and tested methods of grading and DSA selection. But instead of stalling our education reforms, it has underscored their importance and provided impetus to press on,” he said.\xa0\nAdding that the acceptance of online learning tools and capabilities across schools were “uneven” before the pandemic, Mr Ong said that having everyone “forced into” home-based learning helped overcome that problem “almost overnight”.\xa0\n“We wanted to emphasise more on Character and Citizenship Education and especially moral education, and COVID-19 has provided us with many important teaching moments. Similarly, we have progressively been reducing the over-emphasis on examinations and grades in our current system.\xa0\n“Now, COVID-19 is forcing us to adopt more alternate evaluation tools and make greater efforts to exercise judgment on the potential and character of a child. Education reforms will therefore continue. So will the DSA exercise, and all the more so this year.”\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     schools ']}"

      Commentary: Parental warning - these May school holidays will be like no other
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Almost a month into the circuit breaker, half my friends have been enjoying back-to-back online yoga “buffets”, and baking artisan bread. As we ventured deep into the yawning chasm of our new homebound existence, many were discovering moments of stillness and vast expanses of time.\nNot parents though. As we scroll through social media images of culinary feats and self-discovery in the wee hours after our tireless offsprings had finally dozed off, most of us have never felt more time-starved.\nA friend who has been managing her communication team remotely from her dining table told me she struggled to simultaneously run technical support for home-based learning, as well as after-class support and a home canteen for her two ravenously hungry primary school boys.\nAnother friend, a primary school teacher, had been shutting herself in a room to call parents to follow up on their children’s homework, while her own one-year-old toddler sometimes banged on the door crying for attention. The parents she called were often as tired as she was.\nIn fact, when home-based learning began, the mobile phones of parents started beeping as early as 8am with instructions, links and follow-ups.\xa0\nThose with many children suddenly found themselves managing multiple schedules like pre-virus air traffic controllers – class schedules, homework deadlines, mealtimes and bedtimes.\nThis has been especially trying for parents coping with sudden unemployment, partial income loss and financial uncertainty. They will hardly have the bandwidth to double up as teaching assistants for young children during these unprecedented times.\nSo when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the circuit breaker extension, many parents I knew moaned inwardly.\nMAY HOLIDAYS - A REPRIEVE OR DISRUPTION?\nYet, when the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced later that same day the mid-year holidays would be brought forward by a month to May 5, it felt like a much-needed reprieve. At least while navigating the unfamiliar waters of the circuit breaker, there would now be one less deliverable to worry about.\nNot all, however, rejoiced. Some lamented it would be “the most boring school holidays ever”, with theme parks, pools and beaches closed, and travel and summer camps out of the question. \xa0\nIt is not just that the long awaited mid-year holiday has lost some of its fun factor. Many centres of activity during those seasons have been shuttered. Museums, libraries, school excursions and holiday enrichment classes are no longer viable. Even bookstores, where many parents used to curate a ready stash of assessment books, are now closed.\xa0\nFor the first school holiday in history, our children and youth will be stuck at home, pretty much in limbo.\nThat said, being homebound is a vastly different experience across socio-economic groups. For the underprivileged with many children sharing a one- or two-room flat, the stressors of an extended circuit breaker and a stay-in school holiday will be greatly amplified.\nSome counsellors suggest the lack of breathing space could increase the likelihood of conflict and abuse. As a matter of fact, since the beginning of the circuit breaker, referrals and enquiries related to domestic conflicts and violence has already increased.\nEven those fortunate enough not to have to worry about a comfortable roof over their heads may find it a challenge. They may feel hard-pressed to come up with creative ways to engage their children with conventional activities and tick off enrichment goals within the confines of four walls.\nThis begs the question: Will the new May holidays prove to be as stressful as term time?\nA NEW PARENTING EXPERIENCE\nHaving the June holidays in May is one example of how COVID-19 has turned our world on its head. It almost feels as if a time portal has opened up, taking us to an alternate universe.\nBut rather than try to preserve and pack vestiges of our old lives into this alternate reality, perhaps it is time for new rules and rituals, especially those that may ease some of the pressures of modern parenting and the relentless education race.\nIt is worth noting that over a generation, parenting seems to have evolved to be more hands-on, especially within certain demographic groups. Gone are the days of free-range kids.\nToday, many parents juggling the demands of full-time jobs feel compelled to also cultivate, engage and entertain their kids round-the-clock. Helicopter parenting had turned raising children into a competitive sport.\nThat arms race has been a costly one. According to a Household Expenditure Survey by the Department of Statistics, Singapore households spent a total of S$1.4 billion on tuition from October 2017 to September 2018. In addition to tuition, parents also invest in enrichment programmes such as music, dance, art, swimming and other sports.\nSome spend their weekend sending their children from one class to another, merely enjoying short snippets of family bonding time during the commute. When they manage to take weekdays off, they stack it with activities and appointments.\nIn this overscheduled world, it can be easy to lose track of the basic needs of healthy children – adequate rest, free play and family bonding time.\nWith that said, perhaps it is useful to think of the new May school holidays stuck at home as the perfect time to Marie Kondo your activities and de-clutter your time. By doing less, and streamlining your activities, perhaps we will have more time to focus on the essential?\nCREATIVE PLAY AND BONDING RITUALS\nIn fact, sometimes an empty agenda can be the best breeding ground for creativity, as several studies suggest.\nBoredom boosts the mind’s resourcefulness and problem-solving abilities. Provided parents do not resort to screen-time as their default lifeline to fill up empty swathes of time, boredom can encourage creative unstructured play – a crucial component for intellectual, social and emotional development.\nGranted, our children will no longer be able to zip off to the latest theme park, but in the vast world of their imagination, everyday items such as cardboard boxes, paper, drawing materials and old fabrics can be fodder for creativity, transforming into trucks, tents or time machine.\nMoreover, it must be said that children do not necessarily need trucks or tents to engage in play. With the right attitude, any activity can be categorised as “play”. Parents can help foster this attitude by framing activities in a fun way.\nThey can involve their little ones in making their own customised omelette or pizza, setting the table in a creative way or helping to clean up after dinner, as many of us were brought up to do. Your new “enrichment” curriculum could include roles such as assistant sous chef and wardrobe specialist for folding clothes.\nAs many have rightly pointed out, it takes a village to raise a child. However, in a time when most parents have lost important parts of their support system, getting children to help out may ease the household load.\nHelping out in the household may also make children feel like an important part of the family ecosystem, and consequently feel a greater sense of connectedness in a time when they too feel somewhat disorientated.\nAfter all, it is important to remember that like us, our children’s social world has shrunk dramatically over the course of a few weeks. Family rituals, even something as simple as family meals, can offer our children important support.\nPre-pandemic, numerous studies have already shown the positive effect of family meals on healthy eating habits, self-esteem, communication skills, and general academic performance.\nSo if you feel that you cannot cope with activity planning for your children on top of your daily hustle, perhaps it is time to rethink your gruelling holiday schedule.\nAfter all, we have seen the benefits of time-out for our beaches, rivers, wildlife and the Earth. Perhaps our children, and indeed the entire family, will benefit from a little rest and restoration as well?\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nAnnie Tan is a freelance writer.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Parenting ', '     education ', '     schools ']}"

      Home-based learning blues: Life in a rental flat during the COVID-19 circuit breaker
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It is 9am and Ella is about to attend her first lecture as a polytechnic student.\nShe fires up her live lesson, Introduction to Accounting, on her laptop, keeping her camera on long enough for her lecturer to register she’s there. Just long enough – before a loud cry can shoot through the hall, or one of her younger brothers crawls into frame.\nOnce her attendance is marked ""present"", the 19-year-old turns off the camera, and her real work begins.\nSitting on the floor of the two-room flat which she shares with seven brothers and her parents, Ella plays teacher – as she has done since the start of full home-based learning (HBL) on Apr 8 – to Dylan, nine, and Darren, seven. All the families\' names in this story\xa0have been changed.\n“I don’t want them to go back to school not knowing anything,” said Ella, helping Dylan with a Primary 3 mathematics assignment. “I’m afraid that they would need a lot of catching up.”\nBut their ""classroom""\xa0for the past two weeks has not exactly been conducive to learning. In that small confined space, there is no privacy or quiet.\n“11 minus 6 is …?” says Ella, trying to cajole the distracted Dylan, who has a lollipop dangling from the side of his mouth. One of the toddlers barrels towards them and sits on the workbooks; the other three young boys run amok, their screams shattering any fragile focus.\nA simple table with chairs could, maybe, help get the boys into a better frame of mind for learning. But they don’t have the luxury of space for that.\nSometimes, the chaos drives Max, 16, to seek refuge in the stairwell outside with his books and phone, ""circuit breaker""\xa0rules notwithstanding.\n“It’s very hard to focus when I have to look out for my brothers while paying attention to my teachers and taking notes,” said Max, who is taking his O-Levels this year.\nPerched on the stairs, with a flaky Internet connection, he has to do all his schoolwork on the six-inch screen of his mobile phone, which makes typing “a bit troublesome”. Two donated laptops at home – from the family service centre and Beyond Social Services – are for his younger brothers’ use.\nA third, on loan from the primary school, sits unused\xa0because their mother Tina\xa0is afraid the younger kids might break it.\nFOR SOME, THE MAMMOTH TASK OF HBL \nSince the start of circuit-breaker\xa0measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the new reality of self-confinement at home has posed stark challenges for low-income families like Ella’s.\nThey are among 52,000 households in Singapore living in government-subsidised rental flats – and, in some ways, are the hardest hit by the safe-distancing measures.\nMany have lost jobs or income. Added to that is the mental stress of lacking physical space 24/7, and the feeling of helplessness among parents out of their depth dealing with their children’s schoolwork – as well as with their pent-up energy, once the\xa0month-long school holidays start next week.\nTake Nora, 47, who sometimes can’t answer her two youngest children’s questions about schoolwork. “We do (the work) together, but I also get it wrong. I have to take some time to Google, but it’s very slow,” she said.\nShe is especially concerned that her son in Primary 4 might drop to a foundation class if he does not do well this academic year.\n“It’s not easy for me, but if I don’t help him he will be so stressed and he will give up. In school, the teacher is there to help, so now I need to be the teacher,” Nora said. It helps\xa0that they can reach out to his form teacher by phone when they face issues.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) acknowledges that home-based learning would be more challenging for students from lower-income and vulnerable backgrounds.\n“From an educational perspective, the move to full home-based learning is not ideal,” said an MOE spokesperson. “This is a key reason why MOE has been reluctant to suspend schools despite petitions and calls from the public to do so.”\nAmong the steps MOE has taken to “mitigate the impact” on vulnerable students, has been to loan out more than 20,000 computing devices and 1,200 Internet-enabling devices as of Apr 22.\nBut still, bridging the digital divide is an ongoing process.\nA “JARRING” DIGITAL DIVIDE\nAt Nora’s two-room rental flat household, things were, in her words, “going haywire” with technical glitches and an unreliable Internet connection.\nThe family received two refurbished second-hand laptops sourced by the volunteer-run ReadAble, which has been giving Nora’s two youngest children lessons in reading, speech and drama since 2016.\nBut\xa0she had trouble installing Zoom on one of the laptops, and it needed frequent rebooting – which meant her son missed all the live online lessons, said the frustrated mother.\nThe mobile data dongle donated by ReadAble also got lost in their busy household of eight. So the children had to rely on her phone’s hotspot, which provided a spotty connection.\nAll this resulted in assignments that couldn’t be completed and submitted online. As of Apr 22, two weeks into HBL, her Primary 4 son had about 17 assignments left undone, she said. He is given about three a day.\nOne social studies assignment, for example, required him to answer questions about Kampong Glam based on a video. When it failed to play, Nora resorted to using Google to read up about the place and its history – but still, they couldn’t complete the assignment as the questions were specific to the video content.\nThe lack of adequate technical tools for HBL among low-income families has been a “jarring disparity”, said ReadAble’s co-founder Amanda Chong, 31. “I think we take for granted that in 2020, most households would have some sort of computer device, but we found that most of our kids never owned a laptop.”\nThe organisation, which aims to equip students of disadvantaged families with literacy, has thus far given out 12 MacBooks donated by Skyscanner and another 40 laptops sourced from families in their programme.\nThey also have replacements standing by in case of technical problems – Nora’s faulty laptop has since been replaced. She is also planning to apply\xa0for subsided fibre broadband access under the Home Access Programme for low-income households.\nWHEN PARENTS STRUGGLE TO HELP\nBut technical tools are just one part of the problem. Natalie, 13, also a ReadAble beneficiary, said that no one at home can help her with the “difficult but still fun” assignments.\nHer mum Eva, 47, said she can only instruct Natalie\xa0in her mother tongue, and besides, she doesn’t have the time with a three-year-old granddaughter to care for. Her husband studied only up to Primary 6, she added.\nThe stakes are high because Natalie\xa0is taking her Primary School Leaving Examinations this year, after being held back a year in Primary 5. Full HBL has meant missing out on an after-school programme where, for four days a week, there were mentors to help her with homework.\nFor now, Natalie\xa0gets help with English once a week through ReadAble’s online lessons.\nElla’s brother Max, meanwhile, is struggling to stay motivated in his O-Levels year. “There’s no teacher around to scold me if I don’t do my online work, so there’s nothing driving me to complete my assignment,” he said.\n“But I’m not going to take things for granted ... I’m afraid of failing,” said Max, who only just scraped through Secondary 3.\nHis mother Tina, though, is determined to help the two younger boys in primary school learn – even when it means nights spent toiling through their workbooks with Google Translate to decipher the more difficult\xa0English words after everyone has gone to sleep.\n“I need to learn how to do (their homework) and show them how to do it,” said Tina.\nThankfully, there are online tuition classes by a\xa0community self-help group which Max, Dylan and Darren log on to once a week. And there’s Ella to help too. Though the Year 1 polytechnic student has to spend her evenings catching up on the lessons she missed during the day, Ella does not complain.\xa0\n“To my mum, education is very important,"" she said. “(Helping her) is not something that she has to ask of me. It is my responsibility.”\nAt the other end of the spectrum are children like Katie, nine, whose father Sam can’t be home to supervise her because of his 12-hour shifts as a security guard.\nThe Primary 3 student has attended only one online class since HBL began, said her father.\nWhile they have a desktop computer, obtained with the help of MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme, Katie said she does not know how to use Google Meet for her live lessons, and the 39-year-old single father\xa0has yet to figure out how to demonstrate it to her.\nHer days are spent with an elderly grandaunt at home. It is only when Sam returns to their one-room flat at 9pm, when he’s not working overtime,\xa0that they attempt the assignments.\nBy then, a tired Sam can only spend 45 minutes to an hour helping Katie. Her hyperactivity makes focusing a challenge. And science homework is a bit of a struggle for them both. Said Sam: “Sometimes I don’t know the answer but I will (search on) Google or ask my friends. It’s tricky, but we somehow find a solution.”\nSo far, they’ve been able to submit most assignments on time, he said. “I’m trying my very best.”\nACHIEVEMENT GAPS COULD GROW\nAll these difficulties lead social service groups to worry about HBL widening the learning disparity between students from low-income families and the rest.\nA survey by Beyond Social Services showed that many children from less privileged homes were already struggling in school before HBL, said Lim Shaw Hui, 47, the charity’s assistant director. “Their learning will definitely be impacted,” she said. “It’s especially stressful when the parents have to juggle between helping many children.”\nReadAble’s Amanda is worried that “achievement gaps would continue to grow” if full HBL extends beyond several months.\n“There are clear disparities when a parent is able to handhold a child through the entire syllabus, versus a working parent who may not be so educated and is already stressed trying to put food on the table,” she said.\nDuring HBL, in addition to teachers making themselves available over the phone to students who need help, schools have also stayed open for students whose home environments “may not be conducive for learning”, or who need additional support, said MOE.\n“We have been inviting these students to school, and so far, the response has been good,” said the ministry spokesperson.\nWhen schools resume, teachers will also take stock of the students’ learning progress and provide “the necessary remediation and consultation”, MOE added.\nHaving two of the younger boys return to school is an option that Tina – who says she wasn’t aware of it before – is now exploring.\nBut other parents are reluctant, citing worries about the coronavirus. Nora and her husband have tried not to let their children set foot outside since the circuit breaker\xa0began. “My husband is very, very worried for their safety,” she said.\nTheir concern was heightened when Nora recently learnt of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a neighbouring block. “Even though it’s difficult, it’s hectic (at home), I would rather bear with\xa0it than let my children go to school with the situation like that,” she said.\nFor Sam, too, sending Katie back to school is a last resort. The nine-year-old likes to run around and doesn’t always keep a safe distance from others, so her grandaunt would have trouble taking her to and from school, Sam explained\n“The number of (COVID-19) cases is increasing, so I do have worries,” he said early last week.\nCOOPED UP AND FED UP\nBut staying home 24/7, with many people sharing a small area, brings its own set of problems and frustrations.\nEva\'s son, Nat, is 14 and on the autism spectrum. She used to bring him for a walk when he had his meltdowns, but now she must find new ways to calm him down.\nThe noise, flaring tempers, and other stressors at home are taking a toll on Eva\xa0in the form of migraine attacks. These now happen every day and can last hours. “Before COVID-19, it wasn’t like this,” said Eva, who turns to painkillers and medicated oil to cope.\nTina used to be able to snatch a few hours of peace on her own when the younger boys were out at school, or engaged in after-school activities like swimming and\xa0soccer. These used to help the boys – especially nine-year-old Dylan, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\xa0– expend their boundless energy.\nNow, restricted to just running around the hall and bedroom, Tina said: “Sometimes they cry and ask to go out. It’s hard to watch. It’s hard to handle their behaviour.” The toys that she’d bought to salve their boredom were all broken in just a few days.\nFor Tina, there is also the preparation of endless meals and snacks, and chores that eat into the night after hours of HBL. “I have been feeling close to giving up,” she confessed.\nWith the circuit breaker\xa0extended until Jun\xa01 and school holidays brought forward, the parents worry about how to keep their children occupied.\nKatie has already been complaining of feeling bored the past two weeks. There is nothing much to engage her at home besides a mobile phone and some colouring books, said Sam. “I need to crack my head and find more things for her to do.”\nHELPING STRUGGLING KIDS TO EXCEL \nBut beyond the support offered by schools, teachers, self-help groups and MOE, others in the community stand ready to help families grappling with HBL.\nSeveral non-profit and volunteer groups, such as ReadAble, Beyond Social Services and Engineering Good, have been channelling refurbished second-hand laptops to low-income families. And at least two projects started by university students are providing a pool of tutors willing to help remotely for free.\nSocial enterprise VivaKids has also been busy helping primary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Working with partners, it provided the 700 students in its programme with 4G-equipped tablets. Its KidsExcel supplementary academic classes have migrated online.\n“These classes are meant to help children who may fall behind during this period of change as well as complement HBL,” said Victor Pok, founder of VivaKids.\nWithin a week of CNA Insider linking VivaKids up with Tina, Eva and Sam, their younger children were provided with the tablets and trial classes.\nIt took Victor by surprise how receptive the children were, especially Katie. “Most kids will think ‘huh, tuition?’ But she took to the teachers straightaway. She couldn’t wait to get into action. This shows that she’s been disengaged for a very long time,” said Victor.\nBefore each lesson begins, the children must do one thing: Put on the KidsExcel T-shirt. This gives them a “sense of uniformity and structure”; that it’s official class time despite being at home, said Victor.\nEach online class is kept to four or five students. In one of the lessons that CNA Insider observed, Katie – who suffers from a short attention span – sat through a 30-minute class with minimal disruption. She read along with the teacher and tried her best at the exercises.\nIn the same class was Tina’s son Dylan. Though his attention was sometimes on the action at home, he mostly listened and highlighted his answers on a virtual whiteboard, which the teacher corrected on the spot.\xa0\n“Unlike in physical classes, where students have to wait a week for their work to be marked,” Victor noted.\nAt the end of the session on adjectives, the students took turns describing the class: Some were “happy”, others found it “funny”, and Dylan called it “perfect”.\xa0\nOne student asked: “Tomorrow are we doing it again?”\nWhen the circuit breaker\xa0is lifted, the children can look forward to joining KidsExcel’s resumed physical programmes at a designated family service centre. “Twenty years ago, school would have been an equaliser, but now it’s about extra tuition classes. So that’s my motivation to help the lower-income kids,” said Victor, 46.\nThough Ella cannot yet tell if Dylan’s work has improved, she has noticed that he has become more focused, after the first two sessions with KidsExcel. “He’s been able to navigate his classes more independently. I don’t have to guide him all the time,” she said.\n‘IN MY HEART, IT’S NOT CRAMPED’\nIndeed, however rough the road gets, the families say they try to keep their minds focused on the positive.\n“As long as (my kids) are in front of my eyes, they are safe, it’s okay,” Nora\xa0said. “It’s stressful but ... I have to endure. I have to really play my part as a parent.”\nAs for Ella, she said: “Serving this circuit-breaker\xa0period with my family, I get to see what the struggles of each of my family members are. It has made me more aware of what I should do to help.”\nA week since CNA Insider first reached out to her, Tina shared eagerly in a text message that she had finally bought a table and chairs for her children to better focus during their HBL classes. She threw out other stuff to make space.\nAnd though their walls are covered in the children’s scribbles, and nights spent sleeping on mats rolled out across the living room floor, these conditions do not bother Tina too much at the end of the day.\n“I don’t find that it is cramped because in my heart, it is not cramped. We are thankful to have a roof over our heads.”\nRead the second story:\xa0‘If no work at all, how?’ Low income families grapple with zero income, higher expenses amid circuit breaker\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     circuit breaker ', '     education ']}"

      Local universities announce initiatives for financial aid, jobs for graduating students
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The National University of Singapore (NUS) announced on Friday (Apr 24) an initiative to offer full-time salaried positions and paid traineeships for graduating students, in light of the weakened job market during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStudents from the graduating class of 2020 can apply for 200 full-time positions within the university, spanning roles in central administration and across the 17 faculties and schools, 29 research institutes and the National University Health System, said the university in a press release.\nThey may also apply for 800 traineeships in four tracks - education, research, entrepreneurship and executive and professional, said NUS. These positions are launched in partnership with the SG United Traineeships Programme also announced on Friday.\nNanyang Technological University (NTU) announced later on Friday that it plans to create “several hundred” paid traineeships to support the programme, and they will be open to the undergraduate class of 2020 from all disciplines.\nThese traineeships will be available across NTU’s colleges, schools, research centres and institutes, as well as corporate and joint laboratories with “strong industry engagement”, said NTU in a media release.\xa0\nThe Government will set aside S$100 million to fund the traineeship scheme, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore (WSG) on Friday. From Jun 1, recent graduates of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), polytechnics, universities and other institutions will be able to tap on the programme.\nTraineeships will last up to 12 months\xa0and trainees will get a monthly training allowance, based on the scope and skills required for the traineeship.\nThe Government will fund 80 per cent of the allowance and the trainee’s host company will fund the remainder.\nAccording to WSG and MOM, this monthly training allowance is pegged to 50 to 70 per cent of median starting salaries. Host companies will not have to make CPF contributions for the trainees as “there is no employer-employee relationship” under the programme.\nTo qualify for the programme, trainees must be a Singapore citizen or permanent resident. They must also have graduated –\xa0or be graduating –\xa0in the calendar year of 2019 or 2020, or have graduated earlier and completed National Service in 2019 or 2020.\nTRAINEESHIPS, COURSE SUBSIDIES\nMore than 280 organisations across the private and public sectors\xa0and institutes of higher learning have offered more than 4,000 traineeships under the programme. The aim is to have up to 8,000 traineeships this year in fields such as life sciences, engineering and the arts.\n“Graduating students are concerned that they cannot land good jobs. The idea of the R&G Initiative is to provide them with opportunities that have strong development potential and which will give them an edge in a competitive market,“ said Professor Ho Teck Hua, NUS senior deputy president and provost.\nAll trainees will have access to all of the university’s Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses and certificates for free, said Prof Ho.\nSingaporean graduates who receive financial aid will be given priority in receiving these paid traineeships, he added.\nAll fresh graduates in NTU’s class of 2020 will receive an additional S$1,600 in alumni credits that can be used to offset fees at the university\'s CET courses. This is on top of the existing S$1,600 available to all alumni, said NTU.\xa0\nThe Ministry of Education also announced on Friday that all 16,000 Singaporean and PR graduates from the class of 2020 across the six autonomous universities will enjoy four complimentary CET modules offered by their universities.\xa0\nThe joint effort by the Education Ministry, SkillsFuture Singapore and the autonomous universities is “in recognition that with the uncertain economic outlook, some fresh graduates may want to continue their learning and pick up additional skills”.\xa0\nSkillsFuture Singapore will provide a subsidy of 70 per cent\xa0of course fees for Singaporean and PR graduates, with the universities\xa0subsidising the remainder.\xa0\nFINANCIAL AID\nNTU\xa0announced on Wednesday a relief package to provide financial support for students affected by the pandemic. Additional initiatives to help graduating undergraduates find employment will be unveiled next week, said the university in a press release.\nUnder the relief package, NTU has established a S$2 million OneNTU Fund to support Singapore citizen and PR students “who need immediate assistance due to the COVID-19 outbreak”.\nEligible students may get an interest-free advance of up to S$1,500, which they will reimburse to NTU within two years after graduation, said the university.\nNTU will also establish the NTU Priorities Fund, driven by private philanthropy. This fund will address “urgent needs” identified by the university and will be used to offer financial assistance to the neediest\xa0NTU students affected by COVID-19 “who have no other recourse for help"".\n“Recipients of support from the fund will pledge to ‘pay it forward’ within two years after graduation and return the interest-free cash assistance to the university,” said the university in the press release.\n“COVID-19 has already caused profound social and economic disruptions across the globe, and these effects have hit close to home too. We have students grappling with sudden loss of family income or find that they no longer have part-time jobs and are worried about their daily lives should the situation continue,” said NTU president Subra Suresh.\nDEFERRED FEES FOR MASTER’S STUDENTS\xa0\nGraduating students who enrol in any Master’s degree programmes at NUS may also defer the payment of course fees for up to three years from the date of enrolment at no interest, said the university.\nFor NTU final-year PhD and Master’s students who “face difficulties” completing research work within this semester “due to the disruptions caused by the closure of their labs due to COVID-19”, the university will extend their candidature with a full waiver of tuition fees for up to one semester.\nThis includes PhD and Master’s students on their final year of NTU scholarship, and all other research students in their final year of candidature.\n“We will continue to monitor and evaluate these dynamic circumstances and take appropriate measures as the situation evolves,” said Professor Suresh.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     NUS ', '     NTU ']}"

      ‘We’re ready to help’: University students rallying volunteers to give free tuition
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: It was the second time in a row that Andy Teo’s tutee had cancelled on him. “Hope the (virus) situation gets better,” a text message from the student’s parent read.\nThis – and another student cancelling lessons for two weeks due to a stay-home notice – got Andy thinking about how he could best teach online. \xa0\nOn Apr 3, it was announced that schools would move to full home-based learning (HBL) for a month. and this had Andy worrying further. What about other students who, like his tutees, struggled to keep up in class? Could it be even harder for them now?\nHow could he make himself available to those in need?\nThen an idea struck: What if he rallied fellow tutors to volunteer their time for free?\nTEMPORARY ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE\nAndy’s idea was simple: Tutors, in any subject from the primary to tertiary school level, would first register via a Google form. They could indicate how much time they wanted to offer – even if it were just 30 minutes.\nStudents who needed help would be able to browse the list of registered tutors, and contact their desired ones by email. The tutor would decide how to conduct the lesson remotely, be it using video conferencing tools like Zoom or text messaging.\n“For example, if the student were struggling with algebra on a particular day and could not get to their teacher, they could find help here,” Andy said, noting that teachers might be swamped with preparing HBL materials every day.\xa0\nI just hope the community of tutors with time to spare can fill this gap.\nIt took him barely a day to swing into action. On Apr 4, he began putting out a call for tutors on his social media pages, and friends helped to spread the word. \xa0\nEvery day, 10 to 20 people signed up. In just over a week, 250 volunteers were ready to serve.\n“The generosity of the volunteers really touched me. I thought, if I could reach 50 tutors, that was more than enough,” Andy said.\nWhat was also surprising was the wide range of volunteers, Andy said. Some had no tutoring experience but offered to help in wherever their strengths lay. So, besides the usual math, science and language subjects, there were those who could teach art, design and technology, music, and the humanities.\nFor students in polytechnic, ITE or university, there was help available in engineering, computer science and mass communication. One volunteer even specialised in teaching primary school children with autism.\nCOVID-19 TUTORING SUPPORT\nUpon registration, students can indicate and rank the subjects they need help with. On their part, volunteer tutors choose what to teach from a list of examinable subjects in Singapore, and indicate their experience level.\nThe students and tutors will then be matched by the CTSS team, led by Quek Hui Ying, 20. Tutors are encouraged to conduct lessons via the online tutoring platform Bramble, which has been made free with the COVID-19 outbreak.\nA week into the initiative, more than 1,400 volunteers have signed up, and more than 180 students matched with tutors.\n“It has been very heart-warming to see Singaporeans stepping up to help each other,” said Hui Ying, a first-year history student at Oxford University. “Strangers can come together to do really nice things when they put their mind to it.”\nCTSS is now run by a\xa0core team, all students aged 19 to 22 – three of them people whom Hui Ying didn’t previously know, but had approached her to help.\xa0\nHELP IS FOR ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT\nSetting up his TAA initiative took Andy back to his secondary school days, when he needed to book a consultation with his English teacher every week to get better at the subject.\n“Now that a lot of people cannot see their teacher, I can imagine how difficult it must be, especially for students who cannot afford tuition,” Andy said.\nWhile this service is meant primarily for students who do not have tuition, it is open to all. Said Andy: “In these difficult times, I don’t think we should be so selective in terms of who we help.\xa0\nIf we can give, and we have the time now, why not?\nLikewise, at CTSS, the system is “based on trust”, Hui Ying said.\nThe team does not ask about the background of a student or their parents. But one single mother of four shared with them how difficult it has been to cope with the outbreak – she had lost her job, and it has been a struggle to juggle HBL for all her children.\nSo the team hopes to reach out to more Family Service Centres and student care centres, which are best able to identify families in real need. “To all students who really need academic support, don’t be afraid to sign up. We are ready to help,” Hui Ying said.\nWhile Andy is unable to track how many students have used TAA so far – since students choose and contact their tutor directly – he worries that word of the initiative has been spreading only among those who can offer tuition support.\nHe hopes this resource can be shared with more parents and students in need. “With so many volunteers, it shows that many have the same concern for students… What we get in return (for our time) is students not lagging behind. That is the greatest satisfaction for a tutor.”\nTemporary Academic Assistance\nTo choose a tutor: tinyurl.com/TAADatabase\nTo volunteer: tinyurl.com/TAAForm\nCovid-19 Tutoring Support for Students\nStudent sign-ups: tinyurl.com/ctss-student2\nVolunteer sign-ups: tinyurl.com/ctss-volunteer2\nWebsite: https://covidtutoringsupport.weebly.com/\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Home-based learning: Harvard University is offering 67 free online courses
  </h1>, 'text': 'After what might seem like your hundredth home workout, maybe it’s time to start thinking about working out your mind, too. And maybe earn some bragging rights about having gone to an Ivy League school during the circuit breaker period.\nOnce you’ve mastered the art of making the perfect Dalgona coffee and doing the handstand T-shirt challenge, it’s time to level up. Harvard University is offering 67 new online courses that you can take for free. That’s right, you can boast about having learnt from the best while lounging about at home.\nThe free classes cover a huge range of fields such as Health and Medicine, Programming, Business, Humanities, and Art and Design. Depending on the course, each online class can take anywhere between one and 12 weeks, which you can check on the official Harvard catalogue website.\nThere’s some really interesting ones in there too, with one of them being called PredictionX, where students will learn about what Harvard calls “pre-scientific” prediction systems such as Chinese bone burning and the Greek mythical figure, the Oracle of Delphi.\xa0\nIf the free classes aren’t too much to your liking, Harvard is offering paid online ones as well, though they can get a bit pricey with some costing more than a few thousand dollars. Still, there are some relatively cheap ones worth noting, such as the two-week-long Introduction To Tai Chi class, which we think can bring some much needed calm amid the current situation.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Circuit breaker classes: Yoga, tuition and gyms move online as Singapore gets used to operating in virtual worlds
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Armed with a large iPad, a laptop and a large monitor screen, over 40 tuition teachers with Raymond’s Maths & Science Studio press on with their regular lessons amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\xa0\nAlthough the lessons are held at the same time on the same day as before, all of the teachers now tutor remotely from their homes over video conferencing application Zoom.\xa0\nManaging director Raymond Loh told CNA that training teachers to use Zoom and trying to bring the classroom onto a digital platform is “not an easy task”.\xa0\n“Honestly, training for my staff is just one thing. Having good class control is totally another thing,” said Mr Loh.\xa0\n“And how do we make sure the classes are conducive enough? To be candid with you, we learn on the job, because we do not have any precedent.”\nHe added that while many of the teachers and students faced teething problems on the first day of online lessons, things quickly improved and the process is smooth now.\xa0\nAs Singaporeans stay at home throughout the circuit breaker\xa0period, more are looking for ways to carry on with their usual activities, and many businesses and organisations are taking the opportunity to move their operations online.\nThe education sector was one of the first to start shifting operations online, after it was announced on Mar 24 that centre-based classes would be suspended, aiming to reduce the mixing of students from different schools.\xa0\nMr Loh said his team started preparing for the possible closure of tuition centres when Singapore moved to DORSCON Orange. They moved classes online a few days after the Mar 24 announcement.\xa0\nPredicting that tuition centres would soon be asked to close, the team bought about 40 iPads, one for each of the teachers, and started printing booklets for the thousands of students studying with them.\xa0\n“Getting all my teachers to be aware and know how to use the software, and trying to bring the classroom into a digital classroom is not an easy task,” said Mr Loh.\xa0\n“Most of our customers are very, very happy and very appreciative that we are ready (for online lessons),” said Mr Loh.\xa0\n“And we even have a small group of customers asking us to consider going online as a business. Because for older kids, they don't feel like travelling and going online seems to be a good option.”\xa0\n\n\nEnrichment classes have also found ways to move online. Mr Saravanan Manorkorum and Ms Amutha Saravanan, co-founders of education company Da Vinci Group, digitalised the content under its brand KlayKit, to sell the enrichment materials directly to parents.\xa0\nThe team used to visit pre-schools to carry out the classes in person, but with the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, the KlayKit team conducted lessons virtually before it was announced on Apr 3 that all schools would be closed between Apr 8 and May 4, said Ms Amutha.\xa0\nTo target parents directly, they have started selling the lesson packages online. For example, parents can order a package of three lessons and three KlayKits to be delivered to their homes.\xa0\n\n\n“We started digitalising (the lessons) and then pairing that with the KlayKit and selling it as a package… And that had been quite a service offering that people had taken up,” said Ms Amutha, adding that pre-schools have also expressed interest in purchasing the kits for their students during this home-based learning period.\xa0\n“We changed the angle to go more B2C. Since we started doing that, there have been quite a number of orders as well, still slow, but I think people are picking up and getting the idea about it.”\xa0\nAccording to the couple, parent feedback “has been actually very great”, and they have even received orders from parents overseas.\xa0\n“It's also become quite exciting because people overseas have also started buying just the content, because we realise that right now supply chains might be affected and we can't really send the KlayKit.\xa0\n“So we have created just content, consumable for parents overseas to buy it at a nominal rate, and then they can just use all sorts of other mediums that they can find to actually\xa0create the craftwork.”\nBut moving online has not been easy for everyone. Private tutor Wendy Ng, 38, said half of her regular students have requested to stop lessons for now.\xa0\n“(One of the) main difficulties is that not all parents or students are accepting of online lessons. Some have requested to stop tuition for now. Also, it has become more time consuming to conduct the lessons since there is more preparation needed before lessons,” she told CNA.\xa0\nMs Ng said she has lost about 40 per cent of her usual income from the cancellations. She uses Zoom for online tutoring with her students and charges the same amount for online lessons.\xa0\n“Work is assigned to students to complete in advance. (They) send it back to me to check, and then we can go through during the online session. So there is more pre-work to be done before actual lessons,” adding that speaking to students on a video call is quite different from face-to-face.\xa0\n“We tend to misunderstand each other quite a bit.”\nEXERCISING FROM HOME\nOther types of lessons have also shifted online to deal with the realities of the circuit breaker measures.\nWater bottles, laptop bags, suitcases and chairs - these are some of the “workout gear” personal trainer Patrick Siew has got his clients to use as they exercise from home.\nMr Siew\xa0now uses video conferencing apps to remotely coach clients who sweat it out by doing kettlebell swings with a laptop bag or squats while holding heavy water bottles.\nWhile there are many online exercise videos and apps out there, there are people who prefer to have interaction with a trainer over video, he said. The trainer can also monitor what the client is doing and correct their form. He may continue such classes in future if there is demand, he added.\n“It seems to work with a lot of people who have very busy schedules and they can't get out.”\nYoga teacher War War Lwin Tun, founder of Ohmsantih Yoga is also considering extending her online offerings even after the circuit breaker\xa0period is over.\nFormer students of hers, such as public relations director Julie Chiang, have signed up for her new Zoom classes, which were launched on Apr 6.\nMs Chiang, a mother of three, said that she stopped attending classes because she was busy with the children and travelling to the yoga studio took up too much time.\n“When she started doing (Zoom classes), I jumped at the chance to sign up,” she said.\n\n\nMs Lwin Tun has also reconnected with students who have moved overseas, from places including Mauritius, Tokyo and France.\n“There are lockdowns everywhere, so they’re very happy about this - that’s something cool that’s come out of this,” she said.\nSince lockdowns have begun around the world, virtual classes have erased geographical boundaries, with major gyms and fitness memberships rolling out free online classes.\xa0\nClassPass has been providing free on-demand exercise classes on its app, while subscribers can use their credits to attend livestreamed classes from studios or instructors around the world.\xa0\nUsers can log in live for a session from anywhere, said Mr Sam Canavan, regional director of ClassPass APAC.\n“We expect Singapore to have more than 100 local partners offering livestream before the end of May,” he said.\nGym chains such as Fitness First have also been streaming classes on social media.\xa0\n“The response we have received so far has been positive and we’re seeing much higher engagement on the posts,” said Mr Anil Chugani, country manager of Fitness First Singapore.\nThe gym has also introduced a “30-Day Challenge” on social media for people to contribute creative home workouts using ordinary household items in place of gym equipment.\nThe People’s Association has also decided to livestream “bite-sized classes” so that residents and senior citizens “can continue to lead an active and healthy life” from home.\xa0\nThe viewership of the virtual lessons is “encouraging”, said a PA spokesperson. Over the past three weeks, the viewership for the PAssion L!VE and Virtual CC classes have doubled, she added.\xa0\n“PA has taken a holistic approach in curating and planning courses so that it is highly accessible for seniors and their families. There are plans for webinars, online classes to be rolled out in stages to enhance the online learning experience,” said the spokesperson.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     Fitness ']}"

      Commentary: Home-based learning can be an opportunity to rethink parenting
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: We saw the writing on the wall, or we should have, when several weeks into DORSCON Orange, centre-based tuition and enrichment classes had to be suspended in order to reduce intermingling of students from different schools.\nThis wave of precautionary measures was met with relief and praise from some and slight panic from others as enrichment centres had to make a quick transition from classroom-based lessons to online ones: Music lessons over FaceTime, ballet coaching over Zoom.\nDespite these efforts, the situation didn\'t bate and the Ministry of Education announced that they were going to institute home-based learning (HBL) for all students. Once a week for the month of April.\nThat first day, social media was rife with photos of children at laptops and tablets; small, eager, earnest faces, each working on a liturgy of tasks vis-a-vis their Student Learning Space (SLS) and on pre-assigned worksheets.\nInvariably, along with the pat-on-the-back posts, came the rants on how HBL was too disruptive, too exhausting for parents who have their own work to do. Some even mused that teachers must be having a relaxing day off now that parents have taken over for the day.\nAs the national COVID-19 numbers continued to rise, parents and educators clamoured for the government to do more, to close the schools. And so, that came to pass.\nWHEN WFH MET HBL\nOn Friday (Apr 3), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced to the nation that we were entering a stage of heightened measures, as a circuit breaker, which will see schools and institutes of higher learning turn towards HBL for a month. Employers too, barring those that provided essential services, were told to allow their staff to also work from home (WFH) during this period.\nSome lauded the move. Others decried how inconvenient things would be for them. How would parents work from home when their kids were going to be home as well?\nIn the weekend that followed, all hell would break loose.\nCrazy queues formed all over the place. A mad scramble to stock up on assessment books at Popular Bookstore to board game buying sprees at Toys R Us. Over at Challenger stores nationwide, tablets became the new toilet paper and laptops the new rice.\nParents stood in long lines to get what they needed to weather the upcoming month where WFH bumps its head with HBL. Most understand the necessity of this drastic move. But few, it seems, actually seem happy at the prospect of hunkering down with their children for an extended amount of time.\nTIME TO CHANGE OUR APPROACH TO PARENTING\nWe who were envious of friends who got to work from home because they seemingly get the best of both worlds, are starting to realise that the grass is always greener on the other side.\nOr is it, perhaps, that modern Singapore parenting makes it easy for us to simply outsource our children to school, to teachers, to the next better enrichment lesson, or even our helpers. We assuage our parenting guilt of needing our own space and personal time by convincing ourselves that our children are duly entertained and engaged.\nThe thing is this, the grass is greener on the side that one tends to and waters regularly. For all the crazy curveballs that COVID-19 has thrown at us, perhaps this is the one silver lining: We get to reset the clock. Not just on the ruthless rampage that is this insolent illness, but also on the relentlessness of modern parenting.\nA psychiatrist friend shared a case he had of a school-going boy on the verge of a breakdown who tearfully lamented that his parents get weekends off but he has to spend much of his weekends shuttling between tuition centres with a tight 30-minute window to wolf down his lunch in the car.\nA survey done by the Straits Times and Nexus Link showed that seven out of 10 families enrolled their children in tuition classes, with nearly half starting at pre-school levels.\nA separate Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) study showed that Singaporean students experienced much higher levels of anxiety over their school grades and tests compared to their international peers.\nIn a country where 70 per cent of all students go for supplementary lessons, where the tuition industry is worth S$1.4Billion and the pressure to excel in sports and school is high; we have always lamented about the need to re-evaluate this pressure-cooker environment on students. Now is the chance - but how?\nCOVID-19 says, well, hold my beer.\nStill, this difficult season unwittingly gives us an opportunity to rethink how we want and should parent. It makes us re-engage our children, re-jig our lives to better suit our version of work-life balance.\nRETHINKING OUR ROLES AS PARENTS\nIt forces us to unpack our over-scheduled lives and re-examine the walls between work life and family life. It means that parents get to reclaim their role as the main purveyor and steward of our child’s education and well-being, instead of outsourcing it to schools and teachers as many of us have done.\nI don\'t mean that you now need to be able to decipher how many marbles Ali has left after giving two-thirds of his original stash to Samuel and dropping another 15 per cent down the drain.\nIt means that your children get to take lessons with and from you in the school of life; and you get to craft the syllabus. In this special term, the usual rules don’t apply and the points don’t matter.\nSo, teach them how to cook, that’s home economics right there. Show them how you balance the monthly grocery budget— hello maths! Exchange Spotify lists for music lessons.\nAnd after ""school time"", let them be bored, let them play without feeling the need to police, govern or facilitate learning through play. If it helps you feel better, there’s strong research that shows that boredom is good for kids, it builds creativity and allows the brain to fallow new ideas.\nA piece in Psychology Today encourages what they call a Boredomutiny, a rewriting of the rulebook where bored children should not be seen as problems that need fixing, but considered a starting point to encourage unstructured exploration, contemplation and daydreaming that often spurs creativity. The same is true for adults. \xa0\nAnd, really, if you are a WFH person and thus have to be around your HBL children, be grateful.\nMy neighbour is a doctor and she leaves her four children daily to battle on the frontline, leaving her helper the primary caregiver and chief supervisor in this time of HBL. Add to that, the anxiety and worry she carries almost perpetually of bringing the virus home to her family.\nOther parents are home because they have lost their jobs or face reduced volumes of work. It\'s hard to keep a brave face when the uncertainty bubbles from within and without.\nSo, the quick and dirty take-home is this: stop whining, stop nit-picking (especially at the teachers) and suck it up. There are ways for you to still be productive at work from home while your kids are on HBL.\nIt is a rare time where all the pithy life values we espouse is visible up close and personal: adaptability, flexibility, empathy, resilience, gratitude, the importance of being part of the solution and the power of vulnerability.\nOur children learn what they live.\nYou see, we are enrolled in school with our children — welcome to a new term in the school of hard knocks, where we lead by example.\nCherie Tseng is Chief Operations Officer at a local fintech company, a mother of three and editor with The Birthday Collective.\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     safe distancing ', '     Parenting ', '     education ']}"

This means students on the School Meals programme will not be able to benefit from the programme if they are not in school.\xa0\nTo continue assisting students on MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme and the School Meals programme, schools will reach out to these students “to see who still needs to come to school because they don’t have the support at home to do home-based learning”.\xa0\nThese students will be registered and allowed to continue coming to school throughout the “circuit breaker period”.\xa0\nThe education ministry will also work with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to provide financial and other support for these families through community partners such as the Social Service Offices.\xa0\n“This is what we do currently for low income households facing financial difficulty throughout the year, but the Social Service Offices will do more to help needy families access financial assistance schemes rolled out as part of COVID-19 support measures,” said Mr Ong.\xa0\nOther community partners and donors are coming forward to support these students through vouchers, including food vouchers to help students with their meals, he added.\xa0\n“The CDCs (Community Development Councils) are starting this and once the details are worked out they will announce the new measures.\nThere is “no doubt” that students from the lower income group will be “the most adversely affected” when schools have to close and move to full home-based learning, Mr Ong said.\xa0\n“And that is why we are moving to full home-based learning only now and not earlier because we do know it creates a lot of disruptions to people’s lives, and children from lower income families, from vulnerable families are most affected.\xa0\n“But we are doing it now in support of the circuit breaker measures that will come into force this week.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ', '     MOE ']}"

      COVID-19: Home-based learning begins for some students, 'teething issues' surface
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Instead of donning his uniform to go to school on Wednesday (Apr 1) morning, Primary 5 student Danial Rizal\xa0completed his four hours of English, Mathematics, Science and Malay classes at home.\xa0\nWith Wednesday marking the first day of home-based learning for primary school students, most of them completed their assignments and learnt\xa0from home, working on hardcopy worksheets or online assignments on the Student Learning Space (SLS).\xa0\nWhile he had some difficulties logging in and getting the audio for the video lessons to work, Danial said his experience with home-based learning has been smooth so far.\xa0\n""The difference is in school, the teacher will guide us if we don\'t know. We ask the teacher and the teacher will show us the answer,"" said Danial.\xa0\n“At home, we have nobody to ask. If our parents are (around), we may ask them\xa0for help,” said the 10-year-old Innova Primary School student.\nLuckily, Danial\'s mother is often around as she works from home. He said he consults her when he encounters topics not yet covered in school.\xa0\xa0\xa0\n“She will sit beside me, but she will not tell me the answer. She will just explain this part, and then I will know (the answer) already,” he said.\xa0\nQuizzes are the ""fun part” of learning from home, said Danial, because he feels challenged to score better when he sees his friends’ scores.\xa0\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) announced on Friday that all schools will conduct one day of home-based learning a week from April. The move was part of enhanced measures to stem the spread of COVID-19, after an increase in the number of imported and local cases here.\xa0\nPrimary schools will carry out home-based learning on Wednesdays, secondary schools on Thursdays, while junior colleges and centralised institutes will conduct them on Friday.\xa0\nOn days where students are not on home-based learning, schools will stagger dismissal times to “reduce the transient congestion of students”, said MOE.\xa0\nMaking the announcement on Friday, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung stressed that schools are not closing, but the new system will allow Singaporeans to “get used” to the idea of home-based learning\xa0and allow the ministry to expand the new system to more days, if necessary.\xa0\n""Schools are not closing,"" Mr Ong had told reporters on Friday.\n""But what we have been working on is to prepare for some introduction of home-based learning.\n""As the crisis develops, you will find that you have more arsenal, more measures to respond to as opposed to a sudden drastic change that will get everyone panicked, which is what we always want to avoid,"" he added.\n""TEETHING ISSUES"" FACED, PARENTAL SUPPORT HELPFUL\nFor his home-based learning on Wednesday, Danial’s mother, Mdm Masliza Ismail received a schedule from the school\xa0with the designated hours for each subject and a summary of the homework assigned.\xa0\nWhile students are given a week to complete the assignments and do not have to follow the timings strictly, Mdm Masliza said the schedule also helps Danial complete his work on time.\xa0\n“He prefers to follow the timing because the earlier he finishes, the earlier he can rest. The timing will be like school, if he follows the hours,” she added.\xa0\n“At home, at least they are free and easy but still learning. It’s just a different way.”\xa0\nBeing at home makes it easier for her to supervise or support Danial while he is learning, said Mdm Masliza, adding that working parents may face additional problems if their child needs help with the computer while they are at work.\xa0\nWhen Danial was in lower primary, she was still working in an office\xa0and would bring him to the office on home-based learning days. At the time, she found that she was unable to concentrate at work because he would face login issues or have difficulties with the assignments.\xa0\nShe also said that starting with one day of home-based learning a week was a ""good idea”, giving working parents time to\xa0make alternative arrangements before the programme was expanded.\xa0\nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung noted “teething issues” when he visited Sembawang Primary School. About 20 students were present because their parents had to work\xa0or because they had\xa0no WiFi at home.\n“Got feedback that some students at home also had problems logging into Student Learning Space (SLS),” he wrote. “Please bear with us as we iron out the tech glitches.”\xa0\nTeachers also put in extra hours for home-based learning and there is “a lot of adjustment to be done”.\xa0\n“It’s not easy\xa0and it’s not perfect, but we are tapping on our collective efforts to get this to work during such exceptional times,” said Mr Ong.\xa0\nLEARNING FROM HOME AT SCHOOL\nWhen CNA visited Innova Primary School on Wednesday, 39 students across lower and upper primary levels were in school to work on the same assignments as their level peers at home. Students were grouped in different classrooms according to level, with one row of tables between them for safe distancing.\xa0\nAbout 80 students were given the option to come back to school for home-based learning, based on the knowledge that they did\xa0not have alternative care arrangements, access to WiFi at home or that they required additional help academically, said vice-principal Stephen Lau.\xa0\nLike Danial, some of them encountered issues logging on to SLS, but received help from teachers who were in the classrooms to guide students through the assignments. Other teachers remained at home to log students’ attendance, temperatures\xa0and monitor the students’ progress on the online modules.\xa0\nFor students who fail to log on to SLS, teachers will call their homes to check on them, said Mr Lau. Parents can also call the school to ask for IT support or help in explaining certain concepts to their children.\xa0\n“Some students were not able to log in at the stipulated time. However, we have contingency in place - the students were also given written assignments to do.”\nMr Lau added that on Wednesday, the SLS system was down for “less than half hour"" and the issue was resolved shortly after.\xa0\nSchools did not have to start planning for home-based learning “from scratch” because it had\xa0been implemented before.\xa0\nFor example, home-based learning is implemented for the other levels during PSLE oral or on PSLE marking days, said Mr Lau, adding that parents are “familiar with the process”.\xa0\nStudents would receive a simplified timetable, with only four subjects -\xa0English, Mathematics, Mother Tongue and Science. According to Mr Lau, online and offline tasks are allocated two hours each.\xa0\nTeachers can come up with different formats for home-based learning, including video lessons or online quizzes, said Mr Lau, adding that the school did not scramble to plan for the new measures announced on Friday.\xa0\n“We plan for continuity, that means the scheme of work is still being followed. As far as possible, home-based learning will be a continuation of where the teacher left off,” he said.\xa0\nHaving a safe learning environment with curated resources is “very important”, said Ms Farlinah Supaah, head of the English department at Innova Primary. This would enable students to find the answers to their questions within the SLS, rather than go online or on social media to look for them.\xa0\n“The children are not worried that they cannot do (the assignments). In fact, they like to see their responses posted up,” she said.\xa0\n“I feel that I get more responses online because everybody is required to respond, versus in a face-to-face classroom where you have a limited amount of time to capture everyone’s learning. The responses from even our quieter students are captured.”\nHaving online lessons also allows children to build on each other’s ideas more seamlessly, said Ms Farlinah.\xa0\n“Students can read someone else’s opinions and see if they can improve their own.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      The Big Read: No child’s play when it comes to stamping out bullying in schools
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0They tagged her picture to a crying baby, as well as cropped her face out of the group photo which they posted on Instagram, while calling her ""dumb"", ""loser""\xa0and ""trash"".\nThe 14-year-old was also added to a WhatsApp group with her bullies where they taunted her for being a slow learner — always having to stay back in school for remedial classes and not being able to read a comprehension passage fluently in class.\nThree years on, Hannah (not her real name), who is dyslexic, still remembers the ordeal. “The words were very hurtful. I cried almost every night,” said the student currently pursuing a business course at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).\nThen there is May (not her real name), 13.\xa0\xa0\nAlso diagnosed with dyslexia when she was eight, May was bullied throughout primary school for not speaking well and being slower than the rest of her peers.\nIn one case, which happened when she was in Primary 3, May could not buy food during recess time as a male classmate had been stealing her money.\xa0\nIn another incident, a group of students took her clipboard and snapped it into half. They also created chat groups online to spread rumours about May and malign her.\xa0\nThe issue of bullying in schools came under the spotlight earlier this month, when one such incident at Mee Toh School was highlighted by Twitter user @4YSLZ in a series of tweets which went viral on social media — prompting a response from Education Minister Ong Ye Kung himself.\xa0\nThe user shared that her sister’s classmates had thrown pieces of paper with insulting notes in the girl’s face and picked on her race.\nThis was not the first time that her sister had been bullied, the Twitter user said, adding that the 11-year-old had been called names and cyberbullied. Her uniform was also vandalised in the past.\nThese incidents and\xa0interviews with bully victims, parents and teachers suggest that bullying is not uncommon in schools — from small unkind remarks to physical altercations and, more recently name-calling on social media.\xa0\nParents and victims acknowledged that intervention by teachers is no silver bullet for stopping bullying in schools. In fact, many of them said\xa0they were not expecting harsh punishments for the perpetrators. At the very least, they want the school to take all reports of bullying seriously and look into them.\nIn response to\xa0queries, the Ministry of Education (MOE) stressed that when bullying incidents are reported, they are “promptly investigated and appropriate disciplinary actions taken against the bullies”.\xa0\nTeachers interviewed say tackling bullying in schools is not so straightforward and their approach may also not always satisfy parents. Not only does bullying come in different forms, it often takes place outside of the classroom, making it difficult to catch the bullies red-handed.\xa0\n""LOW, STABLE""\xa0NUMBER OF CASES\xa0\nThe number of bullying cases has remained “low and stable” in the past five years, said MOE.\xa0\n“However, even though the numbers remain low, we treat each incident with utmost concern,” the ministry reiterated.\xa0\xa0\nIn his Facebook post on the Mee Toh School incident, Mr Ong said that bullying is ""wrong and cannot be tolerated anywhere, especially in schools”.\nThe incident also ""goes against some very fundamental values of what we stand for as a society”, wrote Mr Ong, who added that he was dismayed and troubled after reading about it.\nON THE RECEIVING END\xa0\nWhile schools take a firm stance against bullying, victims often suffer in silence and experience long-term effects of bullying.\nHannah, for example, would not have told her mother about the bullying incidents had the latter not felt that something was amiss when the girl was crying herself to sleep for two nights.\xa0\nThe reason — a tweet by her bully that said: “Your teeth are ugly.”\n“I was afraid if I told my parents and they brought it up to the teachers, (the bullies) would call me a snitch,” she said, adding that her parents might also confiscate her mobile phone.\nShe also lied about having a stomachache to skip school for two days.\nSimilarly, May admitted that she was being bullied only after her mother realised that she had been coming home hungry for nearly two weeks.\nThe girl, whose mother said she has trouble expressing herself, also did not speak up about the other incidents as she wanted to avoid any kind of social engagement with her bullies.\xa0\nMeanwhile, Olivia (not her real name), who was bullied when she was 12, took a month to inform her parents about the incidents, as she had considered the bully her close friend.\xa0\nThe bully would scold Olivia, now 16, for arriving late for their appointments, and demanded that the latter not only pay for her meals but also serve them to her.\nWhen Olivia attempted to apologise to the bully for arriving late, the girl would simply give her the cold shoulder. Later, the bully went online and mockingly parodied the lip-syncing videos which Olivia had posted on the social platform Musical.ly.\xa0\nWhile such acts of mischief could have a lasting effect on those at the receiving end — many of them felt anxious and intense fear at the thought of going to school — several former bullies said they were unaware of the severity of their actions at that time.\xa0\nITE student Lisa (not her real name), who bullied Hannah when they were in secondary school, said the pair only buried the hatchet after they graduated.\nShe said: “I think at that time we were just being stupid teenagers. I didn’t like her because she liked to cry over every little thing so I felt like she was being an attention-seeker.”\nAfter the bullying was reported, her father — who was raising her and two other siblings on his own — was called up by the school and she was asked to apologise to Hannah.\n“I think I was more angry at her when I was asked to apologise. I didn’t understand what I did was wrong and I felt like everyone overreacted,” Lisa said.\xa0\nIt took her three years after the incident to realise how her actions could be deemed as bullying.\nHOW TO IDENTIFY BULLYING\xa0\nSo, what separates actual bullying from childhood mischief?\xa0\nMOE defines bullying as persistent behaviour intended to cause hurt, distress or humiliation and can be physical, verbal or psychological in nature.\nMs Joanne Chua, clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters clinic, said “markers” of bullying include a recurrence of the action, an intent to harm and distress caused to the victim.\xa0\n“I think the fine line depends on how the person on the opposite side perceives it and how it impacts them,” she said.\nDr Gregory Liem, an Associate Professor at the National Institute of Education, said often, victims of bullying share the same characteristics.\xa0\nThey are usually more timid or anxious, physically weaker or smaller, and have traits that are different from the majority of students, such as a learning disability.\nMs Chua said bullying is also related to the “ingroup” and “outgroup” concept — where the treatment of the child by his peers depends on how he is perceived in the group.\xa0\n“If the child is out of the group, they are more susceptible to bullying… but this doesn’t apply to all children,” she added.\xa0\nMs Chua said that trusted adults — such as parents and teachers — should look out for signs of distress in children which include changes in behaviour, mood and academic performance.\n“Some research suggests that bullied children might also have psychosomatic symptoms such as headache, stomachache or night terrors,” she said.\nWhile some bullying incidents may seem minor, such as name-calling, they can still have a significant impact on the child, the experts said.\nSome long-term effects include mood disorder, anxiety and low self-esteem.\nTwo victims\xa0said they still have nightmares and are seeking help for their anxiety.\xa0\n""SEPARATE THE ACTIONS FROM THE PERSON""\nDespite the harmful effects on those at the receiving end, experts caution against ostracising or labelling misbehaving children or youth as bullies — especially by those in authority.\xa0\nDr Liem pointed out that some of the common traits among those in this group include the need to assert themselves as a stronger figure or of higher status,\xa0\xa0and they might be those who do not perform well academically.\nMs Chua said they are usually those who are unable to inhibit their responses.\n“Perhaps they want to interact with others but they don\'t know how to, or it could also be a set of learnt behaviour that they picked up from their environment,” she said.\n“It is good to separate the child from his actions (and) to not label the child as a bully. We don’t want to perpetuate the stigma of the child being a bully.”\xa0\nLabelling children or youth could affect their identity and self-esteem, she added. Moreover, both victims and bullies could end up believing the labels are part of their identity and act them out.\xa0\n“For the bully, I think it’s possible to correct the behaviour. I don’t think it\'s very useful to label these children so early in their lives,” she said.\nThe experts recommended a holistic and systemic approach to tackling bullying cases.\n“In terms of intervention, it has to be more systemic. It should not just be contained to the school. It should include the child’s environment, the people at home and the community the child is in,” said Ms Chua.\nDr Liem noted that it is easier for teachers to identify physical bullying since the damage to the victim can be more readily assessed, but the more challenging task is to detect bullying that takes place outside of the classroom — such as on social media.\nHe added that social media can be a double-edged sword; although a useful source of information, it also offers a good platform for bullies to prey on their victims.\xa0\nSCHOOL PROTOCOLS TO HANDLE BULLYING CASES\xa0\nTeachers and school counsellors said schools usually have a set of protocols to deal with bullying. These guidelines vary from school to school and can be tailored to meet the institution’s needs.\nWhen a potential case of bullying is reported, the teacher generally will be required to make an incident report and interview the involved parties and any eye witnesses who are present at the time of the incident.\nIn serious cases, parents may also be called in to be interviewed and be involved in the mediation process.\nBut while these protocols may be there to help guide teachers, the teachers, counsellors and former educators\xa0interviewed agreed that dealing with bullying cases is a complex and tricky process.\xa0\nThey could not be named because they were not authorised to speak with the media.\xa0\nThose who teach at the primary school level said acts of mischief — be it unkind remarks or physical fights — occur among children every day and it may not be possible for them to follow up on every single case.\nThat is why, they said, teachers have to assess whether issues that are flagged up by students are severe enough to be escalated to the school’s discipline committee. Often, these would be repeated incidents that target a specific individual.\xa0\nOn the other hand, secondary school teachers said older students were usually shrewd enough not to misbehave in front of teachers and parents, and bullying thus often takes place behind the adults’ backs.\nCompounding this problem is the fact that a lot of bullying now takes place online on social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and TikTok, which teachers may not always be very familiar with.\nSaid one educator: “Even if a teacher uses social media, how many would follow their students and how many students will let their teachers follow them? Some of them even have multiple accounts on the same platform.\xa0\n“A lot of stuff is going on and it’s very hard for us to know something is happening until a student thinks it\'s serious enough and trusts us enough to tell us the problem.”\nOther teachers reiterated that they often have to depend on students to sound the alarm when bullying surfaces, as they cannot have eyes everywhere.\nEven then, one teacher noted that not many students are mature enough to know when is the right time to flag serious issues.\n“Students don’t want to be known as a ‘snitch’... because of that usually when it’s brought to my attention (the bullying) has already become quite serious,” said the 37-year-old.\nPUNISHING BULLIES: ""HARD APPROACH""\xa0NOT ALWAYS THE BEST\xa0\nEven when a case of bullying has been established, the school will have to grapple with another issue: What is the appropriate form of punishment for the student who has misbehaved.\xa0\nTeachers said many factors would come into consideration here, including the student’s age, the severity of the bullying, and whether he or she is a repeat offender.\xa0\nAgreeing with the views of psychologists and counsellors, the teachers said coming down hard on the bullies is not necessarily the best way to tackle the problem.\n“The hard approach may not always work for some students… not all bullies should be caned. We have to look at situations on a case by case basis… there is no one-size-fits-all approach,” said one former educator.\xa0\nAnother teacher noted that harsher punishments, such as suspension and caning, do not necessarily stop the bullies from retaliating against their victims.\nThat is why the disciplinary system needs to go hand in hand with counselling sessions for the victims, said the 34-year-old. Such sessions can help the victims to learn some strategies on how to handle the bullies.\xa0\nFor example, victims would receive tips on how to cope and what to do when bullied. Bullies themselves are also counselled to rehabilitate them and help them understand the underlying causes for bullying behavior.\nSchool counsellors are usually roped in after a punishment has been meted out to help bullies understand how their actions and words have impacted the victims, and why the bad behaviour should not be repeated.\nWhile the teachers said they try to step in and intervene when bullying incidents are brought to their attention, they noted that it is not always possible for each case to be settled according to the parents’ desired outcome.\xa0\nFor example, said one teacher, the bully’s parents may not agree with the school’s assessment which, in turn, would make it difficult for the student to understand the severity of his or her actions.\xa0\n“Parents may sometimes be uncooperative because they think the issue is a small one. We cannot do much then because we can’t force the parents to support our programmes (if they do not want to),” he said.\nAt the other end, parents of bully victims may view the punishment meted out to the perpetrators as a mere slap on the wrist, causing them to think that the school does not take bullying cases seriously.\xa0\nWHAT PARENTS SAY\xa0\nParents interviewed\xa0offered differing assessments on whether the schools had handled the cases involving their bullied children well.\nSome felt that the schools did not take the reports of bullying seriously enough. For example, Olivia’s parents claimed that their daughter’s school had given short shrift to her case, after they had compiled a list of incidents and brought it to the discipline mistress’ attention.\n“I felt angry that the school was not transparent nor thorough with its investigations… it felt as if the school had merely paid lip service to its ‘zero tolerance’ to bullying,” said the parents, who declined to be named.\xa0\xa0\nBut some parents were grateful for how their children’s schools did their best to look into the incidents and try to resolve them.\nMay’s teacher, for example, had stepped in and asked the boy who had been stealing from the girl to apologise and return her money. She also asked the bullies who broke May’s file to buy her a new one.\xa0\n“I’m so thankful to that teacher. I told the teacher: ‘I’m so glad that I have you as my girl’s teacher’,” said May’s 45-year-old mother, who wanted to be known only as Ms Toh.\nAnother parent, a 43-year-old lawyer who declined to be named, said when her son, then 11, received hurtful notes from his classmates, his teachers swiftly stepped in and handled the situation effectively.\n“It was never escalated to the principal, because there was no need to. They also showed anti-bullying videos to educate the rest of the class on what bullying is,” she said.\nParents reiterated that when their children were bullied, they, too, felt the pain.\n“It is agonising to know your child is going through something and you can’t protect her. I would get upset and I would cry too,” said Ms Toh.\nAgreeing, Olivia’s father said: “(Bullying) doesn’t just affect the victim, but the parents as well. There is a lot of guilt in me because she was suffering in silence.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     The Big Read ', '     education ', '     MOE ', '     schools ']}"

      COVID-19: Parents voice frustration over learning centres' arrangements amid suspension of classes
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Some parents have voiced frustration over learning centres\' arrangements for students after the suspension of centre-based classes was announced on Tuesday (Mar 24).\nThe suspension, which aims to reduce the mixing of students from different schools, is among new measures rolled out to ensure safe distancing, as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise.\nWith classes now put on hold until\xa0the end of April, many centres have turned to home-based learning, with lessons mostly delivered online.\xa0\nThe arrangements vary -\xa0some send out pre-recorded videos, while others arrange for students to sign in to video conferencing platforms like ClassDo or Zoom.\nBut some parents feel shortchanged, and petitions against the centres’ practices have sprung up.\nA handful of parents whose\xa0children are enrolled in\xa0Chinese enrichment centre Berries World told CNA that based on their past experience with the centre’s home-based learning resources, the videos could be about 20 minutes long and do not\xa0match up to regular classes, which last for about one and a half hours.\xa0\nThe centre usually conducts home-based learning in place of classes on public holidays. \xa0\nParents said there isn’t sufficient teacher engagement, which makes such classes\xa0less effective.\nSome have demanded a refund of their\xa0centre fees, while others have called for all classes to be rescheduled to after the suspension.\xa0\n“I think Berries should give parents the option of deferring lessons and not just throw us home-based learning,” said Mrs Jaclyn Neo, whose two children go to the centre.\xa0\nMore than 1,000 people have signed an online petition\xa0that criticises the centre.\nCENTRE RESPONDS TO CRITICISM\nBerries World’s assistant manager for corporate communications Ang Weifeng explained that its alternative arrangements have to be looked at in its totality, and it is\xa0constantly improving its resources.\n""Pre-school children have shorter attention spans, so if video lessons stretch beyond 15 or 20 minutes, it will be very challenging for the child. The children would have the activity books so they will perform the exercises in tandem. After that, if parents permit, our teachers will do a live face-to-face video call to check on their progress.”\xa0\nAccording to Mr Ang, Nursery to Primary 4\xa0students will have two lessons deferred, while the rest of the classes will be delivered through home-based learning.\xa0\n“To avoid disruption to Primary 5 and Primary 6 students, who will be facing critical examinations ahead, a combination of home-based online learning and live interaction will be conducted,” he said.\xa0\nCredit vouchers of between S$50 and S$65 will also be issued to all students.\nGiven the short notice to suspend classes,\xa0Mr Ang said the centre had to scramble to come up with more engaging materials, such as\xa0videos incorporating music and dance for young children, on top of existing home-based learning resources.\xa0\nHe added that home-based learning classes\xa0range\xa0in duration. Some videos and interaction last more than\xa0an hour,\xa0but for younger children, videos are segmented into 10 minute to 20 minute portions.\xa0\nBut with about 20,000 students enrolled across its 20 outlets, he said it has been a challenge to respond to parents’ queries promptly.\n“We received the news on Tuesday evening. So within a few hours, we had to come up with a holistic plan. We do acknowledge that communication could have been tightened … We\'ve personally spoken to some of them, so we hope this helps to bridge the gap,” he added.\xa0\nFor some parents, their initial frustration has quelled\xa0after they managed to get clarity about the online classes.\xa0\n“I think they are trying to work on it, so let’s give them some time to figure things out. With feedback, we hope that there will be progress and a reasonable solution,” said Ms\xa0Vanessa Poh, whose child attends\xa0Berries World.\xa0\nCONCERNS OVER INTERFACE AND LESSON TIMES\nAnother centre, The Learning Lab, has\xa0been inundated with calls from anxious parents.\xa0\nComplaints were targeted at lesson times, as well as its online learning interface and resources.\xa0\nMr Su Wei Li, who has a daughter in Primary 5 enrolled in The Learning Lab, told CNA that online lessons are scheduled at a different time from regular classes in the centre, making\xa0it hard for families as they have to shift their commitments.\xa0\nHe added that his daughter was not\xa0offered alternative arrangements even though she could not\xa0attend the online classes.\xa0\nHe logged on to observe the lesson, which was conducted on the class’\xa0discussion forum.\xa0\n“The materials consist of videos that students must watch, and quizzes, on top of a messaging box. How this can aid primary school students’ learning is beyond me. There is no video conference nor teacher-recorded video sessions,” he said. \xa0\n“Parents are not unreasonable, we know that every business is trying to find a solution. But the way in which it has been managed -\xa0it’s quite a one-way communication. Now lessons have already commenced without consultation (with)\xa0parents.”\nMore than 350 people have signed a petition online criticising the centre.\nIn response to CNA’s queries, The Learning Lab said it has received mixed feedback, particularly about\xa0its discussion forum sessions.\nThe centre said it chose solutions that students were already familiar with\xa0and adapted them to ease the transition to home-based learning.\xa0\n""However, we are listening to our parents, taking their feedback and seeking to incorporate more interactive features such as web conferences,"" the centre said.\n""This is an unprecedented event from which all of us are learning, and we are committed to do better by our students and parents.”\xa0\nThe centre also said it has developed different programmes to cater for children of\xa0various age groups.\xa0\nFor instance, younger students from\xa0Nursery 2 to Primary 2 have been offered replacement classes as the centre recognises the need for physical engagement, while older students from Secondary 1 to JC2 will take part in class-based web conference sessions, as well as forum discussions.\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     COVID-19 ']}"

      Wine education, right from the comfort and privacy of your own home
  </h1>, 'text': 'Sommeliers fret over wine glasses: Are they of the right shape? Are they spotless? Do they feel cheap? Not many would imagine that a wine bucket – that utilitarian container which sometimes doubles as an unglamorous spittoon during wine-tasting sessions – has the potential to ruin an event.\nAt a high-profile event in Singapore, private sommelier Tan Kok Hong realised that the hosting restaurant had wine buckets that were of the wrong size: His client had brought top Bordeaux and Burgundy wines in large bottle formats – Imperial (six-litre), Salmanazar (nine-litre), and Balthazar (12-litre) – none of which could fit into the regular size buckets.\nIn the end, he resorted to using a large soup pot to chill the wines at the back of the house.\nAs a private sommelier, Tan has to “react spontaneously to problems”. “I need to ensure that the flow of the event is smooth. There is no room for mistakes. It’s like a concert; one take from the beginning to the end,” said Tan, who has 21 years of experience as a restaurant sommelier.\nIn 2017, he set up Kohota Consultancy, a wine and spirits consultancy that offers marketing services for wineries and sake breweries, and sommelier services for private and corporate clients. His clientele for the latter consists of politicians, doctors, lawyers, property developers, and celebrities – most of them come from Asia, while some are from Europe and the US.\nTan is one of the growing band of sommeliers who are offering their expertise to private customers. He notes that many private sommeliers are also employees of wine distribution companies.\n“[These distributors] have a quite a number of private clients, so a private sommelier can offer their expertise as an add-on service on top of the wine sales to build loyalty,” he said.\n“Many [of my private customers] are wine enthusiasts who want to learn something about wine but are not sure how to go about doing it, so I help to guide them.” – Gerald Lu\nIndra Kumar is one such private sommelier. As a project consultant for Singapore Straits Wine Company, a wine retailer and distributor, he offers his services to private clients and corporate events.\n“The main challenge [in my job] is to give my repeat clients new experiences,” said Kumar, who has 14 years of industry experience and last worked as a sommelier at VLV Restaurant and Bar. “We don’t want to keep doing the same thing, so I have to think of new activities and concepts.”\nHe conceptualises the wine event around a given theme or the client’s preferences. If he is given a carte blanche, he’d find out what the client has done in the past and offer new ideas. Some events involve wine games with prizes to be won, and activities that serve as team-bonding sessions.\nKumar says he has the opportunity to select wines from the portfolios of different importers – and not just Singapore Straits Wine Company’s – for his clients, whereas a restaurant sommelier may be limited by what he has in the restaurant.\nNot every private sommelier is doing their gig as a full-time job, though.\n“Most of them are normally working [full-time] in F&B establishments because that is their main source of income. So they offer their private sommelier services as a freelance assignment or as an extension of the services from their existing employers,” added Kumar.\nFor example, Gerald Lu, head sommelier of Praelum Wine Bistro, works freelance as a private sommelier. He handles engagements like private wine classes and dinners, and also advises on food and wine pairings. “Many [of my private customers] are wine enthusiasts who want to learn something about wine but are not sure how to go about doing it, so I help to guide them,” he said.\n“My clients tell me they feel relieved in engaging me as a private sommelier. I took away their stress in the wine-handling area. They could relax and just focus on entertaining their guests and enjoying their food.” – Tan Kok Hong\nHis clients are “fairly wealthy” people who want to do private dinners in their homes and are comfortable with paying “S$2,000 to S$3,000 for the entire service”. Others are corporate customers who hold the event in their office or at their boss’s house. The fee varies, depending on the wine selections and venue logistics.\nLu says the role of a sommelier has evolved to cater to trends in the market. “The concept of luxury is no longer about people walking into a three Michelin-starred restaurant. It is now more of a silent luxury, doing what you can afford and having the experience in the comfort of your own home,” he remarked.\nBeing part of the close-knit sommelier fraternity in Singapore is advantageous for Lu’s role as a private sommelier, too. During a private event, he discovered that two of the wines were “corked”, an industry jargon that refers to the chemical 2,4,6-tricholoranisole (TCA for short), which taints corks and gives a mouldy smell to wines.\nSince it was a weekend, suppliers didn’t deliver wines. He made a couple of phone calls to his sommelier buddies, who loaned him the same wines from their establishments.\nLu thinks the main difference between a restaurant sommelier and a private sommelier is the latter offers a more intimate interaction with the customer.\n“In a restaurant, you have to serve other tables. But as a private sommelier, you aren’t rushed; you have time to sit down and explain, talk in detail about wine regions or show pictures [from your phone],” he said. “As a guest, you can pick the sommelier’s brain and tap his knowledge. And there’s the friendship you cultivate with a sommelier. It’s always good to have a sommelier friend.”\nTan said, “My clients tell me they feel relieved in engaging me as a private sommelier. I took away their stress in the wine-handling area. They could relax and just focus on entertaining their guests and enjoying their food.”\n“The main challenge [in my job] is to give my repeat clients new experiences. We don’t want to keep doing the same thing, so I have to think of new activities and concepts.” – Indra Kumar\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Singapore ', '     Fine dining ']}"

      COVID-19: Schools to conduct home-based learning once a week from April
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From April, students in primary and secondary schools as well as junior colleges and centralised institutes will have one day of home-based learning a week, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Friday (Mar 27).\nThe move comes amid an increase in the number of imported COVID-19 cases in Singapore and enhanced measures to stem the spread of the outbreak.\nSchools will stagger dismissal times to “reduce the transient congestion of students” on days when they are not on home-based learning, said MOE.\nEducation Minister Ong Ye Kung said that the new system will allow Singaporeans to ""get used"" to idea of home-based learning, and allow the ministry to expand the new system to more days, if neccessary.\xa0\n""Schools are not closing,"" Mr Ong told reporters.\n""But what we have been working on is to prepare for some introduction of home-based learning.\n""As the crisis develops, you will find that you have more arsenal, more measures to respond to as opposed to a sudden drastic change that will get everyone panicked, which is what we always want to avoid,"" he added.\nPrimary schools will carry out home-based learning on Wednesdays, secondary schools on Thursdays, while junior colleges and centralised institutes will conduct them on Friday, said MOE.\nThere will be about four to five hours of home-based learning, and about two hours of screen time.\nMOE Kindergartens will not be affected by the arrangement.\n“The recent spike in imported cases signals a new phase in our nation’s fight against COVID-19”, said MOE.\n“To support further safe distancing, schools will progressively transit to a blended learning model, starting with one day of home-based learning a week,” the ministry said.\n\nSCHOOLS TO ASSIST STUDENTS WITH NO ACCESS TO DIGITAL DEVICES\nThe ministry added that schools will provide instructions to students and parents on accessing home-based learning materials from Monday.\n“When this requires use of digital devices, schools will assist students who do not have access,” said MOE, adding that the ministry’s headquarters will provide schools with sufficient resources.\nThe Singapore Student Learning Space will also be accessible to students during this period, it said.\n“While digital technologies will play a key part in home-based learning, all our students can rely upon the ongoing support of their teachers and other school personnel,” said MOE.\nStudents in Special Education (SPED) Schools and their parents will also receive home-based learning support for the customised curriculum from SPED teacher through regular contact.\nWILL THERE BE SCHOOL CLOSURES?\nWhile Mr Ong said that he hopes the situation ""won\'t come to that"", the ministry is not ruling out the option that it may have to close schools.\xa0\n""The virus situation is changing\xa0all the time. I wish we can avoid that because the disruption to lives is tremendous,"" he said.\nOn how long parents can expect the once-a-week home-based learning to last for, Mr Ong said that it ""depends how long the virus lasts"".\nHe also addressed concerns for students sitting for examinations, noting that he is ""quite determined"" for learning to continue.\n""Even if schools go into more days of home-based learning, or even all days home-based learning, if the situation is so bad, learning must continue, and we must be able to support students learning from home. That’s why next week is important to start this. And if learning can continue, we don’t have to stop exams,"" he said.\nWhile the ministry will try its best to continue with major examinations such as the Primary School Leaving Examination, and GSCE O-Level, N-Level and A-Level, there is scope for some adjustment.\n""If really curriculum time is squeezed, certain topics for example can be taken out of the exam. And in the grading of the exam, if certain questions involve those topics, you can also take into account that this topic was not taught.\xa0\n""These are some of the adjustments we can still make so that exams can continue and continue to be fair to all students,"" said Mr Ong.\nSTUDENT CARE PRIORITY GIVEN TO PARENTS WITH JOBS IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES\nSchools will remain open for “a small group of students” whose parents are not able to secure alternative childcare arrangement, said MOE, adding that priority will be given to parents in essential services such as healthcare.\nTwenty per cent of teachers will be in school to supervise these students, as well as support students at home who may have any enquires,\xa0said Mr Ong.\nHowever, schools will be selective with those they allow to come to school and school-based student care centres.\nSchools will allow only\xa0about 10 per cent of those currently enrolled in school-based student care centres to return to school during home-based learning days.\nAdditionally, all centre-based learning including at MOE Language Centres will continue to be conducted in a home-based learning format until the end Term 2.\n“For graduating students in Secondary 4 and 5, and JC2, the mode of learning can take the form of video-conferencing in their respective schools or at home, so that ‘live’ lessons can still be conducted without them having to travel to the centres and mingle across schools,” said MOE.\nMeanwhile, co-curricular activities as well as external activities and those that involve the mingling of students across schools - such as Learning Journeys, activities at Outdoor Adventure Learning Centres and the National School Games - will also remain suspended for the rest of the term.\nThe Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation will also be cancelled.\n“Home-based learning will not be able to fully replace the depth and variety of learning experiences that out students derive from being physically present in school”, said MOE.\n“We are also conscious that moving to home-based learning will have impact on many parents and families, especially those without good home support. Hence, we want to progressively introduce home-based learning, so as to allow both our students and parents to be better prepared should the situation call for more days of home-based learning,” said the ministry.\nIt added that it will put in place additional measures to help students with higher needs or those who require more support for this arrangement.\nParents who face challenges with home-based learning may approach schools for support, said Mr Ong.\n""Twenty per cent (of teachers)\xa0will still come to school and parents with challenges during home-based learning, they can still bring their children to school and the teachers will supervise them,"" he said, adding that children of healthcare workers and children from more vulnerable families will be given priority.\nHe said that he expects there to be teething issues with the new system and called for parents and their employers to be understanding.\n""I really seek the understanding of parents that we need to do this. Parents have been very understanding, very accommodative, but now I seek your further understanding that one day a week, the child will be at home doing study,"" he said.\n""I know it can affect parents\' work ... Employers, please be as understanding as possible, support the parents, to do it one day a week,"" he added.\nCHILDREN AT ""MORE RISK"" IF SCHOOLS CLOSE: PM LEE\nThe introduction of home-based learning comes amid concern among parents following a cluster of COVID-19 cases at\xa0PAP Community Foundation (PCF)\xa0Sparkletots centre in Fengshan\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, as well as at\xa0Dover Court International School.\xa0\nLast month,\xa0a 12-year-old student from Raffles Institution was infected with COVID-19.\xa0\nSingapore on Thursday reported\xa052 new cases of COVID-19, bringing its total number of cases to 683.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nEarlier on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said that children may be at ""more risk"" of contracting COVID-19 if schools were closed and parents are not at home to take care of their children.\xa0\nSchool is a ""controlled environment"" and not all parents can look after children at home if schools are shut, he said.\nMr Lee also highlighted that children would\xa0be at a disadvantage if enrichment stopped\xa0and\xa0if teachers were unable to socialise with their students and guide them.\xa0\nChildren\xa0who ""bear the burden more"" are the ones from lower income families, he added.\xa0\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     education ']}"

      NUS, NTU students allowed to take more modules on ungraded basis to ease COVID-19 anxiety
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Two universities are allowing students to take more modules on an ungraded basis to ease\xa0concerns about their education during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to emails issued on Wednesday (Mar 25).\xa0\nThe satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) option allows students to take modules on an ungraded basis so that they do not affect their grade point average.

      Commentary: No ordinary disruption – a rising generation meets the coronavirus
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: “An unprecedented crisis” – those were the words of National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs Singapore’s COVID-19 taskforce, in announcing tighter border restrictions to combat the coronavirus outbreak on Sunday (Mar 22).\nAn unprecedented crisis, the ongoing global pandemic has changed all our lives. And among those who have felt the brunt of the rush to contain COVID-19, are students in higher education all across the world.\xa0\nAt home, the Ministry of Education on Mar 15 announced a recall of students on official overseas placements, including all internships and exchange programmes. In addition, institutes of higher learning will suspend all overseas placements until the end of July.\nRelatedly, Singaporean students studying overseas have been encouraged to return home soon, with the Government liaising with airlines to facilitate return flights.\nMeanwhile, Singaporean students studying locally have had to rapidly adjust to new academic arrangements, whilst dealing with a suspension of their planned trajectories for 2020 and possibly beyond.\nAs it becomes increasingly clear that the COVID-19 outbreak will last a year, even more, a difficult realisation is starting to dawn for my generation of youth: This is only the beginning. To borrow the title of a 2014 book associated with the McKinsey Global Institute, this is no ordinary disruption.\nNO ORDINARY DISRUPTION\nOn the economic front, a brewing economic storm will likely cause tightened hiring and reduced job vacancies, carrying the prospect of underemployment fresh out of graduation.\nInternships will also be in shorter supply, while competition rises due to higher demand from returning students and students whose summer overseas placements have been suspended. The risk of a gap in one’s resume looms.\nFurthermore, most major events that make for prime networking events for graduating students will likely be cancelled for the foreseeable future. Increasingly stringent social distancing measures will inevitably disrupt the activities of social causes that define this generation; even one’s social life will likely take a hit.\nLess tangibly, significant milestones such as commencement and graduation trips will never materialise in the ways they were supposed to, the finishing line of a decades-long race suddenly disappearing just as one approaches.\nAgainst the backdrop of an already uncertain future stemming from technological changes and trade tensions, the changes brought about by the coronavirus add up.\nDay by day, they add up to a gradual, persistent disruption of previously planned rising trajectories – there’s no denying that the world has been dealt a bad hand.\nA once-familiar equilibrium has been disturbed, and the race is on for students, graduates and workers to quickly find a new one, to regain control over our plans and lived experiences.\nTHE FIGHT FOR CONTROL\nIt is here that I must switch to the first-person, “I”, for the above was a product of intensely personal reflection over the past few weeks, as I felt many familiar routines slipping away and a gradual erosion of my plans for the year.\nThe late economic historian Peter L\xa0Bernstein wrote: “The ability to define what may happen in the future and to choose among alternatives lies at the heart of contemporary societies.""\nChoice, preparedness, control – a global pandemic seems to challenge all these. It emerged from nowhere, and now that it’s here, it is easy to feel somewhat lost, vulnerable and strung along through the days.\nHow does one regain that sense of control? I have three pieces of advice for all my peers reading this, wondering about their disrupted futures in a time of coronavirus.\nFirst, switch from being reactive to being proactive.\nThe reason why I felt “strung along” was because I was constantly reacting to what the COVID-19 situation threw at me; I was not in control of the narrative. What I needed to do was to get ahead of developments, to take back control by finding a new destination to head to when the route to old ones now seem increasingly murky.\nSo I decided that I would finally pursue a dream of mine of writing a book about writing skills for young adults.\nEmbarking on this project will allow me to take back the wheel in my 2020 journey. Plus, should I decide to take on a writing-related or research career in future, this could stand me in good stead.\nThe question you should ask is: What is something that I have always wanted to do, but have never been able to as I was always too busy? It need not be career-related, but if it is, a second piece of advice is in order.\nThe second piece of advice is this: Focus not on getting through this “downturn”, but being ready to ride the upturn when it comes.\nIf such language seems familiar, it’s because Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat used it in his Budget 2020 speech.\nOne month on, the phrase that stuck with me most from Mr Heng’s speech is “when the upturn comes”.\nThe exact sentence was: “We\xa0want to help our workers retain their jobs, and use any lull period to upgrade their skills, and be ready when the upturn comes.”\nThat sentence was about workers, but it equally applies to those of us who are still studying and have yet to enter the workforce. This lull period is an opportune time to plug skill gaps that may limit the attractiveness of potential job applications and to seek out mentorship on how to improve ourselves.\nWe could research and be more in tune with emerging trends in the job market which will come to bear when the upturn comes.\nMore radically, in this lull period, we have the capacity to take a good hard look at where we are heading professionally, and ask if that is where we truly want to go. We can then make necessary adjustments to our planned trajectories which we can realise once the upturn arrives.\nAND NOW, A TWIST\nUnderlying these two pieces of advice is a call to do something you may not have normally done. Will this guarantee that things will work out for the best in the end? Of course not.\nThe final piece of advice is thus one of mindset – be ready to take a risk.\nHere’s a twist: The quote from Peter L Bernstein which sparked this discussion was from a book titled Against The Gods: The Remarkable Story Of Risk.\nAccording to Bernstein, the word “risk” comes from the early Italian word risicare, meaning “to dare”.\nTo be proactive, and to be ready for the upturn, we must dare to do what we typically might not have considered, explore potential new paths, seek out opportunities in industries beyond those we originally set our sights on, collaborate with others to work on novel projects and start new initiatives.\nThink of it this way: We already have nothing to lose, and thus, everything to gain.\nNo matter what, of course, there is no denying that an unprecedented crisis dealt us a bad hand. This wasn’t what we planned for, this wasn’t what we wanted.\nBut make no mistake, whether we’re studying, about to graduate, or in the job market, we can retake the wheel; we can regain control; we have agency.\nAnd perhaps, if we play our cards right, we can also make this an unprecedented opportunity.\nDownload\xa0our\xa0app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak:\xa0https://cna.asia/telegram\nNg Chia Wee is a second-year student at the National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and Tembusu College.

      Commentary: How prepared are parents for suspension of schools if that happens?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Parents were slightly spooked last week.\nAfter the Singapore Government announced a fresh round of border restrictions, Minister for National Development and co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce Lawrence Wong had said on Wednesday\xa0(Mar 11) he would not rule out the possibility of closing schools to stem the spread of COVID-19 here.\nHowever, Mr Wong caveated that authorities would need to be sure that such a drastic measure would be effective in slowing the chain of transmission first.\nEarlier that same day, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also listed school closures as one potential measure Singapore can call upon in the event of a spike. Referring to a suite of additional measures as “extra brakes”, he said that they may help slow down community transmission of the virus.\nAs cases of new infections in Singapore rose sharply these past few days, some quarters grew increasingly concerned over whether this move would be made.\nAnd so many parents breathed a sigh of relief when the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Family and Social Development clarified on Thursday (Mar 19) that schools and kindergartens will reopen after the March holidays as scheduled.\nBut a 14-day Leave of Absence will be issued to students and school staff who travelled overseas since the start of the school holidays, as an additional precautionary measure given the surge in imported cases.\nStill, while we all hope we will not come to this point, are Singaporean parents prepared if such a day comes?\nMAJOR ADJUSTMENTS IN LIFESTYLE\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has reshaped many aspects of our lives over the past two months and pushed Singaporeans to alter our lifestyles quite dramatically.\nMore people are working from home, fewer are travelling, and everyone is upkeeping top-notch standards of personal hygiene as well as ensuring that their children practise these new habits.\n“Wash your hands.” “Cough into your elbows.” All are common refrains you might overhear at a restaurant or hawker centre.\nInculcating new hygiene habits in our young has not been an easy task. Kids, being kids, despite constant reminders not to touch their faces or cough into the air, still do the exact things we tell them not to. (Many adults too are guilty.)\nMany families are also opting to keep their children at home, or having smaller-scale play dates within the home or outdoors instead of heading to the malls or indoor playgrounds.\nSome are even scheduling more tuition hours to keep their children occupied at home.\nOrdering groceries and meals online has quickly become the norm, even for folks who have not done so in the past.\nAll these in the name of social distancing, or reducing one's movements and social activities, so as to lower the risk of catching the virus or transmitting it unknowingly.\nCERTAIN GROUPS WILL BE MORE AFFECTED\nBut coping with a week-long school holiday – with kids kept largely at home – is quite different from dealing with an extended period of school closure.\nThe last time Singapore shuttered her schools was during the SARS period in March 2003.\nWhen you consider dual-income families, single-parent families, and families with members working shifts or in healthcare, the decision whether or not to close schools becomes especially tricky.\nEven for households with a parent working from home, balancing the demands of work while dealing with rowdy toddlers and sibling conflicts can be hair-raising to say the least. I’ve already heard some friends quip that working from home just isn't working out for them.\nIn spite of working from home for the past six years, I still find it tough to juggle work and kids during school holidays.\nThe fact remains that some will be harder hit by school closures, such as when the main caregiver needs to be at work physically in order to pay the month’s bills, and have little remote working options.\nWhen is it bad enough to warrant such a drastic and socially disruptive measure?\nHOW MUCH TIME CAN SCHOOL CLOSURES BUY, IF AT ALL? \nThe gravest concern among governments worldwide is that if the number of cases get too big too soon, the healthcare system might be overwhelmed.\nBy progressively applying a range of interventions, such as what the Singapore Government has done with contact tracing, quarantine measures and border restrictions, we can keep the number of cases at a more manageable level, thereby flattening the curve and reducing the peak.\nIf the situation worsens, however, more drastic measures such as closure of schools, commercial activities and public spaces may come into play.\nIn particular, if children are playing a role in disease transmission, as research published in the journal Paediatrics suggests, closing schools could buy healthcare systems critical time in the context of a wide-ranging community spread.\nOne study in Nature in 2006 found that closing schools at the peak of an influenza pandemic could reduce the rate of spread by up to 40 per cent.\nAnother study on influenza suggests that school closure can reduce the spread between children but has only a moderate effect on average transmission rates in the wider population.\nHowever, such research assumes a higher attack rate in children, which experts have said does not seem to be the case with COVID-19.\nAnd would a bigger portion of our youths end up outside where the risks of transmission could be greater than in the relatively safe and controlled confines of a school?\nAuthor of Influenza: The 100-Year Hunt to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History Dr Jeremy Brown highlights a second conundrum in a commentary in The Atlantic:\xa0\nPublic closings cannot last forever. They must, sooner or later, be lifted … While mortality rates declined during closures, once they were relaxed, the influenza virus found fertile new territory.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSUPPORT NEEDED FOR VULNERABLE FAMILIES\nWhen cases of COVID-19 rose in Japan in early March, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced nationwide school closures.\nThis unexpected move was met with huge scepticism and outrage as it created a logistical nightmare for some 13 million children across Japan – and their teachers and parents.\nThis case illustrates how parents, educators and authorities would do well to plan ahead for a school closure, whether it is allowing schools and teachers some runway to create e-learning resources and assignments, or giving parents some heads up so that alternate care arrangements can be made.\nIf both parents are working, can one work from home or apply urgent childcare leave? Can companies extend more flexibility?\nAlternative, can grandparents or a kind neighbour be enlisted to help?\nHow can we plan our children’s schedules to also avoid large social gatherings?\nIf there ever was a time when the community needs to rally together and show greater solidarity, it is now.\nFor those struggling to make ends meet and must show up at work in order not to lose their jobs, could financial assistance be provided? Or could a classroom at every school be kept open for parents without alternative child-minders? This latter point could help keep kids away from the streets.\nIt may take some creative engineering, but these may smoothen the rough edges of this control measure and reduce the costs of activating it – particularly for lower-income families.\nAs for the rest of us, school closures, if activated, up the ante in terms of coronavirus-related inconveniences but it helps to remember the purpose of it all – to see our children, our nation and our world free from the clutches of COVID-19 sooner rather than later.\nDownload our app\xa0or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of\xa0Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     COVID-19 ', '     Singapore ', '     Parenting ', '     education ']}"

The current median fee is S$295 per month, close to the median of S$290 per month in 2015, he said.\nFor school-based SCCs, the Ministry of Education puts in place measures to keep fees affordable, he said.\nOperators are selected via a competitive procurement process, where they are required to state any proposed fee increases throughout their six-year contract upfront.

The work is just beginning. In a way, how we intend to do this is uncharted waters,” he said.\nHe noted that some early ideas include providing information and raising awareness about available resources, so that people know where to go for help\xa0and to do so earlier.\n“I hope many Singaporeans will partner us to jointly develop solutions for a happier and healthier Singapore. Our young people deserve the best start in life possible,” he said.\nWhile mental health is not a new area for MSF, “we are keenly aware of the issues and struggles faced by those who have mental health issues”, Mr Lee said.\n“A person’s mental well-being affects their families, neighbours, colleagues and friends.

Likewise, community organisations may not always know which students and families need help,” said Second Education Minister Indranee Rajah during the committee of supply debate on Wednesday (Mar 4).\nTo “close this coordination gap”, the\xa0Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce (UPLIFT) taskforce is piloting a new programme with the Ministry of Social and Family Development in three towns - Woodlands, Kreta Ayer and Boon Lay.\nA town-level coordinator based in the Social Service Office of the three towns will “integrate school-based and community-based support” under the\xa0UPLIFT Community Pilot.\n“Where\xa0students have emerging attendance issue and needs that can be met by community-based programmes, schools will refer them to the coordinator,” said Ms Indranee.\n“By improving coordination, we can set up protective factors around the students and their families faster, and address underlying causes of absenteeism earlier.”\nMOE estimates that more than 300 students will benefit from this new system from 2020 to 2022.\nSCHOOL-BASED STUDENT CARE CENTRES\nMOE will also have school-based student care centres in primary and after-school programmes in secondary schools for students who “do not have a conducive home environment to return to after school”.\n“Providing these students with a structured and supervised after-school environment gives them the opportunity to develop good habits, routines and skills that will help them succeed in life,” said Ms Indranee.\nShe added that the taskforce, which supports students from disadvantaged families, achieved its target of opening a student care centre in all 185 primary schools this year, and increased student enrolment from 3,000 students in 2012 to 27,000 this year.\nNow, MOE is “stepping up efforts to identify, enrol and provide support to students who would most benefit” from these centres, said Ms Indranee.\nFor some families, the challenge is affordability.\nEven with fee subsidies under the ComCare Student Care Fee Assistance scheme, some students on MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme still have to pay more than S$120 a month, said Ms Indranee.\nMaking student care centres affordable for low-income families is “an important step” towards getting their children enrolled into the centres and into “the right environment for them to do well”.\nOther families face more complex challenges such as financial assistance documentation, or requiring students to go home to look after family members.\xa0\n“Recognising this, we have developed a more comprehensive, proactive approach to reach out to families and tackle challenges together with them,” said Ms Indranee.\nSchools will “proactively identify” students who would benefit from the student care centres and engage with their families.\nMOE will also engage the community to address each family’s challenges in a “holistic and targeted way”.\nThe application process for the ComCare Student Care Fee Assistance Scheme will also be made simpler for families.\nTeachers will guide families through the documentation and schools will “exercise judgment and be more facilitative” for families with complex challenges.\nMs Indranee noted that the pilot managed to\xa0enrol 87 out of 100 students identified, and they have seen progress in these students.\nShe cited the example of four siblings from Boon Lay Primary School who received “limited support at home”.\nAfter joining their school’s student care centre, two of them have “improved their time management skills” and “manage their homework more confidently”.\nAdditionally, UPLIFT will support partnerships between schools and the community.\n“I am very encouraged by the number of people who have come up to me to say: ‘I want to be part of UPLIFT, how can I help?’,” said Ms Indranee.\nAt the secondary school level, there are more than 70 schools with after-school programmes, benefitting more than 3,000 students.\n“These programmes focus on befriending and mentoring by trusted adults, peer support, and interest-based activities to engage the students,” said Ms Indranee, adding that MOE is on track to offer this to 120 schools this year.\nThese measures are in addition to increased financial assistance for disadvantaged students that Deputy Prime Minister Heng Sweet Keat announced during his Budget speech on Feb 18.\xa0\nUnder the increased financial assistance, the bursary quantum for pre-university students on MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme will increase from S$900 to S$1,000 per year. Students will also receive more transport and meal subsidies.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2020 ', '     parliament ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     education ']}"

      Professional development roadmap for special educational needs training for mainstream educators to be rolled out
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A professional development roadmap to enhance special educational needs (SEN) training will be introduced for all educators in mainstream schools, announced Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah on Wednesday (Mar 4).\xa0\n“We want every teacher in mainstream schools to become more skilled in supporting students with SEN. The Ministry of Education (MOE)\xa0will work with NIE (National Institute of Education) to strengthen the inclusion of SEN support strategies in pre-service teacher training,” said Ms Indranee, speaking in Parliament during the MOE Committee of Supply debate.\nFor teachers currently in service, MOE will launch bite-sized online learning resources in phases from this year, she added.\xa0\nThe roadmap will also provide more professional development opportunities for educators who “play a more specialised role in SEN support”, including allied educators in learning and behavioural support, teachers trained in special needs, as well as the school’s management team, said Ms Indranee.\xa0\nAccording to MOE, the number of in-service training places for allied educators has\xa0increased from 60 to 600 from July 2019.\nIn a separate release, the Education Ministry said the roadmap will help educators to better support students with SEN who are able to cope with the national curriculum and learn in large group settings.\xa0\nAll educators will be equipped with a basic understanding of SEN, and the skills and strategies to support such students through more coverage of SEN in the pre-service curriculum, said MOE.\n“To ensure our education system provides opportunities for all, MOE is also committed to supporting students with SEN\xa0to reach their fullest potential,” said Ms Indranee.\xa0\nMs Indranee also announced that the SEN fund available in polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education (ITE) will be extended to support students with a wider spectrum of learning needs, beyond those with sensory or physical impairments.\xa0\nFrom April 2020, polytechnic and ITE students with learning and language difficulties such as dyslexia, or social and behavioural difficulties like Autism Spectrum Disorder, can use the SEN Fund to purchase assistive technology devices, with a cap of S$5,000, she said.\xa0\nAdding that feedback on the SEN Fund has been positive, with about S$675,000 disbursed to benefit more than 120 students, she said: “It has helped students to keep up with academic learning and improve day-to-day interaction with peers.\n""In my engagements with students with SEN at the polytechnics and ITE, they told me it would be helpful to extend the SEN Fund beyond physical disabilities. And they’re right ... Advancements in assistive technology devices have made it easier for students with other types of challenges to access education and prepare for independent work and life.""\nAutonomous universities will be extending the same support to their students with SEN for the purchase of assistive technology devices, said Ms Indranee.\xa0\n“MOE will continue to work with schools and IHLs to strengthen support for students with SEN, to ensure that they, like all other students, receive the support they need to maximise their potential,"" she added.\xa0\nSKILLSFUTURE FOR EDUCATORS\nThe SEN professional development roadmap\xa0is aligned with the SkillsFuture for Educators initiative announced by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Wednesday. One of the six areas of practice for educators is support for students with SEN.\xa0\nThe five others are assessment literacy, differentiated instruction, inquiry-based learning, e-pedagogy and character and citizenship education.\xa0\nAccording to Mr Ong, the ministry surveyed teachers to ask them what skills they needed the most, and these six areas came up.\xa0\nHe also noted that others are concerned that with professional development, teachers “will have one more thing to worry about” beyond teaching and administrative duties.\xa0\n“But professional development is not new. Teachers have been doing so for years,” said Mr Ong.\n""Our teachers were very forthcoming with their inputs because they want to learn, be good at what they are doing, and grow in their careers. They do not see professional development and teaching duties as a zero-sum game.""\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Budget 2020 ']}"

      Schools to offer mental health lessons from 2021; more trips to Asian countries
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mental wellness and peer support will be given more focus in schools soon, as the Ministry of Education refreshes the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum for 2021.\n“One key challenge our youths face today is mental well-being,” said Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah in Parliament on Wednesday (Mar 4).\nAs such, mental health will be part of the new CCE curriculum in secondary schools, “to help students to understand common mental health issues and their symptoms, know when and how to seek help for themselves and others, and develop empathy and care towards persons with mental health issues”, said Ms Indranee, during her ministry’s Committee of Supply debate.\nSimilarly, polytechnics and the Institute for Technical Education (ITE) have also worked with the Health Promotion Board to develop mental health resources for students.\nOther than educating students, teachers will also create “a positive school learning environment”.\nTeachers are taught to create a “positive classroom culture” as part of their training, and “positive teacher-students relationships are strongly emphasised”, said Ms Indranee. The ministry will develop teachers’ capabilities through SkillsFuture for Educators.\nBuilding on that, schools will have to teach students how to overcome setbacks.\n“To help students face challenges confidently, we will help students develop the resilience mindset of ‘I am, I have, I can’,” said Ms Indranee.\nThis mindset will teach students to appreciate their strengths, harness positive beliefs about themselves, tap on peer and family support and equip them with skills such as emotional regulation, problem-solving and managing relationships and conflicts.\nAs peer support can contribute to students’ well-being, MOE will also establish peer support structures in every school by 2022.\n“Our vision is for every student to be a peer supporter, forming a strong network of support in their class, CCA (co-curricular activity) or peer group, where they can look out for each other and seek guidance from teachers or counsellors where necessary,” said Ms Indranee.\nDespite these measures, students who still struggle with mental health issues will require more support, she added.\nTeachers in schools and Institute of Higher Learnings’ class advisors will be trained to pick up signs of distress, reach out to these students and refer them to mental health professionals if needed.\nMORAL VALUES AND DISCUSSIONS ON CONTEMPORARY ISSUES\nAs part of the refreshed CCE curriculum, primary schools will emphasise the teaching of moral values, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung during his Committee of Supply speech on Wednesday.\n“As the Chinese saying goes … values before academics,” said Mr Ong.\nThe bulk of CCE lessons for Primary 1 to 3 students will be devoted to character and values, while CCE and mother tongue lessons for all primary school students will be better aligned, as many character and values lessons are taught during mother tongue lessons, he said.\nNational education and citizenship, currently part of the CCE curriculum, will be taught during the Form Teacher Guidance Period instead. This will apply to Primary 4 to 6 students.\nMOE will also increase efforts to engage secondary school students on contemporary issues through CCE lessons, covering topics such as climate change, government policies and race and religion.\n“(Some of these topics)\xa0may be sensitive to discuss, but they are important to help our students better understand the complexities of our country and our\xa0life,” said Mr Ong.\n“Teachers will guide students to listen attentively, converse respectfully and be open to differing perspectives.”\n\xa0As specialised skills may be needed to facilitate discussion of complex or sensitive topics, every secondary school will have specialised CCE teachers by 2022.\nOutside the classroom, CCE will be integrated into activities such as CCAs, camps, cohort learning journeys and Values-in-Action.\xa0\nThree new models of CCA allocation will be piloted at several primary schools in 2020, aimed at eliminating CCA selection trials.\nThe ministry is also looking into expanding a pilot that allows students to participate in CCAs not offered in their schools, while some schools will trial combined teams for CCAs with small enrolment.\nThe new CCE curriculum will be progressively implemented in all primary and secondary schools from 2021, said Mr Ong.\nKNOWING ASIA\nTo allow students to engage Southeast Asia better, the humanities curriculum will place more emphasis on studying Asia, said Mr Ong.\n“It must provide students with a deeper appreciation of the geographies, histories, cultures, languages and economies of our regional countries,” he said.\nMore overseas trips will also be organised to Asian countries.\xa0Singaporean students should experience Asia, as it is “our own backyard” and where Singaporeans “have a natural competitive advantage”, added Mr Ong.\nThese measures will go towards the 70-70 goal announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Sweet Keat in his Budget statement.\nUnder this goal, Institutes of Higher Learning will aim for 70 per cent of their students to have overseas exposure, with a further 70 per cent of these students to have exposure to ASEAN, China or India.\nMOE will also teach conversational ASEAN languages starting with Vietnamese and Thai.\xa0 This will be offered to students from primary to pre-university levels and it\xa0will be a 10-hour language and cultural exposure component.\n“Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. Together with China, India, Japan, Korea, they all form part of our natural hinterland.\n“Singapore-based enterprises need to be able to venture out to the region, and Singaporeans must be able to play a part in it. To do so, we need to be equipped with the relevant knowledge, language and cultural skills,” said Mr Ong.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2020 ', '     parliament ', '     mental health ', '     education ']}"

      Secondary 1 students to own a personal learning device by 2024 under new digital literacy measures
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: By 2024, all Secondary 1\xa0students will own a school-prescribed personal learning device under a new national digital literacy programme, announced Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung on Wednesday (Mar 4).\xa0\nThis could be a tablet, laptop or Chromebook, he said. The Ministry of Education (MOE) “will make sure” that the device is affordable, and does not intend for it to be a high-end device since it is used for learning and education.\xa0\n“We need to teach students to use software and devices productively to learn, for work\xa0and for daily living, across different contexts,” said Mr Ong, adding that MOE will use a bulk tender to lower the price of the devices to ""a few hundred dollars"".\xa0\nBy 2028, all secondary school students will be equipped with a device, he noted.\xa0\nStudents can pay for the device through their Edusave accounts, and Mr Ong said the ministry expects that most students will have enough in their account to pay for the device.\xa0\nIn anticipation of the initiative, MOE\xa0is providing a one-off Edusave top-up of S$200 in 2020 to all Singaporean students in primary schools and secondary schools, costing a total of S$75 million, said Mr Ong.\xa0\nAccording to MOE, this is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of S$290 for secondary students and S$230 for primary students.\xa0\nFor students from lower-income households, MOE will extend further subsidies to ""ensure that they pay zero dollars"",\xa0said Mr Ong.\xa0\n“This is to ensure that no student is denied the opportunity to benefit from the programme,” said the ministry in a press release.\xa0\nStudents will use the device in tandem with the Singapore Student Learning Space and other education technologies to personalise and enhance their learning, MOE said.\xa0\nNoting that “almost the whole” curriculum is on the Student Learning Space, Mr Ong said: “The idea is not to make students learn completely online and then don’t have to go to school. The quality and outcomes of e-learning will never be the same as a physical learning environment with teachers, with friends, CCAs\xa0and a social setting.\xa0\n""Neither are we using SLS to make the classroom high tech and futuristic.\xa0What we want to do is to use SLS to enhance the classroom experience. Let the technology fade into the background. Let the interaction, the discussion and the thinking come to the fore. Flip the classroom, give students more voice, make learning become collaborative. Then students are more likely to internalise the lessons, and achieve better education outcomes. ""\nIn 2019, MOE conducted a pilot study with eight secondary schools on using the devices to enhance teaching and learning.\xa0\n""We learned many things from this pilot project. Number one, teachers cannot teach the traditional way using e-learning. They need new pedagogies – e-pedagogies,"" said\xa0Mr Ong.\xa0\nHe also said that there has to be controlled access so that the device is used for education and learning. According to Mr Ong, the pilot schools effectively addressed this through device usage control.\xa0\n""It can access educationally meaningful sites on the Internet, but online games and Korean dramas are out. It will also monitor students’ use of the device,"" he said.\xa0\n""Some students are naturally disappointed with the limited functionality of their devices, but it is the necessary thing to do. This is consistent with a common school practice where no mobile phone usage is allowed during school hours.""\nCOMPUTING AND CYBER WELLNESS\nThe Education Minister also announced several other changes in the classroom as part of the national digital literacy programme.\xa0\nAs part of changes to the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum, there will be a greater emphasis on cyber wellness education in schools, said Mr Ong.\xa0\n“We will devote more time, and develop more materials to teach this subject, so that students will learn to critically evaluate what they read online, be able to tell genuine news from falsehoods, and not rely on social media ‘likes’ for validation,"" he said, noting that 11 secondary\xa0schools are piloting the new curriculum.\n""They need to be able to say no to bad influences, protect themselves from cyberbullies and predators.""\nAbout 50 per cent more time will be spent discussing cyber wellness issues during CCE lessons for primary and secondary levels, said MOE.\xa0\nMOE also announced in July last year that the Code for Fun programme will be expanded to all primary schools from this year. It will be offered as a 10-hour enrichment programme at the upper primary level.\xa0\nMore schools will also offer Computing as an O-Level and A-Level subject, announced Mr Ong. Thirty secondary schools will offer O-Level Computing, up from 22, and 10 junior colleges will offer A-Level Computing, up from eight.\xa0\nHowever, he ruled out making coding compulsory in schools.\xa0\nDescribing the idea as “too simplistic”, the Education Minister added: ""Not everyone will grow up to be a coder. Many of us, we just need to learn to use technology and software and be comfortable with using them. Further, the programming languages will become outdated by the time the students graduate.""\nA revised lower secondary science syllabus will be rolled out in 2021, MOE also announced in a press release. It will help students develop a better understanding of artificial intelligence and other technological advancements.\xa0\nInstitutes of Higher Learning are setting baseline digital competency requirements for all their students, said Mr Ong. They are also upgrading their curriculum for sectors that require more advanced digital skills such as cybersecurity, finance, manufacturing\xa0and logistics, he added. \xa0\nAccording to MOE, all polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students will be taught AI-related topics. Those in sectors poised for AI adoption, such as the finance, manufacturing, logistics and cybersecurity sectors, will be equipped with higher proficiency in AI competencies.\nMr Ong noted that the autonomous universities have trained about 1,000 information and communications technology (ICT) graduates per year in the last three years. Now, they take in 2,800 ICT students per year.\xa0\n""But the (universities) know the industry is hungry for more talent, and have been working very hard to expand the capacity ... We will find ways to ramp up the capacity further if need be.""\nIn introducing these digital literacy measures, Mr Ong stressed that technology presents children with “influences, choices and decisions previous generations never had to contend with”.\xa0\n“In an online world, you can be anonymous, and there are no policemen, no editors. No verifiers. A child can choose to be nasty and then get away with it,"" said Mr Ong.\xa0\nAnd with devices, children can use them for good or bad purposes, he added.\xa0\n“How do we ensure that our young make the right choices, and survive well in the online world? I think digital world problems require analogue world solutions. It goes back to our values, morals, and humanity.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Budget 2020 ', '     schools ']}"

Both of these top-ups will be available for use from Oct 1 this year and will remain valid for only five years, until Dec 31, 2025.\xa0\n“I think some of the biggest achievements (in the) last five, six years, is that we have synergy - more and more synergy with the education system and SkillsFuture,” said Mr Ong.\xa0\nHe noted that when SkillsFuture was launched in 2015, automation and\xa0the use of artificial intelligence were rising trends. These trends are still growing today.\xa0\n“What is left for humans (are) our skills, soft skills as well as hard skills. The deeper our skills are in our various domain areas, the harder it is for technology to replace what we do.\xa0\n“This continues to be a very important way for us to stay ahead of the game, raise our competitiveness and for individual Singaporeans to stay relevant and to be inclusive in our economic strategy,” said Mr Ong.\xa0\nMr Ong said the next step for the SkillsFuture programme is to achieve synergy with companies’ efforts.\xa0\nIn his Budget speech, Mr Heng had said that the Government aims to train sectors and value chain partners of up to 40 large anchor enterprises.\xa0\n“Anchor enterprises are supported by many SMEs (small and medium enterprises). By helping raise the skills of workers in these SMEs, the entire supply chain benefits,” he had said.\xa0\nAdding to this, Mr Ong said:\xa0“Essentially (these are) companies that are leaders in their field, that can train not just for themselves, raise the skills level not just for their own employees, but also for the entire industry, for the whole value chain.\xa0\n""I think they can play a very important role in the next phase of the SkillsFuture journey.”\xa0\nMr Ong was observing SkillsFuture classes that were being carried out at the NTUC Learning Hub, together with Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat.\xa0\nMr Chee also spoke to reporters, saying that this phase of Singapore\'s economic development\xa0“requires our enterprises to transform to improve their competitiveness and productivity”.\n“We know enterprise transformation must go hand in hand with skills upgrading so we bring our workers along so that our workers can benefit from the transformation efforts,” said Mr Chee.\xa0\n“My belief is that the better we can do\xa0skills upgrading, the more assurance we can give to our workers\xa0and the quicker we can transform our economy and our enterprises.”\nMs Tan Hong Pin, who is the general manager of security company Omni Integer, has used her SkillsFuture credits to take up a course on networking fundamentals.\xa0\nMs Tan said her colleagues have enrolled in SkillsFuture courses to expand their knowledge of technology systems in order to better\xa0support their customers and offices.\xa0\nThe company\'s productivity has increased by about 30 per cent since its workers began taking up classes, said Ms Tan.\xa0\n“Before SkillsFuture, we used our own money\xa0or the company sponsored the courses. It could cost thousands of dollars, courses like these are not cheap to begin with,” said the 48-year-old, who has worked in the security industry for the last 20 years.\xa0\n“But with SkillsFuture, we have a lot of additional (credits) to play with, so with the additional S$500, because I qualify (for the additional credits), I can take about three to four courses this year alone.”\xa0\nWhen asked about those who spent their SkillsFuture credit on leisure-based activities, Mr Ong urged people not to be ""too judgmental"".\xa0\n“What is leisure to me may be a profession or a home-based business for somebody else. What to me may be a language to understand a drama series\xa0may be a work requirement for somebody else. So I won’t want to prejudge,” he said.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     SkillsFuture ', '     education ', '     Ong Ye Kung ']}"

      Commentary: Over-parenting teaches children to be entitled. Let them fail instead
  </h1>, 'text': 'WINCHESTER, England: During the last couple of decades, new types of parents have emerged. From the anxiously involved helicopter parents to the pushy tiger mums, these differing styles all have one thing in common: they tend to involve over-parenting.\nThis is where parents micromanage their children’s lives – giving them little autonomy, putting too much pressure on them to achieve academic and personal success, while allowing few chances for their children to experience failure and frustration.\nThese are the parents who run back to school when their children forget their sports kit, do their homework, and ask others in the parent WhatsApp chat for the homework when their child does not bring it home.\nThese parents believe their children are always right. They will confront teachers if the child feels they have been unfairly treated, or will confront other parents if, say, their child is not invited to a party.\nAs their children grow, these parents decide which school subjects their children should choose, and do not allow their adolescents to travel on their own because they are afraid they may be kidnapped. These parents may well accompany their children to university applicant interviews, or even to job interviews.\nAnd they are parents who consider themselves their child’s best friend rather than their parent.\nWhile there is no doubt that these parental behaviours are acts of love, the problem is that by making sure that the children never fail an assignment, experience a detention, or the disappointment of not being invited to a party, these parents are not letting them fail.\nAs a result, they are effectively hindering their child’s development.\nTHE POWER OF FAILURE\nBy learning to overcome failure, children develop resilience. They learn to deal with frustration and to regulate their emotions properly. And it is crucial children develop these skills during childhood to be able to lead successful lives.\nMost of the research on over-parenting has focused on how it has affected university students. But the link between over-involved parents and negative consequences is found when examining children of all ages.\nIndeed, pre-school and primary school children of over-involved parents tend to experience high levels of shyness, anxiety and poor peer relations.\nWhen examining adolescents and university students, these negative consequences continue.\nFor example, 16 to 28 year-old students who reported having helicopter parents were more likely to have low levels of self-efficacy – the trust that people have in their own abilities and skills – and poor relationships with their peers.\nIn similar research, young people who reported having over-involved parents experienced higher levels of depression and stress, less satisfaction with life, as well as less ability to regulate their emotions. They also reported a higher sense of entitlement, and increased drug use than young people with less involved parents.\nBAD FOR PARENTS TOO\nOver-parenting doesn’t only have negative consequences for the children, though. Parents who over-parent are more likely to experience high levels of anxiety, stress and regret. This in turn has negative consequences for their children, who may pick up on their parents’ anxiety and make it their own.\nThis may be one of the reasons why the number of university students struggling with anxiety and depression is at an all-time high. Indeed, a recent poll concluded that one in five university students in the UK suffers from high anxiety levels.\nSo, should all parents back off and not get involved in their children’s lives? Not quite.\nBecause to make matters more complicated, research clearly shows that children who have involved parents tend to do better at school, have higher levels of self-esteem, and better peer relations than children whose parents are not as involved.\nChildren whose parents are warm, loving and have high expectations of them tend to do better than children of cold and undemanding parents. The difficulty lies in establishing what the right amount of love and demandingness is.\nSo, the key aspect that researchers are now trying to establish is what the optimal level of parental involvement is.\nThere is no doubt that parents want to protect their children and avoid them getting hurt but they also need to consider when that level of protection becomes too much.\nSo, next time your child rings from school asking you to bring in their sports kit, think twice before doing it.\nLife inevitably brings problems and disappointment. It is better to teach children how to face these issues rather than to solve all their problems for them.\nBy doing so, parents will help children to develop resilience and the ability to deal with frustration – tools that will allow them to thrive once they leave the parental home.\nAna Aznar is a psychology lecturer at the University of Winchester.

      Commentary: Why do parents still pay top dollar for pre-schools when there are more affordable options?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When my parents began planning for my education, they were largely saving up to put me through university.\xa0\nFast-forward some three decades: I am now paying a comparable amount for my daughter’s pre-school even before she can speak in full sentences.\nIn recent decades, pre-schools went from being an exception to a necessity for many.\nWhile childcare duties traditionally fell squarely on mothers or grandparents, today women play an increasingly larger role in the workforce, and nuclear families are also more common. As such, pre-schools have become a crucial part of family planning and budgeting.\nSo when Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18) that the government will double spending on the early childhood sector to more than S$2 billion a year over the next few years, I was delighted.\nWith higher pre-school subsidies for all eligible income groups rolled out since January, DPM Heng also said that the Government would increase the share of places in government-supported pre-schools from 50 per cent at present to 80 per cent by 2025.\nThis led me to wonder if the vast playing field in the pre-school sector was narrowing.\nHIGH QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ALL\nSceptics ask why the Government needs to set aside billions each year to enhance pre-schools. Some have argued many of us spent the very same “formative years” of our lives tossing plastic pick-up sticks and catching tadpoles, and mostly turned out fine.\nBut there is a huge research consensus establishing the criticality of quality early childhood education in developing high-performing adults. Studies suggest that 85 per cent of the brain develops before the age of five and that begins to form a complex network of connections during this period.\nEarly childhood education is believed to translate into better academic performance, healthier emotional and social development later in life, and higher future earnings.\nWith that said, it is natural for parents to be selective about school choices. Cost seems to be one of the key differentiators of the pre-school landscape in Singapore, with monthly fees ranging from a few dollars to thousands of dollars.\nSince January, some Singaporean households in selected income brackets need to pay as little as S$3 a month for their kids’ fees in government-supported pre-schools.\nHowever, a mid-range option like Cherie Hearts costs $1,180 for a full-day childcare programme, according to its website. After the S$300 working mother’s subsidy from the government, that rings up to S$42,240 over four years – enough to put a Singaporean through three years of an undergraduate law degree at the National University of Singapore.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, EtonHouse at Vanda Road costs S$6,370.25, for a 10-week Pre-Nursery 1 term without subsidy, according to EtonHouse’s website. With four terms over the year, that amounts to S$25,481 for a single year.\nIS PRICIER ALWAYS BETTER?\nBut the question begs: With the availability and enhancement of government-sponsored pre-schools, why are parents still paying for higher-priced options?\nOne reason is that pre-schools are highly differentiated, and sometimes, selecting the right fit can be more mind-boggling than picking the right formula milk.\nI remember sifting through at least eight disparate brochures and attending more than five open houses, trying to cut through the marketing spiel and identifying important and tangible differences.\nSome branding aspects like Montessori or Montessori-inspired are not easily quantifiable. The Montessori approach in early childhood education, designed in 1907 by Italian educator Dr Maria Montessori, is designed to empower children to drive their own learning process through collaborative play and hands-on activities.\nSince the “Montessori” brand is not a trademarked name, not every school that uses it is accredited. “Montessori-inspired” schools or curriculum therefore can be loosely adopted. It may not guarantee a wide use of Montessori materials, or that many teachers within the school have completed accredited Montessori training programmes.\nAnother differentiating factor for high-end options is lavish facilities. White Lodge International Preschool for instance has a trampoline and sand pit, and Little Tykes has a maritime-inspired sensory room with fibre-optic blankets and a colour-switching infinity portal. Many of these pre-schools are also replete with other stimulating educational props and toys.\nHowever, it remains debatable if all these are necessary for optimal childhood development, or if they are worth the considerable price difference. Some studies suggest that children with fewer toys are more creative and have longer attention spans.\nPerhaps the prohibitive pricing and luxury branding are also among the factors that add to their appeal for some, transforming high-end pre-schools into a reflection of socio-economic status?\nCLOSING THE GAP WHERE IT MATTERS\nThat said, some factors like the teacher-to-child-ratio do seem to make a difference in ensuring that budding young minds get the attention and stimulation they need. And these naturally cost more from a human resource perspective.\nImmersive second language environments, and extra-curriculum classes such as art, music, dance, speech and even financial literacy contribute to a well-rounded programme as well. So do pre-school compounds with ample space for children to engage in physical activities. These are often reflected in pricing.\nIncreased government funding for more operators makes affordable pre-schools more available. Grants also enable more schools to invest in staff training to nurture effective and dedicated teachers, and enhance facilities to close the gap with premium private brands.\nSome government-sponsored preschools today offer art, dance, music and acting programmes, either as part of the curriculum or as opt-in programmes. My First Skool 2 Punggol Drive, an NTUC\xa0First Campus Pre-school, even includes five play zones, such as an outdoor playground with a bamboo igloo, a water play area, and a forest play zone with a tree house.\nAs the differentiating factors between branded pre-schools and government-supported options narrows, more parents may begin to opt for affordable options. This reduces the burden on young parents at a time when they are still building their financial foundation.\nIn a nation widely lauded for its education system and equal opportunities, this also paves the way for pre-schools to evolve in the same direction as primary and secondary schools – where high-quality programmes are available and accessible to all income brackets.\nAfter all, for a country without natural resources, realising the potential of each child is an investment in the future. It is heartening to think that somewhere in a classroom today, a child’s brain synapses are firing away, laying the infrastructure for a future of limitless possibilities.\nAnd more importantly, this need not necessarily come at a staggering four-figure price point.\nAnnie Tan is a freelance writer.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2020 ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: What the uncertainty after receiving A-Level results can teach you about adulting
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Uncertainty is the bedrock of adulthood, although most of us don’t realise we lack the skills to navigate it, until we have to confront a major fork in the road.\xa0\nIf you’re receiving your GCE A-Level results today, you might experience conflicting feelings about which university to go to, which course to take, or perhaps, whether you should even go to university right now.\nThe answers to these questions will feel monumental, as though this seemingly pivotal decision will determine the rest of your life. In some ways, it will.\xa0\nFor example, picking the right course that combines your interests and abilities will mean there’s a higher chance of doing well, and hence, embarking on a career you can flourish in. It also ensures that you have a fulfilling time in university, which enriches your mental and emotional well-being, allowing you to realise your fullest potential.\xa0\nAlternatively, gaining relevant work experience before deciding on a course could prove crucial for the industry you wish to enter. Then you need to ask yourself how long you’d like to defer your university plans.\xa0\nWhile figuring out how to deal with these choices is extensively covered by career and course counselling guides, you can take some comfort in the fact that the hyper-vigilant focus on these immediate, tangible decisions ironically reflect the safe environment of our education system.\nFor most of our school lives, many of us cruise along without making particularly risky or divergent education choices. One of the biggest decisions is, in fact, picking the science or arts track in junior college.\xa0\nThese secure parameters are precisely why making a decision after receiving your A-Level results can feel exceptionally scary, like falling through a broken stair without warning.\xa0\nHowever, the real mistake many of us will make lies not in our education choice but in believing the uncertainty ends once we make a choice.\nYOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT BY HOW YOU RESPOND\nFor everyone receiving your results today, this won’t be the last time that adulting slaps you with a cold reality check, so it’s best to familiarise yourself with the discomfort of uncertainty.\xa0\nBut it can be the last time that you feel overwhelmed by the weight of having to make such a critical decision, if you learn how to handle such choices.\xa0\nFor starters, we need to reframe our perspective of success and failure, because our present definition results in tunnel vision. We believe that choosing a “wrong” course or taking a gap year, instead of pursuing a university education, means we are not as successful as our peers who go on to read prestigious degrees.\xa0\nLikewise, if you’ve received less than favourable results today, it’s tempting to wallow in self-pity or spiral into shame.\nBut please remember that neither good results nor bad results have the power to define us. How we respond to each situation we’re placed in has far greater bearing on who we become and the life we lead.\xa0\nA strict conformity to rigid definitions of what success looks like might shape our choices in perverse ways, when what we believe we should want or aim for guides decision-making.\xa0\nIn this case, getting straight As doesn’t give you a headstart if you choose a course simply because it’s the trendy decision, only to regret it later on, while getting Cs and Ds isn’t the end of the world if it encourages you to bolster your resume with work experience before university to make up for your grades.\xa0\nYOUR CHOICES MATTER - NOT JUST IN THE WAY YOU THINK\xa0\nBut first, a reality check. While we create unnecessary anxiety for ourselves when we place excessive importance on a single decision in our lives, as though believing one wrong move at this juncture would negate every other action, you shouldn’t be cavelier with your choice.\xa0\nDeciding what to do or where to go after receiving the A-Level results can mark a turning point in your life. For instance, doing a general degree might close off specialist fields, such as medicine or engineering.\xa0\nYour degree might not matter for the rest of your life, but it helps you start off the journey on the best possible foot.\xa0\nA good start will also reduce uncertainty in the future, significantly alleviating the pressure of building a “successful” professional life. This is especially important if you seek a stable career trajectory that affords you time and money to start a family or pursue other non-professional dreams.\nUnderstandably, at 18 or 19, not everyone knows what they want to do for the rest of their lives. So if you make a poor choice now, take comfort in the fact that life is a series of choices. One single decision doesn’t – and won’t – define you, if you make subsequently more enlightened choices.\nTake this common example. If you eventually realise that you’d have preferred studying sociology over business, the latter doesn’t automatically become the wrong choice. You can either make a switch to your desired course, or find something that interests you in your current course and pick up skills that would be relevant to any career.\xa0\nWhile not everyone has the privilege to embark on an entirely new university degree, everyone has the capacity to find the silver lining in an unfavourable situation.\xa0Either way, you gain self-awareness – a sorely underrated skill in handling adulthood.\xa0\nAnd there’s nothing stopping you from reading, exploring and learning outside the boundaries of your formal educational curriculum. That sense of curiosity is a trait found in the best corporate leaders, according to Harvard Business Review, so start exercising that muscle.\nFORGET PASSION - FIGURE OUT YOUR PURPOSE\nThere are multiple pathways to your eventual goal. The trouble is we often assume the goal is a job or career. But this is as myopic as assuming the decision we make after getting our A-Level results will dictate the rest of our lives.\nIn reality, the goal should be in realising our purpose in our life, not a job.\xa0\nI took a gap year before university, working at the corporate communications department of my polytechnic in trying to figure out what university course to take to further my interest in telling meaningful stories.\nThat experience allowed me to talk extensively with students and staff to feature them in internal publications and get media coverage for their stories.\nThe year revealed to me something new: The novel and multifaceted means to tell stories and how learning can come from doing, rather than the confines of a degree.\nIn the end, I chose an arts degree at the National University of Singapore, so I could finish my degree in 2.5 years (after exemptions from my diploma) and start working as soon as possible.\xa0\nI have learnt to hustle for the professional future I wanted even before university, because I was guided by my overarching purpose, not a job.\nUltimately, I’m less fazed by uncertainty now not because I believe I’ve ""made it""\xa0professionally, but because the skills I’ve learnt from owning my education choices and their consequences have prepared me to deal with the grey areas in every other aspect of life.\nAnd that is what adulting is about – figuring out how to make decisions when the road ahead seems unclear.\nGrace Yeoh is a journalist.

      Budget 2020: Enhanced bursaries for low- and middle-income students as part of education measures
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The annual bursary amount for pre-university students from lower-income families will be increased from S$900 to S$1,000, part of enhancements to the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Financial Assistance Scheme.\nAnnouncing the enhancements during his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said transport subsidies for all students and school meals subsidies for secondary school students will also be increased.\xa0\nWith these enhancements, MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme will cost an additional S$9 million per year, increasing the yearly total to S$52 million.\xa0\nNoting that primary school is free for all Singaporeans and secondary school fees are S$5 a month, Mr Heng said that education in the primary to pre-university school years is “already heavily subsidised”.\xa0\n“Students pay a few dollars of miscellaneous fees,” he added.\xa0\nENHANCED BURSARIES FOR DIPLOMA AND DEGREE HOLDERS\nBursaries for full-time Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students will also be enhanced from the 2020 academic year, Mr Heng announced. Students from households who qualify under the lowest income tier for the bursaries will now receive 100 per cent fee subsidies\xa0on top of the cash bursary, he said.\xa0\nThe cash bursary for students from low- and middle-income households will also increase by up to S$200 a year, he added.\xa0\nThis is on top of the enhanced bursaries for diploma and degree holders announced by Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung in August 2019.\xa0\nMore than 33,000 diploma students and 21,000 undergraduates will benefit from the Government’s enhanced bursary scheme announced last year, including students enrolled in ITE, the National Institute of Early Childhood Development, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LASALLE College of the Arts.\nAbout 30,000 of these students come from families with incomes at the 30th percentile and below. The bursaries would be “heavily weighed towards benefiting” families from the 30th percentile and below, Mr Ong had said in August.\xa0\nThis means that families from the lowest income bracket could pay fees as low as S$150 a year for polytechnics, down from the current S$550. University undergraduates in this bracket would only need to pay S$2,000 a year, compared to the current S$4,200.\nThe enhanced bursaries will be rolled out from the 2020 academic year. Mr\xa0Heng said the cost of bursaries for higher education will increase to S$198 million per year, up from S$148 million per year.\nDOUBLING PRE-SCHOOL SPENDING\nMr Heng also noted that pre-school subsidies were significantly enhanced and made available to more families from this year.\xa0\nIn August 2019, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) announced higher pre-school subsidies and a raised income ceiling of S$12,000, extending the subsidies to more than 60 per cent of households in Singapore.\xa0\nThese measures took effect in January. Families with a gross monthly income of S$3,000 now pay S$3 a month per child at anchor operator pre-schools, as the maximum additional subsidy was increased from S$400 to S$467. This is on top of the S$300 basic subsidy.\xa0\n“Good education provides a strong foundation for children to grow, realise their aspirations, and continue a journey of lifelong learning,” said Mr Heng.\xa0\n“We have committed to decisive shifts in the Government’s support for early childhood development. We are determined to give every child, regardless of circumstances, a good start in life.”\xa0\nHe also said that the share of Government-supported pre-school places will also be increased to 80 per cent by around 2025, up from just 50 per cent today.\xa0\nAdding that the Government is “doubling” its support for children in their pre-school years, Mr Heng said government spending on the early childhood sector will double to over S$2 billion per year within the next few years.\xa0\n“A good education lays a strong foundation for a better future. This is why this Government has been providing significant education subsidies for each child,” he said.\xa0\nA Singaporean child will receive more than\xa0S$180,000 of education subsidies by the time they turn 16, added Mr\xa0Heng, including S$50,000 in government subsidies over five years when they enrol in a full-day childcare programme with an anchor operator.\xa0\n“This substantial investment is how we maximise every child’s potential, regardless of family circumstances,” he said.\xa0\n“This is a promise that I, as\xa0former education minister and now finance minister, am committed to keep.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2020 ', '     education ', '     polytechnics ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: To help students in acquire cross-cultural skills and understand the region, the Government has set a new target for 70 per cent of local graduates from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to have overseas exposure, and 70 per cent of the exposure to be in Southeast Asia, China or India.\xa0\nSetting the “70-70” target during his 2020 Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said that the Government will introduce a new Asia-Ready Exposure programme to achieve this, supporting visits by local young people to cities in Southeast Asia, China or India.\xa0\nIt will also enhance support for internships under the Global Ready Talent Programme, said Mr Heng.\xa0\nThe Global Ready Talent Programme was launched in October 2019, combining current and local overseas internship programmes, with more funding support for students interning overseas with Singapore firms.\xa0\nSingapore enterprises offering student internships or management associate programmes are currently eligible for up to 70 per cent of funding support for allowances or salaries of participants.\xa0\nLaunching the programme in October 2019, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing had said that over the next five years, the Government aimed to offer 5,000 overseas placements to IHL students and young graduates.\xa0\nThe programme also supports high-growth Singapore firms, to send Singaporeans with up to three years of working experience for postings in key markets, including Southeast Asia, China and India.\xa0\nNoting that about half of all local IHL students gain experience abroad through internships, exchanges, service learning or study trips, Mr Heng said local students are “well-prepared to thrive” in other countries and cultures, including in Asia.\xa0\n“In my pre-Budget dialogue with youth leaders, I was struck by their understanding of the importance of learning new skills and exploring new opportunities. They look forward to overseas exposure and postings in the region,” he added.\xa0\nMr Heng also noted that IHLs and industry have distinct roles, and students can secure good jobs if these roles are aligned to “keep learning relevant”.\xa0\n“Employment rates are high, and starting salaries have increased. We develop Singaporean talent in partnership with enterprises under the Singapore-Industry Scholarship scheme,” he said.\xa0\n“Many of them have graduated and are developing their careers with leading enterprises like ST Engineering and Micron.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Budget 2020 ', '     education ']}"

      The Big Read: As subject-based banding takes root, labels on students are fast shedding
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE:\xa0When Jocelyn Chia scored an aggregate of 181 for her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), she left the school hall, result slip in hand, feeling disappointed.\xa0\nThe annual national examination taken by students at the end of their primary school education determines the stream and secondary school they move on to.\n“I was aiming for the Express stream and I had expected to do better,” said the 16-year-old of her PSLE results four years ago.\xa0\xa0\nHowever, within a year after starting her secondary school education, Jocelyn found herself taking up two subjects — mother tongue and mathematics — at the Express level.\xa0\nThe opportunity to do these subjects at a higher level despite being streamed into the Normal (Academic) course has allowed her to feel better about herself.\xa0\n“I don’t feel so bad being in N(A) anymore because I am still taking Express subjects,” said Jocelyn, who is currently a Secondary 4 N(A) stream student at Clementi Town Secondary School.\nSince 2014, the opportunity for Normal stream students like Jocelyn to take certain subjects at higher levels has become a reality -\xa0starting as a pilot in a dozen secondary schools, before being rolled out to all secondary schools across the island two years ago.\xa0\nAs of this year, the subjects offered will be extended to the humanities at 25 pilot schools. This means that Sec 2 N(A) students in these schools who have performed well in literature, history or geography in Sec 1 may take these subjects at an Express level.\nFor many previous cohorts, their memory of secondary school would have been one of being streamed into either Express, N(A) or Normal (Technical), and then remaining in their respective streams throughout their secondary school years.\nWhile the initial intent of streaming was to reduce dropout rates by ensuring that students could keep up with their lessons, it has also resulted in stereotypes attached to students depending on the streams they are in.\nExpress students, for instance, are viewed as being more studious, while those in N(A) or N(T) are assumed to be less academically capable or not as well-disciplined.\nHowever, amid a long-running national debate on the merits or otherwise of the streaming system, the education scene has seen a shift over the past decade, with various changes introduced to give students more flexibility in what they wish to learn.\xa0\nThese include the introduction of subject-based banding, which lets students such as Jocelyn to take a subject at a more demanding level even though they may be from a “lower” stream.\nFor these students, the initiatives have not only boosted their confidence and helped them shed the negative labels associated with their streams, they have also opened up more educational pathways.\xa0\nFROM STREAMING TO SUBJECT-BASED BANDING\nIn 2014, subject-based banding was introduced in 12 secondary schools here to allow N(A) and N(T) students in lower secondary to take English, mother tongue, mathematics and science at a more rigorous standard.\nFollowing the healthy take-up rate of subjects at more demanding levels in these schools — about half of N(A) students took up Express stream subjects — subject-based banding was introduced to all secondary schools in Singapore in 2018.\xa0\xa0\nWith the option extended to humanities, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said that about two-thirds of this year’s eligible Sec 2 N(A) students took up the offer to study humanities at the Express level. This represents about 10 per cent of this year’s cohort of Sec 2 N(A) students in the pilot schools.\nThe figure excludes 4 per cent of the N(A) cohort in these schools who laterally transferred to the Express course.\nThe latest changes are part of the transition towards full subject-based banding, which will be implemented across secondary schools by 2024, when the decades-old streaming system will be scrapped.\xa0\nIn full subject-based banding, subjects will be taught at three levels — General 1 (G1), G2 and G3. The three levels will roughly correspond to today’s N(T), N(A) and Express streams respectively.\xa0\nStudents can take a range of G1, G2 and G3 subjects based on their abilities.\nThey will then sit for a common examination in Sec 4 and graduate with a common secondary school certificate that is co-branded by Singapore and Cambridge. This will kick in for Sec 4 students from 2027.\nThe other aspect of full subject-based banding is mixed-stream form classes, where students are drawn from a mix of Express, N(A) and N(T) streams.\nThis is a departure from the current format of having students of the same streams in the same form class.\nCurrently, 4,000 Sec 1 students are part of mixed-stream form classes that are being piloted in 15 secondary schools.\nAnother 13 schools will introduce mixed-stream form classes by 2021, with the rest of the secondary schools here following suit in 2024.\nThe move towards full subject-based banding is part of the Government’s efforts to overcome some\xa0 drawbacks of school streaming, such as pinning negative labels on students.\xa0\nEducation Minister Ong Ye Kung made this point during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate in March last year, when he acknowledged that entering a stream such as N(A) or N(T) can “carry a certain stigma that becomes fulfilling or self-limiting”.\n“Students can develop a mindset where they tell themselves, 'I am only a Normal stream student, so this is as good as I can be',” he said.\nMr Ong noted that while some students are strong in every subject, most have uneven strengths. Subject-based banding will allow students to take subjects based on their capabilities and encourage them to find their strengths. This will, in turn, minimise the downsides of labelling, he said.\nHOLDING THEIR OWN AGAINST EXPRESS STREAM PEERS\nSecondary students taking subjects at a higher level we spoke to said that subject-based banding has given them the belief that they can hold their own against their peers from more academically demanding streams.\nOne of them is Pei Hwa Secondary School student Maldaa Abdul Aziz. Despite topping her N(A) class for history in Sec 1, she was initially hesitant to take up the subject at an Express level in Sec 2 when offered to do so by her school.\xa0\n“I’m the only one (from N(A) stream) to take history at an Express level, in a class of 40, so there is a lot of pressure. I was also concerned that I could not keep up,” said the 14-year-old.\nHer concerns, said Maldaa, were compounded by comments from her family members who said that Express stream students “have higher IQ then the rest” and that they will “look down” on those from other streams.\nBut after three weeks of taking history lessons at the Express level, Maldaa said with a sense of pride that she is “better” than her classmates at the subject, and this has given her the confidence to take on more subjects at a higher level.\xa0\nMaldaa’s uplifting experience is not uncommon. Exam results from the first two batches of students who took part in subject-based banding showed that they can hold their own against their Express stream peers.\xa0\nIn 2018, 25 per cent of Sec 4 N(A) students who took O-level English scored A1 or A2, compared to 24 per cent for Express students.\xa0\nFor O-level maths, 26 per cent of N(A) students got A1 or A2, compared to 50 per cent for Express students.\nFor O-level combined science, it was 33 per cent for N(A), compared to 34 per cent for Express students.\nREMOVING THE SHACKLES OF STREAMING\nThe students’ strong showing in the national examinations aside, subject-based banding has also helped to debunk stereotypes associated with individual streams.\nAldrick Au Khin Hon, a Sec 3 student from Evergreen Secondary School, said that while his parents were not disappointed that he got into the N(T) stream after PSLE, some of his friends’ parents felt let down by their children.\nHowever, having the opportunity to take subjects at a higher level in secondary school helped these friends to prove to their parents that they were academically capable too.\n“That’s why I think subject-based banding is a quite a good thing,” said Aldrick, 15, who takes English and science at a N(A) level. “People won’t judge you for being a N(T) student. They won’t keep looking down on you.”\n“They will be surprised that I can take Normal (Academic) subjects, rather than say I’m from N(T) and a troublemaker,” he added, alluding to the perception among some quarters that N(T) students are unmotivated and ill-disciplined.\nMs Claudia Toh, who is teaching mathematics to a class of Sec 1 N(A) and N(T) students this year, said that she consciously avoids checking out the streams of her students.\n“I haven’t actually seen the names of the students that are from N(T). I feel like if I do that, I would go in with the prejudice that maybe this person needs more help,” said the teacher from Greendale Secondary School.\nWhen asked if it may be better for her to know so she that would be more aware of her students’ capabilities, Ms Toh pointed out that doing so would mean that she is already assuming that a child will perform poorly, even though he or she had already met the minimum requirement to be in the class.\xa0\nSPILLOVER EFFECT ACROSS OTHER SUBJECTS\nIn his speech during the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Committee of Supply debate last year, Mr Ong said about half of the N(A) students from 12 secondary schools, where subject-based banding has been adopted since 2014, had taken up subjects at an Express level.\xa0\nA quarter of N(A) students in these schools took up one Express level subject either in English, mathematics or science, while 11 per cent took two subjects, and over 10 per cent took three subjects or were transferred to the Express stream.\nThe numbers were similar for N(T) students taking up N(A) subjects, Mr Ong added.\xa0\nIn response to\xa0queries, MOE said that since subject-based banding was introduced in 2018, about 60 per cent of Sec 1 N(T) students and 40 per cent of Sec 1 N(A) students took up subjects at a higher level.\nOf these, about 6 per cent proceeded to take up more subjects at a demanding level in Sec 2. This does not include those who are laterally transferred to a more academically demanding course.\xa0\nMOE added that schools look at each student’s abilities carefully before offering them the opportunity to take up higher level subjects. They are also mindful that students need time to adjust to the demands of these subjects, the ministry added.\nAs a result, only a small number of students stopped taking up one or more subjects at a more demanding level when they progress to Sec 2, said MOE.\nAmong the secondary school students interviewed, some said they were motivated to study harder and take on more subjects at a higher level after being offered at least one.\xa0\nMaple Koh Xin Yi, a Sec 4 student from the N(A) stream at Christchurch Secondary School, said that having the opportunity to do English at an Express level gave her the confidence to do better in other subjects as well.\nMaple said that she pushed herself in Sec 1 so that she could take up at least one subject at a higher level to increase her chances of entering the Polytechnic Foundation Programme, a one-year programme to prepare N(A) students for entry into polytechnic diploma courses.\nShe was eventually given the opportunity to take up English at an Express level in Sec 2. This made her work harder to take up her favourite subject, maths, at a higher level as well, said Maple.\nAlthough she ultimately did not qualify to take maths at an Express level, she had seen an improvement in her scores for the subject, which went from “barely passing” in Sec 1 to about 70 out of 100 for her final-year examinations in Sec 3.\nMr Bernard Kang, 43, the year head for the Sec 1 cohort at Pei Hwa Secondary School, said that since the school piloted subject-based banding in 2014, it has seen an increase in the number of students eligible for transfer from N(T) to N(A), or from N(A) to Express.\n“Before 2013, we did not have any (transfers), but in 2014 we had a small handful and it has been consistent since then.”\nHe added that students who were not taking any subjects at a more demanding level were driven to work harder, since they knew that they had the opportunity to do so if they performed well.\xa0\nRiverside Secondary School said it has “a healthy number” of students who qualify to do the more demanding subjects annually.\xa0\nThe school’s principal, Madam Shanti Devi Thambusamy, 55, added that students who took an additional subject under the subject-based banding in their subsequent years would have performed well across their subjects, and demonstrated proficiency in managing their academic workload.\n“Conversely, a student who drops a subject (under the subject-based banding) might have found the added academic load challenging and opts to pursue a more manageable one,” she said, adding that the number of such pupils was “quite negligible”.\nMORE POST-SECONDARY OPTIONS\xa0\nStudents interviewed also said they were encouraged to take up subjects at a higher level as this would open up more opportunities for them in post-secondary education.\xa0\nMaple from Christchurch Secondary School, for instance, reiterated that her decision to accept the offer to do English at an Express level was prompted by her desire to qualify for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme.\nQualifying for the programme will allow her to skip Sec 5, the year where N(A) students typically sit for their O-Level examinations.\xa0\nStudents taking Express course subjects may also sit for the O-Level examination for those particular subjects at Sec 4, the same year they sit for their N-Level examinations. Their scores in their O-Level examination subjects can then be converted into points, which can determine the course or pathway that they take after leaving secondary school.\xa0\nLikewise, N(T) students taking N(A) level subjects for their N-Level examinations may convert their grades to points for entry into their preferred Institute of Technical Education (ITE) course.\nMANAGING CLASS DYNAMICS\nThe benefits of subject-based banding are clear for eligible Normal stream students taking on subjects at a higher level. But what about their classmates from the Express stream?\xa0\nPei Hwa Secondary School’s teacher, Ms Lee Sixian, noted that having students from the Normal stream in their classes would instill humility in Express students.\xa0\n“When you put N(A) and Express students in the same class, Express students realise they are only in that stream because their average marks may be higher than a particular student ... When they realise someone can be stronger than them in a subject like English, it opens up the eyes of these students who think they are better at everything. They realise there are people in other streams who have strengths and weaknesses in different things,” said the 27-year-old who teaches geography and English.\xa0\nStill, some educators felt that teaching students from different streams within the same class also means that they have to put in more effort in ensuring that everybody can keep up with the pace of the class.\xa0\nThey spoke of the need for “differentiated teaching” to suit the different pace and abilities of students in a class.\xa0\nThis could mean more guiding questions during class time or in worksheets to help students along. Other techniques employed by teachers involve increasing group work in classes so that students who are faster can help the others along.\nNevertheless, the educators were also quick to note that tailoring a lesson to cater to different abilities in a class is an on-going effort that has been underway in schools here even before subject-based banding kicked in, given that each class always has students with mixed abilities.\xa0\nHowever, an English teacher who only gave her name as Ms Jennifer as she was not authorised to speak to the media said there was “no difference” in how she planned her classes since her school adopted subject-based banding. The N(A) students in her Express stream English class made up only a small number, and could keep up with the pace, she said.\nSimilarly, Ms Cheung Ka Yan, 33, from Greendale Secondary School said that students from the N(A) stream who were taking Express-level Chinese in her Sec 4 class had an interest in the language and were confident in their abilities.\nFor some teachers, however, one problem lies in managing the class dynamics.\nAn English teacher who declined to be named as she was not authorised to speak with the media said it was challenging to teach a class of mixed-stream students.\nThe teacher, who has been teaching English to mixed-stream classes at N(A) level for the last two years, said that classes could be hampered by the way students from the different streams interacted with each other.\nShe said: “When you go in as a subject teacher, you don’t have much time to do bonding activities with the class and you have to get on with lessons. The students are very cliquish and difficult to break, so I have to do a lot of cooperative activities to make the students of different streams mingle.”\xa0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nLikewise, Maldaa’s history teacher, Ms Ranice Tan Pan Ying from Pei Hwa Secondary, was less concerned about the girl keeping up with the lessons, since her previous examination results had already shown that she could likely keep pace with the Express class.\nInstead, Ms Tan, 28, was more worried that as the only N(A) student in the class, Maldaa would have trouble integrating with the class.\xa0\nAs such, Ms Tan made it a point to sit Maldaa alongside other students whom she knew from her co-curricular activity, and checked in with her regularly in the first few weeks of class to make sure Maldaa was settling in.\xa0\nNevertheless, some students said that despite efforts by their teachers, there remains a barrier between those from Normal and Express streams studying in the same class.\xa0\nNicholas Aishwar Robert Michael, a Sec 3 Express student at Christchurch Secondary School, had three N(A) students joining his English class last year. He said that some of his Express classmates felt “superior” and avoided mixing with the N(A) students.\nHowever, the 16-year-old added that having N(A) students sit in with Express students for lessons will help correct the misperception.\xa0\nMOVING AWAY FROM LABELS\nPrincipals and teachers alike say they are optimistic about the attempt to remove labels and the stigma associated with different streams.\xa0\nWith form classes set to have students from different streams as well, the schools piloting full subject-based banding are confident that it will boost social mixing among those from various educational backgrounds.\nEvergreen Secondary School principal Vincent Toh, for instance, said that N(T) students, in particular, usually “clustered” together.\nWhile they were streamed to ensure that learning takes place at the correct pace, Mr Toh, 46, said that subject-based banding had allowed them, as well as those from N(A), to “shine” after performing better than their peers from other streams in some subjects.\xa0\nHowever, Associate Professor Jason Tan Eng Thye, from the policy, curriculum and leadership department at the National Institute of Education, noted that should societal mindset and attitudes remain unchanged, subject-based banding could still result in stigma on students based on the bands they take.\nWhile the move to sort out students according to bands of G1, G2 and G3 is not “as rigid as streaming”, Assoc Prof Tan said that labelling of students could still take place.\n“Our society, unfortunately, still attaches more prestige to what they perceive as more academically demanding courses or programmes,” said Assoc Prof Tan.\n“It remains an uphill battle to change societal attitudes in that respect, so that taking less academically demanding bands aren’t seen as inferior,” he added.\nThis is underscored by the public’s mindset that academic achievement in secondary schools here would keenly affect one’s range of post-secondary school options.\n“For a long time now, the vast majority of our university students have been from the Express stream,” Assoc Prof Tan said. “So one of the key factors at play is the public’s thinking about the relative desirability of the three streams because to a large extent, our society still views university as being more prestigious than polytechnic, which is, in turn, more prestigious than ITE.”\nMs Jennifer, however, is more optimistic.\xa0\nThe English teacher believes that society is gradually grasping the intent of subject-based banding, and that the current generation of young parents may be less quick to label students according to their academic abilities\nUnder the new system where students take a combination of G1, G2 and G3 subjects, it will also be harder to stigmatise a child, she said.\xa0\n“People will no longer have a handle to label kids because every child has a unique suite of G1, G2 and G3 bands over many subjects,” she added.\xa0\nHowever, in order to eradicate labelling, subject-based banding must be accompanied with other measures rolled out by MOE — such as the removal of mid-year examinations for Sec 1 and Sec 3 students.\xa0\nTaken together, these moves emphasise the building of values among students, instead of just memorising facts and regurgitating them during exams.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ']}"

      Shorter poly diplomas for JC graduates, aptitude-based admissions in universities from 2020
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A-Level students who will graduate this year and want to move on to polytechnics could see their diploma courses shortened by up to a\xa0year, said the Ministry of Education on Thursday (Jan 30).\nFrom October this year, A-Level graduates can be exempted from up to two semesters in 56 polytechnic courses\xa0if they fulfil\xa0the necessary module requirements, said the ministry in a media release.\xa0\nOne example is Republic Polytechnic’s Diploma in Engineering Design with Business. A-Level graduates may be exempt from modules on Mathematics, Physics\xa0and Engineering Design\xa0if they have obtained passes in H2 Mathematics and H1 Physics.\nThe total number of polytechnic courses offering exemptions of at least one semester will also increase to 120.\nSince 2019, eligible A-Level students have been allowed mid-year entry to about 110 polytechnic courses, and exemptions from modules depending on their A-Level subjects, shortening their diploma course from three years to two-and-a-half years.\nWith the new measures, an A-Level graduate could start Year Two of his or her polytechnic course in October of the same year, and graduate with a diploma\xa0two years later.\xa0About 200 A-Level graduates are admitted to the polytechnics each year.\xa0\nMaking the announcement at the Applied Learning Conference on Thursday at Marina Bay Sands, Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung acknowledged that many A-Level graduates do not find polytechnics attractive ""because it takes too long"".\nIllustrating this with an example, he noted that if a student does not successfully apply to an autonomous university after graduating from junior college and wishes to switch to a polytechnic, he or she has already missed the admissions window and can only enroll in April the following year.\xa0\n""Thereafter she will undergo three years of polytechnic education. In total, she would have taken about 6.5 years to attain a diploma after graduating from secondary school. And to many A-Level students, that is just too long,"" said Mr Ong.\nNoting that the mid-year entry launched last year has received positive feedback from students and parents, Mr Ong said that the reduction of the course duration for A-Level students ""does not compromise the quality""\xa0of the diploma education.\xa0\n""Students will only receive module exemptions if they have met the necessary grades for their A-Level subjects. They will also need to complete the same graduation requirements as the other polytechnic students, such as internships and overseas exposure,""\xa0he said.\nInterested A-Level graduates can apply directly to the polytechnics for the 120 courses in mid-August this year, for matriculation in October, and further details will be announced in March.\xa0\nEXPANSION OF APTITUDE-BASED ADMISSIONS\nFrom the 2020 intake, the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU) will assess more students with aptitude-based admissions across as many courses as possible, Mr Ong announced.\xa0\nThis takes the place of the universities\'\xa0standalone discretionary admissions schemes.\n""To enable more porosity across pathways, our admissions system needs to rely less on academic grades, and more on other meritorious yardsticks, so that a fuller range of an individual\'s aptitude and attributes can be taken into account,” he said.\xa0\nUnder the current discretionary admissions scheme at NUS, NTU and SMU, the three institutions can admit up to 15 per cent of the annual intake based on factors beyond general academic grades, said the education ministry.\xa0\nThe three institutions already do this today for a range of courses including architecture, dentistry and medicine, to ""identify students who possess the relevant skills, competencies and passion to do well in their courses"".\nThe Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) already practice aptitude-based admission for all their students, said the ministry.\xa0\nNEW PATHWAYS FOR FULL-TIME DIPLOMAS IN POLYS AND ITES\nPolytechnics and ITE colleges will also shorten the working experience required for part-time Nitec, Higher Nitec or Workforce Qualification (WSQ) diploma holders to enroll in full-time courses from their 2021 intakes,\xa0Mr Ong announced.\nFrom 2021, these students can take on\xa0full-time diplomas at the polytechnics and ITE Colleges with one year of work experience instead of two, as is the case now.\xa0\n“We hope this will provide more upgrading options for our working adults, and encourage them to come back to school to pick up new skills,” he said.\xa0\n“This will also change the dynamics and atmosphere at the polytechnics – there will be more students who are working adults, and I think it will make class more interesting.”\nFrom the 2021 intake, working adults with at least two years of relevant work experience can also be considered for admission to part-time polytechnic diploma and Technical Engineering Diploma (TED) Technical Diploma (TD)\xa0programmes, said the ministry. Today, they can only be considered for admission to full-time polytechnic diplomas.\xa0\nAs a result, there will be “some tightening” of the academic requirements for entry into part-time polytechnic diplomas for Higher Nitec holders “to align with other diploma-level programmes”, the ministry said in the release.\xa0\nIndividuals who do not meet the higher academic requirement can still be considered for admission by discretionary admission processes or after accumulating two years of working experience, and more details will be made available before the 2021 admission exercises.\xa0\n“Essentially, with technological advancement, humans are increasingly valued for our technical and soft skills, rather than deep content knowledge. These skills cannot be picked up purely off books and papers, but are honed through years of on-the-job practice, improvisation, and continual learning,” said Mr Ong, adding that different pathways are needed to support the development of these skills.\n“But having different pathways is not enough. They are like different expressways, bringing us to different destinations.\xa0\n“But we also need smaller roads connecting the expressways and pathways together, so that if you decide to switch from one to another, it is possible to do so, even if it means spending more time on your journey.”\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     ITE ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Indonesia seeks to abolish national exams but could end up creating a new rat race
  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: In December last year, Indonesia’s Minister of Education Nadiem Makarim announced sweeping changes to the education sector through four priority reforms. One of them is the abolition of the country’s annual national exams.\nThe exams will be replaced by what the minister dubs a “minimum competency assessment and character survey”. Inspired by concepts used in the Program for International Students Assessment (PISA), it aims to measure students’ numeracy and literacy levels at grade four, eight, and eleven.\nSet as an important factor determining students’ graduation, the national exams have been notorious for causing high levels of anxiety in students, parents and teachers.\nThe exams have also failed to contribute to improvements in the quality of school education.\nA 2018 study by think tank SMERU looked at education policies in 13 regencies and cities across Indonesia. It found no meaningful correlation between the 2017 national exam results and the adoption of policies aimed at improving teacher skills.\nIn 2019, the ministry confirmed 126 cases of cheating nationwide – a 59 per cent increase from the previous year.\nStudies have also shown how the exams have caused “measurement-driven teaching”, where teachers focus mostly on items being tested in upcoming exams.\nScholars argue moving away from a high-stakes graduation exam to an evaluative assessment can help focus Indonesia’s education towards improvements in classroom teaching and learning.\nFOCUS ON PROCESS NOT RESULTS\nGoldy Fariz Dharmawan, a researcher at SMERU said Minister Nadiem’s focus towards numeracy and literacy made sense.\n“The test items would probably have to be based on either literacy or numeracy as students’ core competencies, but this could be designed to cover a variety of subjects including the social sciences,” he said.\nHe suggested the test could, for instance, use questions with economic themes or give problems aimed at testing financial literacy.\nThe PISA tests – which are centred on mathematics, science and reading – were criticised in 2014 by a coalition of more than 2,000 academics from 40 countries. They say the tests can “dangerously narrow our collective imagination regarding what education includes and ought to be about”.\nGoldy was also concerned assessments like these only focus on the results of students’ learning and not on things that happen inside the classroom, which he considers the true “blackbox” of education.\nHe called for the new assessment to not just be conducted in one or two days. Instead, it should be held across a slightly longer period of time to accommodate field observations to understand the teaching-learning process in schools.\n“The assessment should be a complete package which includes a numeracy-literacy evaluation, classroom observations, and also Minister Nadiem’s proposed ‘character survey’ if required,” he said.\nHe suggested classroom observations be conducted on a sample of schools that represent every province should budget limitations become an issue.\n“The two assessments can then be analysed together to provide a complete picture of how students are really learning across Indonesia.”\nENSURING SCHOOLS REALLY IMPROVE\nEdi Subkhan, who teaches education technology at Universitas Negeri Semarang, argued the Ministry of Education and Culture must ensure the assessment results will be effectively used to improve the quality of schools.\n“Those that should have played a big role in acting upon assessment results include school leaders, regional education agencies (dinas pendidikan), and forums such as the Teacher’s Work Group (KKG). However, their efforts don’t seem to have been very promising,” Edi said.\n“To help them think of better solutions, we can involve research agencies such as SMERU, the Centre for Education and Policy Studies (PSPK), or even research centres within teacher education institutions (LPTK).”\nGoldy agreed with Edi. He said the government could deploy research teams and education analysts to assist regional actors in identifying local problems. They could then draw from the assessment results to solve them.\nHowever, he argued different local conditions must be taken into account.\n“Our provinces have varying capacities, different dominant actors, and distinct education cultures. Yogyakarta for instance, has their own team of analysts. Other provinces aren’t so well-equipped,” he said.\nHe said it was important for the government to understand the needs of each region so it can deploy help accordingly.\nAVOIDING ANOTHER “RAT RACE”\nAlthough the proposed assessment indicates a shift from the high-stakes exam students are used to, Edi warned of the possibility of it causing another rat race.\n“If the government falls into the trap of making the proposed assessment all about rankings, schools and regional governments will be pressured to do everything they can to achieve the highest scores. This defeats the purpose of an evaluative assessment,” he argued.\n“It would just be another national exam but with a different skin.”\nA study from the University of Oslo, Norway took note of how PISA caused its participating member nations to be obsessed with policies designed to increase their test scores.\nThe researchers said it has ended up “killing the joy of learning and led to the detriment of basic values that schools should strive for”.\nTo avoid this, Edi suggested the government prepare “policy packages” aimed at improving schools that are behind in the assessment results, and communicate them effectively to education units nationwide.\n“These policy plans must be formulated since the beginning so that schools are assured that attaining unfavourable but honest results will actually help them,” he said.\n“This was another missing piece of our current national exams. There was no certainty.”\nLuthfi T Dzulfikar is an associate editor of The Conversation Indonesia.

However, he assured the victim that they would ""keep a low profile"" until she graduated.\nHe asked her out and they met on Sep 10, 2017, where he took her to a void deck after lunch.

If she refused, he would abuse her verbally, even telling her she deserved to be raped when she did not want to meet.\xa0\nHe messaged her on Instagram even after they had broken up, asking if they could be ""friends with benefits"".\nTheir secret was blown open when the victim\'s mother checked the teenager\'s phone and saw messages between her daughter and the accused.\nThe girl admitted being in a relationship with her teacher, and the matter was flagged to the school and police.\nFor each charge of committing an indecent act with a child or young person, the man could have been jailed for up to five years, fined a maximum S$10,000\xa0or both.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) told CNA the teacher has been\xa0suspended since\xa0Nov 19, 2017 and is no longer teaching in any school.

      Commentary: Look beyond state-of-the-art campuses for what matters in education
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: This week, students and staff of Eunoia Junior College kicked off their academic year by moving into their new high-rise campus at Sin Ming Place.\xa0\nThe complex, which includes a 10- and 12-storey block was built at a cost of about S$100 million.\nThat\xa0amount immediately prompted a wave of social media comments that questioned the need for a new junior college (JC) campus, particularly because eight other JCs had just merged into four last year.\nA further point, about two-thirds of Eunoia’s 1,250-strong student body are from the Integrated Programme (IP) of Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School.\nThis led to some questioning if elitism was at play with some JC students gaining access to a new school building while others saw their schools being merged.\nHowever, Eunoia was set up as a new educational model back in 2010, as there was no suitable JC at that time to partner these three secondary schools for the IP.\xa0\nThis was long before the merger decision was made in 2017, when a study determined enrollment rates for JC would fall in the long term.\nStill, S$100 million is no small amount by any measure so it is worth asking if the spending on this campus has been prudent.\nThe Ministry of Education’s 2019 budget documents reveals an estimated project cost of almost S$144 million, which puts this amount for construction well within budget.\nIN LINE WITH OVERALL EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADING\nIt is useful to regard the new Eunoia campus in a wider context.\nThe Government has long been investing heavily in multiple aspects of the country’s education infrastructure – and it is timely for this to include JC upgrading.\xa0This includes major spending on polytechnics and ITE.\nIn 2013, about S$1 billion was allocated to upgrading the various polytechnics with new classrooms, laboratories and sports and recreation facilities.\nVocational and technical education has not been neglected either. The Government had opened three ITE campuses over 2006 to 2013, and had announced plans to spend S$2 billion\xa0on ITE in 2011.\xa0\nOn the contrary, a majority of JCs have not received such attention of late, having been built or upgraded before 2002. Many of their premises, such as those currently occupied by Temasek, Jurong Pioneer and Anderson Serangoon, are at least 35 years old.\nTIME FOR JUNIOR COLLEGES TO BE UPGRADED\nIt cannot be denied that some of the older JC buildings have become rather outdated and could do with significant refurbishment.\nFor instance, Eunoia’s interim location since 2017 has been the former Raffles Junior College (RJC) premises on Mount Sinai Road, which was built in 1984.\nWhen I attended RJC at this campus in the early 2000s, the school was already bursting at its seams with multiple repurposed shipping containers used as temporary classrooms.\nYears later, I can only imagine that the Mount Sinai complex, while well-loved by many of us during our time, is now even less suited to cater to today’s students with its limited facilities and space.\nAs Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung said in announcing the JC Rejuvenation Programme in 2019: “I think our JCs deserve new campuses too.”\nUp next from 2022 to 2025, four other JCs, including three of the merged schools - Anderson Serangoon, Jurong Pioneer, Yishun Innova - and Temasek, will either be rebuilt or upgraded.\nIf Eunoia’s new campus, which includes thoughtful student-friendly amenities such as a two-storey library, performance stage, activity deck and eight-lane track, is anything to go by, students of these upcoming JCs are in for a treat.\nAfter all, all students, regardless of whether they choose to pursue academic, technical or vocational modes of education, can benefit from having access to well-planned facilities from labs for science lessons to studios for the performing arts.\nSingapore thrives as a knowledge-based economy. In a world of automation and disruption where more will be demanded of every unit of human capital, investing in the education of every Singaporean is serious business.\nSurely, it is heartening for parents - and the general population - to know that the Government is taking a thorough approach to revamping educational infrastructure and investing in education.\nLOOK BEYOND THE FANCY CAMPUS\nLet’s also look beyond multi-million dollar school campuses and consider whether this spending on a large cohort of IP students might be entrenching elitism.\nSome have speculated that the IP programme would further entrench social stratification but some MOE findings indicate that the mix of students in IP schools is actually better compared to non-IP schools.\nTo get a gauge of diversity, MOE’s guide is that every 100 Secondary 1 students in a school should come from 20 or more primary schools.\nIn 2019, 88 per cent of IP schools (15 in total) have hit that target with students. At prestigious schools like Hwa Chong Institution, Raffles Institution and Raffles Girls School, students hailed from over 100 different primary schools.\nIt is important to keep this up and to encourage students to mix among themselves regardless of their backgrounds.\nAs for interactions with the community at large, most would probably agree that more can always be done.\nAt Eunoia, where the Bishan North Community Club is integrated into the new campus, there are plans for students to take part in community activities with residents, including children and the elderly.\nLet’s hope these ideas come to fruition and that more of such activities are implemented in a sustainable way in other schools too.\nMORE THAN BRICK AND MORTAR\nWe can have these discussions about campuses but the essence of education is about so much more.\nIt goes without saying that teachers who care about their students’ academic and personal growth are irreplaceable. At my alma mater, being the bunch of nerds that we were, we would sometimes cajole our teachers into sacrificing their personal time by holding extra classes after school hours.\nThese teachers were invaluable in inspiring many of us to aim for possibilities beyond our then-limited imaginations by telling us about scholarship opportunities and institutes of higher learning abroad.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I would like to thank all the teachers who have gone above and beyond the call of duty for my education. May the relevant authorities as well as students and parents recognise and appreciate the contributions that teachers continue to make.\nAbove all, I have fond memories of huddling with my classmates at study tables placed along the school’s corridors as we revised and worked out tricky science and math problems together.\nI credit my much smarter friends for helping me understand how to put these blackboard theories to practice.\nI also have equally fond memories of being a part of the school’s drama club where I spent many hours at performance rehearsals as part of the operations and backstage crew.\nDo I wish I could have studied with my friends in air-conditioned comfort and that we had nicer, more modern equipment and facilities for our co-curricular activities? Definitely, yes.\nBut none of these indulgences would have mattered if not for the people who made these experiences so rich that they have become memories to last a lifetime.\nAnd that, more than anything else, should be what those lucky enough to spend time in these shiny, fancy new schools and every student who might study elsewhere instead, aspire towards.\nKaren Tee is a freelance\xa0writer.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      MOE to review practice of withholding original result slips for all levels: Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The practice of withholding\xa0original result slips over unpaid school fees will be reviewed for all levels, said Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung on Monday (Jan 6).\nIn a written response to several parliamentary questions on the matter, Mr Ong said\xa0that the education ministry will review the practice “while continuing to underscore the responsibilities of families to pay a small miscellaneous fee”.\nThe topic has been in the spotlight since November, after the case of a student receiving only a photocopy of her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results slip because of S$156 in unpaid fees was circulated on social media.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) later responded to media queries to say that this was a longstanding practice, and that the student's parents had failed to pay miscellaneous fees for two years despite several reminders.\nIn his written response to parliamentary questions on Monday, Mr Ong said that the current practice may not be “fully effective” in encouraging parents to pay miscellaneous fees.\nThe\xa0review\xa0will be completed before the release of this year’s PSLE results.\nCHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PARENTS' ARREARS\nMember of Parliament Dr Teo Ho Pin posed a question on the number of graduate certificates that have been withheld over the last three years.\nIn his written response, Mr Ong said that an average of 2 per cent of each Primary Six cohort who do not receive financial assistance from MOE have arrears, and are affected by the practice.\nThere were 645 such students in 2019, Mr Ong added.\nAcknowledging feedback that children who receive only a photocopy of their results slip may feel awkward and embarrassed, Mr Ong said: “We do not want the children to bear responsibility for the arrears accumulated by their parents.”\xa0\nHowever, he also stressed that most families take the payment of school fees seriously, and this would inculcate in children “the value of commitment and playing our part, however small”.\nEDUCATION IS HIGHLY SUBSIDISED\n“The amount is low because school education is highly subsidised. But a small payment is still required, to demonstrate that as parents and families, we have a part to play,” said Mr Ong.\nThe monthly cash payment for primary schools is S$6.50 for miscellaneous fees, with another S$6.50 that is payable by Edusave.\nIn December, Mr Ong had mentioned that the practice of withholding certificates should be reviewed in an email response to Mr Terence Tan, who had started an\xa0online petition for MOE to do so.\xa0\n“We do have to question if this practice works at all in urging parents to do a small part in paying some miscellaneous fees. So the practice should be reviewed,” said Mr Ong in his email.\xa0\nHe also said that he did not sense that students who did not get their original result slips were humiliated, adding that schools “were sensitive about it”.\xa0\nMr Tan started the petition after a Facebook post by activist Gilbert Goh on Nov 25, 2019 went viral.\xa0\nIn his post, Mr Goh wrote about a student who could not collect the original copy of her PSLE results slip because she owed S$156 in school fees.\nIn his written reply on Monday, Mr Ong said that he has followed up with the student in the post.\nThe student's school had previously reached out to her parents and gave them an application form for MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), but the parents did not apply, said Mr Ong.\xa0\nTeachers also did not observe that she felt embarrassed or emotionally affected by receiving only a copy of her results slip on the day PSLE results were released, he added.\xa0\nThe student\xa0has since been placed in a secondary school of her choice near her home, said Mr Ong. Her\xa0parents have also submitted the FAS form, and the student is receiving assistance.\nEditor's note: A previous version of this article reported Education Minister Ong Ye Kung's comments that the review will be completed before the release of next year’s PSLE results. MOE has clarified that the review will instead be completed before the release of the results this year. \n\n"", 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     education ', '     Ong Ye Kung ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: More diverse pathways to admission to the Singapore Bar and a review of how law students are currently trained are part of a suggested ""timely"" reimagining of Singapore\'s legal education system, the Chief Justice said in a speech on Monday (Jan 6).\nSpeaking at the Opening of the Legal Year 2020, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon shared these\xa0views, which were gleaned\xa0after months of discussions last year with various sectors of the legal community across 16 focus groups comprising 160 people.\n""It may be valuable to introduce greater diversity in the pathways that lead to admission to the Singapore Bar,"" said the Chief Justice.\nThis will encourage those with backgrounds in fields like computer science or STEM-related fields - in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics - to join the legal sector.\nThis also means that professional training courses and qualifying examinations may need to be reviewed to ensure they are able to equip all new lawyers with the necessary skills.\nSharing some possible ways to achieve this, while stressing that they are merely ideas at this point and have to be tested for viability, CJ Menon said Singapore\'s law schools could consider offering a wider variety of pathways to the Bar through their courses and degrees.\n""Apart from direct entry through undergraduate law degrees, these pathways might also permit mid-career individuals with non-law backgrounds to enter the profession,"" he said.\nOne suggestion\xa0is a new four-year degree programme, with both academic and practical components, comprising two years of core legal education, a year of professional training, and a final year of study in a complementary discipline such as business, accounting or computer science.\nTo ensure that all new entrants meet required standards, they could sit for a common Bar examination.\nREVIEW UNDERGRAD LAW SYLLABUS\xa0\nStakeholders in the discussions also widely supported the idea that it is timely to review the undergraduate law syllabus, to focus on growing areas like\xa0cross-border insolvency, international arbitration, e-commerce and financial services.\nOther suggestions include offering students\xa0working experience in more diverse institutions and organisations, and enhancing the teaching of practical skills.\nOne strategy suggested to achieve the ideas raised in the talks is to create a steering forum to guide the reimagining of\xa0legal education and training, in consultation with the universities, the Ministries of Law and Education and the judiciary.\nThe initial ideas have been discussed with the deans of Singapore\'s law schools, as well as with the Ministers of Law and Education, said CJ Menon, with further exploration expected in the year ahead.\nWhile no concrete date was given for any of the suggested initiatives, those in the legal industry told CNA they welcome the move.\nMOVE WELCOMED BY INSIDERS\nProfessor Simon Chesterman, dean of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, said he was ""excited about the challenges and opportunities ahead"".\n""Upheavals in the practice of law require a radical rethink of the purpose, content, method, and funding of legal education and training,"" he said.\nHe cited recent initiatives to this end by NUS Law, including the launch in December of the Centre for Technology, Robotics, AI & the Law (TRAIL), a research unit exploring the relationship between technology and legal research.\nWhile career opportunities for NUS Law graduates ""remain very strong, with high employment and salaries"", there is no room for complacency, said the dean.\nLawyer Josephus Tan of Invictus Law agreed that it is timely to reshape existing legal education to include areas like technology ethics, FinTech regulations and digital payment laws.\nOther than introducing a topical curriculum, compulsory work attachment stints to non-law sectors could be considered, to help law students have better insights into how laws function in non-court settings, he said.\nThe need to reimagine legal education ""is not perhaps surprising"", said Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan.\n""There appear to be concerns that Singapore’s legal sector may not be equal to the task of lawyering for the domestic, regional, and international markets,"" he opined. ""It boils down to the fundamental issue of whether our legal sector will be relevant and be at the cutting edge.""\n""MORE LEGAL INNOVATORS""\nHe said Singapore needs ""more legal innovators who can craft creative solutions to multi-faceted challenges, especially with IT and Artificial Intelligence disruption transforming all aspects of human endeavour"".\n""Legal education today is fit for our present needs but may be inadequate for future challenges,"" he said, adding that the country could do with a more diverse group of law students, thinkers\xa0and practitioners.\nAssociate Professor Tan said most of Singapore\'s lawyers come from a similar background, going through the route of A Levels or International Baccalaureate.\nHowever, applicants should include non-traditional backgrounds such as polytechnics and ITE\xa0and also those who already have\xa0undergraduate degrees in other disciplines, he said.\xa0\n""The aptitude for law should not be seen as only the preserve of those who decided at 18 years of age that they would like to read law,"" said Assoc Prof Tan, explaining his view that law should be a graduate degree.\nHaving lawyers from more diverse educational backgrounds would enable them to better appreciate an issue not just from the legal perspective, and to offer more rounded solutions, he opined.\n""Law cannot be a mono-discipline; it needs to embrace other disciplines,"" said Assoc Prof Tan. ""The more varied the practitioners and teachers of law are, the better law and the legal professions can meet the demands and expectations and engage in innovative problem-solving.""\nLaw Society president Gregory Vijayendran told CNA ""we can do better"" as a community to reduce ""the steep learning curve for law undergrads to acquire practice-oriented skills"", while the Ministry of Law said it has held detailed discussions with more than 300 lawyers on the future of legal services.\nEducation Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post that the Ministry of Education shares the Chief Justice\'s views that undergraduate courses must have more diverse curriculum elements, and more pathways for entry into the profession.\n', 'related_topics': ['     law ', '     education ']}"

      The low-down on parents’ WhatsApp group chats: Are they becoming toxic?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Banu Partiban’s daughter was in her first month at primary school when she and her husband received a WhatsApp message from another parent.\n“It was a picture message.\xa0This parent circled my child. The parent wrote, ‘Can I know who’s the parent of this child?’” she recounted.\nIt was sent to a parents’ group chat, which was “not a very nice thing to (do)”. An upset Banu had parents approaching her, seemingly thinking something was wrong, to ask what happened and why her girl was singled out.\nShe reached out to the parent privately — the better approach in the first place, she thought. It turned out that their children had a minor dispute, which they eventually resolved.\nThe incident came as a “shock”, occurring within days of her joining the WhatsApp group. But she remained in the group because, as a working parent, she did not want to miss anything important for her child’s schooling.\nChances are parents today are in a parents’ group chat or even a few groups. But not all see the need for this.\nSome parents — and children — describe these WhatsApp groups as “competitive”, and as the question of whether to stay or leave arises, the programme Talking Point investigates whether parents’ group chats are even becoming toxic or inadvertently hurting children. (Watch the episode here.)\nTHE 90-9-1 TYPES OF PARENTS\nWinston Tay, for one, was in a group chat when his child was in Primary One to Primary Three, but he left because the parents had “a lot of idiosyncrasies”.\n“On Sunday nights especially, there’d be a flurry of messages,” he recalled, citing queries about homework for the weekend.\n“And we realised that we had certain parents who’d … ask, ‘How have your kids’ results been? My kids’ results are this.’ So after a while, it started getting a little bit annoying.”\nOn the other hand, these WhatsApp groups have been “very useful” for mother of two, Serene Seah, who admitted to being “forgetful” and needing reminders.\nThe two parents belong to two of the three types of people generally in online communities, which are what parents’ WhatsApp groups are.\nResearch by the Nielsen Norman Group found that 90 per cent of users are quiet observers who only read the messages, 9 per cent are active in the conversations, and 1 per cent are very active users who provide a lot of information.\nWhile that is a general view of online communities, Talking Point found specific descriptors associated with people in parents’ WhatsApp groups: The blur sotong; the know-it-all; the chat-a-lot; the show-off; the life coach; and the lurker, who does not contribute.\nWith such parents in these WhatsApp groups, chat administrators such as William Choo must play the role of “policeman” to ensure that the chats stay civil.\n“(Some parents) try to dig out information like … your kid’s score,” said the father of three. “I’d try to tell them, ‘Please don’t compare.’\n“We need to have someone (as) the neutral party, to let every member of the group chat have peace of mind, for example (through) simple rules like ‘No messaging after, say, 11pm’ … no sensitive issues (and) no bad-mouthing each other.”\nIMPACT ON TEACHERS\nThe use of WhatsApp could also expose teachers to disparaging remarks, insults and contempt shown by parents.\nFor example, one of the reasons Lenny Syafawatie Abdul Rahman gave up teaching at primary school after 14 years was she had to manage difficult parents, offline and online, even when she was not part of these group chats.\n“You’d think twice about what you say in class because you’re afraid that whatever you say would be misinterpreted by the kids,” said the full-time tutor. “Parents would spread it among themselves (and) change the whole story.\nParents are quicker to share the negatives rather than the positives.\nIn one incident when she had a class of 40 pupils, a parent took a snapshot of her marking and put it in the group chat.\n“She said, ‘You all better check your kid’s work. This teacher just anyhow marks.’ It was actually one (mathematics answer) marked wrongly,” Lenny related.\n“Nowadays (parents) are a bit kiasu, they get a bit kancheong (anxious), so they all panicked, and they started checking each and every one of their kid’s work … I was a bit upset because it was a small matter.”\nThe 35-year-old agreed with Talking Point host Diana Ser that, from a parent’s perspective, WhatsApp group chats “allow for some kind of checks and balances” in that parents should know what happens within a school and the issues at stake.\nBut she suggested checking with the teacher involved rather than making “a mountain out of a molehill” by, for example, “going straight to school leaders”.\nIn these situations, Seah tries to “send positive vibes"" in her group chats. “When you feel that\xa0the tension is building up, like resentment against the teachers, someone’s got to be there to put out the fire,” she said.\nCREATING A CRUTCH?\nAs a tool to improve parental involvement and keep up with what goes on at school, WhatsApp group chats work a treat, especially for parents worried about their children not paying attention in class or forgetting to take notes.\nBut if parents rely on others for information to fill in gaps like test dates, does this not make their children less self-reliant?\nXavier Chua is one who “often” forgets to do his homework, but parents in his mother’s group chat would keep her informed, and then he gets scolded.\nTo him, however, that is not the trouble with these groups. “The bad part comes when the parents share other people’s results,” said the 11-year-old, whose parents may sometimes point out those with higher marks to him.\nManassvi Arora, who is also 11 years old, agreed. “Sometimes when you compare results in the chat, like when everybody (scores) better than you … you can take it positively if it (happens) the first or second time,” she said.\n“But when it always happens, you feel kind of bad that you can’t be better than the rest of your classmates.”\nDespite the competition encountered, the five pupils Talking Point had gathered did not want their parents to leave these group chats — as that would mean, said 10-year-old Belinda Low, that “we have to pay more attention at school”.\nDigital literacy trainer Carol Loi, who runs workshops on parenting in the digital age, said parents may not be supporting their children’s learning if they “provide them with a crutch all the time”.\nShe recommends helping children to see the consequences of “some of the things that they’ve forgotten” and what they can “learn from the whole experience”.\n“That’s more important than going straight to … get the information for them and just give it to them,” said the 49-year-old.\nFor parents evaluating whether to leave their group chats, Choo has this piece of advice: “If you can 100 per cent depend on your kids — that means you don’t rely on this ‘information centre’ — (then) you can do it.”\nWatch this episode of Talking Point here.

      Full subject-based banding an 'important' move to maximise students' talents: Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The full subject-based banding (SBB) system represents an ""important, very strategic"" move to maximise the potential of secondary school\xa0students in Singapore,\xa0said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Thursday (Jan 2).\xa0\nMr Ong was speaking to reporters following a visit to Ping Yi Secondary School on the first day of the academic year. Ping Yi Secondary is one of the 28 schools\xa0piloting full\xa0SBB\xa0in 2020.\nFull subject-based banding was announced earlier last year to replace the existing system of streaming students into Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) based on their PSLE results.\nThe new system will be rolled out by 2024 across all secondary schools.\nGREATER INTERACTION\n""If you are a stronger student, you benefit from the fact that you interact with students from many more different backgrounds,"" said Mr Ong, when asked about the benefits of the SBB.\xa0\n""The second important area - which is the key consideration when we decided to implement this - is to really break out (of) a certain constraining mindset of students should they feel that \'I am in this stream and this is all I can achieve\'.\n""(In the) long-term, we want students to be more confident, to discover, explore and develop their individual talent, and then with that I think they are much more ready to move on to post-secondary education.\n""All in all, I think this is an\xa0important, very strategic move to make sure we maximise the potential\xa0talent and future of every single student.""\nDuring his visit to the school, Mr Ong held a short\xa0dialogue session with students and visited\xa0a secondary one class of about 25 students where he observed and participated\xa0in a class activity.\nWhile calling the pilot scheme ""a big step ahead"" for the education system, Mr Ong acknowledged that some schools have had their ""concerns"".\n""Definitely they have a concern, because this is a huge move, a big step ahead ...\xa0But we have 28 schools, we are giving them two years. Within these two years they will implement full SBB, including mixed form classes.\xa0\n""And\xa0these two years are necessary for them to really gain the experience, overcome all the various\xa0challenges and difficulties that other schools are worried about ... By the end of 2021, I hope that they will have learnt all the lessons, and have methods and responses to all the challenges.\xa0\n""So for every other school that is still concerned about this system, I think they will get a good manual, good tips, good advice from these 28 schools to say that ... there\'s no reason why you can\'t do it.""\n\nThere\xa0are several key things that the schools involved in the scheme will need to get right.\nThe first is the scheduling of lessons, said Mr Ong.\xa0\nIn Ping Yi, for instance, its secondary one form\xa0classes\xa0comprise different students from different streams.\nStudents take\xa0a set of subjects such as art, music and physical education at a common level within\xa0their form class.\nThey take other subjects\xa0at levels\xa0based on their strengths and participate in these lessons with students of similar ability levels.\nStudents will need ""constant"" encouragement and motivation from teachers, said Mr Ong. He also highlighted the need for ""differentiated"" instructions.\n\n""Visiting this school, I appreciate how much effort has already gone into it - that the teachers are all trained and exposed to various techniques to teach a mixed form class,"" he said.\xa0\n""Teachers are doing this in a very subtle way, a very skillful way, and I believe they will get better and this is essential to make this pilot work so it can be expanded.""\nROOM FOR IP, SPECIALISED SCHOOLSMr Ong also said on Thursday that Integrated Programme (IP schools), as well as specialised schools such as Spectra and Crest Secondary, remain important as they provide a ""differentiated landscape"".\n""If you go to Crest and\xa0Spectra, it\'s because we recognise that your strength lies in vocational. So, therefore, you should be doing subjects that cater more to your strengths.\n""Likewise for IP schools, it is to\xa0recognise that certain students are strong academically therefore they can skip O-Level\xa0and therefore they do subjects at a higher academic level.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     MOE ']}"

      New S$100m Eunoia JC campus is Singapore’s first ‘high-rise’ junior college
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: With their sleek green-tinted glass windows, expansive open spaces and greenery lining their walls, the two new towering blocks along Sin Ming Place could be mistaken for\xa0office buildings.\nBut they are not.\xa0\nThey form part of Eunoia Junior College\'s (EJC) new campus which boasts the tallest buildings among JCs in Singapore.\xa0\nThe campus was built upwards to compensate for the smaller four-hectare plot of land it sits on, compared to the six-hectare average plot size of\xa0other JCs. One of the academic blocks is 10-storeys high, the other reaches 12 storeys.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) said EJC cost\xa0S$100 million to construct. In its 2019 budget documents, the ministry said the total project cost\xa0for the development of the campus was estimated at almost S$144 million.\xa0\nThe total development cost of the project, which includes consultancy costs, improvement works and other related fees, is still being finalised and is expected to be lower than what was budgeted, said the ministry.\xa0\nDESIGNED FOR STUDENT INTERACTION\nA duplex library takes up the ninth and tenth floors of one of the academic blocks. It offers a panoramic view of nearby Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. The library is part of a student hub, which includes an activity deck on level 10,\xa0an art studio and special learning rooms.\xa0\nA stage within the library provides a space\xa0where students “can perform spontaneously”, said principal Mrs Wong Mei Heng.\xa0\nThe interaction areas are “really huge spaces created for the students to carry out many of the activities to facilitate their bonding and facilitate the ability to initiate activities”, said Mrs Wong.\xa0\n“The learning spaces are designed from the start with the intention of encouraging collaboration, encouraging active student life, and encouraging the students to really make use of space to support their learning,” she added.\xa0\nStudents were invited to give input on how they would like the spaces in the new campus to be furnished and who gets to operate stalls at the canteen.\xa0\n“When we selected and shortlisted our canteen vendors, the students joined us in tasting the food and giving us the vote. So all the vendors that we bring in really are a result of students’ vote,” said Mrs Wong.\xa0\nPERCEPTION OF IP\xa0SCHOOLS ""HAS NOT BEEN VERY FAIR""\nEJC took in its first batch of students in 2017 at its interim campus at Mount Sinai. Students from the Integrated Programme (IP) of Catholic High School, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School make up about two-thirds of the 1,250-strong student body.\xa0\nThe remaining one-third are students from the O-Level track, and they come from about 80 different schools, said Mrs Wong. The school has about 120 teachers.\xa0\nResponding to questions on the perception that EJC is an elite school with mostly IP students, Mrs Wong said: “Actually maybe the perception of IP schools has not been very fair because our students grow in the heartlands of Singapore as well. And they face every challenge that every teenager faces.”\nMrs Wong said that classes are mixed, all students choose their co-curricular activities at the same time, and the college’s flagship IP programmes are available to students from the O-Level track as well.\xa0\n“About two-thirds of our students come from IP schools that have rich traditions, and they have four years of forging friendships and they’re going to have another two years to continue that. But they are also sensitive to the fact that there will be another batch of college mates that come in and join in. Inclusivity is something that we have focused on right from the start,” she said.\xa0\n“For us, I think it is important that once our students come into EJC, then they are Eunoians and we don’t differentiate between IP and JAE (joint admissions exercise) students.”\nStudent mixing is one of the major factors that influenced the design of the college’s new campus. Next to the classroom blocks is a five-storey student activities centre that houses an eight-lane track and full-sized field on its roof. It also houses\xa0a 900-seat lecture theatre, the canteen, and Bishan North Community Club.\xa0\nAs the first JC to be co-located with a community club, Mrs Wong said that the plan is for students to be involved in activities such as reading programmes for children, digital literacy programmes for the elderly, and organising activities for residents.\xa0\nLOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW CAMPUS\nOn Jan 6, a symbolic relay from Mount Sinai to Bishan via Rifle Range Road and the Central Nature Reserve, will mark the move to the new campus.\xa0\n""We will miss Mount Sinai but we look forward to the Bishan campus. In terms of giving closure to our students, some of them were also involved in saying goodbye to Ghim Moh, because, in a way, we would say that the school has grown up in Ghim Moh,"" said Mrs Wong.\nAppreciation notes written by the students had been distributed to the stallholders at Ghim Moh hawker centre, a Eunoian haunt for the past three years, she said: ""It’s touching to see the students value a space that they also have been able to learn from.""\xa0\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The practice of withholding original Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results slips over unpaid school fees should be reviewed, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung in response to a recent online petition.\nMr Ong\'s comments were made public on Wednesday (Dec 18)\xa0after Mr Terence Tan, who started the petition, uploaded the minister\'s e-mail response on\xa0his Facebook page.\xa0\nMr Tan has since changed the privacy setting of the post to his Facebook friends only.\nResponding to queries from CNA, Mr Tan said he changed the privacy setting of the post after noticing a confidentiality clause in the email he received from Mr Ong.\nMr Tan started the petition, which calls for the Ministry of Education to review the practice, after a Facebook post by activist Gilbert Goh went viral.\xa0\nIn the Facebook post on Nov 25, Mr Goh wrote about a student who could not collect the original copy of her PSLE results slip because she owed S$156 in school fees.\xa0\nResponding to media queries at the time, MOE had said that for the case in question, the student’s parents did not pay miscellaneous fees for two years despite several reminders\xa0and did not put in an application for MOE or school-based financial assistance, which would have covered all the costs.\nIn a media statement, the ministry had said that the issue was “not about recovering the money”.\xa0\nAdding that funding for each primary school student comes up to about S$12,000 each year and that each student co-pays S$13 of miscellaneous fees per month, the ministry said: ""MOE’s consideration stems from the underlying principle that notwithstanding the fact that the cost of education is almost entirely publicly funded, we should still play our part in paying a small fee, and it is not right to ignore that obligation, however small it is.”\nCiting Mr Ong\'s email response to Mr Tan, TODAY reported that Mr Ong had acknowledged the petition.\xa0\n""We do have\xa0to question if this practice works at all in urging parents to do a small part in paying some miscellaneous fees. So the practice should be reviewed,"" said Mr Ong, adding that he would provide a response on the matter in Parliament next year.\xa0\nMr Ong also said that after speaking to various people, he did not sense that\xa0children who did not get the original results slip were being humiliated.\n“The schools were sensitive about it. The students would receive their results like everyone, and apply for secondary school and progress like everyone else,” he said in his email.\xa0\nAccording to MOE, students can use the photocopy of the results slip to apply for admission into secondary schools.\nAddressing other comments made by the signatories, Mr Ong said that he disagreed with those who called schools and teachers here “uncaring and unfeeling”.\n“On the contrary, schools and teachers are on the frontline doing their utmost and often going out of their way to help students from vulnerable backgrounds,” he wrote.\xa0\nHe also responded to comments that said applying for financial assistance could be difficult and demeaning, noting that all government schemes “will need some form-filling, which cannot be helped”.\xa0\n“It is not a difficult form to fill\xa0and school staff often help to fill up the forms for parents,"" said Mr Ong.\nIn his response to CNA, Mr Tan said that he had put up Mr Ong\'s email to ""share with our petitioners that some positive news might be on the way in the coming parliament sessions"".\n""I believe the minister was weighing his thoughts on the matter. His email doesn\'t specify if our petition was a factor, as his points weren\'t based on the contents of our petition per se,"" said Mr Tan.\n""The key takeaway for me is that he is thinking whether the practice works when it comes to parents\' arrears.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Ong Ye Kung ']}"

He was being punished for missing a previous CCA session.\nThe teacher came up behind the boy and suddenly hugged him tight from behind.\nEven though the teenager was uncomfortable and tried to wriggle out of his hold, the teacher molested him under his clothes.\nShocked and upset, the teen not knowing what to do.\nThe teacher told the CCA members there: ""What happens here, stays in here.""\nThe boy later quit the CCA.\nHe molested another student during a session in the school gym in 2017, as the boy used an exercise roller.\nThe teacher asked the victim how low he could go with the equipment and said he could support him, before placing his hand under the boy\'s body.\nHe clutched the boy\'s privates, shocking him and causing the boy to fall forward, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Joshua Lim.\nThe teacher laughed about the incident.\nESCALATION IN SEXUAL EXPLOITATION\nThe prosecutor had asked for the sentence that was meted out, saying there was an escalation in sexual exploitation and an attempt to cover the crimes up.\nThe case involved ""egregious breaches of trust"" as the man was the uniformed group teacher of all the victims, who were vulnerable.\n""This case involves a public institution: a secondary school in Singapore. The court should send a clear message that sexual assault against students by members of the teaching fraternity cannot be condoned under any circumstances,"" said Mr Lim.\nHe added that predatory conduct by teachers against young students is an offence that triggers unease and offends the sensibilities of the public, and must be deterred.\nOther than the three cases listed in the statement of facts, the teacher had molested four other boys in the six charges taken into consideration.\nThese include acts where he molested one boy repeatedly in his car and molesting others over their pants and shorts.\nHe was a predator who took steps to prevent his victims from reporting him, by explicitly silencing his victims and passing off the acts as horseplay, said Mr Lim.\nThe prosecutor said teachers perform a unique and important role in shaping the minds of the young, and parents and students do not expect teachers to be ""predators masquerading as protectors"".\n""The sentence imposed should also deter the accused from the commission of future offences, and must provide assurance to the wider public that teachers who decide to use our institutions of learning as captive grounds for their criminal sex acts will be dealt with severely,"" he said.\nTEACHER SUSPENDED SINCE SEPTEMBER 2017\nThe\xa0Ministry of Education (MOE)\xa0said that the teacher has been suspended\xa0since Sep 14, 2017,\xa0and is currently not teaching in any school.\n“MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,"" said MOE, adding that it will commence internal disciplinary action against the teacher.\nFor each charge of outrage of modesty, the teacher could have been sentenced to two years\' jail, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     education ']}"

      ‘Without him, I’d be in Boys’ Home’: The Normal Stream student who just needed someone to believe in him
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When Yap Zi Yang saw the score ‘140’ on his Primary School Leaving Examination result slip, he was crushed.\n“Study so hard, also fail,” he said. “I just wanted to give up.”\xa0\nAnd give up on himself, he did.\xa0\nJust barely making it into the Normal (Technical) stream at Bedok Green Secondary School, he skipped classes three times (or more) a week to stay home. When he did bother to show up, he was often splayed out in his chair at the back of the classroom, fast asleep.\xa0\n“I felt like I had no future,” he said. “I just took one day at a time.”\nDirectionless, low on self-esteem, and resentful of the way he thought his peers in the Express stream looked down on him, Zi Yang lashed out.\n“We targeted the smaller students. Sometimes I would take their bags and throw them on the floor.\xa0\n“Our teachers always said Express students don’t look down on us,” he added. “But we just felt like they did.”\xa0\nShafik Said knows how students like him feel. “When you’re in the Normal stream, you kind of are compared,” said the senior youth worker with Children-At-Risk Empowerment Association (CARE Singapore).\xa0\nYou tend to believe you are way less capable than others. You aspire to less.\nEach time he walks into a class and asks “how many of you think being in Normal Technical means it’s the end for you?”, Shafik said, “a few of them will raise their hands”.\nMORE THAN MEETS THE EYE\nBut there was more to Zi Yang than the rebellious, couldn’t-care-less side he showed in school.\nWhen the school bell rang, 13-year-old Zi Yang, instead of hanging about with his friends, would head straight home, where he’d help his mother around the house and care for his ailing father.\nA seamstress, Madam Chin Bee Ching had been taking on more work making curtains ever since Zi Yang’s father suffered a mild stroke in 2014 and could no longer work as a taxi driver.\xa0\nZi Yang looked up to his dad. When he was younger, they’d go for supper together, just father and son, at the coffee shop near their home. Over prata with egg, they’d have heart-to-heart conversations about everything.\n“My father was one of the closest people to me. I would talk to him about things that I went through, sometimes he would talk to me about his issues. He understood me,” Zi Yang, now 17, remembered.\xa0\nIn January 2015, the month Zi Yang entered Secondary 1, his father was diagnosed with terminal cancer.\xa0The man he looked up to rapidly wasted away before his eyes.\xa0\n“He couldn’t even hold a spoon himself. Sometimes in the morning, if I needed to feed him, I’d stay home,” said the teenager who, without anyone asking, became his dad’s main caregiver.\nInstead of going to school on some mornings, he’d help his dad down to the void deck, where the older man loved to sit and enjoy the breeze. It was there that Zi Yang’s father put on his young shoulders a responsibility that he holds close to his heart to this day.\xa0\n“To my father, boys must always support the family,” Zi Yang said. “He told me to start to think about how to help my family.”\xa0\nThree months after being diagnosed, his dad died. Zi Yang lost not just a father, but a confidante.\n“My father would sleep in my room,” the teen said, “So after he left, it was like there was no one sleeping beside me.”\xa0\n“When he passed away I couldn’t take it. It just hit me very hard.”\nA CHANCE TO BE MORE\nFor a whole month, Zi Yang stayed away from school, shut up in his room most of the time.\nBut his father’s words kept coming back to him. Seeing how his mother was working hard to make ends meet for himself and his older sister, he returned to school and started to buck up in class.\xa0\n“He wanted to take care of the family,” his mum Bee Ching, 53, said. “He would help me with the housework.”\xa0\nThe three of them moved in with her father, and Zi Yang’s grandfather became the disciplinarian the boy needed in his life. “If I skipped (school) again, my grandfather would really cane me, so I didn’t dare.”\xa0\nWith the renewed effort that he was putting into his studies, he was pleasantly surprised when he discovered that he had a flair for Mathematics.\xa0\nWhen you solve a question and get the correct answer, wow, it’s like, mission accomplished.\nAs the months passed, Zi Yang’s ‘U’ grades turned to ‘A’s, and by the end of Secondary 2 he’d topped his class in Math.\xa0\n“His results were quite remarkable for a Normal Technical student,” recalled Hafiedz-ul Tamrin, who was his Design and Technology teacher. As a result, Zi Yang was offered a transfer to the Normal (Academic) stream – he was one of only two students in the school given the rare opportunity.\nWATCH: The mentor who helped a teen believe in himself (6:33)\nHis form teacher encouraged him. But doubts assailed Zi Yang. With the move up, he’d have to repeat an entire academic year, with a class of strangers no less, and he’d have to take on three additional subjects. He feared he’d falter and fail.\xa0\n“I might get demoted, and I didn’t want that feeling,” he said.\xa0\nHis mum, however, refused to let him pass up the chance to do better – especially when she believed her son was capable of anything he put his mind to.\xa0\n“If he wants to get something done, he can do it well,” she said. “(But) he always needs someone to push him.”\nAnd so, she insisted on the transfer, which Zi Yang took without much confidence. For the first few months, he struggled.\nThat’s where Shafik came in.\xa0\nNOT ‘JUST ANOTHER TEACHER’\nThe 30-year-old youth worker had been assigned as mentor to Zi Yang’s entire class in Sec 1 as part of The Scaffold Programme.\xa0\nDeveloped by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), the pilot programme in 11 mainstream schools sees youth workers working with teachers and families, to help students from the Normal stream build their confidence and set future goals.\nThe programme targets lower secondary students who – due to factors like poor self-esteem or family troubles – might be at risk of dropping out during the transition from Primary 6 to Sec 1, and from Sec 2 to Sec 3.\nShafik was uniquely suited to understanding how these students felt: He himself had been in the Normal (Technical) stream, and like Zi Yang, had at first seen only a bleak future for himself.\n“I was ten times worse than Zi Yang,” he laughed, recalling how he’d bullied other students, sometimes even teachers, and got into fights and bad company.\xa0\n“I remember the first time when CARE Singapore mentors came, they asked ‘where do you see yourself in 10 years?’ And I said, ‘Boys’ Home’.”\nBut then, a youth worker came into his life under CARE’s Uth Power Programme. Giving advice and encouragement over even the small things – like publicly praising Shafik for how well he’d mopped a floor – the persistent mentor convinced him he had something worthwhile to offer.\nThe “naughty” teen eventually became a student council leader. “(The youth workers) had this belief in me, which allowed me to really believe that I could achieve a lot.”\xa0\nAnd so, after he earned his Nitec in Aerospace Technology from the Institute of Technical Education, Shafik decided that what he really wanted to do with his life was to help troubled youths. He joined CARE.\nTo help someone like Zi Yang, though, required first getting past his walls. The mistrustful teenager thought of him as “just another teacher”.\nBut when Zi Yang was absent from school for several days with a high fever, Shafik and another youth worker went to his home to check on him. It made an impression.\xa0\n“I felt like they really cared about me and my family,” Zi Yang said.\nAnd Shafik, on that short visit, saw something in Zi Yang at home that gave him hope that the boy, who sometimes acted like a gangster in school, had potential in him yet.\nI saw how he loves his mum a lot. That’s when I knew the boy has a heart.\nTHE ZEN OF POOL\nPlaying pool became Shafik’s way of getting through to Zi Yang.\nThe school’s clubroom had a pool table, and when he found out the teenager couldn’t play, Shafik offered to teach him. He used the game to patiently impart life lessons – for instance, turning it into a metaphor for achieving goals.\xa0\nYou had to plan out your moves, and aim before shooting, he told Zi Yang over the clacking of balls. The den, with its cartoon-doodled walls and foosball tables (Shafik was proud of the fact that Zi Yang had helped to decorate it), became an informal counselling room abuzz with laughter.\xa0\n“He is a very good person to talk to,” the teenager said. “A very good friend. He understands me very well.”\xa0\nIn his big-brotherly way, Shafik was filling the void Zi Yang’s father’s death had left. He regularly got feedback from the boy’s teachers. He and another youth worker checked in often with the teenager and his mother.\nAnd, when a frustrated Zi Yang was struggling with the switch to Normal (Academic) classes – he’d sit at the back “stoning”, as he put it, not understanding what the teacher was saying – it was Shafik who reminded him why he was there.\n“We told him that the new environment will challenge him,” Shafik said. “If you’re too comfortable in your environment, you won’t grow.”\xa0\nAnd by now, Zi Yang had found a goal to shoot for.\xa0\nDuring a Scaffold Programme session in Sec 1, his class was tasked to set their future goals.\xa0\n“I didn’t even have a goal then,” said Zi Yang. “Mr Shafik told me to just write down what interests me most. I like to do things with my hands.”\xa0\nHe’d spent some time in his grandfather’s car workshop, and was fascinated by auto mechanics. So that’s what he put down as his goal: To become the owner of a car repair business.\xa0\nNext, Shafik guided him in planning how to get there step by step. “What would you need to open a shop? Which course should you study In ITE? Which ITE offers that course?” he pressed.\nThe job, of course, would only be a means to a more important end for Zi Yang – taking care of his family. “My goal is to let my mother travel around the world. That’s her dream,” he said simply.\nA WORK IN PROGRESS\xa0\nIn Sec 3, Zi Yang made more strides when he was elected as a student leader. He was also appointed logistics head for a camp jointly organised with CARE.\xa0\n“Having a leadership role helps a lot in allowing students to see their own potential,” Shafik pointed out.\nMore than 2,000 Normal stream students have gone through The Scaffold Programme, and Zi Yang is not the only one showing results of the intervention.\n“About half of the students showed academic improvement,” said Tina Hung, NCSS’ deputy chief executive officer. The students were also “better able to build social relationships and set future goals.”\nZi Yang’s teachers and schoolmates too have seen a difference in him. “He tries his best to pay attention,” said his teacher Hafiedz. “He’s putting effort into his daily work.”\xa0\nHis friends quipped about how he used to walk around looking like a scary “ah beng”. But now, said classmate Marcus Ng, “he will approach me when he sees me struggling with Math. He’s quite a good teacher, I really understand when he teaches me”. \xa0\nSaid his mum Bee Ching: “A few months ago I went to the school … The canteen aunties told me that Zi Yang has turned out to be a very good boy, not like the rebellious boy when he first came in.”\nReflecting on where he’d be without Shafik and The Scaffold Programme, Zi Yang said: “Maybe I wouldn’t even graduate from secondary school. Maybe go to Boys’ Home.”\xa0\nShafik, nonetheless, describes Zi Yang as “still a work in progress. There is still doubt in him. What he needs is just that extra caring adult, to assure him that he is more than what he thinks he is"".\n“We believe that there is always a success story in in every child – no matter how rotten you think you are, there’s always a star in you,” he added. “You still can achieve more.”\nThis story by CNA Insider was done in partnership with Gov.sg.\xa0\nFrom 2020, Bedok Green Secondary will be one of 28 schools piloting full subject-based banding, where students will no longer be streamed into Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) courses, but will take subjects at different levels according to their abilities.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'JAKARTA: The lack of comprehensive sex education can lead to serious social challenges, as Indonesia is finding out.\nIn Southeast Asia’s most populous country, up to 4.7 per cent of girls\xa0aged 15 to 19 and 17.4 per cent of women aged 15 and older have experienced sexual abuse, a 2017 report by the Knowledge in Childhood initiative shows.\nAccording to a report published by Statistics Indonesia (BPS) and UNICEF in 2016, one in nine married women in Indonesia were married as children.\nThe Indonesian government has tried to arrest these trends through national programmes to tackle poverty, increase access to primary education and health services, law enforcement, and various efforts to enhance public awareness, including reproductive health education.\xa0\nNotably, in September 2019, the Indonesian parliament revised its Marriage Act to increase the legal age a girl can marry from 16 previously to 19 – same as that for boys.\nCONSERVATIVE SOCIAL NORMS HOLD INDONESIA BACK\nDespite these efforts, social norms in the country, which has a large rural and conservative population, are still ruefully inadequate in addressing the prevalence of child marriage and sexual violence.\nToxic social norms have been widely acknowledged to be a leading cause behind the high numbers of child marriage, violence against children and unwanted pregnancy.\nThese have gone hand in hand with increasing religious piety and conservatism, as norms regulate the way young people understand sexuality.\nParents prefer to marry their daughters off before the legal age due to fears of daughters committing ""zina"",\xa0or\xa0adultery.\nConservative groups have also employed religious rituals as a means of preventing youth from engaging in pre-marital sexual activities.\nFor example, popular conservative groups Indonesia Tanpa Pacaran (Indonesia Without Dating), promotes early marriage in urging Indonesians to protect themselves from the sin of adultery.\nThe movement also often highlights the risks of dating, and has unsuccessfully tried to advocate the Indonesian Ulema Council to issue a legal pronouncement of dating as haram (forbidden in Islam).\nThere is also no minimum age for marriage if parents apply for the local religious court’s consent – a loophole which persists despite recent change to Indonesian laws.\nNEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION\nSo what can be done to counter these social norms? Earlier this year, the National Population and Family Planning Agency (BKKBN) announced that they plan to include reproductive health education as part of core school curriculum.\nIt has done well so far to focus on factual modules on reproductive health, the risks of sexual behaviours and how these could lead to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), unwanted pregnancies, poverty and violence. \xa0\xa0\nHowever, these programmes lack pertinent information that can help youths understand relationships and the complexities when it comes to abstinence, consent and decision-making about sexual health.\xa0\nThese are themes the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research recommends, in their 2010 framework for action in developing sexual health programmes, to be included in any comprehensive sexual reproductive health education.\xa0\xa0\nInstead, Indonesia\xa0has relied on deterring sexual activity by promoting a fear of STDs.\nPOOR PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING \nThere is an urgent need for comprehensive sexual health education in Indonesia.\nYes, I Do, an international study by five Dutch NGOs conducted in two regions in Indonesia in 2016 reported that pre-marital sex that resulted in teen pregnancy was influenced by limited access to sexual and reproductive health knowledge and services.\nThe study also affirmed that young women have a weaker bargaining position in relationships and that the majority of respondents agree marriage is a solution to unwanted pregnancy among youth, which are problematic findings.\nAnother study, by the WHO and John Hopkins University’s Global Early Adolescent Study, conducted from 2017 to 2018 among adolescents aged 10 to 14 in Indonesia, showed that students in this age bracket have a relatively low knowledge of sexual and reproductive health.\nWhen asked to answer questions related to sexual and reproductive health, only 30 per cent of the respondents from the study could provide correct answers. Despite having limited knowledge of sexual and reproductive health, 50 per cent of youth in the study stated that they have been secretly dating.\nThe presented studies provide empirical evidence that toxic social norms in Indonesia can lead to higher risks for youths.\nGiven existing societal narratives that depict sexuality as taboo, sinful, and negatively affecting youth, it is no wonder adolescents shy away from asking important questions and have limited understanding of sexual and reproductive health.\nSuch narratives might be fuelling alarming actions from parents who struggle with their children’s own coming of age. From January to September 2019, a total of 63 teenagers applied for marriage dispensation to a religious court in the Slawi district in Tegal, Indonesia.\xa0\nSome girls were already pregnant, but there were also cases where parents were worried their children would engage in non-marital sex and thus preferred for them to get married instead.\nPRINCIPLES TO CONSIDER\nWe can no longer ignore the fact that conservative social norms hamper Indonesian youths from having a full understanding of sexuality and consent.\nThe government, educators and supporting organisations should develop strategies to instil a comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education syllabus and a system that provides requisite support for youths.\nIt is also worth for Indonesian authorities to bear in mind four key principles in developing national strategies.\nFirst, acknowledge that sexuality is normal.\xa0That will enable programmes to be tailored according to a child’s developmental cycle without any fear-based messages. Parents, teachers, peers and the community should be involved in providing safe spaces to talk about sexuality.\xa0\nSecond, understand that youths have the right to exercise their sexuality and make their own decisions. But in order to exercise full responsibility over their sexuality, youths must be empowered with a comprehensive understanding of sex and sexuality.\nThis includes not just an understanding of attendant risks of being sexually active but also consent, how to make the right decisions, self-worth, body confidence, and what healthy relationships with the people around them entail.\xa0\nThird, let’s reframe our messages on sex. The evidence shows that sexuality is commonly seen as taboo to most Indonesians, but we also know that framing issues as reproductive health may lead\xa0us to leave out important issues of sexuality and consent, responsibility and respect.\nWork done in this area by non-profit organisations such as Plan Indonesia, Rutgers, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the ARI (Independent Young People Alliance) are encouraging bright spots that\xa0provide youths with language to talk about sex.\nFourth, improve the accessibility of information and services\xa0for youths and their guardians. Information and services should be community-based, so that vulnerable groups of youths that include those who might not go to school have access to this support.\nAccess to information and services should be free, anonymous, non-judgemental, and accessible through various media that youths use. Parents and peers should also be equipped to provide guidance.\nUsing fear-based approaches to preach abstinence will not improve Indonesia’s poor sexual health public awareness.\nLet’s empower Indonesian youths to take charge to become responsible and respectful adults who can make their own decisions instead.\xa0\nMarsha Habib is Communication and Relations Manager at the Center on Child Protection and Wellbeing (PUSKAPA) at Universitas Indonesia.

      Friends from other lands: The unique challenges of international students at one primary school
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: They’re fiercely engrossed in their basketball game, shouts resounding over the canteen recess buzz. “Pass me the ball!” Ibramsa Idris Ahamed, 11, yells to his chubby-cheeked pal, Ahnt Phone Pai.\nThe ball curves into the hoop, and the boys – Idris from India, Phone from Myanmar, Kuo Chi-Yun from Taiwan, and Ng Kian Ping from Singapore – whoop and high-five each other. This group of Primary 5 friends is as spirited, and as international, as the game they’ve bonded over.\n“We’re from different countries, but we focus on the similarities, not differences,” said Kian Ping, 11. “And we respect the differences.”\nAt Farrer Park Primary School, such friendships are not unusual. A small portion of its students hail from across the world: Vietnam, Thailand, China, Russia, even South America, to name a few places.\nThe same is true in a number of Singapore schools today. International students make up about 5 per cent of all pupils in primary and secondary schools and junior colleges, according to the Ministry of Education.\nAnd they’re bringing with them both challenges and opportunities, for their schools and fellow classmates.\xa0\nThis is the story of three of these international students at Farrer Park Primary, and how they’ve become part of the fabric of Singaporean school life.\nWATCH: Meet Chaorui, Alina and\xa0Idris\xa0(10:24)\nWU CHAORUI, 7: STARTED OUT WITH ZERO ENGLISH\nOn school days, it is rare for seven-year-old Wu Chaorui to see her father when the sun is up.\nAfter he drops her off at the school gates at 6.30am, he heads straight for his 12-hour shift as a deliveryman. The next time she sees him, it is usually at the dinner table.\nWu Xiao Jun has worked hard for his family since coming to Singapore in 2000. He brought his wife and son over from China in 2011, but when Chaorui was born here in 2012, she was sent back to be raised by her grandparents in Zhejiang.\n“I couldn’t afford to raise her here,” said Mr Wu, who had to pay non-subsidised rates for her healthcare.\nIt was only in late 2018, when she was ready to start Primary 1, that Mr Wu felt the family’s finances were stable enough to bring her over for her education. (While Singaporeans pay no primary school fees, international students paid S$440 to S$700 a month in 2019.)\nBut Chaorui struggled to adapt to life in Singapore. She missed her grandparents and her many friends in her village school. Her biggest fear was language. “I didn’t want to come to Singapore,” she said hesitantly, in Mandarin. “I don’t know how to speak English.”\nWhen she first came to Farrer Park Primary this year, her knowledge of the English language was, according to her English and Mathematics teacher Tan Jac See, “zero”.\n“She knew very basic words like ‘yes’ or ‘no’, but other than that, she couldn’t speak English at all,” the latter said.\nHELP FROM SCHOOL AND FRIENDS\xa0 \nFor international students from non-English speaking countries, picking up the language is often their biggest hurdle, according to the school’s vice principal Wendy Lee.\n“This is a challenge for them especially in the classroom because they may not be able to understand the teachers,” she said.\nThe school has programmes for students, both local and international, who may need extra help in English. Chaorui, for example, is involved in an after-school learning programme, and she attends the Learning Support Programme (LSP) for those with weak reading skills while her classmates have their regular English lessons.\nBut help is also available from their peers. The school has a care buddy programme where students are appointed to look out for and befriend the newcomers. This, according to Wendy, works better than having a teacher do so instead.\n“The buddy can also introduce them to other friends, and widen their circle,” she said.\nAnd then there’s Chua Hian Boon. The solicitous seven-year-old boy approached Chaorui to make friends one day, and the two have been inseparable ever since.\nThe pair enjoy running around the playground and exploring the school together during recess. Hian Boon talks to her in English, then instinctively repeats himself in Mandarin; or naturally translates for her what other people are saying.\n“I think she is a very quiet person,” he said. “She answers my questions in a very soft volume. But I like her because she always asks me what book to read.”\nHe’s just one of the many children in the class who have, unprompted, rallied around to befriend Chaorui and help get her English up to speed.\n“They help me explain certain instructions in Mandarin to her, and they have always included her,” said teacher Jac See. “When I tell them to find a partner, she’s always be able to find somebody who’ll work with her.”\nPUTTING IN THE WORK\nChaorui’s parents, neither of whom speak much English, send her for English tuition twice a week. At home, she practises with assessment books.\nWhile it might be tough going, the little girl can look to her brother Chaoyi for help and inspiration.\nHe’d come to Singapore eight years ago not knowing English, but picked it up quickly and is now in Secondary 2. Almost every evening, he sits with Chaorui as she reads aloud from flash cards, correcting her patiently when she stumbles and encouraging her when she pronounces a word correctly.\n“She is very hardworking in school, but playful at home,” he said, ruffling her hair as she grinned cheekily.\nAttitude makes all the difference. In LSP class, Chaorui is an enthusiastic student – always the first among the three students to put her hand up as they try to pick out vowels or pronounce words.\nOne of the most difficult words she has learnt recently, she said, is “gardener” – a word she enunciates slowly but with confidence.\n“It is the person who waters the plants,” she added, a note of pride in her soft voice.\nIBRAMSA IDRIS AHAMED, 11: FROM SHY BOY, TO HEAD PREFECT\nIn another room, an 11-year-old who could not be more different stood in front of his class, presenting an eloquent monologue.\n“She pushed me away!” Idris declaimed loudly, with a grimace. “Teenagers on Earth are obviously more dangerous than expected.” With a dramatic flourish, he bowed to his classmates’ applause.\nThe school’s head prefect, he loves an audience. But Idris was not always this self-assured.\nBorn in Tamil Nadu in India, he moved to Singapore in 2009 at the age of one when his father, who was working in Singapore, decided to bring his family over. Mohamed Kasim Ibramsa had hoped his children could get to know the local culture from young.\nIn the first few years, Kasim admitted, “Idris stayed at home mostly. He did not have many friends”. In kindergarten, not knowing much English, a shy five-year-old Idris stuck to a Tamil-speaking friend.\nEventually, though, he pushed himself to learn the language. Said Idris: “My father said, if you do well in English, it will help you in everything. English is in Maths, English is in Science… so that’s the basic you need to learn.”\nMAKING OTHERS FEEL INCLUDED\nAs he got more fluent in English, his confidence grew. By the time he entered Farrer Park in Primary 2, a more outgoing Idris was looking forward to making new friends.\nDeveloping friendships at first can be a challenge for some international students, vice-principal Wendy noted. “The other children around them could be different in terms of skin or hair colour; they may worry that the other children may not accept them.”\nIdris wasn’t one of them.\nIndeed, classmate Chi-Yun remembers how they quickly became friends. “He introduced himself to all of us, and he wasn’t shy like other people,” he said.\nIdris even made it a point to reach out to other newcomers: When Phone, his classmate from Myanmar, joined the school in Primary 4, Idris brought the quiet, bashful boy to the basketball court on his very first day.\n“I thought he was one of those guys that never talks, and I was like… it’s okay, let’s just bring him along and we’ll play with him,” said Idris.\nPhone recalled: “I didn’t know how to play basketball… but then we just played. And we became friends.”\nIdris is all for making people feel included. When he ran for elections and was voted head prefect by the student body, one of the things he promoted was a bully-free culture.\nHe thinks there could be more awareness among students of how some comments or casual jokes can come across as insensitive. “Everybody is human, right? This,” he added, pointing to his heart, “is what matters.”\nA CULTURAL EXCHANGE\nBut Idris does appreciate the chance to share what’s different about his culture with peers who are curious.\xa0\nWhen he has to stay back after school for prefectorial duties, Idris meets his mum at the school’s side gate to pick up a home-cooked lunch of sambar rasam. And he often gets questions when he unpacks this food.\n“Why are you eating this curry?” Phone asked. To which Idris replied, “This isn’t curry, Phone, it’s sambar”, rolling the ‘r’ for dramatic emphasis.\nHe also gets asked why he eats with his hands. Such questions don’t offend him, he said, “because other people learn my culture, and I learn their culture too”.\nIf there’s one thing his parents are concerned about, it’s that he loves his mum’s Indian meals and McDonald’s a little too much. That could be a problem when, like his older brother, he has to serve National Service as a Permanent Resident.\n“My older son suffered in BMT (Basic Military Training) because he didn’t like to eat local food. But now he has learnt to eat a bit of fried rice,” said Kasim. “When Idris goes into the army, he might suffer too.\n“I always tell him to learn (to like) local dishes. Now I will let him learn himself.”\nALINA ADAMENKO, 10: STRADDLING TWO CULTURES\nIn a sea of children in the crowded canteen, Alina Adamenko sticks out as she queues to buy a mantou and Milo.\xa0\nIt’s her long golden hair, which is wound tightly and meticulously into two braids every morning by her mother.\n“Some people say I’m French,” she said, giggling. “I’m like, why doesn’t anyone know? I’m from the biggest country in the world.”\nClose your eyes, and you might think you were listening to a born-and-bred Singaporean. You would be at least partly right.\nAlna was born in Singapore to Russian parents, and has spent all 10 of her years here, only returning to Russia occasionally for holidays.\nIn some ways, Alina is a child of two cultures. While she enjoys the school canteen’s mantou, she also likes the Russian-style dumplings her mother cooks in soup at home.\nLike many of her classmates, she takes Chinese language classes. She is an enthusiastic participant in class, confidently reading out loud and raising her hand repeatedly to answer her teacher’s questions.\nSaid Alina’s father, Mikhail Adamenko: “We had to choose a mother tongue when we put her in a local school, so we chose Chinese.""\xa0His family came from a town in Russia close to the border with China, and he speaks Mandarin himself.\xa0\nBut Alina’s parents want her to stay close to her Russian roots too, even as she embraces local culture. So her\xa0after-school schedule is packed with activities: Chinese tuition, taekwondo, swimming, and Russian language and heritage classes which she attends twice a week.\nShe has learnt a lot about Russian culture, she says, and was proud to wear a Russian traditional costume to school on International Friendship Day.\xa0\nAnd it’s a bit of a thrill when friends ask questions about her country or to learn some simple Russian words. “If they pronounce it wrongly, in my heart I’m like, ‘ha ha ha,” she said jokingly.\nSCHOOLED IN DIVERSITY\nTo her friends, however, she is Alina first, and Russian second. “She’s a normal person,” said Dhara Lakshmi Soumika. “Except that she’s super-duper joyful.”\nFriendships in the school, said vice-principal Wendy, tend to be formed organically. And obvious physical differences like Alina’s hair colour (or even less obvious ones, like one’s birthplace or culture) are easily overlooked.\xa0\nOne reason for this, she added, is their age. “I think as they get older, they may become more aware of the differences,” she said. “But because they are younger, everyone is just another playmate.”\nAnd having international students around who look distinct and come from dissimilar backgrounds can benefit their Singaporean peers. “They become more accepting of diversity,” Wendy said.\n“I think it helps them a lot. It really increases their global awareness, and cross-cultural skills are developed from their interactions with the international students.”\nAs for Alina, she can only stay in Singapore for as long as her father has a job here. But to her, this is home. “I want to stay in Singapore,” she said. “It’s always summer here.”\nBesides, she wants to be near her Singaporean “besties” – Soumika and Nuha Zahra Mohamed Ziauddin. “We will be friends forever,” said Alina, giving Zahra a bear hug. “Until we die.”\nThis story by CNA Insider was done in collaboration with Gov.sg.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Commentary: What I would tell my 12-year-old self about PSLE results
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Twelve-year-old children around Singapore will be\xa0handed a tiny slip of paper today. In many schools, teachers will arrive\xa0early just to pack this into folders or envelopes.\nThis semblance of privacy however is fleeting. Minutes later, the nation will descend into an episode of mass comparison. Friends, neighbours and even distant relatives will ache to uncover your secret “three-digit number”.\nThe Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) sets off a very peculiar cultural phenomenon in Singapore. In most other situations, it is considered rude to openly compare numbers – whether it is a pay slip or bank account figure. This social etiquette does not apply to PSLE scores.\nLike most Singaporeans aged 12 to 70, I can relate to this experience. I remember my own feelings more than two decades ago rather acutely. The pre-assembly bustle was smothered by a pervasive sense of anxiety – regular Straight-A students seemed unusually twitchy.\nAs I collected my results slip, it felt heavy with the “weight of destiny”. During the long bus ride home, I felt strangely displaced and lonely.\nNURTURING MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCE\xa0FOR SUCCESS\nSince PSLE was introduced in 1960, it has become a rite of passage for Singaporeans. It throws youth at the cusp of their teenage years into a frenzy of social comparison, just as they are struggling to build their sense of self and self-worth.\nIf I could go back in time and have a heart-to-heart with my 12-year-old self over a root beer float, I would tell her not to read too much into this three-digit number – that what she held in her hands were examination results, not a yardstick of her intelligence.\nHuman intelligence is multi-faceted. It cannot be fully measured by a series of written tests.\nAmerican developmental psychologist Howard Gardner divided intelligence into nine different types as early as 1983 – way before I sat for PSLE. The four main subjects – English, mother tongue, mathematics and science – only cover three of the nine types of intelligence.\nWithout going into too much jargon, this examination does not account for people smarts, self-awareness, musical talents, spatial intelligence, mind-body coordination and what Gardner calls existential intelligence – the ability to question the meaning of life.\nNone of these add a single digit to PSLE T-scores, but they give\xa0colour and purpose to a passion-driven career.\nSpeaking of passion-driver careers, it is worth noting the Life Beyond Grades movement started last year by five successful entrepreneurs:\xa0Tjin Lee, Dolores Au, Aarika Lee, Derek Ong and Charmaine Seah-Ong.\nUnder the hashtag #LifeBeyondGrades, famous personalities including deejays, actors, and athletes shared their PSLE grades on Instagram.\nAmong them, Royston Tan, an award-winning filmmaker, scored 168; marketing expert and contributing editor of Buro 24/7, Tracy Phillips, scored 226; chef and co-owner of the Michelin-starred restaurant Corner House, Jason Tan, scored 190.\nEach of these personalities have nurtured their talents and gone on to dominate their respective fields, proving that ordinary PSLE scores can lead to extraordinary careers.\nREDEFINING HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS\nAs a freelance writer, I am convinced that acing PSLE examinations is not a prerequisite for a fulfilling life. I admit that I do not have the answers to two out of the three infamously difficult PSLE mathematics problems parents are up in arms about this year.\nThat has not stopped me from building a life I love, meeting inspiring people from all walks of life, and “hot-desking” in front of a pool in Sri Lanka or a fjord in Iceland.\nIf our generation can redefine the boundaries of the office and work itself, I cannot imagine what our children can do. Many will be scientists, creatives, chefs, coders and entrepreneurs in their own time. Some will fill up roles that don’t even exist today, and create things that we cannot yet imagine.\nThey should not feel so defined or diminished by a number on their result slip that it remains their greatest achievement or biggest baggage for years to come.\nIn response to that, the Ministry of Education has announced that it will be replacing T-scores with a grading system similar to the O-Level and A-Level exams. Come 2021, students will no longer feel judged by a number on their results slip.\nThat said, I doubt that this will do what it takes to quell the competitive sport of comparing grades. At least in part, change must come from ground-up and from the home.\nIf as parents, we downplay the significance of PSLE results, and focus on each child’s individuality and unique talents, we could collectively open up a world of possibilities and nurture a spirit of lifelong learning.\nAt this point, I should probably share that my PSLE score was 244 – neither very high nor low. Two of my closest friends at that time however were intensely disappointed with their scores.\nAt the age of 12, I did not have the empathy to ease their sense of loss and failure – that was a skill I developed much later.\nAlthough I subsequently lost contact with one of them, the other has picked herself up from the ashes of “PSLE disaster” to carve a dynamic career in banking and finance. While our PSLE results differed and our paths diverged at many points, she remains my closest friend today and an inspiring role model for my 19-month-old daughter Lily.\nIf I could have a conversation with my 12-year-old self, I would tell her that life is a long winding road – there will inevitably be times when you do better than your friends, and times when they do better than you.\nWithout diminishing its importance as a national examination, PSLE is ultimately a checkpoint, not the endgame.\nYour success and happiness will be measured by your grace and resilience in dealing with the many ups and downs throughout life. How you respond to each triumph or disappointment will shape you as a person, friend and parent.\nThe future, in all its richness and fullness, cannot be defined by a three-digit number.\nAnnie Tan is a freelance writer, and the mother of a spirited one-year-old who fires her imagination and inspires her to find her inner child.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore ', '     education ']}"

He was also hospitalised in a critical condition.\nThe chaos prompted the city\'s education authorities to tell parents earlier on Wednesday they could decide whether to send children to school ""due to traffic and emergencies"", while some international schools remained closed for a second straight day.\nThe education bureau made the decision citing ""traffic and emergency conditions and that some major traffic lines have been seriously affected"", according to a statement on the Hong Kong government\'s website.\n""The bureau stressed that schools should keep their premises open, arrange sufficient manpower as far as possible to take proper care of students who have arrived at school, maintain communication with parents, and allow students to return home only under safe conditions.\n""(Students) must not wander on the streets or go to potentially dangerous places, and should never participate in unlawful activities.""\nThe protest movement has been fuelled by fears that China is choking the liberties and freedoms Hong Kong is meant to have under the terms of the handover deal with the British.\nProtesters are demanding the right to freely elect their leaders.\nTOUGHER RESPONSE\nChina has responded with ominous warnings that it is prepared to further curb freedoms, and that it wants tougher security measures in Hong Kong.\nOn Tuesday the People\'s Daily, the mouthpiece of China\'s ruling Communist Party, warned that local district elections due to be held on Nov\xa024 may be cancelled if the protesters do not back down.\n""Only by supporting the police force to decisively put down the riots can (Hong Kong) return to peace and hold fair elections, to help Hong Kong start again,"" the commentary said.\nOther powerful arms of the Chinese state media have also again raised the prospect this week of the Chinese military being deployed in Hong Kong to end the crisis.\nStill, China is not yet prepared to take such drastic action as military intervention as it plays a longer game of weakening and intimidating the protest movement, according to Ben Bland, Sydney-based director of the Southeast Asia Project at the Lowy Institute, a policy think-tank.\n""It still seems, as far as we can tell, that the most likely response is going to continue to be led by the Hong Kong authorities and the Hong Kong police,"" Bland told AFP on Wednesday.\nBut the events this week have deepened concerns that Hong Kong\'s police cannot solve the crisis, and that a political solution must be found.\nThe police force\'s spokesman, Kong Wing-cheung, appeared to echo those fears on Tuesday.\n""Hong Kong\'s rule of law has been pushed to the brink of total collapse,"" he said.\nFollow us on Telegram for the latest on Hong Kong: https://cna.asia/telegram\n', 'related_topics': ['     Hong Kong protests ', '     Hong Kong ', '     education ']}"

      This mother-of-three wants to improve early childhood education in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'It should come as no surprise that parents who are trying to figure out the best way to prepare their children for the future are also acutely aware of the modern world’s ever-accelerating pace of change. And Elaine Kim – mother to three boys aged eight, six and two – is no exception.\nThe result of her desire to improve early childhood education is just a stone’s throw away from our photo shoot location at\xa0Raffles Hotel Singapore.\nOver at the nearby Funan mall,\xa0Trehaus, a business co-founded by Elaine in 2016, started out as a\xa0co-working space with childcare services\xa0and was partly inspired by her experience as a working mum.\n\n\n“Spending time with my children was so precious to me, and I wanted to create a space where you could work and still have your children in your life,” she said.\nNow relocated to Funan from its former Orchard Road location, Trehaus still has workspaces and a curated playspace to encourage quality family bonding time. It has also introduced its latest innovation, Trehaus School. This Silicon Valley-inspired preschool and childcare focuses not just on imparting academic knowledge, but also aims to help young children acquire useful skills and inculcate character-building values.\n“All my children attended top preschool programmes, and I felt none of these really prepared them well,” Kim said candidly.\n“Things in this sector have not changed for decades. But grades are not the only thing that matter. Soft skills and character, these are very important to me. We want to bring up kids who don’t just think about what they want to do when they grow up, but how they can make the world better. We want to raise change-makers.”\n\n\nThe eldest of two children born to doctor Ben\xa0Neo and member of parliament Lily\xa0Neo, Elaine was raised to remember that “in everything we do, we should think about how to make a positive impact for others”, she said.\xa0“My parents do that in their lives and work, and that\xa0strong belief has guided all the things I do.” It influenced her choice of specialising in palliative care as a\xa0doctor, and is also the reason she co-founded\xa0Crib, a social enterprise\xa0that aims to\xa0empower female\xa0entrepreneurs.\nThis non-profit’s philanthropic arm, Crib\xa0Gives\xa0Back, raises funds for organisations such as EmancipAction, which aids victims of sex trafficking; as well as Operation\xa0Hope Foundation, which helps the underprivileged in developing countries. Crib Gives\xa0Back collaborated with the latter on Holiday For Hope, a signature initiative that saw\xa0donors travelling to Cambodia in 2018\xa0to distribute necessities to communities in need. Kim brought her boys with her on the trip, and “it’s been so meaningful to me to be able to involve them, and help them see how we can try to make a\xa0difference”.\nThe next\xa0Holiday for Hope trip to Nepal takes place in November, and participants will help communities still recovering from the 2015 earthquake.\nIn the meantime, Elaine hopes that Trehaus School’s forward-thinking, future-proofing model will flourish in Singapore, and perhaps even expand beyond these shores.\n“We hope to bring this to as many people as we can. An education system that teaches the right values and skills that prepare children for the future – that’s the kind of impact that will last for generations.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     children ', '     Singapore ']}"

      Commentary: Here’s what’s wrong with a homework curfew
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Recent news of the Chinese government considering a 9pm and 10pm homework curfew for primary and secondary schoolchildren respectively has sparked a huge debate about the country’s education system in the country.\nConsidering the heavy workload that Chinese children have, coupled with endless enrichment activities, it isn’t difficult to see why the Chinese government would feel a need to step in.\nIt may be hard to imagine that such a practice be imposed in Singapore, but one can never rule out the possibility.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nThinking about it worries me, as it does not appear to be focusing on the right problem.\nInstead of legislating the time kids should go to bed, should it ever come down to that situation, we should be asking ourselves, how did childhood get so hectic in the first place?\nAre children being ferried from class to class, and only able to do their homework after dinner?\nAre parents busy making ends meet and only able to coach their kids after hours?\nIn this context, a homework curfew may be a sledgehammer but does not solve any of the underlying problems when a child has to do homework late into the night.\nTACKLE THE PROBLEM OF TOO MUCH HOMEWORK\nFirst, it’s worth tackling the problem of too much homework head on.\nSingaporean students aged 15 clocked the third-longest time spent on homework, at 9.4 hours a week, according to an OECD survey conducted in 2012, which is the latest survey on the subject. They are behind students in Shanghai (13.8 hours) and Russia (9.7 hours).\nIs the homework load in Singapore that unmanageable? Not really.\nMy Primary Four daughter occasionally gets a heavy workload which may take her two hours to complete but this thankfully occurs only once or twice a month. Most days, she’s in bed by 8.30pm.\nIn this, educators play a key role. In my daughter’s school, teachers try to coordinate homework load to avoid overloading on any given day.\nThis helps ensure that homework does not morph into a mountain that students have to chip away at. (That is, unless the various tuition classes are adding to the load.)\nSecond, instead of imposing a curfew, parents should refrain from packing their kids schedules.\nWe made a conscious choice to keep tuition for our daughter to a minimum (1.5 hours a week), and reserve her weekday afternoons for schoolwork, revision and free play. She also goes for violin and art lessons, interests she chose for herself.\nEven then\xa0although she seems to have a balanced schedule, we still pick up heightened stress signals over weekends when she has a test looming or Chinese spelling to prepare for.\nSo even what a parent thinks is a sensible lifestyle may not be one for a child.\nThere is no hard-and-fast rules that can be applied to every child. A high ability and energetic child may crave greater levels of intellectual stimulation or physical activity.\nFor a parent to know when it is too much, we must tune in to the child’s emotions, and provide a safe space for them to voice out.\nEMPOWER CHILDREN TO EXERCISE AGENCY OVER THEIR SCHOOL LOAD\nThird, are children imbued with a sense of agency and ownership over their schoolwork?\nDo they have sensible work habits?\xa0 Or do they count on parents to nag at them before opening up assignments?\nParents know two children of equal ability can achieve very different test scores because of work habits.\nOne may procrastinate and distract himself with gadgets and other less urgent tasks, while the other is organised and has advanced planning skills so he knows exactly what needs to get done when.\nSo do we instill in our children that homework is their responsibility, and that how long they take to complete tasks is something they must be aware of and plan accordingly?\nOr do we allow them to abdicate accountability and carry the weight of the homework responsibility ourselves as parents?\nLittle do we know that the more we worry, the less the child is bothered. But if we spend the first two years of formal education instilling good work habits in our children, the chances of homework battles will be markedly reduced.\nA better solution is to establish a homework routine, and use visual cues to remind the child, for example, a homework chart placed above the study desk they can tick off daily.\nAfter homework is completed, the child gets to choose their next preferred activity, be it reading a book or playing with his mates.\nIf your child is struggling with some hard concepts, try asking how they want to receive help. Maybe a few sessions with his teacher would suffice, or he could message a friend.\nWhere both parents work late, try finding other options for homework help, such as a reliable student care, a nearby tuition centre that offers a space for students to study outside classroom hours or even a trusted neighbour.\nWHAT A DISCIPLINED LIFE REALLY LOOKS LIKE\nFourth, some parents have argued kids need to keep up their academic rigour and stay ahead of the competition, so they put in the hours.\nIn their minds, discipline is why kids stay up late to do homework, which is a healthy inclination to be encouraged.\nBut arguably, such discipline should also apply to other areas of life. A child needs a balanced life, which includes nutrition, work, rest, and play to be at his best.\nIf they prefer downtime in the afternoons and can cope with homework later, this could be their optimal rhythm.\nBut if bedtime gets pushed to the point where the child cannot concentrate the next day, it may create a vicious cycle where schoolwork gets harder when the child isn’t able to absorb during lessons.\nSHOOT FOR BALANCE\nThe pressure to achieve in this modern age is ever-constant, but so is the need to reflect and change.\nWe all want our kids to succeed, but the science is telling us that we’ve been focusing on the wrong things.\nAs guardians of our children’s well-being, we need to switch gears to avoid raising a generation of burnt out youths.\xa0Instead of aiming for achievement, we should aim for balance, agency\xa0and\xa0self-discipline. The achievement will follow.\nWe must not get into a situation where we have to resort to curfews.\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     school ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: What Nadiem Makarim brings to the table as education and culture minister
  </h1>, 'text': ""SURABAYA: President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has announced the appointment of\xa0Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim as the new Minister for Education and Culture.\nNadiem’s appointment has surprised many. For the first time in Indonesia’s history, a sitting president has recruited an entrepreneur focused\xa0on digital ventures for a ministerial position.\nJokowi, who has a background in the furniture business in his hometown Solo, Central Java, has always tried to involve entrepreneurs in his administration.\xa0\nThis can be seen from his decision in appointing Susi Pudjiastuti as Minister of Marine Affairs and Fisheries under Jokowi’s first term presidency. Prior to her role as minister, Susi owned businesses in the fisheries and airline industries.\xa0\nInvolving business people and entrepreneurs may be part of an effort on Jokowi’s part\xa0to improve his government by streamlining Indonesia’s notorious bureaucracy.\nBy appointing Nadiem, who is widely\xa0considered an innovative and creative business leader, Jokowi seems eager to improve\xa0Indonesia’s education system, which has racked up complaints of being\xa0too bureaucratic and outdated.\nBUT WHY NADIEM?\nNadiem founded app-based transportation service Gojek back in 2010. Under his leadership, Gojek grew to become one of Indonesia’s biggest start-ups with an estimated value of at least US$10 billion.\nThe appointment of this 35-year old Harvard alumni can hopefully provide some fresh energy to Jokowi's efforts to\xa0revitalise Indonesia’s education system, which has been stymied by bureaucracy.\nIndonesia’s education system is the world’s fourth largest, but\xa0quality is lacking.\xa0The latest PISA report shows that Indonesia is among the 10 worst performing nations in terms of education. It has been ranked lower than Mexico, Columbia and Thailand.\nOne of the greatest challenges facing Indonesian education is its overlapping regulations. Lecturers also\xa0face stringent administration procedures that hold them back from focusing on\xa0carrying out their academic duties.\nNadiem’s presence can hopefully bring much needed innovation and drive new solutions not yet\xa0explored.\nHis experience in information and technology is also extremely useful in designing and adopting new digital systems, an area which Indonesia's academic institutions lag behind compared to many other educational systems.\nNadiem’s entrepreneurial traits in digital business – shown by his risk-taking attitude and willingness to collaborate – can also contribute to developing an education system that generates high-quality and innovative research that tackles\xa0Indonesia’s most pressing issues.\nWith his success in expanding Gojek’s operations to Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines, high hopes rest on Nadiem’s shoulders to take advantage of his vast international network and apply those contacts to improve conditions at home.\nMany hope that Nadiem, who was recognised as an “Asian of the Year” in 2016 by the Straits Times given his contributions to\xa0improving the lives of many in Indonesia and the wider Asian region, will\xa0bring this\xa0same energy to\xa0empower\xa0teachers and improve their welfare, especially those who are contract-based.\nA LOOK AT OTHER BUSINESS LEADERS APPOINTED TO HELM MINISTRIES\nHowever, in the history of Indonesia’s bureaucracy, most business leaders and entrepreneurs recruited as ministers\xa0do not stay long in the administration.\nSome ministers with a background in business have not\xa0continued with\xa0their role in subsequent terms.\nThe closest example is former minister of marine affairs and fisheries Susi Pudjiastuti, who now no longer serves in Jokowi’s second-term cabinet.\nMedia tycoon Dahlan Iskan, who was appointed state-owned enterprises minister when Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was president,\xa0only served for two years.\nOwner of electronics corporation National Gobel Group\xa0Rachmat Gobel only served for one year as trade minister\xa0under Jokowi.\nThe reason these business people don’t assume their positions for long might be because their entrepreneurial attitude clashed with the Indonesian government’s notorious culture of bureaucracy.\nHow long will Nadiem endure under Jokowi’s second term?\xa0I guess we’ll see.\nFreddy H Istanto is a lecturer at the Faculty of Creative Industries, Ciputra University.

      Commentary: Should parents help their kids with homework?
  </h1>, 'text': 'NORMAN, Oklahoma: Schools across the world have generally encourage parents to help their children with homework.\nParents are listening. Helping with homework is one of the most common things that parents say they do to support their children’s learning.\nMany experts have found that helping with homework cultivates positive learning behaviours, reinforces class material and signals to children that their education is important. The US Department of Education says that parents play an important role in their children’s learning when they help with homework.\nYet parents often hear through the media that helping with homework may not be worth it.\nAfter seeing headlines such as “Why It’s So Important You Never Help Your Kids With Their Homework” and “Don’t Help Your Kids With Their Homework,” moms, dads and other caregivers can be left wondering whether they should even bother.\nCAUSE OR CONSEQUENCE?\nThe basis for claims that parental help with homework can be bad for students comes from research examining national surveys. These studies find that frequent homework help from parents is associated with lower test scores.\nBut this finding does not necessarily mean that moms and dads do harm when they help with homework.\xa0\nWhen children are struggling in school, parents may step in to help more often. That is, frequent homework help from parents might not be the cause of problems, but rather, coincide with them.\nMy colleague and I wanted to see if this was the case.\nTo find out, we studied data from an important nationally representative survey administered by the US government – the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. We found that low-achieving children were far more likely to receive frequent homework help from parents.\nAnd importantly, after we factored in children’s achievement levels, help with homework from parents was no longer associated with lower test scores.\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\nWhile this finding was insightful, we figured that the effect of homework help from parents on student achievement might also be influenced by many other characteristics.\nSo we used a statistical technique that would account for many overlapping factors, such as how well parents and their children get along, the number of siblings, and behaviour at school.\nOur results also indicated that children with low test scores benefited the most when their parents frequently helped with homework.\nIn other words, calls for all parents to stop helping with homework could end up hurting some children.\nIn addition, one common concern is that only affluent and highly educated parents have the time and resources to help their children with homework regularly. We find little evidence to support this presumption.\nOn national surveys, low-income and minority families report helping their children with homework frequently. And this was also true in our study.\nQUALITY COUNTS\nIt is important to point out that our study looked at the frequency of homework help from parents. However, evidence suggests that the quality of homework help also matters.\nParents can make a difference through warm encouragement,\xa0a positive outlook and by communicating high expectations to children.\nThe effectiveness of homework help also seems to increase when parents foster independent learning behaviours. When helping with homework, parents should avoid trying to control the process and should also resist the temptation to complete assignments for their kids.\nInstead, they should let their children figure out answers on their own while offering helpful hints and positive feedback as needed.\nAlthough parents should always consider their child’s individual learning needs, researchers say that parents should gradually reduce homework help as their children grow older, probably phasing out direct assistance with homework by the time their children reach their teenagehood.\nParents can also seek advice from teachers and other school staff on how to make homework support engaging and attuned to their child’s learning needs.\nBlanket statements about whether homework help is simply good or bad can be misleading. Under the right circumstances, parents can help their kids learn more when they help with homework.\nDaniel Hamlin is Assistant Professor of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, University of Oklahoma.

      We’ve shortlisted 10 of the best local and international preschools in Singapore
  </h1>, 'text': 'Preschool education sets the foundation for your child’s development in the later years, so it’s important to pick the right school from the get-go. But how do you pick the one for your child? We shortlisted 10 of the best preschools and kindergartens for your children, based on curriculum, facilities and that special X-factor.\n1. BLUE HOUSE NURSERY & INTERNATIONAL PRESCHOOL\nCURRICULUM: The perfect place for curious tots to flex their imagination and artistic abilities, Blue House values the importance of creating an environment for children to be independent learners. It follows the child-directed Reggio Emilia approach that kids learn best from hands-on experiences and relationships with others. Classes include messy play, drama, art and music, and\xa0are catered for children aged 18 months right up to six\xa0years.\nAll through the campus, the use of space, light and colour, attention to detail, and emphasis on nature and aesthetics, play a crucial role in the child’s development, which is why the surrounding environment is often referred to as the third\xa0teacher.\nBlue House also recognises the importance of art and ensures the children have access to art supplies at all times and regular sessions with the school’s resident\xa0artists.\nCAMPUS: Enjoy a morning cuppa with your little one at The Pantry, or head to the\xa0indoor and outdoor Ateliers and Piazzas for immersive parent-child experiences. Available at both campuses at Turf City and UE Square, the Infant & Toddler Atelier provides a conducive environment for little ones to exercise their senses and build vital connections. These areas are filled with colourful, interactive displays – from foam dunes to a noodle curtain – that look like they should be in a\xa0museum!\nCOMPETITIVE EDGE: Aside from regular classes, Blue House also offers drop-in sessions where you can swing by for play sessions with your child any day of the\xa0week.\nBlue House Nursery & International Preschool\n2.

The newest and largest campus is the River Valley branch, which features a double-storey open loft concept with spacious classrooms, a naturally-lit dining area and indoor playground.\nCOMPETITIVE EDGE: Parents appreciate the low student-to-teacher ratio – 1:6 for pre-nursery and 1:14 for kindergarten, and enrichment programmes offered after school hours. These include activities such as speech and drama, music appreciation, computer literacy and educational games. There is also an Intensive Chinese Immersion Programme conducted in a strictly Mandarin-speaking environment that combines comprehensive study materials and fun\xa0activities to get kids to appreciate the language.\nBrighton Montessori\n3. CHILTERN HOUSE \nCURRICULUM: Founded by the late early childhood educator, Julia Gabriel, Chiltern House is Singapore Preschool Accreditation Framework (SPARK) certified and offers half- and full-day programmes from pre-nursery to Kindergarten 2.\nThe curriculum – covering mathematics, science, language and literacy, Mandarin, art and craft, speech and drama, music, computer literacy and physical education – prepares your child for primary school.\nThe full-day programme also includes a Chinese cultural arts programme, creative writing and a project-based programme. The latter expands children’s understanding of the world around them by enabling them to be actively involved in exploring topics such as the solar system or even looking after pets.\nCAMPUS:\xa0If your little one loves the outdoors, Chiltern House Turf Club is the perfect campus. Tucked away from Bukit Timah’s busy main road, the school is housed in a quaint mansion surrounded by a sprawling garden and outdoor playground to encourage exploration.\nCOMPETITIVE EDGE: Chiltern House organises visits by specialist teachers from Julia Gabriel Centre to conduct weekly speech, drama and music sessions.\nChiltern House\n\n\n4.

PAT’S SCHOOLHOUSE\nCURRICULUM: This 30-year-old school developed its proprietary award-winning curriculum – a “teacher-facilitated, child-guided inquiry approach” to support children’s holistic development. It focuses on play-based learning, rather than just academics. Pat’s Schoolhouse has 16 preschools for kids aged 18 months to six years old, and three infant care centres for babies from two months old.\nCAMPUS: The branch at Kovan deserves special mention.

STAMFORD AMERICAN EARLY LEARNING VILLAGE\nCURRICULUM: The Early Learning Village\xa0(ELV) welcomes children from two months to six years old. While classrooms are inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach, Stamford American’s early learning curriculum is guided by the USA Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework, which focuses on child-initiated and teacher-guided experiences to enhance language development, social competence, imagination, and thinking skills.\nCAMPUS:\xa0The largest purpose-built preschool facility in the world at 50,000 sqm, with a capacity for 2,100 children, ELV is a treasure trove of incredible facilities such as a 20m indoor swimming pool, library and inquiry centre, outdoor play zones, multi-purpose indoor gym, and parents’ cafe.\xa0\nSpecial effort has been made to ensure that the campus remains a cosy and intimate place for the students, despite its size.

      Yale-NUS course: Schools should not be misused for partisan politics, says Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Education institutions should not be misused as platforms for partisan politics, said Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung in Parliament on Monday (Oct 7).\nHe was addressing questions from Members of Parliament (MPs) about the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) stand on the cancellation of a controversial programme at Yale-NUS College in September, titled Dialogue and Dissent in Singapore.\n""Academic freedom cannot be carte blanche for anyone to misuse an academic institution for political advocacy, for this would undermine the institution’s academic standards and public standing,"" Mr Ong said.\nThe course was part of the curriculum for first-year students at the liberal arts college and was to have been led by Singapore playwright Alfian Sa\'at. The week-long programme, formerly titled Dissent and Resistance in Singapore, was cancelled on Sep 13, two weeks before it was due to start.\nYale University has released a report that\xa0said the cancellation of the course was justified due to concerns about the academic rigour, the legal risk to students and the political balance, but Mr Alfian has disputed the report\xa0in a series of Facebook posts.\nMr Ong said some argue that academic freedom grants universities the licence to run such programmes, and a few may claim that dissent is good for democracies and ""hence so is teaching students to become dissidents"".\n""I much prefer the test of an ordinary Singaporean exercising common sense. He would readily conclude that taking into consideration all the elements and all the personalities involved, this is a programme that was filled with motives and objectives other than learning and education,"" he said.\n“And MOE’s stand is that we cannot have such activity in our schools or institutes of higher learning. Political conscientisation is not the taxpayer’s idea of what education means.""\nSPEAKERS CONVICTED OF PUBLIC-ORDER OFFENCES\nAside from a\xa0placard-making workshop and visit to Speakers’ Corner, the programme included dialogues with Mr Jolovan Wham and Mr Seelan Palay, who have both been convicted of public order-related offences, said Mr Ong.\nTalks with Ms Kirsten Han and Dr PJ\xa0Thum, founders of New Naratif, were also part of the curriculum.\xa0\nMr Ong said: “These individuals responsible for the programme are entitled to their views and feelings about Singapore. They can write about them, even vent them on social media, and even gain a following.\xa0\n“But we have to decide whether we allow such forms of political resistance free rein in our educational institutions, and even taught as compulsory, credit-bearing courses or programmes.""\nMr Ong also said that Mr Alfian wrote a poem in 1998 titled Singapore You Are Not My Country.\n""This is a poem, and we might concede some artistic licence. But Mr Alfian Sa’at continues this attitude consistently in his activism,"" said Mr Ong.\nMr Alfian saw his project as ""political conscientisation"" which is aimed at making people conscious of and take action against\xa0the oppression in their lives, he said.\nHe added that\xa0academic institutions should not undertake activities that expose their students to the risk of breaking the law.\n“They should not work with speakers and instructors who have been convicted of public order-related offences, or who are working with political advocacy groups funded by foreigners, or who show openly, disloyalty to Singapore.""\nLater on Monday, Alfian Sa\'at responded to reports of the claims made\xa0about him in Parliament.\nHe said he has\xa0not used the word ""conscientisation"" in any description of the programme.\xa0\n""I have only used the word \'conscientisation\'\xa0in reference to what I observe as a political awakening among students, in a post made three\xa0weeks after the programme was cancelled. So it’s not accurate to say that this was how I saw the project,"" he said.\nACADEMIC FREEDOM VALUED\nMr Ong also highlighted that MOE and the autonomous universities value academic freedom and that political dissent is a legitimate topic of academic inquiry.\xa0\nAdding that many students read and assess works by figures like Lenin and Mao Zedong, he said: “It would also be valuable for students in the social sciences to examine critically present day issues, such as the causes and implications of protests against climate change or globalisation, or the demonstrations currently happening in Hong Kong.\xa0\n“Students can and should also discuss the implications of such political developments for a small country like Singapore.""\nA liberal arts school like Yale-NUS has\xa0a place in the Singapore education landscape, he stated.\n""In fact, in all our autonomous universities, there is an increasing focus on interdisciplinary learning and development of critical thinking skills in students,” he added.\xa0\n“But thinking critically is quite different from being unthinkingly critical, and any course offered by our autonomous universities must be up to mark. Otherwise it does not deserve to be part of a liberal arts programme.""\nDr Intan Azura Mokhtar questioned if MOE will be exercising ""greater scrutiny""\xa0over Yale-NUS, its programmes and lecturers.\xa0\n“The withdrawal of this project does not affect the partnership, I think the standard of this project is so far off the mark that both sides agree there\'s no implications on academic freedom,"" Mr Ong replied.\nSUITABILITY OF TEACHERS AND INSTRUCTORS\nIn response to Mr Ong’s concerns on the instructors connected to the Yale-NUS course, Nominated MP\xa0Walter Theseira asked if there should be a blacklist of individuals that autonomous universities should not engage, expressing concerns that universities would ""overreact and put individuals on the list when they should not be”.\nMr Ong said that a blacklist would not be practical.\n“We have to leave a lot of room for educational institutions to decide for themselves, and whether a person is suitable to be a teacher or instructor at all, I think that is a relevant consideration,” he said.\nElaborating, Mr Ong said that activism among faculty is actually ""quite encouraged"", but\xa0political activism and teaching should not be conflated:\xa0“As long as they are kept separate, there’s actually no problem.""\nMP Seah Kian Peng called for more local academics than foreign ones, to ""calibrate a right balance"", and asked Mr Ong if\xa0guidelines will be put in place to address this.\nMr Ong said MOE is taking various steps to encourage more local academics to join universities here, to ""make sure we have a strong local core"".\n“But apart from that, on the issue of understanding Singapore’s context, and teaching and doing research within our context, I would say that it is not just for locals,"" he said.\xa0\n""A foreign faculty can also acquire that sensitivity to our context. So I will say it is not so much a local versus foreign issue – but I think all our academics and institutions will have to understand Singapore’s context and operate within it.""\nEditor\'s Note: This article has been updated to remove a quote that was not said by Mr Ong Ye Kung.

      Parents: Here's how to select the best preschool in Singapore for your kids
  </h1>, 'text': 'No longer do preschools have teacher-led, cookie-cutter curriculums. Instead, there is a wide array of different award-winning pedagogies, language immersion programmes, beautifully-designed campuses, first-class amenities... the list goes on. With so many options – and with each institution offering varying and unique features – how do you pick the one?\nHow do you even begin to choose? To\xa0help us, we asked two experts for advice.\nDr Elaine Kim is the co-founder of\xa0Trehaus School – a Silicon Valley-inspired preschool in the heart of the CBD – which launched in August, revolutionising how\xa0parents and children can seamlessly work and play under one roof. With this modern approach to school-work-life balance, Trehaus School is set to pave the way for a new generation of top preschools in Singapore.\nAccording to Dr Kim, the top priority when choosing a preschool would be picking a place where your child will be the happiest. “Academics are important, but your child has a lifetime of formal learning ahead of them. Preschool should be a joyous\xa0place where he or she learns to love\xa0school and makes happy memories with you,” she affirmed.\nKelly Hor is the director of schools for\xa0Odyssey The Global Preschool, a\xa0prestigious IB-certified institution\xa0backed by Reggio Emilia practices. In her opinion, having a melting pot of cultures is the most ideal situation as it “helps children develop an in-depth understanding of intercultural differences and international mindedness – essential skills for little ones to thrive as learners not just in the local learning environment, but globally as well.”\nAlthough there are many factors to note when it comes to narrowing your choices, there are six key essentials in determining the best preschool for your child. And, it starts with you, the parent.\n“Academics are important, but your child has a lifetime of formal learning ahead of them. Preschool should be a joyous\xa0place where he or she learns to love\xa0school and makes happy memories with you.” – Dr Elaine Kim\n\n\nKNOW YOUR CHILD, KNOW YOURSELF\nBefore researching schools, spend some time thinking about your child. What kind of environment does he or she thrive in? Does your child need more structure or more freedom? In what areas would you like to see the most growth? Thinking about your child’s personality will help you recognise that the school which everyone else is raving about might not actually serve the needs of your little one.\nAs a parent, you may also have opinions about the way you want your child to be educated. For instance, is the centre more focused on play or academics? If you’re academic-oriented, a school that doesn’t give homework isn’t the right one. So do make sure the school’s philosophy, beliefs and values are aligned with yours.\nFIND THE CURRICULUM THAT WORKS FOR YOUR CHILD\nThere’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all curriculum, even in early learning. For you to decide which curriculum works best for your child, pay a visit to the centre with Junior and see for yourself if he or she feels comfortable in class.\nWhile established institutions such as\xa0Odyssey The Global Preschool\xa0bank on proven pedagogies like the Reggio Emilia method, where children are empowered through a child-directed learning approach, Trehaus School draws inspiration from a gamut of methodologies that include Montessori, Reggio Emilia, Ecological Systems, RIE, and Somatics.\n“In this changing world, parents increasingly recognise that education also needs to change accordingly to meet a future where more than 50 per cent of the jobs that exist tomorrow don’t exist today,” said Dr Kim. “The debate of each pedagogy holds its pros and cons, and that is why we have extracted the best elements of each to help us curate our very own project-based curriculum and framework. Our curriculum writers are not only from the education field, they are from all walks of life and backgrounds – tech engineers, psychologists, doctors, artists, music producers and entrepreneurs – providing a diverse perspective that lends a breadth of skillset teaching to the curriculum.”\nGREAT TEACHERS ARE HALF THE BATTLE WON\nIt goes without saying that teachers make up the heart of the school, so it’s important that you find a caring and dedicated educator who is qualified and well-trained. “In Singapore, parents are quite fortunate in that the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) regulates the industry quite stringently; all teachers must possess relevant qualifications, centres must satisfy guidelines on matters such as staff-child ratios, and there is the accreditation system, SPARK (Singapore Pre-school Accreditation Framework), for preschools,” explained Hor.\n\n\nA LOW TEACHER-STUDENT RATIO FOR THE WIN \nChildren are individuals with different learning preferences, talents and characters. To meet your little one’s needs, it is crucial to find a school that offers small class sizes and low teacher-student ratios. At Trehaus School, the ratio is at a very low 1:5.\nThis enables the teacher to foster the child’s individuality and potential rather than just a cookie-cutter, top-down style of class management,” explained Dr Kim.\nAN EFFECTIVE CLASSROOM SET-UP\nWith both Trehaus School and Odyssey The Global Preschool, the bar is set very high in terms of classroom infrastructure. Hor believes in the principle of the environment as the “third teacher” in effectively supporting children’s learning and growth. “Classrooms for toddlers should not be overly cluttered with furniture and materials. There should be clearly defined pathways and ample floor space for play, interaction and movement, which would encourage them to explore and investigate their environment,” she added.\nTrehaus School at Funan\xa0takes a different approach with open-plan classrooms designed like little villages complete with supply stores and a bank to draw Trehaus currency. The kids also have access to an indoor playground sandpit, beach house and rock wall, as well as an outdoor edible garden and futsal court. More importantly, there’s a business centre and cafe within the Trehaus space for parents to co-work at while their little ones are in school.\nThe biggest thing to remember is that it’s more important to follow your child’s lead than to follow the crowd. Ask yourself: Does your child look happy being there? Do you hear laughter from the other children? Can you feel the warmth of the staff and a sense of community?

      Chin Swee Road toddler death, haze and cancelled Yale-NUS course on Parliament agenda
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The discovery of a toddler’s body in a Chin Swee Road flat, transboundary haze and the cancellation of a controversial Yale-NUS course will be discussed when Members of Parliament (MPs) meet on Monday (Oct 7).\nEight Bills will also be introduced during the sitting. Two Bills, including the amendment on the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill, are set for a second reading.\nLast month, a couple was charged with killing their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter in March 2014. Her remains were discovered inside a flat in Chin Swee Road on Sep 10 this year.\nMPs asked why government agencies and social services were unaware that the child had been missing for five years and if there are measures\xa0to help such children in troubled families.\nConcerns over the haze situation were also raised by some MPs.\xa0\nIn September, the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) crossed into the Unhealthy range for the first time in three years as forest fires raged in parts of Indonesia.\nMP Cheng Li Hui wanted to know if measures are in place at hospitals and nursing homes to help protect patients from the haze, while\xa0Non-Constituency MP Daniel Goh asked if all public hospital wards should be air-conditioned and fitted with air purification filters.\nThe recent cancellation of a controversial\xa0Yale-NUS course on ""Dissent and Dialogue"" will be discussed as well.\nThe course, part of the curriculum for first-year students at the college, was cancelled two weeks before it was due to start.\xa0\nThe college said it found that the proposed activities for the course, which included a ""simulated"" protest,\xa0would have put students at risk of breaking the law.\nMP Intan Azura Mokhtar asked\xa0if the cancellation signals a more controlled and rigid environment in educational institutes, while Nominated MP Anthea Ong asked if the Ministry of Home Affairs has guidelines for\xa0academic institutions on such legal risks.\nQuestions relating to the ban on personal mobility devices (PMDs) were\xa0also raised. Last month, PMDs were banned from void decks and all common areas of housing estates run by the PAP town councils. Those who violate this will face a fine of up to S$5,000.\nMP Alex Yam asked how public feedback on the ban has been so far, and if the number of reported incidents has reduced since implementation.\nMeanwhile, MP Lim Biow Chuan asked\xa0about the estimated cost of the Land Transport Authority’s early disposal incentive for e-scooters that do not meet the UL2272 fire safety standard.\nAlso on the agenda are questions relating to the implications of the recent disruption on Saudi Arabia’s oil supply on Singapore and the recent detentions of three foreign domestic workers under the Internal Security Act.\nSet for a second reading on Monday are two Bills: the Income Tax Bill and the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill.\nThe proposed changes to the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill address the impact of social media and foreign influence.\xa0\nThis includes the expansion of the restraining order to require individuals who post inflammatory content to take down the posts, as well as a proposal that key leaders in religious organisations be Singaporean or permanent residents.\n', 'related_topics': ['     parliament ', '     crime ', '     education ']}"

      No government interference in decision to cancel Yale-NUS module: Yale president
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The decision to cancel a Yale-NUS module titled Dialogue and Dissent in Singapore was made ""internally and without government interference"", president of Yale University Peter Salovey said on Sunday (Sep 29).\nA fact-finding mission by\xa0Yale University’s vice-president Professor Pericles Lewis concluded that the college had made a number of administrative errors but ""the evidence does not suggest any violations of academic freedom or open inquiry"". His report was made public on Sunday.\nThe cancelled course\xa0was formerly\xa0part of the curriculum for first-year students at the liberal arts college and was to have been led by Singapore playwright Alfian Sa\'at.\nThe week-long programme was cancelled on Sep 13, two weeks before it was due to start.\nIn his fact-finding between Sep 19 to Sep 21, Prof Lewis met at least 25 people involved, including\xa0Yale-NUS College president Tan Tai Yong and would-be module instructor Mr\xa0Alfian.\nProf Lewis, who is\xa0Yale-NUS\'s founding president,\xa0noted that three\xa0main concerns about the proposed module were emphasised:\xa0Its academic rigour, the legal risk to students due to\xa0a ""simulated"" protest\xa0and the political balance of the syllabus.\nLEGAL RISK TO STUDENTS\nOne of the main reasons given for the course cancellation was the inclusion of a protest sign-making workshop followed by a ""simulation"" of a protest at\xa0Hong Lim Park.\nProtest by Singaporeans in the park is permitted in certain circumstances, but is illegal for foreign students.\xa0\nNine of the 16 students assigned to the module were international students, and participation could have exposed them to sanctions and endangered their visa status, the report said.\nThe curriculum committee did not receive timely assurance from Mr Alfian that he understood the risks involved, or that he would mitigate them,\xa0Prof Lewis said.\n""The instructor confirmed to me in conversation that he had not found a satisfactory way to include international students in his plan,"" he added.\nBefore cancelling the course,\xa0Prof Tan had reached out to a Ministry of Education official to see if the ministry could intervene with police so students would not be arrested if they went to Hong Lim Park but\xa0the official said she did not have authority over the police.\nLACK OF ACADEMIC RIGOUR\nThe curriculum committee also found that the instructor, while an accomplished playwright, did not have academic expertise in the area of the proposed module.\xa0\nThe faculty felt that\xa0the proposed syllabus\xa0sacrificed academic rigour to “emotive” activism.\n""They felt that the module did not propose to study activism so much as to engage in it, and they did not feel this was appropriate for a credit-bearing college module that is part of a required curriculum,"" Prof Lewis said in the report.\nIn particular, they objected to a sentence that read: “(students)\xa0will learn that in spite of draconian regulations and legislation, resistance is always possible, along with its emancipatory potential.”\nMr Alfian rejected multiple revisions and suggestions from both staff and students, ""contributing to concerns about whether he intended to offer critical engagement in the module"".\nOn his part, Mr Alfian had thought that Yale-NUS staff members were ""rather vague"" about how he should accomplish the critical engagement called for by the committee, according to the report.\nGiven the issues with the course, the module should\xa0not have been\xa0put online for registration, Prof Lewis said.\n""The curriculum committee should have been involved more continuously and the legal risk assessment should have taken place sooner.\xa0The instructor should have been given a clearer explanation ... of the\xa0inadequacy of the materials he submitted,"" he concluded.\nProf\xa0Salovey said that the report\xa0reassured him of Yale-NUS’s strong commitment to academic freedom.\n""I am proud of Yale’s involvement with Yale-NUS and would like to express my confidence in its faculty and leadership.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Hiring those without academic qualifications: It's about companies' 'risk appetite'
  </h1>, 'text': '\nSINGAPORE: Armed with only an A-level certificate and lacking work experience, Ms Sarah Shaikha was in an unenviable position when job hunting in 2016.\nShe knew she was\xa0competing\xa0against those with work experience and better academic qualifications.\nBut law firm Oon & Bazul LLP offered her a position as an administrative assistant. Throughout the job application and interview process, the firm chose not to look at\xa0her\xa0academic transcripts or certificates but focused on the qualities which they saw in her.\nIt has worked out well for the firm and Ms Shaika who has since been promoted and is now a human resource executive at the firm. She is even\xa0looking to take up a part time degree in human resources.\nHires such as Ms Shaikha are becoming more common, as companies become more accepting of candidates without paper qualification, said managing director of Michael Page Singapore Nilay Khandelwal.\nInnovation startup Padang & Co also\xa0does not place an emphasis on\xa0academic qualifications when hiring.\nCEO Derrick Chiang said he never lists the academic qualifications required for job openings at his company. He could interview university graduates as well as candidates with polytechnic education for the same job opening.\n“I honestly have never thought of even asking for those (paper qualifications),”\xa0he said in an emailed response.\n“We don’t even bother with the transcripts of even tertiary education; just the certificate for the record.”\nNone of his staff was hired “solely on paper qualifications” as\xa0“hardly anyone goes to school to study innovation”, as he explained his company\'s focus on innovation.\nThe first thing he asks in an interview is “tell me your story”, so that he can assess the candidate\'s skills and knowledge gathered from their studies and work experiences.\nHe added that the 20 people in his team all “come from different educational, personal and professional backgrounds” and that this diversity is the company’s strength.\xa0\xa0\nWhile there had been instances where those hired end up being a bad fit, he has never blamed them on paper qualifications or the lack of it, said Mr Chiang.\nInstead, he puts it down to a cultural mismatch, or that\xa0those hired found the job roles did not meet their expectations.\nMr Bazul Ashhab, managing partner and head of dispute resolution at Oon & Bazul said: “We are not evaluating a candidate based on his performance in a national school exam, but rather looking at the individual’s talent, recent experience and his/her aspirations.”\nThe firm has hired candidates who “displayed an entrepreneurial spirit, people skills and ability to understand the objectives behind the task and tackle problems with a solution-driven mindset,” without giving any weight to their paper qualifications, he said.\n“In some cases, we have even adjusted certain roles to ensure that the candidate would have a better chance of success.”\nMr Bazul said Ms Shaika demonstrated a “passionate interest in dealing with HR-relevant matters” after she was hired, and that influenced the company’s decision to give her the role of an HR executive when a position opened up, he added.\nThe law firm will continue to\xa0support her\xa0as she\xa0pursues the part-time degree, and said that they see Ms Shaika “as the future HR manager for the firm”, he said.\nThere are benefits to assessing candidates not just on\xa0academic qualifications, said recruitment experts.\n“They may be hiring a candidate who would be a better fit to the workplace culture and have a greater learning potential, such as finding new and creative ways to improve processes or customer experience,” said Randstad Singapore’s associate director of human resources Martin Hill.\xa0\nGRADES CANNOT BE SOLE FACTOR FOR HIRING\nThe overemphasis\xa0on grades was touched on by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung in a recent episode of Talking Point, a CNA current affairs programme.\nHe said while it is “reasonable to ask for qualifications”, companies\xa0should not be listing down minimum grades\xa0for individual subjects unless\xa0the job requires particular subject knowledge.\nSocial mindsets need to shift to reflect this, he added.\nRecruitment experts agree saying that while academic transcripts can be a useful gauge, they cannot be the sole hiring factor for companies.\n“Academic transcripts indicate the intellectual aptitude of an applicant. They are also reflective of the individual’s diligence, research ability, critical and analytical skills, and project management skills,” said managing director of recruitment specialists Robert Half Singapore Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard.\nBut he added that “theoretical knowledge is rarely a substitute for practical experience”, and\xa0“does not reflect a candidate’s passion, their growth potential, or their cultural alignment with the company”.\n“Particularly as industries undergo massive digital transformation, companies will look to complement their automated processes with employees who offer a depth of human insight and soft skills which an academic transcript cannot necessarily capture,” he said.\nBut human resource experts said the majority of companies will continue to use academic qualifications as a yardstick especially when hiring fresh graduates as they fear having someone who is not suitably qualified for the job.\nIt is about companies’ “risk appetite”, said Michael Page’s Mr Khandelwal.\n“If they have been successful with a particular recipe, they probably would be a bit more resistant to change.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      'No different from other teachers': The childcare aide with special needs 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Growing up, 18-year-old Nur Ayuni Abdul Rahim had always kept to herself.\xa0\nIn primary school, her older brother\xa0often came home with tales of how she had been bullied by other students. But she had never said a word to her family.\xa0\n“It’s quite hard to understand what she’s feeling or thinking, and she’s not the type of person to express herself,” said her oldest sister, Nur Azian.\nThe bullying broke her family\'s hearts. And their hearts took another beating when Ayuni’s primary school approached them when she was 11, suggesting that Ayuni\xa0transfer to Grace Orchard School, a special education school for students with mild autism and mild intellectual disability.\n“We thought she was normal, but just needed to work hard,""\xa0said Azian.\nAyuni’s family had always known she was a slow learner, but it turned out that Ayuni had mild intellectual disability, a developmental disorder that makes it harder for her to grasp concepts and solve\xa0problems.\xa0\nThey also grew used to her silence.\xa0\nAfter all, she was part of a large family, with 10\xa0other siblings and even nieces and nephews living in the same house. Their flat in the western part of Singapore - home to 16 people - was often a boisterous place.\xa0\nAfter Ayuni began to attend Grace Orchard School, the family noticed a change in her -\xa0she started coming home\xa0looking happier.\xa0\nAnd one day, as Ayuni was helping to shower her niece Farisha, Azian heard the unmistakable strains of a familiar nursery rhyme\xa0echoing\xa0through the bathroom door. Ayuni had started to be trained\xa0as a childcare aide and was singing the nursery rhymes she had learnt\xa0to Farisha - something Azian had never heard her do before.\nAzian had never imagined something as\xa0simple as a nursery rhyme could make her so emotional,\xa0because\xa0hearing Ayuni sing out loud - naturally, and without prompting - was a testament to how far she had come: From a quiet, reserved girl, to one who can\xa0handle children with confidence, and harbours hopes of becoming a childcare teacher one day.\xa0\nPRICELESS OPPORTUNITY\nThe seeds for Ayuni\'s journey to becoming a childcare aide were first sown\xa0in 2014\xa0when Grace Orchard School wanted its students to gain some\xa0work experience in a childcare setting.\nAt the time, the school provided four training tracks for its students - horticulture, retail, hospitality and F&B - and they were keen on exposing students to more areas of work.\n“Not all of them are suitable, and not all of them are interested in these four tracks,” said Lisa Goh, Grace Orchard’s principal.\xa0\nImagine having to work your whole life in something you’re not interested in at all. That’s why we felt that we needed to give our students more career choices.\nThe school, which operates under the umbrella of voluntary welfare organisation Presbyterian Community Services (PCS), reached out to PCS.\xa0\nAs a trial, some Grace Orchard students began visiting PCS childcare centres\xa0a few hours a week.\nAnd in\xa02017, to take the programme\xa0further, a pilot scheme was launched to formally\xa0train a pioneer batch of three\xa0students as childcare teacher aides. Their role would be to help teachers with routine tasks such as feeding and showering the children, and give additional support to the teachers during lesson time.\xa0\nThe structure of\xa0the curriculum that includes a mix of classroom training and hands-on experience at a PCS childcare centre in Jurong was jointly developed by PCS and the school.\xa0\nBefore they graduate from the programme,\xa0the three selected students - Ayuni and two other girls her age - would also be\xa0sent out as interns to different PCS centres.\xa0\nThroughout the process, a job coach from Grace Orchard as well as a PCS trainer would work with the students, visiting them at the centres to observe and guide them.\xa0\nDuring each of her visits, PCS trainer Gomathey Veeramari, who prefers to be known as Gomy, has one-on-one reflection sessions with each of the students to give her feedback on what was done well, and the areas that need\xa0improvement.\xa0\n“It’s very important to do regular monitoring of the students, to check on their overall performance and to discuss with the principals and teachers how their performance can be improved further,” she said.\nIt would\xa0take three years for the girls to complete the programme, which Lisa\xa0said was necessary as every task required of the students was broken down to help them understand better.\nFor example, instead of simply telling the student to feed a child, the student would be guided to first take the food out, scoop a certain amount onto the plate, check the temperature of the food, spoon it into the child’s mouth and wait for the child to swallow before repeating the process.\xa0\n“They need that length of time and very specific instructions,” she explained.\xa0\nBut three years to train only three students?\xa0\nLisa stressed that they were more than happy to invest the time and effort in the students.\xa0\nTo see the life of a child change… I think it’s just priceless.\xa0You can’t put a price tag on it.\n“If I can train these girls to be independent and contributing members of society… I think it’s something worth doing, regardless of how long the time is.”\xa0\nALREADY WELL-TRAINED\xa0\xa0\nWhen the school first broached the idea of the programme to Ayuni’s family, Azian remembers being happy to give it a try. At the time, Ayuni had been working in her school\'s training cafe\xa0and was planning to join the F&B track.\xa0\nBut her sisters had\xa0reservations about it.\xa0\n“I used to be in the F&B line, and I know what it’s like,” said Azian. “If a customer were to complain or approach her directly in a rude manner… she’s not the type of person who would\xa0talk back and she’d\xa0just keep quiet.”\xa0\n“Also because we have a lot of siblings… our mum trained us to take care of each other,” added Ayuni’s fifth sister, Nur Amirah. “So she already knew how to do things like changing diapers and showering the children.”\xa0\nAmirah added that although Ayuni had initially wanted to stick with F&B so that she could continue schooling with her friends, she was happy that Ayuni eventually made the decision to try out the new opportunity.\xa0\n“It was something new, and not everyone got the chance to be in childcare,” she said. “I thought she was lucky to get in.”\xa0\nDETERMINED TO MAKE IT A SUCCESS\nWhen PCS centre principal Kelyn Soh\xa0received word from her manager in February that came\xa0April, a new intern named Ayuni would be joining her centre as a childcare aide, her first instinct was excitement.\xa0\n“Even before they told me about this programme, I had already thought to myself: What if one day\xa0the early childhood sector could employ people with special needs?” she said.\xa0\n“I was determined to make it a success.”\xa0\nShe had always believed that people with special needs should be given opportunities in life. Besides, she knew there were many benefits.\nFor one, these aides - who would have already gone through two years of structured, detailed training - would come in already knowing what they needed to do, and how to do it.\xa0\nIn comparison, no formal training is required for one to become a programme helper\xa0who would typically take on a similar role in the centre as these aides.\xa0\nBut Kelyn also knew there would\xa0be challenges.\xa0\n“My concern as a principal would be my team, because I need them to support this programme as much as I do\xa0and to buy into the idea,” she said.\xa0\nMy second concern would be the parents.\xa0I didn’t know if they would be receptive to it.\nSome of her teachers, she said, shared her concern about the parents. But she knew that was something she would have to take as it comes.\xa0\nAt the same time, the teachers also wondered whether the\xa0aide would slow down their work process, or have trouble understanding their instructions.\xa0\n“When we react to children, at times we need to be very fast,” she explained. “So the teachers were concerned that it would be an added load for them\xa0having to take care of the children while taking care of the\xa0aide as well.”\xa0\nShe worked with Grace Orchard School to help address these concerns.\xa0\nPrior to Ayuni’s arrival,\xa0Gomy also came down to conduct a workshop for the teachers to help them understand how they could make her feel welcome.\xa0\nIn addition, Kelyn interviewed each teacher personally to make sure that Ayuni was placed in a class where the teachers would be more receptive to her.\xa0\nWe just wanted her to feel loved and accepted.\nWATCH: A special kind of teacher (Dur 7:31)\nA GIRL OF VERY FEW WORDS\nAyuni remembers being nervous on her first day at the centre.\nHaving gone through two years of training, alternating between lessons in the classroom and taking care of children at another PCS centre, she knew what she was expected to do. But being in a new environment made her\xa0uncomfortable.\xa0\n“When I first came, the children didn’t want to talk to me,” she said. “They would move away and look at me from afar.”\xa0\n“Inside, I felt scared.”\xa0\nWhen she was nervous, she preferred to do her tasks in silence, and she\xa0had to be reminded to speak more to the children.\xa0\n“She was a girl of very few words,” said\xa0Jean Ngoo, the teacher Ayuni was assisting. “The first day, whenever I spoke to her, she would just say, \'Okay, okay, okay.\'”\xa0\nJean remembers being concerned that she would have to spend extra time guiding her. But as the days went by, it got easier and easier to guide Ayuni.\n“When I tell her something, she remembers it very clearly. And when I teach her something new, she’s very willing to learn, and can take feedback well,” she said.\xa0\n“As she got more comfortable with us, she started speaking a lot more and she doesn’t need reminders anymore.”\xa0\nBeing more communicative was also something that was emphasised during Ayuni\'s weekly reflection sessions with\xa0Gomy.\xa0\n“I would tell her how to start conversations with the children,” Gomy said. “Let’s say during lunch time, I would tell her she can say things like, \'Do you like what you are eating? Can you tell me what is in your food?\'""\nKelyn, being new to this childcare centre herself, empathised with Ayuni\xa0and made it a point to keep an eye out for her.\xa0\n“She was scared at first, and she was worried that she couldn’t remember all the children’s names,” she said.\xa0\n“It was like that for me when I first came to work. So many classes, so many teachers.\xa0It was so challenging\xa0so of course she would feel the same way.\xa0\n“It’s normal.”\xa0\n“When I did my rounds around the centre, I made an effort to intentionally look at her, make eye contact with her and smile,” she added.\xa0\n“Soon, I realised that whenever I smiled at her and caught her attention, she would smile very brightly.""\nTHE CHILDREN LOVE HER\xa0\nToday, Ayuni is in the final months of the programme before she graduates. To the children, she is Teacher Ayuni, no different from Teacher Jean and the other teachers in the centre except for her long ponytail and the green apron she wears that identifies her as a teacher\xa0aide.\xa0\nShe loves to sing songs to the children, and does the accompanying hand actions with gusto.\xa0\nShe knows the quirks and fancies of each child in her class, and can rattle off all their names on request.\xa0\nWhen CNA Insider visited the childcare centre, a\xa0boy’s head turned the moment he heard her saying his name, and he ran towards her.\xa0\n“Psssst!” He pointed at her with his finger, grinning.\xa0\n“Psssst!” Ayuni mimicked the sound and action. When she smiles, it lights up her whole face.\xa0\n“This one is my favourite,” she said, as the boy clambered onto her lap, giggling, and reached out to touch her face.\xa0\nAyuni has blossomed during her internship here and has even exceeded expectations by starting to read to the children, a task that was not initially in her job scope.\xa0\n“The children love her so much that sometimes they run to her instead of to me and my Chinese teacher,” Jean said, laughing.\xa0\nAyuni’s relationships with her colleagues have also blossomed, but a special place in her heart is reserved for her principal. Every morning when she reports for work, she makes it a point to knock on Kelyn’s office door and greet her.\xa0\n“If I don’t greet her, I feel like something is wrong,” she said.\xa0\n“I like Ms Kelyn because every time she sees me in class, she keeps smiling,” she added. “So I smile back at her”.\nWhenever Kelyn\xa0has to miss a day of school, Ayuni would, without fail, text her\xa0to tell\xa0her that she misses her.\xa0\n“She would\xa0always ask me how I am, if I have eaten, and remind me to take care of myself,” Kelyn said.\xa0\nShe has such a beautiful heart… as beautiful as how she looks.\n“She grew to be so close to the children, they love her and she loves them. I\xa0feel that she is no different from any other teacher,” she added.\xa0\n“Nobody can tell that she has special needs.”\xa0\nWOULD OTHERS GIVE HER A CHANCE?\xa0\nWhen Ayuni and the other girls from the pioneer batch graduate, they will be guaranteed employment in PCS centres. PCS has also agreed to guarantee the graduates from the subsequent batch employment in their centres.\xa0\nBut beyond this, PCS hopes that other preschools would be willing to take them on, according to PCS executive director David Lim.\n“We want to make them our ambassadors… to show other employers that they can do it,” he\xa0said.\xa0\nCurrently, PCS is in talks with a preschool anchor operator to open up their centres to the students who graduate from this programme. They also hope to expand the programme\xa0and are planning to convert part of one of its centres to become a place for the students to undergo classroom training.\xa0\nBut David acknowledged that getting other preschools to give the likes of Ayuni\xa0a chance can be a challenge.\xa0\n“Some preschools are sure to have some apprehension, especially those who have not worked with people with special needs before,” he said. “Some people have this misconception that people with special needs are those who are very severe… But these students have higher ability.\n""We have seen that they are more than capable to serve in the childcare setting.”\xa0\nIn anticipation of parents’ concerns, the PCS centre in Jurong that was used for training the three girls invited parents down\xa0to meet the students. They were pleasantly surprised by the parents’ reaction.\xa0\n“When they met the girls and got to see who they were, they were actually very positive about it,” said David. “We assumed it would be our greatest challenge, but it turned out differently.”\xa0\nBack in Ayuni’s centre, Kelyn knew that it was only natural for parents to be worried about their children’s safety and well-being.\xa0\n“From a mother’s perspective, it’s understandable.\xa0I want my children to be in good hands. So the preschool would need to assure parents that the\xa0childcare aides are well-trained and are able to take care of the children safely,” she said.\xa0\nSo far, parents whom she has\xa0spoken to about Ayuni were receptive and welcoming. She is also\xa0glad that Ayuni’s presence gave her the opportunity to spark conversations with parents about people with special needs.\xa0\n“Some had this misconception that people with special needs\xa0have a different look, so they were surprised that she didn’t look different. That’s about it,” she said. “It is a good opportunity to raise awareness that there are some who are able to function normally and contribute to society.”\xa0\nKelyn also hopes that Ayuni’s presence would give rise to conversations between parents and their children about those who may be different - something which is already beginning to happen.\xa0\n“My son is starting to stereotype people… perhaps those with abnormalities in their facial features, or people with no hair. So I tell him not to label and to just accept that they are different, but no less equal,” said mother of two, Cheryl Lim, whose younger son is in Ayuni’s class.\xa0\n“I wouldn’t want to let him know that Teacher Ayuni is someone with special needs, but rather she is someone who is there to help him in his daily life and his learning,” she added.\xa0\nBEYOND EXPECTATION\xa0\nAfter months of seeing Ayuni come home from work smiling, and hearing the sound of nursery rhymes echoing through the house as Ayuni sang to her niece, Amirah decided to go down to the centre to visit Ayuni for the first time.\xa0\nShe had a\xa0day off from work, and wanted to see her sister’s transformation with her own eyes.\xa0\nAs she approached the centre, the general hubbub of children’s voices grew louder. It was a busy time. The children had just woken up from a nap, and the teachers were getting ready to feed them a snack.\xa0\nIn the thick of the action was Ayuni. After\xa0serving cakes, she sat down\xa0next to a boy to\xa0help him eat his snack. She was smiling at something the boy was saying, and laughed when he made a face at her.\xa0\nAs Amirah peered into the window to watch Ayuni at work, tears sprang to her eyes.\xa0\n“We only know the stories of what she does at work, but this is beyond what I’ve expected,” she said. “I wasn’t sure if she would take care of other children well… but she’s doing great.”\xa0\nThe tears flowed again when Ayuni came out to meet her.\xa0\n“I’m so, so proud of you,” she said, dabbing at her eyes. “You’re doing very well. Keep it up.”\xa0\nAyuni laughed shyly. “I want to cry too,” she said.\xa0\nShe is sure that she wants to continue in the early childhood sector. And she says she has hopes of one day becoming\xa0a fully-fledged childcare teacher.\xa0\nHer sisters know of her dream, but they also know there are challenges. There will be courses and diplomas she needs to complete in order to be certified. They do not know if she is able to complete them.\xa0\nBut given how much they have seen Ayuni progress, and how far she has come, they hope that one day, she will succeed.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     CNA Insider ', '     inclusive hiring ']}"

      330 childcare centres to raise full-day fees in 2020: ECDA
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: About 330 childcare centres in Singapore\xa0will be raising their fees for full-day childcare for Singapore citizens next year, said the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA).\nIn response to media queries, the agency said they form about one-fifth of the total number of childcare centres in Singapore.\nThe median increase is ""within five per cent of fees"" and\xa0“broadly comparable” to previous years, said ECDA.\nAll pre-schools are required to inform parents and ECDA of any increase in fees by Sep 1 of the preceding year, so that parents can make an informed choice about their child’s preschool.\nIn Parliament earlier this month, Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee was asked how the ministry plans to manage fee increases from pre-school operators in light of the new subsidies announced.\nThe subsidies, announced on Aug 28, will provide more support for parents across all eligible income tiers. For example, families with a gross monthly income of S$3,000\xa0will pay S$3 a month, down from S$70, per child at anchor operator pre-schools.\nIn his response, the minister said that anchor and partner operators – which provide slightly over half of all pre-school places – are required to follow fee caps stipulated by ECDA, and “are required to ensure that any fee increase is moderate and their fees do not exceed the caps”.\nWhile he noted that the fee caps for anchor and partner operators have been “maintained at their current levels” since 2014 and 2016 respectively, “each year, some anchor operator or partner operator centres that charge below the fee caps may make some moderate fee adjustments to maintain sustainability”.\nHe added that private and not-for-profit operators are not subject to fee caps, and have the flexibility to determine their fees.\n“We recognise that fees may be adjusted from time to time in response to market conditions and operational costs. By and large, most pre-schools seek to ensure that their fee increases are not excessive, in order to remain competitive and attractive to parents,” said Mr Lee.\nAdditionally, the Government will also look into lowering fee caps for government-supported pre-schools, he added.\n“DEFRAY RISING OPERATING COSTS”\nOf the childcare centres that CNA spoke to, My First Skool, Star Learners and PAP Community Foundation (PCF)\xa0said they would be raising fees for certain centres.\nPCF - which is the largest\xa0pre-school operator - said that they would make fee adjustments at a few centres ""operating well below the anchor operator fee caps stipulated by ECDA"".\nIt added that the parents of affected children were already informed in July of the changes.\nA My First Skool spokesperson said: “For 2020, we are making slight fee adjustments at some remaining centres to progressively standardise our fees across the network.”\nEffectively, this means that My First Skool centres charging below the S$720 fee cap for full-day childcare under the Anchor Operator Scheme will be adjusted to meet the cap.\nIt added that low-income families can receive additional financial support from the school through their Bright Horizons Fund.\nMy First Skool runs more than 140\xa0centres across various locations in Singapore.\nStar Learners – which has 35 out of its 41 childcare centres on the Partner Operator (POP) Scheme – said that it announced its fee adjustment for next year\xa0to selected parents on Sep 1.\n“This\xa0recent fee adjustment, which ranged between S$20 and S$90 monthly, did not apply to all children of Star Learners. It was applicable mainly to Star Learners centres that were offering monthly school fees below the Star Learners published rates,” the centre said.\nThe fee adjustments affected about 4 per cent of their roughly 3,000 children, it added.\nStar Learners explained that it reviews school fees every year to “defray rising operating costs” and to “continue providing good quality childcare and education for the children”.\n“Fee adjustments take into consideration factors such as location and rental costs of centres, POP status of centres, staff salaries, and other operating expenditures,” said a spokesperson.\nUnder the POP Scheme, Star Learners’ monthly fees are capped at S$800 for Singaporean citizens, and the centre said that it plans to follow the fee caps to be implemented in 2021.\nTwo other anchor operators - E-Bridge Pre-school and Skool4Kidz – said that they will not be increasing fees over the next year.\nA spokesperson for E-Bridge Pre-school - which runs 17 centres -\xa0said that its fees are already at the S$720 fee cap for anchor operators. Any increase in costs will be absorbed by E-Bridge Pre-school instead, it added.\nCNA also reached out to the PAP Community Foundation on whether it would be raising pre-school fees, but did not receive a response.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     ECDA ']}"

      Makeup and wigs: Thai teacher transforms to make English fun
  </h1>, 'text': 'RATCHABURI, Thailand: When ""Teacher Bally""\xa0emerges from his office, students burst into laughter. They clap and cheer as their English-language teacher struts down the corridor like a supermodel.\xa0\nLong strides. Feet crossing. Hips swaying. Theeraphong ""Bally""\xa0Meesat looks nothing like his colleagues at Prasartratprachakit School in Ratchaburi,\xa0with violet lips, bright orange cheeks and large false eyelashes.\xa0\nThe 29-year-old school teacher recently become a social media star in Thailand after wearing extravagant makeup to teach English in the secondary school, a 90-minute\xa0drive from Bangkok.\xa0\n“It all began by accident, really. I took part in a school parade and had a class afterwards. So I just came to teach with makeup on because I didn’t have enough time to remove it,” Bally told CNA. On his desk, a cardboard tray is brimming with colourful shades of eyeshadow, blush palettes, lipsticks and foundations.\xa0\nThe children were surprised and excited. They thought it was hilarious and interesting. They were curious.\nEntertainment defines Bally’s teaching. He believes students can learn better when they relax and enjoy the class, particularly when it comes to foreign-language subjects like English. He said many Thai children do not like studying English or lack confidence communicating in foreign languages because they grow up in a Thai-speaking environment where the use of English is extremely limited.\nA big age gap between teachers and students in Thai schools also has a significant impact on the learners’ interest in subjects they are not familiar with, he said.\n“So many teachers still follow the ‘traditional’ teaching style, which is strict and intense. They tend to focus on academic performance as that’s how the national curriculum is designed. It targets good grades in exams,” Bally said.\xa0\n“But for me, English learning should start with listening and speaking. Once students can do that, good grades will follow.”\nTo encourage his students to speak English, Bally is determined to make his class fun. Since the school parade, he has put on\xa0makeup to imitate the look of various Internet idols in Thailand. But instead of making himself pretty, the English teacher strives for an eccentric look to make his students laugh.\xa0\nBut besides their giggles and smiles, he also gets their attention.\n“Entertainment is so important for students. Before we can give them knowledge, we have to break the ice, tearing down the wall of difficulty, the wall of pressure and the wall of age gap,” Bally said.\nMakeup is just one of my teaching techniques to get their attention. It helps them relax, enjoy the class and open up to English.\nTHAIS HAVE POOR ENGLISH SKILLS\nIn 2018, Thailand lagged behind most countries in a global ranking of English skills. It came 64th among 88 countries and regions participating in the English Proficiency Index by international education firm EF Education First. It was grouped with China, Japan and Taiwan in the Low Proficiency band.\xa0\nAlthough it leads Myanmar (82nd) and Cambodia (85th), Thailand came behind most Southeast Asian countries including Singapore (3rd), Philippines (14th), Malaysia (22nd), Vietnam (41st) and Indonesia (51st).\xa0\nAccording to educational researcher Phusima Pinyosinwa, its poor performance in English could be a result of rote learning, which is common in Thai schools.\n“English and other foreign languages are generally taught through rote learning. Teachers often fail to link the content in textbooks such as grammar and vocabulary with students’ context. What they learn is therefore disconnected from their life and that’s why students don’t have the ownership of learning or enjoy English classes,” said Phusima, who is from the Thailand Development Research Institute Foundation.\nThe basic education curriculum also focuses on grammar more than the development of students’ communication skills, she added.\xa0\nTo increase English proficiency in Thailand, Phusima said teachers need to replace rote learning with active teaching using\xa0discussions, presentations and teamwork, and that the basic education curriculum should focus on English for communication as well as grammar.\n“Fun teaching and learning methods are also very important for their skill development. By creating a classroom environment conducive to learning can engage students and encourage them to learn by themselves,” she said.\nFor Bally, however, Thailand’s basic education curriculum already covers both English grammar and communication skills. The real problem, he said, is that many teachers - particularly those at public schools - have many responsibilities at work and do not have enough time to focus on teaching alone.\n“We have limited time, only a few hours per week, to teach. Teachers have to meet the demands from the school and the education ministry as well as prepare students for various national-level exams. So where can teachers find time to ensure fun learning when we have to focus on so many things in the class that only lasts 50 minutes?”\nStill, the English teacher strives to give his students all he can, even when it means he has to spend extra time putting on makeup and a funny wig before teaching.\n“I like it a lot. I’m happy and not stressed at all in his class. It’s exciting because we have to guess how he’ll look each time. He makes us laugh. We learn, we play and we gain knowledge all at the same time,” said one of Bally’s students, Sitanan Yueadnuea.\n“It’s fun and makes our class colourful. When I’m stressed from other classes, this one helps me relax and makes me smile,” said her classmate, Wasan Kankulkrailerd.\n“I feel like learning English more because he’s friendly.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     education ', '     teacher ']}"

      Singapore Institute of Technology unveils first look at new Punggol campus
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE:\xa0Construction work will begin on Singapore Institute of Technology’s (SIT) centralised campus in the Punggol Digital District after a groundbreaking ceremony on Tuesday (Sep 10)\xa0officiated by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\nEstimated to cost more than S$1 billion, the new 91,000 sq m\xa0campus is expected to be completed by 2023 and can accommodate up to 12,000 students. There are currently about 8,000 students across SIT’s campuses.\nIt will be the first autonomous university to have its campus in the north-eastern region of Singapore.\nSpeaking at the ceremony on Tuesday, Mr Lee said SIT will become a big part of the Punggol community. Being at the heart of the Punggol Digital District will strengthen SIT’s “close nexus” with the tech industry, he added.\n""We hope to support an ecosystem for digital and tech companies here, to trial new concepts to work, study and live, before scaling them up nationally. By being co-located here, SIT faculty and students collaborate with industry professionals on projects and test-bedding opportunities,"" the Prime Minister said.\nThe new campus will have link ways connecting it to JTC’s new business park. They will be served by Punggol Coast MRT Station, which is expected to open around the same time as the two developments.\nWOHA and RSP Architects Planners and Engineers were commissioned to design the campus.\nSIT and JTC have also exchanged 8,000 sq m of space to foster greater student-industry collaboration. Under this arrangement, industry partners will be able to operate within SIT’s campus, and students will attend classes in JTC’s building.\nCOMMUNITY SPACES \nSIT has also made a deliberate choice to create more shared spaces as part of its new campus. Faculties are not segregated by buildings, and will instead take different floors within a few buildings. Laboratories will also be shared, instead of being designated to a single course, to optimise space.\nThe campus is designed with many community spaces to make it more accessible to Punggol residents.\nFor example, 1.7ha of existing green space will be retained to create a forest courtyard, and a heritage trail will run through the campus and straight to the waterfront.\nSIT President Professor Tan Thiam Soon said that as the campus is being built in a time of technological change, it is a perfect time to reimagine the university\'s role in the community.\n""This is an opportunity for us to find new ways of learning and we have been working with grassroots leaders in Punggol to promote different programmes for the community,"" he said, adding that the open design of the campus allows the public to observe students working on projects.\nSIT has run science camps twice a year for primary school students in Punggol, as well as set up Skillscraft, a community makerspace in the Punggol 21 Community Club, Mr Lee noted.\nThe university will also offer more professional development courses for adult learners, including in areas of Food Technology and Precision Engineering.\n""LIVING LAB""\nSIT will install a campus-wide smart sensor network of more than 10,000 sensors, capable of collecting temperature, ambient light and human presence data.\nThe data is then shared with the building management system and will enhance campus experience and workspace efficiency, SIT added.\nThe campus is envisioned as a “living lab” that integrates applied research and innovation for SIT and its partners.\n“The aim of the living lab is to support Singapore to be a regional hub for digital advancements and talent development, by integrating education, innovation and research into real-life environments and scenarios,” Associate Professor Steven Wong, SIT’s director of projects said.\nThe university will install a multi-energy micro-grid (MEMG) system – a collaboration between SIT and power supplier SP Group - at the new campus.\nAbout 10,000 sq m of solar panels will be installed on roof tops and the energy generated will supplement the university\'s power supply.\n“Now that we can monitor nearly every aspect of our energy, be it the consumption or the supply, this allows us to fine tune whether we need to save excess energy that we get from the solar panels into batteries,” Assoc Prof Wong said.\nBeyond the MEMG venture, SIT is currently testing out the possibility of deploying robot sentries, as well as installing a facial recognition system for security purposes.\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Singapore’s education system faces ‘biggest challenge’ of enabling continued learning, PM Lee says
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The “biggest challenge” facing Singapore’s education landscape\xa0today is creating a\xa0system that would be fit for purpose to enable continued learning, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Wednesday (Sep 4).\xa0\nSpeaking at a\xa0dialogue session of the inaugural Singapore University of Social Sciences\xa0(SUSS) Ministerial Forum,\xa0Mr Lee said there is existing capability to run a system for students before they enter the workforce, whether through polytechnics, universities or Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs).\xa0\nHowever, to make a system that would be effective to educate adults, Generation X and those older than Generation X is a challenge, he said in response to a question from the audience.\n“If Generation X says can’t remember so many things, better (to) do open-book exams, imagine people in their 50s, 60s or maybe sometimes 70-year-olds who want to come back for a refresher, who want to learn something,” Mr Lee pointed out.\n“How do we run a course … an education system that can meet their needs and suit their style of learning?”\nMr Lee said this is “not easy at all”. It is\xa0not an issue of just money or running the courses, he added, but to have people with experience to operate these, as well as a support system for\xa0older workers when they decide to go back to school.\n“I must have the whole support system for them so that when they come in, their employers understand and they can focus on their jobs as well as on their studies and keep the balance,” the Prime Minister said.\n“Employers will have to make adjustments because all employees will have to go through this at some stage in their lives,” he added.\nHe is confident that Singapore will have such a system.\n“We will do it, we’ve got (SkillsFuture) SG. But we’re still early on in the journey,” Mr Lee said.\n“BE HUNGRY TOO”\nThe Prime Minister also urged Singaporeans to be as “hungry” as their Asian counterparts, who may be perceived sometimes as hungry and willing to accept lower salary to get jobs here.\n“I think that we have to be hungry too, because if we are not hungry then somebody will steal our lunch,” Mr Lee said.\nSuch competition is managed here, he added, as the authorities track the numbers of foreigners who come here to work, their standards and their proportions. This is so they “don’t crowd Singaporeans out” and locals will have job opportunities, he added.\nHowever, he warned that Singaporeans will have to play their part and be competitive in order for jobs to remain here.\n“The reality is if Singaporeans are not up to scratch, the jobs will not come here to look for Singaporeans,” Mr Lee warned. “The jobs will leave here to go to the places where the talent and the enterprise and the hard-working people are.”\nIndonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, China and India are\xa0possible alternatives for companies to bring their jobs to, he added.\nThat said, there are not enough Singaporeans entering the workforce even as the birth rates here continue to drop, he pointed out. \xa0\nThis is why there is a need to “top up” on foreign talent, whether these are engineers, IT professionals managers and even workers, the Prime Minister explained, adding if this is not done, Singapore will not be able to take up all the opportunities that are available.\nTrade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing had\xa0in Parliament this week\xa0defended the need for the Tech@SG scheme, which makes it easier for qualifying tech firms to import highly skilled foreign workers amid a global talent crunch.\n“We open the door, they come, they complement us,” Mr Lee said. “We have to work hard, yes, but we work hard and we hold our own.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A total of 28 secondary schools will start piloting full subject-based banding next year, before it is rolled out to all schools by 2024.\xa0\nThe pilot schools will implement new ways of organising students from\xa0different academic courses into the same form class, said\xa0the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Tuesday (Sep 3).\nThey will also offer humanities subjects - geography, history\xa0and English literature - at a more demanding level from Secondary 2, for\xa0Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students.\xa0\nFull subject-based banding was announced earlier this year to replace the existing system of streaming students into\xa0Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) based on their PSLE results.\nUnder the new system, students will take subjects at a higher or lower level based on their strengths.\xa0\nORGANISING\xa0CLASSES BASED ON CCA\nNormal (Academic) student Ian Chan initially thought it would be difficult to mingle with his friends from other streams when Bowen Secondary\xa0conducted a trial where Secondary 2\xa0students attended Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons together.\nBut it turned out a lot easier than what he had imagined, especially since they were grouped according to their Co-Curricular Activities (CCA).\nIan, whose CCA is the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps, said: “Sometimes when we don\'t talk about school work, we\'re talking about drilling. And we get to know what each other\'s feelings are like, so that helps us to strengthen our friendship.\n“As I got to know them better, I realised that they don\'t actually care about our streams.”\nBowen Secondary\xa0is one of the 28 schools that will start piloting aspects of full subject-based banding\xa0from 2020.\n""The pilot schools were selected based on their readiness to participate in the pilot. Factors considered include their involvement in the earlier phases of SBB (subject-based banding)\xa0and their experience in supporting different profiles of learners,"" said MOE.\xa0\nStudents in these schools will take a set of subjects at a common level such as art, design and technology, as well as\xa0music. For other subjects, students will be grouped in classes according to the level at which they take each subject.\nBowen Secondary teacher Dorothy Lim said it\xa0took up the offer to be a pilot school because of its experience implementing subject-based banding since 2017.\n“We were able to stretch some of our students from the Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams,"" she said.\n“By doing so, we can provide all our students a keener set of social emotional skills and on top of that, allow them to pursue subjects that are pitched at their level, to the best of their ability.”\nIn preparation for full subject-based banding, the school reorganised Secondary 2 students according to their CCAs for CCE lessons, and conducted a trial over five sessions in April.\nExpress student Nur Faraha Faeaz, who is part of the military band, said that the experience during the trial was initially “awkward” because she did not know a lot of people in her batch despite being in the same CCA.\n“Sometimes we judge each other by which stream we are from. For example, I’m from Express and I don’t really know this person from Normal (Technical) and I feel a little bit uncomfortable,"" she added.\n“But after getting to know them better, I feel a lot more comfortable and I get to know that despite their weaknesses, they also have strengths.”\nMs Lim said the main challenge encountered by teachers was catering to all students in the three different streams.\nThe school has since given teachers learning opportunities with the ministry, teachers from other schools, as well as sessions for professional development.\nWhile Bowen Secondary will not reorganise form classes according to CCAs next year, it will be conducting another trial for Secondary 1\xa0students after the September school holidays.\nThe aim is to prepare at least half of the school’s teachers for the pilot next year when Secondary 1 students from different academic courses attend form classes together.\nBUILDING MULTI-PURPOSE ROOMS FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY IN GROUPING STUDENTS\nSt\xa0Andrew’s Secondary School will also be piloting full subject-based banding next year.\nTeacher Valerie Yeo said\xa0it was a “natural” move for them since the school was already conducting lessons using differentiated instruction.\nIts Secondary 1 classes will have a mix of students from the different academic courses.\n“We’re hoping to do a random mix, because that\'s what the society is like out there. So we are not going to specifically engineer because our goal is to provide authenticity,"" she said.\nThe school is also looking at building multi-purpose rooms to encourage more “versatility and flexibility” in grouping students.\nSt\xa0Andrew’s Secondary\xa0first implemented subject-based banding last year, and currently has a total of 52 Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students under the new system.\nSecondary 2\xa0student Andre Khurana, who made the jump from Normal (Academic) to Express stream, did subject-based banding for three subjects last year.\nHe still keeps in contact with his Normal (Academic) friends and wants to pay it forward, after receiving support from his friends in the Express stream.\n“Because of them helping me last year to get into Express, and helping me with research like history, geography or maths, I\'ll try to do the same for my Normal (Academic) friends so that they will have a better future,"" he said.\nMore secondary schools will progressively introduce aspects of full subject-based banding\xa0from 2022 to 2024.\xa0\nThese are the 28 schools piloting full subject-based banding from 2020:\n', 'related_topics': ['     Ministry of Education ', '     education ']}"

      Calls for new pre-school partner operators to begin end of this year: Desmond Lee
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Government plans to open calls for new pre-school partner operators by the end of this year, as it works toward lowering childcare costs for parents in Singapore.\nThe call for childcare operators will take place by the end of this year, and by next year for kindergarten operators.\n“We’ll open it up to a small number of good quality kindergartens, both not-for-profit as well as private, to come and join the Partner Operator scheme,” said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee in an interview with News 5 on\xa0Friday (Aug 30).\n“By 2021, when (the new partner operators) are in place, we will bring down the fee caps, starting with them,” he added. The current fee cap for full-day childcare partner operators is S$856 after GST.\nMr Lee’s comments come after the announcement on Wednesday that additional subsidies for pre-schools will be increased across all eligible income tiers from January 2020.\nIn the medium term, the Government aims to lower fee caps\xa0at government-supported pre-schools so that parents pay about S$300 per month to match that of the total cost of primary school plus after-school student care fees.\xa0\nIn addition to lowering childcare costs, the Government also plans to expand the number of government-supported pre-schools to 80 per cent over time.\nAt the moment, just over half of all pre-school places are government-supported.\n""Our commitment to enable eight in 10 pre-schoolers to have a place in good quality, affordable preschools in the government-supported sector represents our commitment to developing every child in Singapore,"" said Mr Lee.\nThere are currently five anchor operators and 23 partner operators.

      Mindset change needed on how society views exams: Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Examination grades should be not be the sole means of defining a person -\xa0and\xa0societal mindsets need to shift to reflect this, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday (Aug 23).\nHe was speaking at a forum with parents and students that was filmed for Talking Point, with hosts Steven Chia and Diana Ser moderating the discussion.\nThe forum touched on the greatest source of educational stress for students, and the impact of subject-based banding, following several announcements\xa0from the Ministry of Education (MOE).\nThese include\xa0having fewer exams and assessments in schools starting this year.\xa0\nPrimary 1 and 2 students will no longer have weighted assessments and examinations, while Primary 3, Primary 5, Secondary 1 and Secondary 3 students will no longer have mid-year exams.\nThe Government also announced\xa0in March that subject-based banding will replace streaming in secondary schools, and a\xa0common national exam will replace the O-Levels and N-Levels.\nSubject-based banding allows students to take subjects at a higher or lower level, based on their strengths.\n“It is a\xa0societal mindset,” said Mr Ong, responding to a question on where the biggest source of stress came from.\xa0\n“Because we value meritocracy so much … but I think we have reached a stage where we might be overdoing it, and I think it is time to unwind without losing the fundamental principles of meritocracy.”\nWith that in mind, he pointed out that MOE is gradually making adjustments such as revamping the Primary School Leaving Examination\xa0(PSLE) scoring system, cutting the number of exams and phasing out streaming in secondary schools.\n“That means I don’t boil you down to one number, I try my best to judge and evaluate the talent of this child and give admission places to the child at secondary school through Direct School Admission (DSA), as well as poly, ITE and university,” he said.\nWhen Mr Chia pointed out that some employers still hire based on grades, Mr Ong said: “Every time I spot any ministry, any private sector company that still hires based on minimum B3 in Math, minimum five O-Levels, I always tell them – can you remove that? Why do you want that?”\nHe added that it was “reasonable to ask for qualifications”, but not “for every grade"" unless the job requires particular subject knowledge.\nFEWER\xa0EXAMS MEANS LESS STRESS?\nBefore Mr Ong\xa0took part in the discussions,\xa0the parents and students were already engaged in a lively discussion on whether having fewer exams equate to less stress.\nA poll conducted showed\xa0divided opinions: 54 per cent of parents and children said yes, while 48 per cent disagreed.\n“School should be a place to not really stress, to have fun, to make friends, to learn something, rather than just go there and – I’m so stressed about – exam is coming,” said actor and presenter Ben Yeo, 40.\nHowever, some parents felt that exams were necessary to instil character values in children.\n“If you don’t have exams, you need some other way to teach children discipline and resilience,” said principal founder of Learning Journey Grace Tan, 38.\nThe children also admitted that there was value to having exams.\n“It helps me to know which subject I need to work on more to improve,” said Vera, 10.\n“If there’s more exams, it’s easier to balance out if you do very average for one exam,” said Kyana Chainani, 13.\nIn response, Mr Ong said reducing stress was not the aim behind the decision to do away with some exams.\n“For every exam we remove, we have three weeks of freed up curriculum time, which is very useful for teachers to then teach better and for students learn better,” said Mr Ong.\nSUBJECT-BASED BANDING\nDuring the programme, parents\xa0were also polled on whether subject-based banding would increase\xa0social mixing. This time, it was an even 50-50 split.\nSome parents cautioned that social mixing would not come about automatically, and that schools would have a part to play too.\n“You could have a situation where they’re even more split because there is nobody to facilitate the understanding, the inclusion. So I think the teachers really have to play a central role in helping the students and setting the culture and the tone,” said writer June Yong, 39.\nHowever, manager Lu Jiahui, 44, who went through subject-based banding during her time in school, found it to be a good experience: “I got to mix with lots of other people in the same cohort, so the social mixing was very real.”\nThis is exactly the point of the policy, said Mr Ong.\n“You move from class to class, and you’re not in the same class because you belong to a certain stream or certain course and I can only study at a lower or less difficult level,"" he said.\n“TELL ME I HAD A WONDERFUL CHILDHOOD""\nIn the final minutes of the show, Mr Ong invited the parents to reflect on what yardstick they would use to measure their\xa0success as parents.\nMost of the parents pointed to qualities other than academic success.\n“How I gauge would be – will they be living their dreams or will they be living our dreams?” asked entrepreneur Khalid Awang, 51.\nMr Yeo said: “I just hope that he can come and tell me that I had a wonderful childhood.

      Former vice-principal found guilty of sexually violating student from when he was 14
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A former primary school vice-principal who sexually groomed a student for years from when he was 14, eventually taking him into his own home, was found guilty on Tuesday (Aug 27).\nThe man, who is now 57, had claimed trial to three charges of sexual exploitation of a young person and five charges under Section 377 of the Penal Code for carnal intercourse against the order of nature.\nAt the time of the offences in 2005 and 2006, the law regarded the act of fellatio as unnatural carnal intercourse within Section 377 - with the only exception being fellatio as a stimulant for consensual intercourse between a man and a woman.\nThe section was repealed in 2007, and there is no corresponding section today.\nDistrict Judge Chay Yuen Fatt convicted the man of all charges on Tuesday, saying he accepted the prosecution\'s evidence and believed the testimony of the victim, who is now 30.\nHe rejected the man\'s defence, saying he found it ""wholly self-serving"", and added that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt.\nThe man and the victim, who was almost a third of the then-educator\'s age at the time of the first offence, cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the victim\'s identity.\nBOY CAME TO SINGAPORE FROM CHINA WHEN HE WAS NINE\nThe court heard that the victim had come to Singapore from China with his mother when he was about nine years old, and attended the unidentified school from Primary 1.\nHe was appointed vice-head prefect in 2003 when he was in Primary 5 and reported to the vice-principal every morning at his office.\nThe first offence occurred that year when the boy was doing exercises in the school gym. The man pushed the boy to the wall before molesting him and performing a sex act on him.\n""The victim was 14 years old at this time,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew. ""He did not know how to react, and had doubts about the nature of what the accused did, as the accused was a very respected figure. He was also afraid that he would not be believed if he told anyone.""\nThe boy was appointed head prefect a year later and continued reporting to the vice-principal every morning at his office. He also began going to the man\'s home for tuition on weekends after the vice-principal offered to coach him in English.\nAt his home, the vice-principal showed the boy articles about masturbation and performed sex acts on him, before taking him out for a meal.\nThe following weekend sometime in 2004, during another tuition session at the vice-principal\'s home, the man told the boy that he loved him very much and tried to kiss him before performing sex acts on him.\nThis behaviour continued, with the victim going to the vice-principal\'s home for tuition on weekends about once in two weeks, with the older man committing similar acts against him.\nBOY MOVED IN WITH MAN, SEX ACTS PROGRESSED\nThe relationship between the two changed at the end of 2004 when the boy\'s guardian was repatriated by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.\nAs he needed a new guardian to remain in Singapore, the boy told the vice-principal about his situation and the man offered to become his guardian. He also asked the boy to move in with him.\nHe moved in and originally had his belongings placed in a room opposite the maid\'s, but the vice-principal asked him to sleep with him at night.\nThe boy slept with the vice-principal on his bed every night and also regarded the man\'s parents as his own grandparents.\n""He also began to regard the accused not just as a mentor, but also as a fatherly figure to him, and he was very appreciative of the accused,"" said the prosecutor.\nAfter the boy moved in, the sexual acts progressed to involve fellatio, with the first act sometime in early 2005.\nAs the boy got older, he began having doubts about what the man was doing to him, and whether they were really normal as the man had portrayed them to be.\nIn 2007, when the victim\xa0was about 18, he grew increasingly resistant to the man\'s sexual advances, and the frequency of the acts decreased.\nWhile he was in junior college, the teenager\xa0started thinking about moving out because of the advances, but did not know how to do so as he felt obligated and responsible for the man\'s elderly parents.\nVICTIM DISCOVERED HE HAD STD\nThe victim changed his mind in 2011 when he discovered that he had contracted gonorrhoea urethritis, a sexually transmitted disease, and realised that he needed to protect himself, court documents said.\nHe met a woman while on a trip to Scandinavia with the vice-principal in June 2013, and began dating her secretly after.\nAfter sharing with her about what the man had done to him, the woman, who is now his wife, urged him to make a police report and move out of the man\'s home.\nHe moved out later that year when he was 24, and stayed with the woman.\nThe vice-principal asked the young man not to report the matter to the police, saying he may commit suicide otherwise.\nVICE-PRINCIPAL\'S NIECE ASKED VICTIM TO MAKE POLICE REPORT\nHowever, the issue of reporting it to the police came up again in August 2015, when the victim chanced upon the vice-principal\'s niece.\nHe told the niece what her uncle had done, and she\xa0encouraged him to make a police report, reminding him that her uncle could have done the same thing to other boys.\nThe victim remained reluctant to make the report, knowing that it would cost the man his job and affect his family.\nHe also feared for his own reputation and did not want his parents to feel guilty when they found out about it.\nAfter discussing the matter with the woman he was dating and a friend who was a law student, the victim decided to contact the accused to seek compensation for an out-of-court settlement, thinking this was a possible and legitimate course of action.\nThe victim sent the man a text on Nov 3, 2015, asking the man to compensate him S$200,000 for his acts and saying that his parents wanted to pursue the matter.\nHe also sought an apology, an admission\xa0and an agreement not to do such things to other boys.\nThe man met the victim on Nov 24, 2015, but served him a legal letter instead of having a discussion with him, and the victim lodged a police report the next day.\nMAN DENIED ANY SEXUAL ACTS\nOver the course of the trial, the prosecution relied on evidence including testimonies from the victim, his wife and the accused\'s niece, handwritten letters, articles on masturbation and a recorded phone call.\nIn the conversation, the vice-principal had accepted that he had committed wrongdoing against the victim from the time he was in primary school and said it was ""the regret of (his) life"".\nThe man in his defence denied engaging in any sexual acts with the victim, claiming that the teenager had not slept in his bedroom at night but only sometimes in the day.\nHe also said that when he was contacted by the victim for compensation, he was under the impression that the victim wanted compensation as the accused had caned him in 2004.\nThe judge adjourned mitigation and sentencing to a later date.\nThe man has been\xa0suspended\xa0from duty since December\xa02015 and is not deployed at any school, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to CNA\'s queries.\n""MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,"" a spokesperson for the ministry said.\xa0\n""All educators are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the integrity of the profession and the trust placed in them.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     education ']}"

      No increase to 'adequate' bursaries for undergraduates in top income tier: Indranee
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Bursaries for undergraduates in the highest income tier will not be topped up as the current bursaries are adequate, said Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah on Monday (Aug 26).\nStudents from families in the highest income tier - whose\xa0gross household income is between S$6,901 and S$9,000 - currently receive S$1,350 in undergraduate bursaries.\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had announced\xa0during this year\'s National Day Rally that lower-income undergraduates and polytechnic students will pay reduced school fees with enhanced bursaries.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) released the details of these enhanced bursaries last Thursday, with about 55,000 students expected to benefit.\nSpeaking on\xa0News 5, Ms Indranee explained the disparity between enhancing bursaries for polytechnic students with gross household\xa0incomes up to S$9,000 and for undergraduates with gross household incomes of S$6,900 and under, but not for those above.\n""For universities, you can see that for the first few tiers, actually the increase that we gave was quite a bit. That is because the current bursaries, we felt, were not adequate,"" said Ms Indranee.\n“When you look at the top tier, we felt that the current bursary was actually adequate for that income group. So that’s why there was no increase for that one.\n“But for the other tiers, because we felt that the current bursary didn’t provide as much assistance as would be necessary for those groups, that’s why we topped it up.”\nUndergraduates from families earning S$6,900 or less can expect to benefit from the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) enhanced bursary scheme.\nAccording to MOE, these enhanced bursaries will be expected to cover\xa0up to 75 per cent of general degree fees for undergraduates and 95 per cent of school fees for polytechnic students.\nWith these enhanced bursaries, the Government is hopeful that more students from lower-income households will apply for university courses and polytechnic courses, the minister added.\nADJUSTING FEES AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES\nStudents at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) will see their fees lowered.\xa0Currently, the cost for a general course is S$7,860 at SUSS and S$8,190 at SIT, and both fees will be revised to S$7,500.\nIn response to whether the Government would consider adjusting\xa0fees at the other universities, Ms Indranee said: “The two newer autonomous universities, that’s SIT and SUSS – when they first started out they had smaller cohort sizes, which means that the cost per head is higher.\n“But now, as they’ve been more established, they’re having more students, which means that you can bring the cost down.\n“And what we’re trying to do is to make sure that their costs are in line with the other universities.”\nSPENDING CUTS ELSEWHERE?\nMs Indranee also noted that the Government “should be able to accommodate the enhanced bursaries without any issue”.\nEstimates by MOE indicate that it the enhanced bursaries will cost an additional S$44 million.\n“If you’re concerned that oh, because we’re going to have to spend S$44 million in bursaries, does that mean we have to take away S$44 million from elsewhere – I think the answer is, you can’t quite approach it like that,” she said.\nMs Indranee added that after merging some junior colleges previously, there would be “less cost there than in the past”.\n""So you\'ve\xa0basically got to add up everything.""\nShe added: “Whatever it is, this Government’s commitment is to make sure that for education, we will continue to make sure that nobody gets left behind and that we will provide what is needed for our population.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indranee Rajah ', '     education ']}"

      55,000 tertiary students to get enhanced bursaries, some up to 95%: MOE
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: About 55,000 undergraduate and diploma students will stand to benefit from the Government's enhanced bursary scheme, which will be rolled out to students from the next academic year onwards.\nOf these 55,000 students, about 30,000 of them come from families with incomes at the 30th percentile and below, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Thursday (Aug 22).\nThe details of these bursaries were announced by the Ministry of Education (MOE), following Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally speech where he said that the Government would increase its spending on bursaries.\nMr Lee said that university undergraduates will receive more financial aid, from 50 per cent currently to up to 75 per cent of general degree fees. For polytechnic students, their bursaries will increase from 80 per cent of school fees to up to 95 per cent.\xa0\n“The Government will be investing approximately S$44 million more per year for these enhancements, or a 36 per cent increase from the current S$123 million,” said MOE in a press release.\nThis S$44 million will go to students with a gross household income of S$9,000 or less, with bursaries “heavily weighed towards benefiting” families from the 30th percentile and below, said Mr Ong.\nThis will mean that families from the lowest income bracket could pay fees as low as S$150 a year for polytechnics, from the current S$550. University undergraduates in this bracket will only need to pay S$2,000 a year from the current S$4,200.\nMore than 33,000 diploma students and 21,000 undergraduates will stand to gain from this enhanced bursary scheme, which will include students enrolled in the Institute for Technical Education (ITE), the National Institute of Early Childhood Development, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and Lasalle College of the Arts.\nTwo bursaries will also be renamed to better reflect their intended use: The MOE Bursary will be known as the Higher Education Bursary and the CCC/CDC Bursary will be called the Higher Education Community Bursary, said Mr Ong.\nINCREASED BURSARIES FOR MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY STUDENTS\nStudents enrolled in medicine and dentistry courses at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and National Technological University (NTU) will also receive enhanced bursaries.\nThe Government will now subsidise up to SS20,700 in\xa0school fees for these students, which could see students from the lowest income bracket paying S$5,000 or less for their degree.\nPreviously, the Government only subsidised up to S$4,000 in school fees, which meant that students from the lowest income bracket would have to pay S$24,900 at NUS and S$30,700 at NTU.\n“Today, 11 per cent of our medicine and dentistry students\xa0come from (households with incomes in the 30th percentile) and below. And we want to make sure of all them can have sufficient support,” said Mr Ong.\nThis will ensure that students from lower-income families are not deterred from studying medicine and dentistry, he added.\nWhile the fees for medicine and dentistry degrees differ across the two universities, students in both schools will now pay\xa0the same fees, said Mr Ong.\nHe added that the bursaries for medical and dentistry students are higher because these students have to serve a bond by working in the public healthcare system after graduation.\nLOWER SCHOOL FEES FOR SIT, SUSS STUDENTS\nStudents taking full-time general courses at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) will also pay lower school fees.\nCurrently, the cost for a general course is S$7,860 at SUSS and S$8,190 at SIT. Both fees will be revised to S$7,500.\nEighty per cent of SUSS students and 20 per cent of SIT students are expected to benefit from the lower\xa0tuition fees.\nMost of the other 80 per cent of SIT students are studying in programmes with partner universities, which is why the lower\xa0tuition fees will not apply to them, explained Mr Ong.\nIf these degrees become SIT-conferred general degree courses, the students will similarly benefit from the reduced fees, he added.\nMORE UPGRADING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITE GRADUATES\nThere will also be more opportunities for ITE graduates to upgrade their skills, with about 1,700 students benefiting from the increased number of upgrading pathways by 2030.\nCurrently, seven in 10 ITE graduates continue to upgrade themselves over the course of their careers, said Mr Ong.\nThese opportunities come in the form of more places for full-time and part-time Higher National Institute of Technical Education Certificate (NITEC) and diploma pathways, with 860 more spots in the Higher NITEC programmes and 580 more places in ITE’s SkillsFuture Work-Study Diplomas, he added.\nWorking adults will also have 290 more places in full-time polytechnic diploma programmes, “recognising their competencies gained through related work experience, in addition to academic grades”, said MOE.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     MOE ', '     education ', '     Ong Ye Kung ']}"

      PM Mahathir accuses Chinese schools association of racism over khat controversy
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has hit out again at the Chinese schools association over its opposition to the teaching of khat calligraphy, saying that legal action could be taken if the association instigates negative racial sentiment.\xa0\n""It is going against the law. We have freedom of speech, but we are always sensitive about not instigating people to fight with each other,” he was quoted as saying by the Star.\n""Dong Zong is only talking about one community, forgetting that this is a multi-racial country,” said the prime minister, referring to the United Chinese School Committees’ Association of Malaysia.\n""It is for the police to decide (whether to ban Dong Zong).""\nThe prime minister was asked by reporters to comment on an online petition by a Malay rights group to ban the association for opposing the teaching of khat calligraphy in vernacular schools. This came after Dong Zong had\xa0started its own petition to protest the learning of khat calligraphy.\nEarlier this month, the Education Ministry said that khat would\xa0be taught to Year Four students in Chinese and Tamil vernacular schools as part of the Malay language syllabus beginning next year.\nThe decision caused an uproar among the local Chinese community, which is known to be protective of its mother tongue education.\nChinese educationists questioned the rationale behind introducing khat, which is usually associated with Islam, adding that it would not help the students enhance their Malay language skills.\xa0\nLater, the Cabinet said that khat would only be an elective in the Malay language curriculum.\nOn Monday, Dr Mahathir said that Dong Zong was racist as it never agreed with national education policies, including the introduction of khat calligraphy in schools.\nThe prime minister said apart from the calligraphy issue, the association was also against the setting up of a campus containing different vernacular schools during his first stint in office, for fear of Chinese students mixing with other races.\n“Dong Zong is racist; we set up a campus in Vision School to put a Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (SJK) Cina, a SJK Tamil and a sekolah kebangsaan (national school) in one campus, but they were against it,” he recounted.\n“They are afraid to let their children mix with Malays, so they did not want it. They are against all (policies implemented by the government), never agreed with anything.”\nWRONG FOR MAHATHIR TO LABEL DONG ZONG RACIST: DAP POLITICIANS\nDr Mahathir’s comments drew flak from Democratic Action Party (DAP) politicians.\nIn a statement on Tuesday carried by Malaysian media, senior DAP figure Lim Kit Siang said the prime minister was wrong to brand Dong Zong as racist.\nHowever, Mr Lim also noted that Dong Zong was in the wrong for equating khat calligraphy with Islamisation.\nBukit Gelugor lawmaker Ramkarpal Singh added that Dr Mahathir’s remarks were “uncalled for and most regretted”.\n“Instead of allaying the concerns of Dong Zong on the khat issue, calling it racist will only distance it from any compromise or negotiations that should be had by all stakeholders on the matter,” he was quoted as saying by the Malaysian Insight.\n“Dong Zong’s concerns over the khat issue should not be brushed aside as such concerns are not unfounded and possibly represent a large section of the Chinese community on the said issue. That there is dissatisfaction over the matter on the ground is a fact and cannot be taken lightly.”\nDONG ZONG ""STRONGLY DENIES"" RACIST LABEL\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, the association said it ""strongly denies"" Dr Mahathir\'s accusation, saying it was not the only body that rejected the introduction of khat in vernacular schools.\xa0\n""This view is shared by the mainstream non-Muslim community across the peninsula, Sabah and Sarawak. In fact, not all Malays agree with this initiative. For example, Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz has said that the art of khat should be made an elective and not mandatory.""\xa0\nThe association also said that opposition to the teaching of khat on the basis of it being associated with Islamisation is justifiable, citing the Islamic Da\'wah Foundation\'s (YADIM) Nik Omar Nik Abdul Aziz, whom it said suggested that learning khat would\xa0make it easier for young generations to learn the Quran.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ']}"

      Government spending on foreign students’ scholarships, tuition grants fell 50% over 10 years
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Government spending on scholarships and tuition grants for international students fell by about 50 per cent over the past 10 years, said\xa0Education Minister Ong Ye Kung in Parliament on Monday (Aug 5).\xa0\nThe amount comes up to around S$130 million a year, or around 1 per cent of the annual education budget of S$13 billion, he added.\xa0\nMr Ong was responding to questions by Non-constituency Member of Parliament Leon Perera on the total average amount of government spending on foreign students per year over the past 10 years.\xa0\nHe also asked about the percentage of foreign students receiving financial aid in polytechnics, junior colleges and autonomous universities.\nWhile the nominal sum spent on foreign students\' scholarships and student grants was S$130 million a year, Mr Ong said that the cost to the education sector was actually less.\n“Imagine if we send back all our international students on scholarships, how much of our education budget do we save? I think it would be much less than S$130 million, because that is the worth of the scholarships to the international students, not the expenditure incurred by the system,"" said Mr Ong.\xa0\n""Overhead costs such as the buildings, the laboratories, the equipment, the management, manpower, faculty, will still need to be incurred anyway,"" he added.\n“Instead, if we send back all our international students, what we will lose are the opportunities for Singaporean students to build bonds and bridges with students from other countries\xa0and expand their network of friends.\n“We will also lose a catchment of people who can contribute to Singapore potentially.""\nInternational students with scholarships are required to work in Singapore for at least three years after their graduate. Many eventually become permanent residents or Singapore citizens and raise their families here, Mr Ong noted.\n""Even if they decide to leave Singapore after fulfilling their obligations, they can be part of our valuable global network of fans and friends, who can speak up for Singapore, and forge collaborations with Singapore,"" he added.\nMr Ong stressed that financial aid is for Singapore citizens only, and that\xa0the core objective of the education system is to serve Singaporeans.\xa0\n""No Singaporean is ever displaced from the Institutes of Higher Learning or IHLs, because of an international student,"" he said.\n""When all Singaporean students who meet the standards have been admitted, the IHLs then raise the bar\xa0by a few notches, and admit a small minority of international students, over and above the local students.""\nAs for Singaporeans studying abroad, they also benefit from subsidised fees or scholarships from overseas universities, Mr Ong noted.\n""So we give some and take some, and our IHLs cannot depart from this international practice norm, and has to be part of this global education network,"" he said.\nIn response to a supplementary question by Mr Perera who\xa0pointed out that subsidies from overseas universities may not be government-funded, Mr Ong said that Singapore’s system is different.\n“They have state universities, they also have private universities. In our case, all of our autonomous universities are all government run, so therefore the circumstances are different. Ours is a much more public and centralised system,” he said.\nHe also welcomed academics to study the impact of government spending on foreign students.\n""ABOUT HONOUR AND TRUST""\nAbout 4\xa0per cent of international students default on their tuition grant bond obligations, said Mr Ong, adding that the grant amount adds up to about S$5.5 million annually.\xa0\n“For this small proportion of defaulters, MOE takes a serious view. It is not just a matter of money, but also honour and trust. We have managed to recover from a few, and we will continue to make suitable recovery efforts,” he told the House in response to questions from Workers\' Party Member of Parliament Png Eng Huat.\xa0\nHe added that the Government will take measures to prevent defaulters from working or living\xa0in Singapore.\nWhen asked about the drop in costs incurred by defaulters, from the S$30 million mentioned in 2016 to S$5.5 million currently, Mr Ong explained that this was due to a backlog of cases in 2016.\nIn the intervening years, the Education Ministry managed to contact ""practically all of them"", he explained.\xa0\n""And therefore, we can ascertain now it is a 4 per cent default rate that represents about S$5.5 million a year,"" he added.\nMr Ong said authorities have tightened the recovery process over the last few years.\n“But fundamental point is still, so long as we believe that we need a proportion – a suitable proportion of international students in our system … we will expect some of them to default and not fulfil\xa0their obligations,"" he added.\n“That is inevitable, but we will try to tighten the selection, make sure we pick the right people and make sure they will continue to fulfil\xa0their obligation.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Ong Ye Kung ', '     parliament ', '     education ']}"

      Mastering accounting skills for your career
  </h1>, 'text': 'Accounting is the language of business, and the strong technical skills of an accountant are highly valued in the job market in spite of the digital disruption.\nLast year, the Singapore Accountancy Commission announced the development of a roadmap that aims to establish Singapore as a leading accountancy hub and create 2,000 new jobs by 2020. A key pillar of the roadmap is attracting PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) to the accountancy sector and training them to be proficient in deep technical knowledge and skills. With the accounting knowledge, PMETs will have the ability to help shape business strategies and lead the growth of their organisations.\nA growing number of business and tech-related roles will also require specialised technical skills in accounting, as employees are required to read, interpret and analyse financial reports and recommend courses of action to the management. Gaining these accounting technical skills via further learning will give graduates an edge in a competitive job market.\nQUALITY AND EMPLOYABILITY\nMore PMETs are furthering their qualifications through programmes like Singapore Management University’s (SMU) Master of Professional Accounting (MPA). The programme, which is one of the most recognised graduate qualifications in accounting locally, also attracts professionals from non-accounting backgrounds who deal with financial data at work.\nThe MPA is accredited by 11 professional, regulatory and academic institutions in Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. MPA graduates who want to obtain Chartered Accountant (CA) or Certified Public Accountant (CPA) status and enrol in the professional qualifications offered by organisations like the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA), the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) will be granted exemptions on foundation modules. This will save them time on their journey to professional accountancy.\nAssociate Professor Wang Jiwei, SMU’s programme director of the MPA programme, cites two other aspects of the degree that make it appealing to students besides the high level of professional recognition: A world-class faculty, and high graduate employability.\nAccording to Prof Wang, in the past few years, more than 90 per cent of students find a job within three to four months, while 100 per cent of the students find employment in six months. The MPA programme also saw more than 90 per cent of the students securing an internship within the accounting and finance domain.\nHe added: “One of our courses, Audit and Assurance, is taught by our industry partners from two of the Big Four accounting firms. Learning from them will be very insightful. On top of the technicalities of accounting, you get to pick up critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which will give you an edge in the workplace.”\nMPA graduate Qu Rui, who enrolled in 2018 and completed her studies in May this year, agrees that being taught by a practising accounting professional was highly beneficial.\n“Our professor shared his rich working experience and core audit knowledge with us,” she said. “Despite having no experience before, this class gave me a concise but vivid understanding of auditing and assurance.”\nShe also believes that the school activities and projects taught her how to communicate and compete, while a volunteering session improved her sense of social responsibility.\nADDING A SPECIALISED EDGE \nWhile Ms Qu joined the MPA as a full-time student, Mr Shawn Chen chose the part-time route as he was busy with his legal career.\nMr Chen, a corporate lawyer specialising in corporate finance law, decided to carve time out of his schedule to enrol in the MPA, citing his desire to better serve his clients. “I felt that I often had gaps in my understanding when I spoke with bankers and auditors regarding the accounting, audit and financial aspects of a corporate finance transaction, and I wanted to fill these knowledge gaps,” he explained. \xa0\nTwo of Mr Chen’s then-colleagues, who practised tax and regulatory law, had graduated from SMU’s MPA and recommended the programme to him. While he was forewarned of the heavy time commitment needed, he found the deanery to be very supportive of part-time students. “They do their best to accommodate the different needs of part-time students who juggle work, family, studies and other matters,” he said.\nMr Chen enrolled in the MPA in 2017 and graduated in 2019. Currently the general counsel for Deloitte Southeast Asia, he said: “The MPA has given me the tools and the confidence to face different issues and challenges, and it ensures that I am well-informed and able to offer solutions that are legally sound, context-driven and commercially practicable for our leaders and staff.”\nFor Ms Qu, she feels that the MPA has given her essential technical knowledge and an extra edge that makes her stand out as a job seeker.\n“Nowadays, the accounting profession is no longer just about having a degree certification; it is also about communication, analytical and leadership skills,” said Ms Qu, who will begin work as an associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers next month. “The MPA, through its curriculum and committee activities, has allowed me to be a more competitive candidate with both hard and soft skills.”\nNEW DEMANDS, NEW OPPORTUNITIES\nIn the era of big data, technology will be driving the transformation of the accounting ecosystem. Technologies such as AI, blockchain and cloud computing have a direct impact on the methods of accounting, and the tools and processes used in the accounting and finance domain.\nSome experts have predicted an expansion in roles for accounting professionals, who can look forward to new job opportunities and augmentation of existing roles. Freed from manual work such as bookkeeping, accountants of the future will have the freedom to take on strategic and analytical responsibilities, like managing IT projects, optimising resources, providing deep insights and even working alongside other units such as operations or sales to evaluate new opportunities for the business. Accounting positions requiring critical thinking, problem-solving and human interpretation will be more in demand than ever.\nTo further enhance the skillsets of its MPA graduates, SMU is revamping its curriculum to include Data Modelling and Visualisation as one of the programme’s essential modules, and launching additional courses such as Blockchain in the New Economies. The school will also be introducing a Global Study Programme, where students will go for an overseas study trip to broaden their perspectives.\n\xa0Attend SMU’s events to find out more about the MPA programme.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Singapore Management University ', '     SMU ', '     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The new scoring system for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) is not a silver bullet to reduce the overemphasis on academic grades, said\xa0Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Sunday (Jul 28).\xa0\nThe system, which will roll out from 2021,\xa0is instead part of a ""significant reform"" which the education system is undergoing, he said.\xa0\n“I think this is a period where the education system is undergoing significant reform, not by one single measure but a whole package of measures that we have systemically implemented over time,"" said Mr Ong.\xa0\n“With this system, we will better prepare our children for the future,"" he added.\xa0\nMr Ong also noted that the move complemented other efforts such as the phasing out of secondary school streaming by 2024, as well as\xa0changes to the Direct School Admission Exercise (DSA).\xa0\nSTUDENTS TO FOCUS ON OWN ACHIEVEMENTS\nMr Ong said that the new PSLE scoring system would not\xa0affect students’ chances of getting into their preferred stream, but will allow\xa0students to focus on themselves.\xa0\n“Given time, students will be able to focus on their own achievements,"" said Mr Ong who was speaking on the sidelines of a community event, Gambas Neighbourhood Renewal Programme Roadshow 2019.\n""\'What I want to achieve, what’s my target’\xa0and try to achieve it, as opposed to comparing with each other to get ahead in order to score a high T-score.""\xa0\nHe said based on the education ministry\'s estimates, the percentage of students going to the Express stream, which is currently about two-thirds of the cohort, will not change very much.\nAbout 20 per cent of students are also expected to continue taking Higher Mother Tongue, with 99 per cent\xa0of students to progress to secondary school, said Mr Ong.\xa0\n“Be mindful that under this new scoring system, the subjects don\'t change, the curriculum doesn\'t change and the way we teach doesn’t change - it may improve for the better - assessment also doesn’t change,"" said Mr Ong.\xa0\xa0\n“The only thing that changes is the scoring system. So the technical educators in MOE (Ministry of Education) are able to map from one scoring system to another scoring system.”\nHe likened the current scoring system, which uses the T-score, to a national running competition where the outcome places more importance on the placement, instead of a runner’s timing.\nMr Ong said the\xa0new scoring system would be like the\xa0Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT), a standard physical fitness test used by the Singapore Armed Forces, where individual scores are more important.\nMORE TRANSPARENT THAN T-SCORE\nAccording to Mr Ong, some parents felt\xa0that the new scoring system was\xa0complicated, but he said it was a lot more transparent than the current T-score system.\nHe also said that introducing updates to the PSLE would\xa0help parents internalise the new system.\n“I don’t think it’ll be that complicated because it’s very similar to your O-, N-, A-Levels as well,” Mr Ong said.\n“I\'m quite confident that by 2021, there won’t be confusion. People will understand how this new scoring system will add up and how this aggregate is calculated.”\nHe added there was\xa0a right “exchange rate” in mapping the grades of foundation subjects to standard subjects, which the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) has worked out.\nUnder the new PSLE scoring system, students\xa0will be graded based on an Achievement Level (AL) score ranging from 1 to 8, with 1 being the best score\xa0and 8\xa0the lowest.\nThe AL system will result in 29 possible scores, as opposed to the current T-score system, which has about 200 variations, according to MOE.\nThis aims to reduce fine differentiation at a young age and recognise the students’ level of achievement regardless of how their peers have done, it added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Ong Ye Kung ', '     education ']}"

      Four special education schools to add basic digital skills to curriculum
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: More than\xa0700 students from four special education schools will learn how to make e-payments, use emails and online chats by next year, as basic digital skills are incorporated into their academic curriculum.\nThe students with mild intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder are from\xa0the Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN) Delta Senior School, APSN Tanglin School, Grace Orchard School and Metta School.\xa0\nThe initiative follows positive feedback from a pilot conducted earlier this year involving\xa070 students, said the\xa0Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) on Friday (Jul 26).\xa0\nPrincipal of Grace Orchard School Lisa Goh said the skills have enabled\xa0students to be more independent. “They will be able to access government websites – where they can book amenities.

      Next year's Primary 5 students to get exam results based on new PSLE scoring system
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Primary 5 students next year will be the first cohort to receive their exam\xa0results based on the new Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring system that will be implemented from 2021, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Thursday (Jul 25).\nThey will be graded based on an Achievement Level (AL) score ranging from 1 to 8, with 1 being the best score\xa0and 8\xa0the lowest.\nIn the following years, all P5 and P6 students will receive their results in that format, moving away from the T-score system which will be scrapped in 2021.\xa0\nThis change will not affect students from Primary 1 to 4 who will continue to receive progress reports.\nThe AL system will result in 29 possible scores, as opposed to the current T-score system, which has about 200 variations, according to MOE.\nThis aims to reduce fine differentiation at a young age and recognise the students’ level of achievement regardless of how their peers have done, it added.\nAt the PSLE, \xa0students’ AL score for each of the four subjects – English, mother tongue language, mathematics and science –\xa0will be added up to form a total score of between 4 and 32, which will decide which secondary school they will be posted to.\nThe lower the score, the better.\nA PSLE score of 20 or better will qualify students for the Express stream in secondary school.\xa0\nSECONDARY SCHOOL CUT-OFF POINTS\nInformation on indicative AL cut-off points for the various secondary schools will be announced in the first half of 2021, MOE said.\nThese will be based on the 2020 PSLE results and choices made by that year's cohort, it added.\nThe order of school choices will also become more important from 2021 as it will be used as a tie-breaker when two students with the same score vie for a spot in a school. Currently, places in school are allotted based on results, citizenship and computerised balloting.\n“Students and parents may choose schools based on a consideration of factors such as the distinctive programmes offered by the school, the school’s ethos and culture, or home-school distance,” an MOE spokesperson said.\xa0\nFOUNDATION LEVEL SCORES\nThe ministry also unveiled details on how pupils who take subjects at the foundation level will be scored. They will be graded AL A (75 to 100), B (30 to 74) and C (below 30). These will be converted into the standard level subject equivalent scores of AL 6, 7 and 8 respectively for the purpose of working out their total PSLE score for Secondary 1 posting.\xa0\n“The pegging reflects the fact that the curriculum of a foundation level subject is a subset of the standard level subject, and the assessment load at the foundation level is less demanding when compared against the standard level,” MOE said.\xa0\nFoundation level English, science, mathematics and mother tongue language were introduced in 2008 to Primary 5 students as part of subject-based banding. MOE said that about 10 per cent of students from each cohort take\xa0one or more subjects at foundation level, which allows them to study at a pace suited to them.\xa0\nA student can qualify for the respective academic courses in secondary school as long as his or her overall PSLE score meets the placement criteria, regardless of the mix of standard and foundation subjects offered, the ministry said.\nSCORES FOR HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE ELIGIBILITY\nMOE also said that those who score 8 and better in the PSLE will be eligible to take higher mother tongue in secondary school, while those who score 9 to 14 will be able to do so if they do well for mother tongue or higher mother tongue in the PSLE.\xa0\nSchools can also offer higher mother tongue to students at their own discretion.\xa0\nStudents taking higher Chinese will no longer gain bonus points for entry into a Special Assistance Plan school but will continue to have an advantage over those who do not take it.\xa0\nMOE said that it hopes that the reforms in education –\xa0including the phasing out of streaming in secondary schools –\xa0taken together will “lower the temperature” when it comes to concern over which stream or level a student goes to in secondary school. Going to a lower one is “not the end of the world”, it added.\xa0\nDirector-general of education Wong Siew Hoong said: “This new PSLE scoring system is part of a broader shift that the system needs to make to reduce the over-emphasis on examination results, examination grades, so that we can make space for the students to be developed more holistically.”\nREFINEMENTS WILL BRING ABOUT POSITIVE CHANGE\nRadin Mas Primary School principal Muhammad Farizal Umar Effe said that the changes show that the intention is to “blunt” the focus on PSLE results and broaden the definition of success.\n“PSLE is just a snapshot of the child’s abilities at that moment of their life and we recognise that child will grow and develop at different pace and will continue as a system to focus more on the holistic growth of a child to prepare them not only for the examinations but for life as a whole,” he said.\nStill, examinations have their place in the system, Mr Farizal said. “We must recognise the role and the value of the examinations as a useful checkpoint to guide the child in the next phase, especially at PSLE,” he added.\xa0That said, there have been “several refinements” to reduce the assessment load by removing examinations at several levels, he added. While any examination will lead to “inherent pressure”, making it manageable for students is key, he said. \xa0\n“The new system will reduce fine differentiation with its wider bands, and recognise students abilities and performance without the reference or comparison to peers and this will lead to students feeling less pressure as the student can focus on their own learning outcomes,” Mr Farizal said.\nNational University of Singapore (NUS) sociologist Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser also said that the refinements will bring about positive changes.\n“They will\xa0reduce unnecessary competition and stress among students going through the education system, enhance their learning experience, equip them to be more future-ready, and engender a more equal society characterised by multiple pathways to success,” he said.\xa0\nDr Kelvin Seah, lecturer in NUS’ Department of Economics said the changes to the education system, including PSLE scoring, may even have wider repercussions.\n“In doing this, it is sending a signal to employers that academic grades should not be the be-all and end-all\xa0and that they should broaden the way hiring and promotion decisions are made so as to recognise other strengths and talents,” he said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ']}"

An estimated 190,000 Chinese students study at Australian universities, bringing in much-needed revenue.\nBut the links have also created tensions as the two very different political cultures meet.\nOn Wednesday, there was a violent standoff between pro-Hong Kong democracy protestors and a group of students backing Beijing at the University of Queensland.\nThe university was recently put in the spotlight for making the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane a guest professor at the school of languages and culture.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Australia ', '     China ', '     education ']}"

      Parents know best, or do they? In today’s Asia, the dilemmas of overparenting
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: His mid-term tests were coming up, and Wen Zi Xu’s mother wanted to know what scores her 11-year-old would try to get.\nHis aim: 100 marks for English; 95 and above for mathematics; and above 80 for Chinese, his weakest subject. But she had two words for him about his last target: “Not enough.”\nThe boy replied in consternation: “If I promise 85, you’d blame me if I can’t reach it. Can’t we go slowly?”\nWelcome to the world of parenting. Or is it overparenting?\nThe Wen family hail from Chengdu, China. And mum Feng Jie knows of parents who “won’t tolerate even one mistake in exams”. She said: “They demand 100 marks. Some even beat their kids if they don’t achieve that.”\nIt is not just Chinese parents who are stuck in a rat race. In fast-changing times across Asia, parents are grappling more than ever with an age-old question: How can they set their children up for success?\nBy monitoring their studies 24-7? By cultivating their business smarts? Or by exposing them to coding so that they will have a place in the future job market?\nTo find out how far some parents are willing to go to see their children fulfil their hopes and rise above the competition, the series The Family Affair followed five families — from China, India, the Philippines, Singapore and South Korea. (Watch the series here.)\nTheir dilemmas are ones that many parents face: How to determine what is best for children when the future is anyone’s guess? And when children are not mature enough to decide what to do, whose dream should it be anyway?\nPASSION VERSUS GRADES\nIn the case of Zi Xu, his parents have been hothousing him since he was born. Before he was a year old, he started learning swimming. Before he turned three, he started learning English.\nFrom three to six years old, he learnt to play the piano. In sports, he has been playing baseball “for a long time”, said his mother. And in third grade, he started coding and learning creative technology like 3-D modelling.\nHis parents have spent about RMB1 million (S$197,000) on just his educational activities.\n“My intention was to cast a wide net when he was young, so as to find key talents to develop,” explained Feng. “Early education is a form of investment.”\nThe only child knows that “everyone is fussing” over him. “Everyone hopes to make me the best,” he said.\nMy father once said that if he didn’t invest so much money in me, we’d definitely be staying in a mansion and driving a luxury car.\nHis father Wen Ju, who is in the business of online advertising, wants him to go into the tech sector, believing that artificial intelligence will replace jobs “in the near future”.\n“I’m guiding my son towards creative technology. I feel that this has to be done as soon as possible. If he starts late, he may not catch up with the changing times and the pace of development,” said the 41-year-old.\nThat is where Zi Xu’s interest lies too. Since he was eight, he has spent about 10 hours a week in technology-related classes. Grandmother Xiang Kai Rong said proudly: “He’s taken part in many competitions and won an award every time.”\nHe himself is proud of the inventions he constructs using his 3-D printer, such as toy swords he sold to schoolmates.\nBut what happens when his mother — unhappy with how much time he spends on his hobby at the expense of his schoolwork — stops his creative technology classes because his primary school leaving examinations are drawing closer?\nWATCH: Which parenting style is best? Passion vs grades (4:29)\n“Gaining entry into the right middle school is getting more important. Having good grades is getting more important,” she reasoned.\nIt is something his parents cannot agree on in today’s competitive world, with one parent wanting a more relaxed pace for him, and the other filling his time with more Chinese tuition, including on Sundays.\nHis father thinks that “at this stage, grades aren’t that crucial”, telling his wife: “In future, he may not get to be among the top of his class. But he can play on his strengths to gain a competitive advantage.”\nBut she believes she is “only stating the cruel reality” and that there should be “no excuses” for their son. “Every child starts at the same starting line,” she said. “Every child has the same amount of time.\n“Our boy isn’t working hard enough. Just compare him to other kids (who) are studying hard every day … seizing every moment.”\nWhen his Chinese scores slipped below 80, however — his father’s baseline expectation — even Wen began to wonder if his wife had been right all along, fearing that his son would “give up”, which would “spell trouble”.\nOne thing was clear: Zi Xu was getting tired, and acting up because of that. “I may look lively and happy. But inside, I’m feeling the pressure from school and other stresses. It’s making me very unsettled,” he confessed.\nBALANCING PLAY WITH STUDIES\nOver in Singapore, nine-year-old Keane Yap knows what it is like to have a packed schedule. But it is what he wants in order to be in Band One in class and to achieve his ambition to become a celebrity.\nMake that a “triple-threat” celebrity, who can sing, dance and act.\nSo his weekdays look something like this: Wushu on Monday; mathematics tuition and one-to-one acting class on Tuesday; one-to-one speech class and one-to-one vocal solo training on Wednesday; Chinese tuition and swimming lessons on Thursday; and vocal duet on Friday.\nHis mother Celine Yap, an event planner at work, has devoted herself at home to planning for his future since he was five years old.\nTaking his ambition seriously, she plays the role of talent manager and “Uber driver”, helping to build up his portfolio and sending him to an array of photo shoots and fashion shows.\nHe has already acted in more than 35 projects, from commercials to dramas like Lion Mums, and has racked up awards in international singing competitions like the Hong Kong International Music Festival.\nAll in all, the family spends more than S$2,000 a month on his lessons. Yap considers this an “important” investment, and also tried to groom her elder child Dawn for singing stardom when she was younger.\n“Competitions serve as a platform for building their confidence,” said the 47-year-old. “I want them to have no stage fright, and enjoy performing on stage. Those are the soft skills that I’m looking at.”\nAs a self-motivated child, Keane also wants to do well at school. After he once scored 80 in English, he asked for tuition in the subject. “My class is full of … smart people,” explained the Primary Four pupil.\nMost of them are (scoring) 85 to 100. That’s Band One.\nWhile not wanting any let-up in his performing arts activities, however, what happens when he gets a class paper all wrong? A five-hour quota on his game time each week, imposed by dad Alex Yap, the one who monitors the children’s studies.\n“Kids follow certain rules. So the underlying objective is that we don’t want to make it too extreme. And the last thing we want to do is let the kids get hurt,” reasoned the foreign exchange trader.\nBut it was enough to reduce Keane to tears. “That means I can (only) play one game (a day),” wailed the boy, who has a Nintendo Switch console and an X-box that is shared with his sister.\nNormally, his mother does not disturb him when he is playing, until it is time to sleep at 9pm. But he sometimes stretches playtime to 11pm, which is “a bit too much”, she admitted.\n“I want to stop him from being addicted, but I don’t want to paralyse him totally. I think he's afraid that he’ll end up with no time to play, because his dad really (goes) by the rules,” she said.\nEnforcing the new rule was not so easy, however, leading to a tantrum once. “(Parents) don’t play the game, so they don’t understand,” an exasperated Keane said.\n“They were born in 19-something when there was no technology. They played Five Stones and all those normal games … Once they understand the game, they’d know when to ask me to stop.\n“Then I’d follow them. Then it would make much more sense.”\nBUSINESS SMARTS OR HIGHER LEARNING?\nGetting children to follow instructions is one thing — in South Korea, dad Song Doo-hak wants his children to follow in his footsteps too.\nThe 36-year-old is a self-made millionaire and the nation’s youngest head of a merchants’ association, at the Pyeongtaek International Central Market. He also owns 10 commercial properties.\nHis success all started with a burger shop he opened in 2007, which his family now helps to run.\nMiddle child Eun-ji, 16, and her 20-year-old sister Yeon-ji, who was once regarded as a prodigy at school, have been helping at the shop since young.\n“When I was a second-grader in middle school, the burger shop became extremely busy … I spent more time working at the shop than studying. I didn’t even have time to be rebellious,” lamented the older girl.\nAnd I can see my friends passing by. When I see them having a good time while I’m working, I also feel like hanging out with them. But I have to make hamburgers.\nSong’s focus on earning money meant he had “paid little attention” to his children, he admitted. “I’ve never taken my daughters to an amusement park; instead, we were always at the burger shop.\n“I can sense from my family members’ faces that they’re not happy even when we’re making money.”\nResentment began to boil over, however, when he asked his second daughter to help out more — to help achieve his dream of earning about 30 million won (S$34,500) a month from the burger shop, on top of his property rentals.\nThe high school sophomore was already spending all her free time at the shop. But in the evenings, she has chosen to attend cram school because her dream — of becoming a computer graphic designer — is “more important than family”.\n“I need to be able to support myself financially,” she added. “I can’t expect my parents to support me forever.”\nBut her father, who is not shy of disclosing that he scored 100 out of 400 in his college entrance exam, believes that “doing well at school isn’t the only way to be successful”.\n“I’m trying to teach you a shortcut,” he told his family. “If we work together, there’d come a time when we’d be able to … open a shop for Yeon-ji as well as Eun-ji.”\nHis daughters were not the only ones who disagreed; wife Kim Mi-ok thought he was “treating them as slaves” to his dream.\n“Instead of teaching them shortcuts, why don’t we prepare more options for them, so they can switch between Plan A, B, C or even D. We are their parents, and that should be our duty,” she told him.\n“Even if you drag your daughters to these shortcuts, how would they know these are the right ones for them?”\nTo Eun-ji, it is clear that going to university would give her more options to pursue her dream.\nBut it was only after a row with Yeon-ji about recalling her during a rare night off, coupled with his wife collapsing from exhaustion at work, that Song realised things needed to change, starting with hiring more manpower.\nHe also decided to take the family to Seoul, on their first trip together in nine years.\n“About two years ago, my family was so exhausted we decided to go on a family vacation,” he shared. “But it hasn’t happened till now.”\nAN ‘EPIDEMIC’\nSeveral books refer to the phenomenon of overparenting, or hyper-parenting, as “the overscheduled child”.\n“Some parents want to craft the perfect childhood, to guarantee a successful adulthood in today’s competitive world,” noted The Family Affair series producer Anna Tolentino.\nIt isn’t new, but it’s interesting how, years ago, this was seen as eccentric behaviour. Now, it seems to be the norm.\nThe trend has even been called an “epidemic”, mainly because doctors in the United States and the United Kingdom have seen “a spike in the number of children suffering from stomach ulcers and headaches due to exhaustion and stress”.\n“Clearly, this issue no longer concerns only Asian parents but parents across the board,” she added.\nEconomic status, however, still has an impact on a child’s future. For example, the Filipino family in the documentary also wants to raise a celebrity, “but lacks the resources the Singaporean family has”.\n“In India, we have a single mother who has the bandwidth to see only the short term, and is asking her daughter to stop school to help earn money for the family,” Tolentino also cited.\nWhile she saw “interesting parallels” between the parents in Singapore and China who were concerned with grades, she said the Chinese parents “took hyper-parenting to another level”.\nIn the end, however, some things mattered more than grades.\nWhen Keane scored 11 out of 20 on an English composition, his schoolteacher asked why he was eight marks behind a classmate going to the same tuition centre as he was. But seeing how upset he was, his parents were nothing if not encouraging.\nAnd after speaking with his teacher, his father said she “meant well”, by trying to “bring out that competitiveness in him” to catch up with his friends. “I’m not too worried,” he added.\n“Failures are good. And to have the mindset, or the heart, to overcome failures is very important.”\nWatch the series here.

According to Temasek Polytechnic (TP), about 600 Ngee Ann Polytechnic students enrolled in TP’s pharmacology module online last semester.\nALLOWS SHARING OF RESOURCES, BETTER PREPARATION\nDr Maisha Foo, a pharmaceutical science lecturer at TP, said the platform allows staff to share resources, which is more efficient.\nShe said: “There may be certain subjects that are common across the different courses and the different polytechnics. So I think that’s where we can tap on those resources. We can curate the materials and it can help us save time developing materials on our own.”\nAsmita Ale, a pharmaceutical science student at TP, said the portal helps her broaden her interests and expand her career options.\nThat is because students can sign up for general education modules in diverse areas.\n“If the job that I want inculcates business and science aspects, by looking at materials in PolyMall, it will give me an insight into the industry I’m looking forward to,” said the second-year student.\nMr Brian Tan, a senior lecturer at Republic Polytechnic's School of Applied Science, said the platform has equipped students with more subject knowledge before attending classes.\nThe platform allows multimedia content like video clips and animations to be uploaded, so students can even get a sense of what they need to do during hands-on tasks like laboratory experiments.\nMr Tan said: “This allows them to come better prepared for lessons and engage in deeper academic discussions with their lecturers in class.”\n“UNIQUE IN THE WORLD”\nPolyMall was first conceptualised in 2014.\nA team of about 30 representatives from all five polytechnics worked with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).\nDeputy Principal (Development) of Singapore Polytechnic, Hee Joh Liang, who is also the chairman of PolyMall, said the aim was to allow the five polytechnics to collaborate with one another and help students become self-directed learners.\nThe team then brought on board US educational technology firm Blackboard.\nRegional Vice-President for Asia of Blackboard Philip Murray said it’s the first time the company’s technology has been utilised in such a manner.\n“At no time have we ever had universities and polytechnics get together to share content and allow students to seamlessly move between faculties and different polytechnics dependent on their own capabilities and course interests,” said Mr Murray.\n“This is unique in the world.”\nVISION FOR COURSES TO COUNT TOWARDS A QUALIFICATION\nCurrently, about 100,000\xa0students are using the platform.\nFor now, online modules from another polytechnic do not count towards a student’s grades or qualifications, but Mr Hee said this could happen in the future as more modules are added.\nHe said: “The vision that we would like to have is where students can, in a way, pick a certain module from one poly and pick another module from another poly so that it can stack up towards a diploma.”\nAs technology advances, the platform could also be enhanced so polytechnics can share resources that incorporate augmented reality and virtual reality, said Mr Hee.\nHe hopes the portal will inspire students to become lifelong learners.\n“They need to own their learning, rather than lecturers telling them ‘you must learn this or you must learn that.’\n“Because the world is changing very fast and the half-life of a skill is now less than five years.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Inspired by Singapore’s education system, Bangladeshi migrant worker starts polytechnic
  </h1>, 'text': ""HABIGANJ, Bangladesh: When Joy Sudip Bhadro\xa0wasn’t toiling away on a construction site in Singapore, he could be found outside a polytechnic, gazing in awe as students streamed in and out of the school gates.\nTo Singaporeans, it is nothing special to see. But to this Bangladeshi, it was a whole new world, one he never had a chance to be part of and could only watch from afar.\nAs he observed the students, he thought about how he was unable to complete high school owing to financial constraints.\nHe had come to Singapore at the age of 24, earning S$600 a month to support his extended family of 11. “I was a poor man who had absolutely nothing,” says the now 42-year-old.\nHe then, by chance, met a Burmese studying for a diploma here and who “now works in an office” — while he, with his primary school certificate, could only do menial work. And Joy knew, he was not the only one.\nIn his small hometown of Habiganj, many youngsters graduating from primary school were faced with unemployment or low-paid, laborious jobs, owing to their lack of technical knowledge. So he dreamt of opening a polytechnic in his town 3,917 kilometres away.\nThat was seven years ago. Today, in the heart of this town, along its busy and dusty streets, is a three-storey building with a banner bearing the words “North East Ideal Polytechnic Institute”.\nHome to more than 200 students, it is the town’s only vocational institute. And the man who started it was Joy.\nThis is the story of a migrant’s “crazy” dream and how his vision came to pass, in the CNA Insider series Life After Singapore, about what has happened to migrant workers after they returned home.\nALL GOOD IN SINGAPORE UNTIL …\nWhen his older brother suffered kidney failure, Joy found himself stepping up as the head of the household. There were eight young children in his extended family, looking to him to support their education.\n“Realistically, I thought if I don’t try to improve the situation, more lives will be ruined like mine was,” he said. “So I gave up my life for them.”\nThrough an agent, he secured a job in Singapore in the automobile industry. Over 11 years, he worked in a range of jobs, from construction work to MRT maintenance.\nIt was hard work, but all was good — until May 2012. He was cycling alone along Nicoll Highway when he was knocked off his bicycle by two youths, who then punched, kicked and stepped on his face and body.\nHe lost consciousness and was robbed of his wallet and phone. He also suffered fractures on his face and had to undergo an operation. “It was all over the news in Singapore,” he recalled.\nWhile he was recovering and still in pain, the only thing on his mind was to get back to work as soon as possible so that he could continue sending money home.\nThat resilience served him well as he stayed on in Singapore to work — while pursuing an idea that had just been put into practice.\nWATCH: The migrant worker who founded a polytechnic\xa0(5:55)\nHIS WIFE THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE\nA year earlier, Joy had come to know of free skills training for foreign workers, which he admitted he was sceptical about initially.\nBut he decided to stick around when he saw a class of 30 to 40 other migrants and “hot food being provided”.\nSo every Sunday for a couple of months, he attended courses on waterproofing works and other construction-related training conducted by the Building and Construction Authority and the Ministry of Manpower.\nBefore he knew it, he was hooked. For someone who only had general education in Bangladesh, receiving vocational training was an eye-opening experience. “I realised practical knowledge was real knowledge. I fell in love with it,” he said.\nThat was also when he met the Burmese who was on the way up. And so, the idea of setting up a polytechnic was conceived in his mind. But he knew his hands were tied.\n“I’d observed so much in Singapore, but I still had to get my head down and work,” he said. “That’s when I decided to call my wife.”\nRipa Datta was a primary school teacher. When she received his call, she could hear the excitement in his voice — let’s do this, he said — but at that moment, she thought it was an impossible, “crazy” idea.\nHe remembers her words: You can’t ride a bike, and you’re thinking of flying a plane? How would they fund the school? And what about their own children? (Their daughter was two years old then, and the couple would find out they were having another girl that year.)\nHe thought she probably could not believe “a poor man’s wife would be able to do anything large-scale”. Needless to say, he was upset.\nBut the next day, she called and said she was willing to try. She would ask her father and brothers if they could chip in money for the school.\n“Whatever income she made would go to our family. My income would go towards the school,” said Joy, who was then earning S$1,200 monthly. He handed more than half of it to his family, trusting them to build his dream school.\nAs he continued to work in Singapore, his wife and in-laws got to work, going door to door to look for students. “People were very sceptical of the polytechnic initially,” said his brother-in-law Rintu Datta, who is now the school’s director.\nIt took much effort to convince families that vocational education could make a difference to their children’s lives. In the end, they found a group of eight to 10 students, who gathered in a tin shed with two teachers.\nAnd that was the humble beginnings of this polytechnic.\nHOPE FOR THE TOWN\nIts current premises are still bare, run-down and very humid, but it has come a long way. When CNA Insider visited the school, even a power failure — which is no rare occurrence — could not faze its students.\nSitting in dim light and clad in dark blue uniforms, they had their eyes fixed on their teacher as he explained, ironically, how a circuit worked.\nIt is a sight that makes the leap of faith Ripa took to pursue her husband’s vision worth it.\nNow a primary school principal, she has witnessed her own students being unable to fulfil their aspirations to further education owing to financial constraints.\n“(For) the students in this area, their level of success compared with other prominent areas is very low. There are very few jobs available in the market if you only had (general studies),” said the 35-year-old.\nOnly three courses are offered here: Civil engineering, electrical engineering and computer engineering. “These sectors have high demand in both the government and private sectors,” Rintu explained.\nSince 2012, two batches of 57 students have graduated, and 85 per cent of them have found jobs related to their area of study — which Ripa considers an achievement. “Some of them get a job even before graduating,” she said.\nFormer student Mohammed Al-Amin Shah was already working — as a general worker — at a ceramics firm before he decided to pursue a diploma in electrical engineering. But upon his graduation, his company offered him a better position.\n“Now I can call myself an engineer,” the 32-year-old beamed. “I can even catch on to things quicker than (my colleagues) who studied in the general line.”\nHe also attributes his success to the institute’s teachers. “If we didn’t understand something, our teachers told us to call them at night. They even encouraged us to come back to school on Fridays (a rest day) if we needed help,” he said.\nFurthermore, it is cheaper to study at an institute in the town centre. Before the polytechnic was set up, town folks who wanted a vocational education had to travel to cities like Sylhet and Dhaka, where fees were more expensive.\nMohammed said that if he had pursued a diploma in Dhaka, it would have cost him at least eight times more. The North East Ideal Polytechnic Institute’s fees are about S$130 per semester, and students from poorer families receive subsidies.\nWith the polytechnic, women’s access to higher-level education has also increased, noted Ripa. Growing up, she always had support from her mother and former teachers to go above and beyond, but her father had doubts.\n“When I joined an honours programme (in Sylhet), my father said, ‘Girls don’t need to go so far to study’,”\xa0she recalled. Her “progressive” mother protested, however, and Ripa went on to complete a master’s in 2003.\nShe knows that not every girl in her country has the same opportunities. “Many times due to family pressure or religious outlook, many parents don’t want their daughters to continue studying,” she said.\nPoojal Pal, a first year studying computer engineering, questions the rationale. “Will girls remain unmarried just by studying? No way,” said the 17-year-old. “Studying is extremely important for girls because girls are always seen as useless.”\nRipa hopes that with the polytechnic, mindsets will start to change and women can also return to school after marriage and childbirth. They can be motivated to study again, she believes.\nA SIMPLE MAN\nThe school is where it is today because of “combined efforts”, said Joy. For example, the plot of land it stands on was given by his father-in-law while Rintu, 27, takes care of administrative matters.\nJoy himself has no clue how many students have graduated. He returned home only three months ago to seek treatment for a back injury.\nHis homecoming has been bittersweet. While he is bummed about being out of work, he has seen with his own eyes the polytechnic he envisioned in Singapore, and spoken to graduates who are now working in established firms.\n“I lived abroad for 18 years. But when I come back here, people greet me out of respect,” he said. “I get shy.”\nHis contribution is not discounted either. “He helped a lot financially. He gave us many directions as to what’s right,” said Rintu. “We wouldn’t have made it this far without him.”\nThere are also plans to open a second branch at Srimangal in Moulvibazar, another town in the Sylhet division.\nFor now, Joy can bask in the success of the lives in which he invested. His own nieces and nephews, whom he helped to put through school, have become doctors, educators and police officers.\nWhile he enjoys his “celebrity status” in town, he remains humble. “I’m just a simple human being,” he said. “But I realised that even if I can’t become somebody big, I could do something small.”\nWATCH: An introduction to CNA Insider's Life After Singapore series\xa0(1:41)\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Bangladesh ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Commentary: Time to relook racial quotas in Malaysia’s pre-university matriculation programme
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: The ethnic dimension of resource allocation in Malaysia has long been a concern, and this has coloured debates on issues in\xa0politics, the economy and\xa0education.\nDespite constant calls to do away with racial preferences in policy-making, the Ministry of Education recently announced that the 90:10 quota favouring bumiputra students in the pre-university matriculation programme would be maintained.\nAlthough the overall number of places for university enrollment has been increased, the decision to maintain the ethnic quota has triggered dissatisfaction among Malaysians, especially non-bumiputras who had put high hopes on the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) government to move away from the past and towards a system premised on meritocracy.\nGlobally, there are different views on affirmative action and Malaysia is no exception.\nThe matriculation programme, seen as a fast-track option to enter public universities, was originally fully reserved for bumiputras. Since 2002, a 10 per cent non-bumiputra quota has been put in place.\nThe announcement that this would be maintained has revived the debate surrounding affirmative action and meritocracy in Malaysia.\nWhile some defend the matriculation policy, others decry it on grounds that it is unfair to continue depriving non-bumiputras of one of the channels to tertiary education.\nNo one is denying the need for affirmative action in Malaysia, especially in education. The pressing question, however, is whether the policies should be fine-tuned in keeping with the current political and social context.\nAFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR A RACIALLY EQUITABLE SOCIETY\nAffirmative action aims at levelling the playing field by giving those who have been underprivileged historically some assistance to be on a par with others. It should be emphasised that affirmative action should not be abused for political gains.\nBoth supporters and opponents generally agree that affirmative action in higher education is necessary in the context of Malaysia. However, over time, the process has deviated from its original goals.\nFor those against matriculation, the programme is widely seen as an easier channel for bumiputras to enter public universities. Many non-bumiputras are unhappy with what consequently seems like a restriction on educational opportunities for them.\nThe dissatisfaction is compounded by the fact that the alternative to this pre-university path – the Malaysian Higher School Certificate (STPM) – takes longer time to complete and is perceived to be more difficult.\nOver the years, this has led to a widespread belief that non-bumiputras have to work much harder to compete with the bumiputras for the same access to a place in university.\nOn the other hand, supporters of affirmative action insist that these practices are necessary to advance a more racially equitable society.\nIn a media interview in early May this year, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted as saying: “We decided to have matriculation classes because we found Malays did not take Higher School Certificate and cannot enter university. So we provided a back door for them. It was entirely meant as a back door for the Malays.”\nAlthough the pre-university matriculation route was officially designed for bumiputras, Dr Mahathir’s remarks seemed to suggest that it benefits only one community - Malaysian Malays.\nHowever, the broader issue here should be promoting and protecting access to higher education to all. Indigenous people, especially those in Sabah and Sarawak, often remain marginalised from university access despite having bumiputra status.\nIn the long run, the current matriculation model is not sustainable.\nOne of the main deficiencies is that it continues to set back bumiputra capability development, due to the perceived lower standards of the matriculation programme. If this goes on, it could also dilute the academic quality of public universities.\nThe grievances of non-bumiputras who feel left out should also be addressed.\nSince the 2018 general election that ended 61 years of Barisan Nasional (BN) regime, Malaysians have placed much hope on PH in building a new inclusive society. Such actions, which have\xa0been seen by\xa0many as a departure from PH’s election promise to do away with racial preferences to build a more equitable society, can provoke dissatisfaction.\nRIGHTS-BASED APPROACH SHOULD BE THE WAY FORWARD\nEducation is a universal human right, and after 61 years, it is high time to prioritise equitable access to higher education for all Malaysians.\nThe bumiputra privilege has been embedded in Malaysia for decades and eliminating it altogether is not a feasible or desirable move.\nAlthough affirmative action may be necessary to jumpstart aid for marginalised communities, such quotas should be a temporary measure. More work is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these programmes and design better policies that tackle the root of inequality.\nThus far, little is known about the efficacy of these existing programmes. To be sure, Malaysia is not the only country in the world that practices affirmative action in education, but its multiracial context has made it more challenging.\nIt’s also worth reviewing affirmative action after it’s been in place for so many decades, to see whether its definition in the context of Malaysia needs to be expanded to be more inclusive, given that it has been primarily based on race in practice.\nThe new government has to bear in mind how it handles the matriculation policy will set the tone for its approach in tackling disparity in the country.\nA rights-based approach that emphasises equity in opportunities is needed in order to create an environment that discourages discrimination and promotes equality and inclusivity, without affecting the quality of education.\nAs a compromise, there have been suggestions that ethnic quota can stay, but with improvements made on the criteria, such as prioritising the very poor, the B40 (bottom 40 per cent of households) and people in the rural areas, including the indigenous people.\nDr Mahathir’s Shared Prosperity 2030 economic model, which has the same aspiration as the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), should not be just a vision to reduce\xa0disparities\xa0between races or economic classes. It should also emphasise equal opportunities\xa0for all in a holistic manner.\nDr Khoo Ying Hooi is Deputy Head of Department and Senior Lecturer at the Department of International and Strategic Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Malaya.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ']}"

      Battling stigma and distrust, male pre-school teachers find joy in shaping young minds
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: At the age of 44, Lorbert Tay is well built and athletic, with photos in his office displaying his achievements in international triathlons.\nSo it is hard to imagine him as a pre-school teacher.\nBut for every photo of him competing in a triathlon or posing with a medal, there are others which showcase his love for children and passion for shaping young minds.\nIn one, he is taking a group of children on a hike, all of them clad in multicoloured ponchos. In another, he is in a supermarket, holding a fish and letting the children touch it.\nIt is clear that he is in his element when he is with the children. And likewise for them.\nScreams of “Teacher Lorbert!” fill the air as he makes his rounds in the pre-school. They run to him with brightened faces, some of them try to clamber onto his back while others reach for him, looking for a hug.\nWATCH: Meet the male pre-school teacher (7:05)\nA boy pulls a face at him. Tay grins and reciprocates, earning a giggle. Some children, he says later, even call him ‘Papa’ or ‘Daddy’.\nTay, a centre manager at pre-school chain Carpe Diem, is one of about 150 male pre-school educators in Singapore. They make up fewer than 1 per cent of the total pool of early childhood educators.\nHALF THE CLASS WANTED TO WITHDRAW\nAs a man in a female-dominated environment and working with young children on a daily basis, Tay is well aware that his presence can raise parents’ suspicions.\nHe remembers the first time he took a class on his own. It was 2010, and he was working for PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots, Singapore’s largest pre-school operator.\n“A lot of parents were very skeptical … What’s this guy doing here?” he says. “Their imagination went wild, and they thought I was some kind of weirdo or sicko, coming into the industry and trying to be a predator.\nThe following day, I heard from my principal … Half the class wanted to withdraw.\nIt was a sad moment for him. But he also remembers his principal encouraging him not to give up, and convincing the parents to give him a chance.\nHis first year in the industry was the toughest. “Parents were worried, so every small thing … even if it was a scratch or mosquito bite, was my fault,” he recounts. “I had to explain what my intentions were, from the start to the end, and build trust with them.”\nHe made an effort to think of novel ways to engage the children and help them learn.\n“There were sleepless nights,” he says. “I felt as if I needed to work extra hard to prove myself, so I dug up all the different YouTube videos to look for interesting things that I didn’t really see other teachers doing.\n“For the rest of the year, I had a lot of fun with the children, so much so that they didn’t want to end the day. By the end of the year, even the parents in the other classes wanted to ask for a transfer to my class.”\nALLAYING PARENTS’ CONCERNS\nToday, Tay is careful to ensure that nothing he does can be misconstrued by a parent.\nAs a male educator, he does not do routine care, such as showering the children or changing their diapers. He also has several unspoken rules, for example not entering the children’s bathroom unless necessary, so that he does not see a child in a state of undress.\nHe also limits his physical contact with the children, and over the years has developed guidelines for himself and any male teacher who might join the centre. For example, he uses only one arm to hug the children — and that hug is limited to a pat on the back.\nWhen he first joined the sector, he did not have specific guidelines setting out what he could or could not do as a male educator. He decided to develop his own to not only protect the children, but also himself.\n“I was very stressed,” he says. “I had to watch over my back to make sure that I didn’t do things that parents would feel awkward or upset about.”\nHe remembers once, early in his career, when he forgot himself and gave a child a full-on hug. “When I turned around, the parent was staring at me like a hawk,” he recalls. “That’s when I realised … oh no, I made the mistake I told myself not to do.”\nTo parents such as Elise Cheng, whose younger daughter attends Tay’s centre, it is clear that he makes the effort to minimise contact when he is with the children.\n“With two girls, I’ll always have this fear of physical contact,” she says. “We’ll always be worried about paedophiles or predators … especially when you read the news about people waiting outside schools to prey on girls.\n“But over time, when I saw (Tay) work, my trust increased, and now I’m very comfortable with him being with my two girls.”\nAdhering to his guidelines can be challenging, and even saddening at times, but he knows there are lines he cannot cross. “As much as I want to pour my love out to them, I have to control myself,” he says.\nHIRED ON THE SPOT\nAmid these challenges Tay has faced, he persevered because he had always known he wanted to teach.\nFollowing graduation with an information technology degree, even as he tried out different jobs — from IT to operations to sales — he would without fail apply to join the Ministry of Education (MOE) as a primary school teacher.\n“My friends believed I had a gift for touching the hearts of children,” he says. “They noticed that even their children who didn’t socialise well with strangers would simply enjoy my company, even when they saw me for the first time.”\nFor 10 years, there was no response from the MOE. But the chance to live out his dream arrived in 2009, when he came across a PCF booth at a job fair.\n“There was this man standing there who asked me if I was interested in becoming a pre-school teacher,” he recounts. “I told him I wanted to … shape (children’s) characters, and the best time to do it is when they’re young.”\nThe two continued talking. And suddenly, the man told him: “You’re hired.”\n“I hadn’t even brought my certificates or anything, and I didn’t even apply for the job proper,” Tay says, chuckling. He later found out that the man he had met was the PCF head.\n“The funny thing was, after I accepted the job, MOE called me back,” he adds.\nHe joined Sparkletots in 2010, juggling his work at the centre with his diploma studies in early childhood education. Despite the 50 per cent pay cut he had taken, the hard work and the challenges along the way, he was happy.\nTay worked his way up, joining various operators before taking on a more administrative role at Carpe Diem, making sure his centre runs smoothly.\nHe still enjoys the time he has with the children, and makes a point of greeting them by name every morning.\n“They appreciate these small gestures … and they’d feel happy and proud,” he explains. “I noticed that if they’re happy when they come in, they’d be happy throughout the day.”\nNOT THEIR FIRST CHOICE\nMale pre-school teachers are valued, according to the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), as they can “help to bring different strengths and perspectives to the sector”.\nBut the proportion of male educators in the sector has remained below 1 per cent for the past three years.\n“Some pre-school educators have shared that there may be a perception that the pre-school sector is more suited to women, and this may deter men from joining,” the ECDA said in an email response to CNA Insider.\nWATCH: It\'s tough being a pre-school teacher (4:03)\nMuhammad Hadi Kamal realised he was a “rose among the thorns” when he entered Temasek Polytechnic in 2010 to do his early childhood diploma course: Of the 60-odd students in the cohort, five were male.\nAnd for three of the five, the course was not their first choice, which had been psychology. “In early childhood, there are overlaps with psychology,” explains Hadi, 25 and now a teacher at NTUC First Campus – My First Skool.\nWhile he had always wanted to join the sector since he was a teenager, another teacher, 23-year-old Darius Ng, admits that he ended up in early childhood because his O-Level results did not make the cut for psychology. But he has, he said, since fallen in love with the job.\nAt school, they were “the centre of attention”, but Hadi shares how different it was after graduation: While pre-schools were inviting his female batchmates for centre tours or interviews, eight out of 10 times he received no response to his job applications.\nOne centre told him it “doesn’t accept male teachers at all”, he recalls. “I was taken aback.”\nBut today, Hadi is confident that the situation has improved. “The mindset has changed,” he says. “A lot of centres are taking in male teachers, especially those who are making a mid-career switch.”\nAccording to the ECDA, the proportion of full-time male students enrolled in the pre-employment training diploma courses has doubled from about 4 per cent in 2014 to 8 per cent in 2017, and remained stable last year.\nPCF Sparkletots and NTUC First Campus — both government-appointed anchor operators — said male educators are welcome in their centres.\n“The feedback from parents and fellow educators at PCF Sparkletots has been positive so far, as the presence of male pre-school educators contribute to gender balance in the classroom and enable children to be exposed to positive male role models,” stated the PCF.\nAs for guidelines, the ECDA said the Early Childhood Development Centres Regulations do not prescribe duties that male educators should or should not perform. Pre-schools may, however, develop their own guidelines on the duties of different groups of staff.\nGender-specific dos and don’ts were made clear to both Hadi and Ng at their respective centres. And while the latter stresses the importance of building trust with parents, he does not recall any negative experiences.\n“There was one parent of twin girls who asked my principal if I’d be bringing her daughters to the toilet. But I think she just needed the assurance that I wouldn’t be doing routine care,” he says.\n""Most parents just approach me with a smile and tell me that I’m rare.""\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE\nOver at Carpe Diem, where it is mealtime — with the clatter of spoons and clamour of children eating their pumpkin cake — Tay is in the thick of the action, seated on one of the child-sized chairs and helping the teachers spoon food into the children’s mouths.\n“I usually come over to de-stress,” he says as he cajoles a child to open her mouth. “Feeding the young ones is actually very therapeutic.”\n“Papa!” squeaks a child from across the table.\n“Someone has called me,” he says with a wistful smile. “The whole class … they’re all my children.”\nIt is a sad irony for him because instilling values and shaping the lives of the children in his care is the closest he can come to being a father: He is unable to have children of his own.\nTay explains that after a few years of trying for a child, he and his wife found out that she had developed a cancer in her womb. In 2014, the couple made the decision to remove the womb to stop the cancer from spreading.\nHis wife broke down when she heard the news, he recounts. He himself was sad, but kept his emotions in check because he did not want to upset her further.\n“She knew how much I wanted to have my own children, but I had to show her that it was okay,” he says. “Her health is more important.”\nTay has made his peace with that, and says he is content with the role he plays in the lives of the children he works with every day,\n“(My time with them) starts at 18 months, till they’re six years old. That’s a very long time,” he says. “So from seeing them grow from crying babies to mature boys and girls ready for primary school … that’s the biggest satisfaction I get.”\nBecause he knows he makes a difference in their lives.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      MOE investigators 'harassed' me: Teacher accused of taking students' money breaks down on stand
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: A teacher accused of pocketing S$40,000 from students broke down in court\xa0on Monday (Jun 24) as she described how she was ""humiliated"" and escorted by police officers in handcuffs in front of\xa0teachers and students.\nMaslinda Zainal, then\xa0Head of Department (HOD) for English at Woodgrove Secondary School, took the stand for the first time and told the court how Ministry of Education (MOE) investigators ""harassed"" her despite her telling them what she had used the money for.\nThe 44-year-old,\xa0who has a master\'s in education and had seven to eight teachers reporting to her at the time,\xa0is contesting two charges of criminal breach of trust as a public servant. She is accused of misappropriating about S$40,000 meant for students\' learning materials between January 2016 and April 2017.\nDressed in black, Maslinda took the stand for an ancillary hearing into the taking of a police statement.\nBursting into tears and sobbing at various parts of her testimony, Maslinda told the court that she had stayed up late\xa0marking her students\' essays the night before she was arrested.\nThe next morning, the vice-principal of the school told her to meet her at a conference room, where MOE investigators were waiting for her.\nShe said she did not know why they wanted to see her, and was told that the principal had made a complaint against her for over-collecting money from students. The evidence of the alleged crime was purportedly kept in a thick, red ring file the investigators had.\nMaslinda, who has since been suspended, said she asked to look at the file but was not allowed to.\n""I WAS TREATED AS IF I WAS GUILTY"": ACCUSED\n""After this, she started accusing me of using the money for things which I have never done,"" said\xa0Maslinda, referring to one of the investigators. ""She told me that I have used the money to pay for down payment of a property, to buy luxury products for myself. She accused me of splurging on myself, giving the money to others.""\nMaslinda said she explained that she had used the extra money to buy items for students such as assessment books and stationery, all of which were in her cubicle. However, she did not have any receipts or invoices to prove this.\n""She told me if you don\'t have receipts or invoices, then we cannot take that into account, (it\'s) your personal expenses,"" said Maslinda. ""I said - how can they be my personal expenses if the items are all sitting in my cubicle?""\nAfter this the MOE investigators ""ransacked"" her cubicle, Maslinda said, going through her cupboard, drawers and looking under her desk.\nWhen prompted by defence lawyer Singa Retnam to share how she felt, Maslinda said: ""I was very disappointed because regardless of what I said, regardless of what I had shown to (the investigators), they were still harassing me and asking me what I did with the money.""\n""I was treated as if I was guilty, I was treated as if I was a criminal,"" said Maslinda.\xa0\nShe said she told an MOE investigator that she had ""given up"" because the investigator was still ""harassing"" her\xa0to admit that she had used the money, even though she had explained what she used the money for.\nI FELT HUMILIATED: ACCUSED\nThe police arrived and handcuffed Maslinda, escorting her down to the carpark where a police car waited.\n""There were teachers and students at the time, your honour,"" Maslinda told District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam, breaking down and crying. ""I felt ... humiliated.""\nMaslinda said she was taken to Jurong Police Station and cuffed to a railing at the basement carpark for about an hour, before she was taken for photo-taking, finger-printing and blood-sampling.\n""They took away my belongings, they told me to remove my hijab and they also took away my spectacles,"" said Maslinda. ""I told this officer that I can’t see without my glasses, but she insisted that I surrender my spectacles.""\nShe began sobbing again when describing how she asked to call her husband as her son, who went to Woodgrove Secondary, was waiting for her to take him home.\nShe claimed that a police officer, Station Inspector Navindeer Singh, accused her of taking about S$300,000. He came to this figure by multiplying S$20,000 - the approximate figure for each of her two charges - by 15 years, the total time she had been at the school.\n""I told him that I did not do such a thing and I broke down and cried very, very badly,"" said Maslinda. ""He then threatened me. He said - as a civil servant, when you\'re charged with criminal breach of trust, are you aware that you\'re facing a life sentence, you will never see your family ever again.""\nShe claimed that the officer said the police would let her off and not charge her if she signed on a statement they had prepared for her and agreed to pay ""whatever amount"" they asked her to.\nClaiming that she was ""really very, very scared"", Maslinda said she would agree to anything and signed the statement without reading it.\nIn one of the statements she had given to police, Maslinda admitted to taking about S$10,000.\nThe prosecution in its cross-examination said Maslinda had made several allegations in the hearing that were not previously made through her lawyers.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor David Koh put it to Maslinda that with her experience and education, she would have signed on a police statement only if it contained her words.\nShe answered that logically, one would think that someone with her education and experience would sign a statement only if it were hers, but disagreed that she had done so, as she said she was very fearful at the time.\nThe trial continues for the rest of the week.\nIf convicted of criminal breach of trust, Maslinda can be jailed up to 10 years and fined for each charge.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     schools ', '     education ']}"

      Singapore teachers work longer hours than OECD average: International survey
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Teachers in Singapore continue to work longer hours than the average\xa0in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, but the situation has improved, according to survey results released on Wednesday (Jun 19).\nThey reported working 46 hours per week in 2018, according to the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) of lower secondary school teachers. This is higher than the OECD average of 39 hours.\xa0The hours include those spent working out of school.\nThis makes Singapore teachers the seventh-hardest working educators\xa0in the survey of 48 education systems. Japan’s lower secondary teachers worked the longest hours, followed by Kazakhstan and those in Alberta, Canada.\nA total of about 3,300 teachers and their principals from 157 public schools and 12 randomly selected private schools participated in the online survey.\nREDUCTION IN ADMINISTRATIVE WORK\nIn 2013, when the survey was previously conducted, Singapore teachers worked a longer 48 hours per week.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) said the time spent at work has dropped largely due to a reduction in administrative duties. The number of hours spent on such tasks fell from 5.3 hours a week in 2013 to 3.8 hours in 2018. This was however higher than the OECD average of 2.7 hours.\n“The drop in amount of time teachers spend on administrative work is significant, because we’ve been working on these areas. Most significant, for example, is attendance marking on the app. That has helped save teachers time from marking,” MOE said.\nAnother common administrative task - getting consent forms signed for activities like learning journeys - has also been improved through an app that allows parents to give their consent electronically.\nTIME SPENT MARKING ALSO LESS\nOf the 46 hours, 18 were spent on teaching.\xa0\nThe hours teachers spend working also include lesson planning and preparation, co-curricular activities and marking. When it comes to marking, teachers are able to use an online platform that shows their students’ learning gaps, MOE said.\nMOE said: “That will save time because what is important is for our teachers to be able to look at the gaps and address them.”\nThe teachers spent 7.5 hours a week marking in 2018, lower than the 8.7 hours in 2013. In comparison, their OECD colleagues spent 4.2 hours doing so.\nWhen asked if Singapore will strive for the OECD weekly average of 39 hours, an MOE spokesperson said: “The question we will often be asked is ‘what is the right calibration’? I think the answer must be what we think we need to do for our students to make sure they are ready for the future. What number is the correct number? Nobody will be able to tell.”\nHe added that the ministry's focus is to make sure that teachers are well looked-after, and that when they are working hard, they are passionate about it, and feel good that they are helping students in as many ways as possible.\n“Those are much more important factors than just how many hours,” he added.\nLOWER SECONDARY TEACHERS A PASSIONATE BUNCH\nThe survey findings also showed that Singapore’s lower secondary teachers are passionate, MOE said. Almost all (98 per cent) lower secondary teachers in Singapore polled, indicated that they became teachers because the job allows them to influence the development of young people, and for about 70 per cent of them, teaching was their first career choice.\nThe findings also showed that the teachers are constantly honing their skills and enhancing their teaching practices and pedagogy,\xa0the spokesperson said.\nOECD singled out Singapore as a country where “continuous professional development is ingrained in a school’s shared vision of professional learning”, the ministry added.\nDESIRE FOR MORE TRAINING TO DEAL WITH SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS\nHowever, some teachers felt the need for professional development in teaching students with special educational needs. In 2018, the percentage of teachers who indicated such a need was 20 per cent, compared to 15 per cent in 2013.\n“This reflects the desire of our teachers to equip themselves with the necessary skills and competencies to better cater to the increasingly diverse learning needs of students, as our schools become more inclusive,” MOE said.\nCurrently, all schools have a core group of teachers equipped with skills to teach students with mild special educational needs.\nThe proportion of teachers who have participated in professional development on teaching students with special needs increased from 23 per cent in 2013 to 35 per cent in 2018.\nTeachers here have also increasingly been using practices that encourage deeper learning, and are more confident in using a variety of assessment practices, according to the survey.\xa0\nThey are also devoting more effort in providing qualitative feedback. In 2018, 77 per cent of the teachers surveyed provided written feedback in addition to a mark, compared to 72 per cent in 2013. The 2018 OECD average was 58 per cent.\nDirector-General of Education Wong Siew Hoong said that MOE is heartened the teachers are passionate about developing students to their fullest potential.\n“Being lifelong learners ourselves is what will put teachers in the best position to help students become future-ready and more importantly, want to keep learning throughout life too. The survey findings have also provided us with valuable insights into areas that we can work on, as we continue to support teachers in the important work that we do,” he said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Ministry of Education ', '     education ']}"

      NUS accepts recommendations by review committee on sexual misconduct
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The National University of Singapore\'s (NUS)\xa0Board of Trustees said on Monday (Jun 10) that it accepts ""in full"" the final recommendations made by the review committee on sexual misconduct, which were submitted earlier in the day.\xa0\nThe school convened the review committee in mid-April after undergraduate Monica Baey called for ""justice"" against a fellow student who filmed her having a shower at her hostel.\xa0\n""The Board accepts the Committee\'s recommendations in full,"" said board chairman Hsieh Fu Hua in a statement. ""We feel that the recommendations are informed, balanced and robust.\xa0\n""It reflects our community\'s common desire for tougher penalties for offenders and greater support for victims, and for fostering an enduring culture of respect and support on campus.""\nThe committee shared its preliminary recommendations last month, such as tougher penalties on offenders, including a minimum one-year suspension, a notation reflecting the suspension on the offender\'s transcript and expulsion for severe offences.\xa0\nThe committee also said it was reviewing the university\'s proposal for a dedicated care unit for victims of sexual misconduct cases.\xa0\nA summary of the committee\'s final recommendations, which was disseminated to NUS students, staff and alumni on Monday, provided updates on these items.\nThere were 10\xa0recommendations in total, the first of which was the aforementioned tougher penalties for sexual misconduct.\xa0\nThe committee reiterated the proposal for a minimum one-year suspension, which it elaborated cannot be overridden or removed by the Board of Discipline (BOD), as well as immediate expulsion for ""severe instances or aggravated forms of offences of sexual misconduct"".\xa0\nIt was also recommended that offenders have a notation of the length of their suspension on their academic transcripts, which can be expunged three years from the offender\'s date of degree conferment.\xa0\nTo guard against reoffending, offenders must also be certified fit by a counsellor and/or medical professional before they are allowed to return to campus after suspension.\xa0\nIn addition, a ""no-contact protocol"" would be established ""to ensure that the victim and offender do not come into contact with each other ... for example, ensuring that they do not take the same classes or non-academic programmes"".\xa0\nIn its recommendations, the committee said\xa0it supports NUS\' plan to launch a new compulsory module, Respect and Consent Culture, which will\xa0begin in the 2019/2020 academic year.\xa0\n""The Committee notes that the University will conduct first responder training commencing in June 2019 to ensure that all first responders know how to communicate and help victims. This would involve campus security officers, masters, resident fellows and residential advisers,"" said the committee.\xa0\nOn top of these, the committee also recommended that past cases on which the BOD had formally ruled and for which sanctions have been meted out, ""cannot be reopened"".\xa0\n""Our recommended changes will form the basis of the University\'s tougher stance on sexual misconduct and discipline going forward,"" it said.\xa0\nBETTER VICTIM SUPPORT\nAt least four of the recommendations were related to victim support.\xa0\nIn a bid to ""give victims a greater voice in the disciplinary process"", the committee recommended that they be kept up-to-date on the proceedings, allowed to fill a statement of facts before the BOD hearing, allowed to fill an impact statement and offer clarifications on it in front of the BOD, and given an avenue to request for a review of BOD outcomes in exceptional circumstances.\xa0\nThe committee also recommended that the BOD composition be reviewed to ensure adequate gender balance among members.\xa0\nOne of the recommendations involved the assignment of a care officer to each victim at the point an incident is reported, after the committee found that a single point-of-contact for victims had been lacking, ""therefore risking a lack of continuity in victim care"".\xa0\nThe care officer will accompany the victim in dealing with law enforcement, as well as support the victim through the disciplinary process and interface with other support units across the school.\xa0\nThe committee also said it supports the establishment of the victim care unit, adding that care officers must have relevant experience in counselling, social work or psychology.\xa0\nIt also highlighted the need for a dedicated website providing information and advice for sexual misconduct victims, including clear reporting and support mechanisms like essential contact numbers and whistleblowing channels.\xa0\nAdditionally, the committee proposed that NUS streamline the number of units involved in the disciplinary process, as well as provide a timeline for such processes outlining when each stage of the process should be completed.\xa0\nCAMPUS SECURITY\nIn early May, an email outlining measures to step up campus safety was issued to students by the school\'s senior deputy president and provost Professor Ho Teck Hua.\xa0\nAmong these measures were more secure shower cubicles, new restroom locks and at least 300 new cameras.\xa0\nIn its summary of recommendations, the committee said it ""agrees that these tools should significantly enhance campus safety and security"".\xa0\nBut the committee also said: ""Beyond infrastructure and security, the Committee would like to reiterate the importance of imbuing a culture of safety and mutual care among NUS staff and students, particularly as to the issue of non-resident’s ability to gain unauthorised access to hostels.\xa0\n""Safety cannot be compromised and everyone must be mindful to uphold and observe safety measures.""\nMr Hsieh said that the board will conduct a follow-up review of the disciplinary and support frameworks in two years to ensure that they ""remain effective and relevant"".\xa0\nHe thanked students, staff and alumni for their contributions, calling them a ""significant part of the review process"".\xa0\n""The University is committed to your safety and well-being, and with these new measures, we will build a stronger system that our entire community can stand behind,"" he said.\xa0\nEDUCATION MINISTER\xa0WELCOMES ""ROBUST SET OF MEASURES""\nThe recommendations constitute a ""robust set of measures"" which will ""provide better support for victims, take the offenders to task, deter future offenders and improve the safety of the campus"", Education Minister Ong Ye Kung wrote\xa0in a Facebook post on Monday.\nThe minister had previously said\xa0the penalties imposed on the perpetrator in Ms Baey\'s case were\xa0""manifestly inadequate"". He\xa0had also asked other universities to review their frameworks for similar offences.\nThanking the NUS review committee for their hard work, Mr Ong said: ""It has been a difficult period for the NUS community, but by taking swift and decisive action, NUS will emerge stronger and better.\n""The other institutes of higher learning are also conducting their reviews, and (the) Ministry of Education, Singapore\xa0will continue to work with them to help ensure a safe and supportive environment for our students.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     National University of Singapore ', '     NUS ', '     education ', '     crime ']}"

       Commentary: Teachers love their jobs and feel valued but face immense challenges
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Teachers in Singapore, as elsewhere, play an indispensable role in educating students, not only in terms of academic content but also in terms of values and attitudes.\nThey are also responsible for guiding students through various education pathways and preparing them for adulthood.\nTeachers passionate about their work derive intrinsic joy from intangible rewards, such as when learners suddenly understand a concept, or when former students thank them for their guidance.\nThese rewards do not detract from the reality that teaching is often tough work and involves its own particular set of stressors.\nSTRESS, BULLYING AND EXCESSIVE WORKLOADS\nA recent CNA commentary reported that 80 per cent of Australian teachers surveyed in a research study had experienced verbal or physical bullying and harassment from students or parents.\nAbout 83 per cent of respondents revealed a desire to leave the profession due to teacher-targeted student and parental bullying.\nAnother recent survey, this time conducted in the United Kingdom by the charity Education Support Partnership, examined the mental health and wellbeing of teachers, senior teachers, school leaders and lecturers in the further, adult and vocational education sectors, as well as other non-teaching staff like school business managers.\nRespondents said they loved their work primarily because they wanted to work with children and make a difference in their lives, and they had a very strong passion for a job they found rewarding. Many also enjoyed working with like-minded individuals.\nHowever, 64 per cent of teachers reported feeling stressed at work, with 29 per cent working an average of more than 51 hours per week.\nExcessive workload, inadequate work-life balance and dealing with poor student behaviour in class contributed to poor mental health.\nThese two research studies raise questions about the situation facing Singapore teachers, their working conditions and the challenges they face.\nMOVES TO BOOST TEACHING SECTOR IN SINGAPORE\nThe number of teachers in Singapore has increased over the past two decades, from over 22,200 to just over 33,100 in 1998 and 2017 respectively.\nOver the same time period, the percentage of teachers with university degrees has almost doubled from 45 per cent to 89 per cent.\nAs a result of large-scale recruitment beginning in 1996, only about half of teachers today have fewer than 10 years of teaching experience.\nThe Ministry of Education has introduced measures to keep salaries competitive.\nAt the same time, the Ministry has tried to professionalise teaching. Within the past decade, it introduced an Ethos of the Teaching Profession and a Code of Professional Conduct for Educators that outline key roles and responsibilities.\nIt has also put in place comprehensive professional development schemes and diversified career tracks.\nThere is also a Teachers’ Work Attachment programme to enable teachers to take part in short-term attachments at external organisations in order to broaden their perspectives.\nHOW DO TEACHERS FEEL?\nLittle is known about Singapore teachers’ work conditions except through the findings of two cross-national surveys.\nThe OECD’s Teaching and Learning International Survey 2013 published its findings in 2014. Singapore had the youngest teaching force across the countries surveyed.\nAlmost 90 per cent of teachers said they were satisfied with their job, with 82 per cent reporting they would still choose to be a teacher if they could decide again. About 7 in 10 believed the teaching profession was valued in Singapore.\nTeachers claimed to work an average of 56 hours per week, which indicated a lot of work was done after official school hours.\nBesides\xa0spending most of their working time on teaching, planning and marking, teachers also said they had to engage in administrative work, teamwork with colleagues, student counselling, extracurricular activities and manage parents.\nAnother survey, the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Status Index 2018, revealed that teachers worked 52 hours per week, more than the 45.33 hours that the general public estimated teachers’ working hours to be.\nJust 31 per cent of Singapore parents would probably or definitely encourage their children to become teachers.\nNeither of these two surveys dealt with the main stresses and challenges facing Singapore teachers. Although the Ministry of Education conducts regular staff climate surveys in schools, these findings are not made publicly available.\nKEEPING UP WITH SLEW OF REFORMS\nOne of the major challenges teachers face is keeping pace with the slew of education reforms introduced during the past two decades.\nThese include applied learning programmes, the Direct Schools Admission scheme, changes to the PSLE scoring system, subject-based banding in secondary schools, just to name a few, not to mention greater mainstreaming of special needs students, the reduction in the number of tests and examinations and the creation of multiple pathways to educational success.\nThese reforms do not only involve teachers redesigning pedagogies and subject content, but more critically, teachers unlearning some of their own preconceptions of teaching based on their own experiences as students in order to embrace different ways of thinking about education.\nTeachers need professional development in order to better acquaint themselves with how to respond to the reforms.\nOnly then can they be effective frontline ambassadors for these reforms by enacting them and explaining their rationale and their workings to students and parents.\nMany parents are feeling bewildered about these reforms and are understandably influenced by their own experiences and conceptions of what learning involve.\nStudents and parents will judge the efficacy and meaningfulness of these reforms partly through how they perceive teachers, who are key intermediaries of the Education Ministry, to be implementing them.\nA QUESTIONING PUBLIC\nTeaching is unlike other professions such as medicine and the law. The general public feels at ease questioning teachers’ professional expertise compared to doctors or lawyers.\nMaintaining healthy partnerships with students and parents can be a challenging task.\nThere are no official statistics on teachers being bullied or harassed by students and parents, though there are occasional press reports of students verbally or physically abusing teachers, or surreptitiously filming them and uploading the videos onto social media.\nThere are also some parents and students who dispute schools’ disciplinary procedures and even file lawsuits against educators and schools.\nOne of these cases involved a parent suing his son’s secondary school in 2017 after his son’s smartphone\xa0was confiscated for a three-month period as punishment for using it during school hours.\nAnother case saw a teenager suing her former secondary school for failing to protect her from alleged bullying by her peers.\nSuch cases show a worrying tendency by parents and students to view their relationships with schools in an unnecessarily adversarial manner.\nThe task of maintaining teacher and student respect for teachers has been complicated by the growth of the private tutoring industry.\nThe concept of teacher has now expanded beyond the school to include private tutors and school attendance is no longer necessarily the sole means to attain academic success.\nWith the ubiquity of social media and smartphones, it is now much easier for parents, students and also school leaders to communicate with teachers. The boundaries between work and personal time have been increasingly blurred.\nTeachers are often expected to be selflessly committed to developing and nurturing students. However, they also need to guard against work demands intruding into their enjoyment of a healthy personal and family life.\nCHALLENGES TEACHERS FACE ARE WELL RECOGNISED\nThere are some indicators that the challenge teachers face in working with stakeholders received attention from officials. In 2012 then Minister for Education Heng Swee Keat said that teachers could not be surrogate parents, while urging parents to be supportive of their children’s teachers.\nMore recently, the Ministry of Education has published guidelines for fostering healthy school-home partnerships.\nAt the same time, the Singapore Teachers’ Union offers talks for teachers on topics like teachers’ rights and limitations in disciplining their students, teachers’ liabilities to their students vis-à-vis the Tort of Negligence, managing challenging parents, managing students with disruptive behaviours and navigating the social media landscape for student/parent engagement.\nThe third main challenge teachers face is dealing with the intense human emotions involved in their work. Because of the high-stakes competitive nature of education in Singapore, all major stakeholders – teachers, students and parents – invest not only time and effort but also a great deal of emotional energy into schooling.\nWorking together while grappling with one’s own, as well as others’, beliefs, attitudes and actions is not always easy.\nIt’s clear Singapore teachers face a few major challenges in their work. These challenges, if not carefully dealt with, may lead to unhealthy levels of stress.\nThe rapidity of educational reform and the increasing demands of other stakeholders mean that teachers have to work extra hard to live up to the onerous expectations being placed upon them.\nAnother recent CNA commentary highlighted the danger of work burn-out due to work stress, with approximately two in three employees reporting above average to high levels of stress.\nTeachers and other stakeholders therefore need to pay attention to the issue of work stress in order not to impair teachers’ ability to continue being stellar educators.\nJason Tan is associate professor at the National Institute of Education.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Can ‘alternative schools’ revolutionise Thai education and improve children's capabilities? 
  </h1>, 'text': 'HUAY PAN, Thailand: The school children of Huay Pan are getting ready for their afternoon lesson where they will be taught about water.\nThere is nothing particularly unusual about what their teacher has got planned for them, with one exception. The classroom will be\xa0the Nan River, a 740-km tributary that flows through their little village in one of the most remote parts in northern Thailand.\nEight students aged between six and 14 swim to a clearing on the muddy riverbank. They sit in a circle with their teacher and discuss what they have to find out during the class.\n“Today, we’ll learn how to find food in the river. Do you see what your parents are doing in the water behind you?” Saranporn “Mon” Ratsiwo asks her students.\xa0\n“Fishing!” they all reply.\n“Your parents will be your teachers this afternoon. So, let’s find out what methods they use to catch fish and what else we can find in the water besides fish, shrimps and seaweed. There may be other things in there,” the teacher says to her excited pupils.\nThe class moves into the river. Young children hold their parent’s hand as they walk on slippery river rocks while the older ones dash past with fishnets and swimming goggles.\xa0\nHands-on experience in outdoor classes forms a significant part of teaching and learning at the Huay Pan Learning Centre – the only school that is easily accessible by the village children, who\xa0would otherwise have to travel up to 120 kilometres\xa0to get a basic education.\nUnlike Thai mainstream schools, the Huay Pan Learning Centre offers ‘alternative education’ to children from kindergarten to junior high school.\xa0Its curriculum not only covers the core subjects laid out by the Education Ministry but also incorporates lessons on issues that directly impact the village such as soil, water, forest and food security.\xa0\nEven more unusual when compared with mainstream schools, the Huay Pan Learning centre offers its students a say in what they are taught.\xa0Children get to\xa0choose what they want to learn and\xa0do not have to sit\xa0exams. Evaluation takes place throughout the academic year and marks are accumulated through project work.\xa0\nAs for teachers, they are not lecturers\xa0but rather mentors who design an active learning environment and ask questions designed to\xa0trigger students’ curiosity.\xa0\n“Traditional education in Thailand is like learning in a small square room. But here, our students learn from first-hand experiences in their environment. They learn by seeing and touching real things, and that brings happiness to the learning process,"" Mon told CNA.\nThe style adopted by alternative schools contrasts with the approach of many of their mainstream peers in Thailand, where learning by rote in a formal classroom environment is the norm. Students and teachers\' interactions tend to be formal and lectures are more generally take precedence over discussions.\nAt Huay Pan, however,\xa0children are encouraged to have an inquiring mind. They are taught to\xa0observe their surroundings, ask questions and seek the answers themselves.\n""If we keep feeding them knowledge, they won’t research or think further. But if they’re curious, the knowledge stays with them,” Mon said.\nTHAILAND’S FAILING EDUCATION\nWhile\xa0schools in Thailand strive for academic excellence, teachers at Huay Pan aim to make education fun in order to unlock\xa0students\' full potential.\xa0\nIn fact, this method of teaching and learning is gaining popularity among parents in the Southeast Asian country, where the mainstream education system has shown signs of shortcomings in academic achievements.\nA worldwide survey on educational systems showed\xa0Thailand could do better. In 2015, the country came in 54th place in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which involved\xa0540,000 students from 72 countries and economies.\nThe triennial study evaluates the capabilities of 15-year-old students\xa0in science, mathematics and reading to determine their ability to\xa0utilise in real life what they have studied. Its 2015 assessment revealed Thailand scored\xa0lower than average in every field, while Southeast Asian neighbours Singapore and Vietnam – the first and the eighth in the 2015 global ranking – exceeded the mean threshold.\nIn fact, Thailand\'s performance has seen a declining trend\xa0since 2000 when the country first participated in the PISA study.\xa0\n“Almost half of Thai children lack these foundation skills. At this age, many of them stop school to start working. This means we have a workforce with this much ability in Thailand and this is more worrisome than scoring less than other countries,” said Nicha Pittayapongsakorn, an educational researcher from the Thailand Development Research Institute.\n“We should focus on how we can develop most people in the country. If Thai schools are to catch up with the world right now, they can’t just exist as a place that feeds kids with academic knowledge.""\nFor ex-Education Minister Teerakiat Jareonsettasin, however, Thailand\'s PISA performance does not signify shortcomings in its educational system. He also claimed the reading test used academic lingo Thai students struggled to understand which affected their scores.\n“Even English speakers found it confusing. They had to read it over and over again. When it was translated into Thai, the translation wasn’t inaccurate but they used academic lingo. I don’t want to say it was comparable to Google Translation. It wasn’t that bad but it was difficult for Thai children,” he told local media last year.\nStill, many parents believe mainstream education is not enough for their children’s future. Among them is mother-of-one Pornthawan Chanchitsophon, who has recently enrolled her son in an alternative school in Bangkok.\n“Parents nowadays don’t think academic excellence can help their children survive. Life skills are important and children who graduate from alternative schools will be equipped with them,” she told CNA.\nPornthawan believes a holistic learning process will help her son develop his creativity, logic and\xa0sense of responsibility.\xa0""Children\xa0have opportunities to express their opinions and feelings while learning hands-on experience at alternative schools,"" she added.\nIn Thailand, however, tuition fees for alternative schools are usually comparatively high. Not every family can afford to pay for private educational establishments offering an alternative curriculum. Most children attend public schools where traditional teaching and learning methods are the norm.\xa0\nTo improve Thai education, Nicha said\xa0the national curriculum needs adjusting to develop non-academic skills.\n“The curriculum we’re using is packed with academic content. But in this era, it’s no longer about what content we should feed children with but rather how to create a learning method in classrooms that enables them to seek knowledge themselves, analyse the information they find and use it to create something new,” she told CNA.\n“Alternative schools play\xa0a key role here because they have proved that non-traditional teaching and learning methods are possible in Thailand. In the 21st century, children should have skills in critical thinking, communication and teamwork. Right now, alternative schools have already picked up on these, and actively too.”\nLIFE IS LEARNING AND CLASSROOMS ARE EVERYWHERE\nVarious efforts have been made to improve Thai education. Many public schools have visited their alternative partners to observe their teaching and learning techniques in order to adjust their own methods.\nRoong Aroon School - School of Dawn - in the capital Bangkok is among Thailand’s most prominent pioneers in alternative education.\xa0\nA private non-profit organisation, it regularly welcomes representatives from schools across the country to observe the way its teachers and students interact on its premises – an 8-hectare natural classroom that includes a massive pond surrounded by wooden school buildings, a rice field, a forest garden and a waste sorting facility.\nThe school uses a holistic approach to teach some 1,400 students from kindergarten to high school the art of living with self-reliance. Since young age, children make their own lunch, grow rice and sort the school’s waste for recycling.\n“Life is learning. We learn all the time. Classrooms are everywhere and so are textbooks; they aren’t limited to square rooms, books or pages. Every place presents a learning opportunity,""\xa0said the founder of Roong Aroon School, Prapapat Niyom.\xa0\nTeachers are designers who make it possible for children to learn from nature around them, from society and people, from livelihoods and resources.\xa0\n""Our school creates opportunities for all children to reach their learning potential in the most effective way possible,"" she added.\nBesides studying\xa0the core subjects, students at Roong Aroon School also gain other skills from holistic learning processes. Subjects are integrated and teachers are tasked to create active learning opportunities. Children are encouraged to research, communicate and work in a team\xa0through hands-on practices in real situations.\nFor example, when Grade 4 students have to learn about the capital, they have to find where they live on the map and how to get around Bangkok - which bus numbers to take, how much money they have to prepare, and how far they have to walk.\xa0\xa0\xa0\nBack in Huay Pan, the children help their parents build a small barrier with mud and rocks. The technique is part of the local wisdom to divert the water flow.\xa0When the area behind the wall goes dry, the children find small fish and shrimps stuck between the rocks.\xa0\nScreams of excitement fill the valley whenever someone manages to catch them.\n""Practical knowledge they\'ve learned since since young age is part of the nurturing.\xa0Each community has its own context and we should use it to find out what children need to learn,""\xa0Mon said.\xa0\n""Students here can go to the jungle without bringing\xa0any food but rice. They can fish, make a fire, use bamboos as food containers, and eat. And that’s important for them – the survival skills.""\n', 'related_topics': ['     Thailand ', '     education ']}"

  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Alleviating health concerns that may arise in a pre-school with hundreds of children is a priority at NTUC First Campus My First Skool’s first and largest Early Years Centre, said its general manager.\nThe childcare centre in Punggol, which officially opened on Thursday (May 23), can take in up to 1,065 pupils, including 160 babies. More than 600 children from two months to four years old are already enrolled at the facility, which first started operating in May 2018.\nThe large childcare centre will use a temperature scanner to automatically take the temperatures of children as they enter the school every morning.\nThis helps to ease some of the potential health concerns for a large campus, such as containing an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), said Ms Thian Ai Ling, general manager of My First Skool.\n""Although it’s a large centre, it’s actually many small centres existing side by side,"" said Ms Thian. ""We can contain it quite quickly and we can have the other children move to safer places.""\nThe 8,785 sqm centre located beside Punggol MRT station is also the only Early Years Centre in Singapore with a fully-equipped commercial kitchen.\nAll meals for the children are cooked and baked daily by an eight-person kitchen crew, led by a head chef with 15 years of experience.\nFood poisoning incidents at pre-schools have hit the headlines recently, with more than 250 affected by a gastroenteritis outbreak at multiple PCF Sparkletots centres in March.\nResponding to queries about food hygiene, NTUC First Campus said that all in-house cooks and attendants are required to attend food and hygiene courses by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA).\n""We also have a practice that we are going to kick in very soon, which is to keep small samples of food,"" said Ms Thian. ""So should there, unfortunately, be an incident we can then attribute the causes and be able to find out what caused it.""\nShe added that there have been concerns from parents about the massive size of the childcare centre.\n""Sometimes they may have certain questions (like), will my child receive the attention from the teacher because they just think the centre is large,” she said.\nBut Ms Thian stressed that every room is attended by various teachers, following ECDA guidelines for staff-child ratios.\n""The attention is still the same as before, if not better. In fact, now the children get to enjoy so many more diverse learning spaces, indoors and outdoors,"" she added.\nFive playscapes have been designed for the children to play outdoors, including\xa0a\xa0zone for children to grow their own plants and food, a water play area, rock climbing mounds and a cycling track.\nThe large space also allows for\xa0five indoor learning zones such as\xa0a reading zone with libraries shaped like different vehicles.\nOther features include a\xa0naturally ventilated atrium with long ramps to encourage children and parents to interact while walking up to class instead of taking the lift.\nMs Thian said that the expansive floor area means that children are able to clock up to 19,000 steps a day in the three-storey building.\nEarly Years Centres are part of the government\'s plan to create 200,000 childcare places by 2023.\nThe pre-school is one of three new large childcare centres in Punggol and Sengkang that will be set up by 2021 to meet the demand for pre-school places.\xa0\nLast month, a PCF Sparkletots centre which can accommodate 1,060 children was launched in Punggol North.\nUpon reaching the age of five, children enrolled in these centres can move on to a partner Ministry of Education kindergarten in the area.\n""We want to provide Singapore\'s families with accessible, affordable childcare ... to ensure that all our children can have a good start in life,"" said National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) secretary-general Ng Chee Meng at the opening of the centre.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     children ']}"

      Online petition calling for removal of Malaysia's Education Minister gains traction
  </h1>, 'text': 'KUALA LUMPUR: A petition calling for Malaysian Education Minister Maszlee Malik to be replaced has garnered more than 110,000 signatories, as he continued\xa0to face pressure over controversial remarks linking pre-university entry to job discrimination against bumiputras.\nThe online petition\xa0- started around three weeks ago - gained momentum over the weekend after the minister said on Thursday (May 16) that if the racial quota for the pre-university matriculation programme was\xa0to be removed, then bumiputras should not be denied jobs for not being able to speak Mandarin.\nMr Stephen Ng, who started the petition\xa0and says he is a concerned parent, has\xa0urged Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to sack Dr Maszlee for his “nonsensical policies”.\xa0\nThese include a ruling mandating that all children must wear black shoes to school, introduction of swimming as a co-curricular activity and building a cashless eco-system in schools, said Mr Ng.\xa0\n“Maszlee is a newbie in politics and has little or no experience in any administrative position.\n“To expect him to run a ministry that is so important to all Malaysians is like bringing the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government to a political suicide,” the petition read.\nWhen PH formed the federal government in May last year, Dr Mahathir had appointed himself as the education minister despite a pledge in PH’s election manifesto stating that the premier would not be holding double portfolios.\nHe later\xa0relinquished\xa0the post and\xa0picked former university lecturer Dr Maszlee from his Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia to take over.\nSince then, Dr Maszlee has attracted controversy for his decisions and statements. There has been a steady drumbeat against him\xa0for focusing on trivial matters instead of pressing educational issues.\nIn defending his Thursday remarks, the Simpang Renggam Member of Parliament reportedly told journalists on Saturday that his original intention was to highlight PH’s “shared prosperity” vision for all as a means to bring about changes to the current situation. However, only one particular point on\xa0retaining the racial quota\xa0attracted widespread attention, the minister\xa0noted.\nThe pre-university matriculation programme was rolled out in 1998 to create more opportunities for bumiputras to seek higher education in science, technology and applied arts.\nTen per cent of the seats were subsequently allocated to non-bumiputras in 2003, hence putting in place the 90:10 ethnic quota.\nACADEMICS THROW WEIGHT BEHIND MINISTER\nWhile politicians from both divides have called out on Dr Maszlee for his\xa0comments, local academics have come to his defence.\nVice-Chancellor Asma Ismail from Universiti Sains Malaysia, where Dr Maszlee uttered the said remarks last Thursday, said the minister should be praised for defending the bumiputra quota for matriculation programme.\nLamenting that the pressure of language requirement for jobs\xa0in the market is real but often swept under the carpet, Dr Asma said education should be the tool to bridge inequality.\nShe called for a reformation of the education system, with a focus on unity in diversity.\n“It is important that bumiputras – a majority of which are from low-income group – be given access to education to ensure fair and balance distribution of economy,” she said.\nUniversiti Utara Malaysia Vice-Chancellor Ahmad Bashawir Abdul Ghani also issued a statement supporting the racial entry quota of matriculation, which was first established to address racial imbalance at public universities.\nHowever,\xa0Penang Deputy Chief Minister P\xa0Ramasamy who has been critical of the minister\'s comments, said there is no need for the academics to defend him.\n""I don’t think there is a need for university officials to come to his defence unless, of course, they want to ingratiate themselves to him for certain reasons,” he was quoted as saying by the New Straits Times on Tuesday.\xa0\nSeparately, a change.org petition in support of Dr Maszlee – started a year ago to defend his appointment as the education minister\xa0– also gained refreshed support, with over 280,000 signatures collected so far.\n“With reforms in education driving his main agenda, this man is setting the change in education we all have been waiting for,” it read.\n\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ']}"

      The Big Read: With mid-year exams scrapped, students rediscover joy of learning — yet old habits die hard
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: For those growing up in Singapore, it has become a rite of passage that they go through not once, but at least twice a year: The dreaded academic examinations.\nAnd it is the time of the year again, when the majority of students across the Primary and Secondary levels are busy mugging or sitting for the mid-year exams.\nHowever, this time round, many others will instead be staging a fashion show, trying their hand at sand-art animation and wushu, learning to write haiku while taking in the sights at the Singapore River, or learning about algebra through manga or anime characters, for example.\nStarting this year, as announced by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung last September, schools have done away with mid-year exams for Secondary 1, as well as all graded assessments and examinations for Primary 1 and 2 pupils.\nMid-year exams will also be removed in phases over the next three years for Primary 3, Primary 5, and Secondary 3.\nApart from Secondary 1, some schools have gone ahead to remove mid-year exams for other levels this year ahead of the impending changes.\nNevertheless, students in Secondary 1 this year and their parents — fresh from the stress of the high-stakes Primary School Leaving Examination — are among the first to reap the benefits of the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) moves to reduce stress and emphasis on grades, and to inculcate the joy in learning.\nAmong other things, the scrapping of mid-year exams has freed up about two weeks of curriculum time which means more opportunities for students to engage in self-discovery through lessons within and outside the classrooms.\nIt also means less anxiety and stress for parents. For the teachers, they say they now face less pressure to rush through the syllabus before the mid-year exams. They also have more time to come up with creative lessons, and do not have to be saddled with marking of exam scripts.\nHua Yi Secondary School principal Sandra Gwee said: “The most immediate benefit of the changes has been the additional bandwidth that we have, which has allowed us to spend more time discussing student matters, different aspects of their learning, and to have deeper conversations with stakeholders and parents about our school approaches.”\nYet, as observers had earlier predicted, the reduction in the number of graded assessments and exams has inadvertently driven some anxious parents to turn to tuition agencies to fill the void.\nWhile some tuition centres are also taking the cue from the schools in slowing down the pace of teaching, at least one centre — Kent Ridge Education — said that it has seen a spike in enrolment amid concerns that the absence of exams will make it harder for parents to gauge how their kids are doing in school.\nThese concerns were mainly voiced by working parents. “Because they don’t have time to monitor their kids’ progress at home,” said Kent Ridge Education principal Max Wong.\nMAKING LEARNING FUN\nIn the past few years, Hua Yi Secondary School had been holding a one-day “Learning Fiesta” in May, which included carnival rides and a singing competition.\nThe school removed mid-year exams this year not just for Secondary 1 but Secondary 3 as well.\nAnd its principal Ms Gwee, 58, who took over the reins in 2017, decided to tweak the annual initiative this year since the removal of the mid-year exams for Secondary 1 and\xa03 opened up some “free time”.\nRenamed “Learning Festival”, the event later this month will be extended to five days and students will have the chance to demonstrate their understanding of topics such as robotics. For instance, some students are organising a fashion show relating to healthcare technology.\nThey can also participate in programmes and activities such as sand-art animation.\n“For students, an important part of learning and development is having an opportunity to apply their learning in authentic context and to receive recognition for their learning,” said Ms Gwee, who has been an educator for 35 years.\nOver at another secondary school, students are enticed to learn mathematical concepts through the stories behind them, such as who came up with those ideas and how. The stories are told through animated manga and anime characters, after their teacher surveyed students’ interests.\nThe teacher, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media, said that students became “more excited” when the lessons had a touch of multimedia. He added:\nI could see that their motivation to learn fluctuate during lessons with and without the use of multimedia.\nAt Zhonghua Secondary School, the additional free time is used to teach Secondary 1 students to write Haiku poems and fiction by the Singapore River. Students in the school’s art elective programme also visit the National Gallery to learn the history of the artefacts exhibited there.\nAt Waterway Primary School, which has removed its mid-year exams for Primary 3 students, these pupils now get to learn science through an investigative study on “man and its environment” where they present their findings via skits and drama.\nIn response to queries, an MOE spokesperson said that it is up to schools to decide how best to use the time which has been freed up.\n“Schools also understand that the mid-year examinations should not be replaced with additional practice or high-stakes tests,” said the spokesperson.\nOn its part, MOE helps schools adjust by providing resources and professional development for teachers on the use of formative assessment practices to help students understand their strengths and improve their learning.\nPrincipals and teachers said that teachers now have more time to come up with creative lessons, gauge students’ interests and bounce off ideas with their colleagues.\nMrs Wee-Kwan Liam, principal of Waterway Primary School, said: “Changes to assessment do not change the curriculum, the intents, contents and processes.\nWhat they do is to give teachers more time to plan for and implement learning activities to make learning more authentic, fun and effective.\nA 37-year-old science teacher from a secondary school in the east, who declined to be named as she was not authorised to speak to the media, said there is now “more breathing space” for teachers to experiment with lessons.\nShe recounted that in the past, she had to rush through six topics prior to the two weeks of revision before the mid-year exams.\nBut this year, for instance, she managed to get her Secondary 3 biology students to create a website to explain how osmosis and diffusion work, using animation and other methods.\n“Previously, I don’t have the time to let students do that,” she added.\nUltimately, students benefit from the slower pace of teaching, said teachers interviewed.\nA teacher in her 30s from Meridian Secondary School said: “Yes, it’s less stressful for teachers, but students are the biggest beneficiaries. Imagine you’re in the students’ shoes, jumping from Primary 6 to Secondary 1 is daunting. It’s a big jump having to study from four to eight subjects.\nSo, it helps that teachers follow the students’ pace instead of rushing through the syllabus.\n‘LESS STRESS, MORE JOY’\nWhen she had to sit for examinations during primary school, Amirah Prisca, 13, recounted that she used “to get fever, vomiting and anxiety”.\nThe Secondary 1 student at Assumption English School is glad that she does not have to go through that experience again at this time of the year.\n“I feel less stressed. It gives me a little more play time and I will also have more time to study for the year-end examinations. That is still important because it tests how well you are doing,” she added.\nHer mother Priscilla Ramachandran, 35, who works as a preschool educator, said that the removal of mid-year exams “has been a great relief”. “I still monitor her progress as usual and keep encouraging her,” she said.\nSome parents noted that the removal of mid-year exams has no bearing on their children’s learning at home. Finance manager Ang Keh Sin, a mother of two boys in Secondary 1 and Primary 5, said her eldest son “still does his revision every night, we still buy him assessment books”.\nOthers, however, said it makes a difference — they can space out the revision and set aside more time for family activities.\nNevertheless, all the parents interviewed agreed that the changes have helped them feel less stressed.\nDr Jeremy Lim, a father of three children aged between 10 and 16, said his family has “piles of exam worksheets and assessment books which the children go through over the year”.\nBut since his son, who is in Secondary 1, does not have mid-year exams, ploughing through the study materials will be “more spaced out”.\n“That said, without the mid-year exams to prepare for, there is more time to spend on enrichment activities like going to the park, visiting the zoo and bird park, watching plays and musicals,” said Dr Lim, who is a partner at the global consultancy firm Oliver Wyman.\nFor Ms Wang Hanqing, a mother of two boys in Primary 1 and 3, the removal of exams provided “some relief”. More importantly, it gives her “a bit more space to focus on the process of learning” and not to be fixated on grades.\n“I just teach them (her children) the value of putting in consistent work,” said the 37-year-old freelance writer whose kids do not have any tuition.\nMOE previously said that from this year, all students from Primary 3 to Secondary 4 or 5 will not have more than one weighted assessment per subject per school term.\nSchools can still conduct assessments, although the scores will not count towards overall results.\nTo gauge students’ learning progress, schools use various assessments such as class work and homework, the MOE spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson said that by gathering feedback from parents and students, the ministry will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the changes and identify areas of support needed by schools.\nSTAKES RAISED FOR YEAR-END EXAMS?\nWhile most parents and students spoken to welcomed the scrapping of mid-year exams, some were concerned that it could raise the stakes of the year-end exams, given that these now carry higher weightage.\nPreviously, the weightage given to year-end exams was 40 per cent. This has gone up to between 50 and 60 per cent in some schools, according to teachers and principals interviewed.\nSt Anthony\'s Cannossian Secondary School student Jadyn Tan, who is in Secondary 3, said that it has become more stressful for her to know that her year-end exams would count towards such a big part of her overall results.\nHer final-year exams results will make up 60 per cent of her overall results, and the remainder will come from weighted assessments which account for 10 to 15 per cent each.\nJadyn noted that if she and her classmates do not do well in their year-end exams, their overall grades would be “pulled down”.\xa0She said:\nIn the old system, the weightage for the mid-year exams, year-end exams and common tests were quite equal. So, the stress wouldn’t be too much on the year-end exams. We also had class tests in the old system (which contribute to overall scores), unlike the new system that solely depends on the weighted assessments.\nHowever, not all schools have increased the weightage of their year-end exams, following the scrapping of mid-year exams.\nHua Yi Secondary School, for example, has kept it at 55 per cent.\nIts principal, Ms Gwee, reiterated that students are encouraged to “do consistent work throughout the year, without focusing only on common tests and exams”.\n“In fact, the weighted assessments in the first three terms serve to inculcate in students the ownership of learning and instill the values of consistent work that builds up to the end of year exams,” she said.\nHOW TUITION CENTRES ARE ADAPTING\nThe concerns of students like Jadyn could be compounded by the slower pace of teaching in schools, said Mr Lim Wei Yi, who is the co-founder and managing director of tuition centre Study Room.\nMr Lim said that his centre, like some others are slowing down their pace in line with what the schools are doing. Even so, his centre is still teaching ahead of the syllabus taught in schools, he added.\nFor example, he noted that previously, Secondary 1 students enrolled at his centre would have learnt about summary writing and composition by March.\nHowever, some of the Secondary 1 students currently taking English language classes at the centre have yet to learn these as of this month.\nMr Lim felt that while it is good that schools can now focus on injecting creativity in lessons through podcasts and drama for example, there are still exams at the end of the year that students have to sit for.\nThough students could be less stressed now, it also means that the stakes for the year-end exams could be raised.\n“As they may not have been consistent with their work, there is a higher likelihood of a last-minute scramble then, which results in even more stress for the child,” said Mr Lim.\nBut principals and teachers spoken to disagree.\nA secondary school teacher, who declined to be named, said that while the pace of teaching has been reduced, learning is now done with more depth.\nAnd teachers still have to cover the syllabus within a certain time frame, she added.\nSouth View Primary School principal Sharida Batcha Sahib noted that the removal of mid-year exams for a particular level cannot be seen in isolation.\nThe impact of removing mid-year exams for the school’s Primary 3 students would be felt across the other levels, she pointed out.\nThis is because when a Primary 3 student moves up to the next level and finds that the pace of teaching is different, it can be a shock to them and they would struggle to cope, she said.\n“We look at learning in its totality, throughout the six years in (primary) school. So, when students are exposed to a consistent pace and what the exam format is like, they won’t feel stressed out,” she added.\nLast year, shortly after Mr Ong announced the removal of some exams, he noted that there was a greater concern that tuition centres could simulate exam-like conditions.\n""I strongly urge them not to do so,"" said the Education Minister then. ""Doing so would just be preying on the apprehension and anxieties of parents and students.""\nThere had been previous news reports about some tuition centres rushing in to fill the gap and soothe anxious parents, by introducing more classes and assessments.\nOne centre, Gavin\'s Tuition, also planned to make available its in-house mid-year and year-end exams to students not enrolled with it.\nWhen contacted last month, the centre’s director Gavin Ng said it has set aside 50 slots for its in-house mid-year exams, and there are interest from students not on its books.\nFollowing Mr Ong’s announcement last year, Kent Ridge Education’s enrolment has increased by 10 per cent.\nMr Wong, the centre’s principal, said this was driven by parents who were worried that they would not be able to get a good gauge of their children’s progress in school, following the scrapping of the mid-year exams. They were also concerned that their children could become complacent, and as a result, struggle with the year-end exams, he added.\n“One of the first things they ask me before they sign up is ‘Do you have review exercises or mock exams?’” said Mr Wong, whose centre has 21 branches islandwide.\n“They feel that exams give a better indication or a reality check of their children’s progress. They do not want to end up in a situation where they delay the ‘medical check-up’ only to get a rude shock later on.”\nMr Wong said that for the past decade, students at his centre have been doing practice exam papers. These are not graded as the focus is not on scores but students’ understanding of the subjects.\nFrom these assessments, the centre then tailors its lessons to the students’ strengths and weaknesses, he said.\n“We are not undoing the ministry’s work,” said Mr Wong. “We are complementing the schools’ efforts because we help students in areas which they are weak in, which schools might have insufficient time to do so. We are all in it for the same thing (helping students) and it’s not just about business.”\nSome parents spoken to admitted that they were worried about the new policy.\nThe scrapping of mid-year exams might make it harder for them to gauge their children’s academic performance, they said. This is especially so for working parents, who might not have the time to coach and monitor their children’s progress.\nMs Joscelin Kwek, a 37-year-old managing director of a public relations firm who has two boys including one in Primary 1, reiterated that working parents should not depend on exam grades to determine their child’s progress.\nInstead, they should gauge their children’s learning through homework and assessments.\n“Take the time to go through their homework to see if they have understood the concept, which is more important. You don’t really need a score to know if your kid is doing well or not,” she said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

In the long run, this would lead to better social mixing and greater societal cohesion – or so is thought.\nCHALLENGES WITH DOING AWAY WITH ABILITY-BASED CLASS GROUPING\nDoing away with ability-based grouping necessarily implies that each form class will comprise a more heterogeneous mix of students than before. A pertinent consideration is whether teachers are well prepared to teach such classes.\nAt Edgefield Secondary School, for instance, students attend classes in academic subjects such as English and Mathematics, which are grouped by subject-based abilities, but go through about half of their other lessons, including Art and Music, in form classes comprising a mixture of students from all three academic streams.\nTeaching a class comprising students from vastly different backgrounds and abilities will naturally be more challenging, since the pace of a given lesson might be too slow for some while too fast for others. Principals must therefore ensure that teachers are trained so that students do not become disengaged.\nForm teachers will inevitably need to address thorny questions such as “how should I best pitch my lessons? Should I pitch it so that the content and pace is just right for the average student? Or so I pitch it so that it better challenges the faster learners? Or should I pitch it so as to accommodate the slowest learners?”\nIn influencing the amount of content taught to students and the pace at which the lesson is delivered, these decisions will have important implications for student learning.\nWILL GROUPING BY CCA SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SOCIAL MIXING WITHIN SCHOOLS? \nWhat should principals consider in deciding how best to organise students into form classes, now that ability-based grouping should be avoided?\nIn the Committee of Supply debate, a few examples were shared on how some schools had been experimenting with innovative ways of grouping students. Apart from Edgefield Secondary, Minister Ong also cited the example of Boon Lay Secondary School, which had grouped students into form classes based on co-curricular activity (CCA).\nWhile this is an interesting and creative strategy with many merits, principals of other schools who are considering a similar strategy should also be aware of its limitations. Though this strategy might help to reduce the phenomenon of ability-based grouping somewhat, it is unlikely to completely eradicate it.\nWhy? Because the CCA one participates in involves a choice. It is well known that people from different socioeconomic backgrounds tend to be attracted to different kinds of CCAs. Take golf, sailing, tennis, fencing, or horse-riding for instance.\nWho are the kids that tend to take these up as CCAs? Typically the ones from more wealthy families.\nThese kids have more interest in taking up these activities, perhaps because their parents also engage in them or can send them to such enrichment classes and activities. Because these activities often require access to exclusive clubs or facilities offered by condominium residency, students and parents who engage in them are often those that are more well-to-do.\nTherefore, forming classes by CCAs could continue to result in ability and socioeconomic-based grouping, since students in certain CCAs might be from more advantaged backgrounds than others.\nForming classes based on CCAs may also result in unintentional grouping based on race and gender. Again, this results because students of different races and sex tend to be attracted to different types of activities.\nFor instance, the majority of those who opt for ballet as a CCA tend to be females. Similarly, Chinese, Malay\xa0and Indian dance or music are CCAs that tend to attract students of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities respectively.\nAs such, grouping students based on CCAs, when CCAs involve self-selection based on socioeconomic, racial\xa0and gender lines, may end up inadvertently segregating classes of students along those lines.\nA POTENTIAL WAY TO GROUP STUDENTS WITHIN SCHOOLS \nIf the primary objective is to allow for greater social mixing, schools may want to consider grouping students into form classes based on random assignment instead. This process would much be like rolling a die.\nIf a die is rolled and the number two is obtained, a student is assigned to class two, and so on. In practice, the assignment can be based on a random number generator. This procedure will ensure that the mix of students in each class will be roughly the same as the composition of students making up the school.\nIn other words, if the ratio of male to female students in the school is 50:50 and the ratio of Chinese, Malay, and Indian students is 70:20:10, for instance, this procedure will yield a mix of students in each class with roughly these same proportions.\nImportantly, the average ability of students in each class will end up being the same as that of the school. Hence, there will not be a case where some classes will have disproportionately more high ability students or students from certain sociodemographic backgrounds. This results in an equal mix of students across classes within a school.\nTo ensure that teachers teaching the core subjects will not face the problem of having to deal with a class which is too heterogeneous, schools can explore grouping students by random assignment\xa0for non-core subjects like character and citizenship education, but by the new subject-based academic levels when it comes to examinable subjects.\nThis way, schools can achieve the best of both worlds – with ample opportunities for students of different backgrounds to socialise on a regular basis but yet still ensuring lesson delivery in core subjects continues to be efficient.\nSCHOOLS NEED THE BUY-IN OF PARENTS\nOf course, for any social mixing scheme to work as intended, schools need the buy-in of parents. Parents, especially of the more-able academic performers, need to be convinced that social mixing will actually be beneficial for their children.\nOtherwise, they would simply “migrate” from schools with a policy of social mixing towards those schools where students tend to be higher achieving (such as integrated programme schools) so as to avoid having their children mix with students who are less academically inclined.\nAlready, there is some evidence that such concerns might be genuine, with reports citing how some parents have responded that they\xa0prefer to avoid having their children mix with children who are lower-achieving.\xa0\nIf this is true, we might end up with a situation where the higher-achieving children from more advantaged families would have a greater tendency to cluster in some schools, while lower-achieving children from less advantaged families would have a greater tendency to cluster separately in others.\xa0\nThe end result then, might be more social mixing within schools,\xa0but paradoxically greater social inequality across schools.\nKelvin Seah Kah Cheng is a Lecturer in the Department of Economics, National University of Singapore.

      Malaysian Education Minister draws flak for comments linking ethnic quota to job discrimination
  </h1>, 'text': 'PENANG: Malaysian Education Minister Maszlee Malik has drawn flak from both sides of the political divide for his comments linking the racial quota for pre-university admission\xa0to “employment discrimination” against bumiputras.\nDr Maszlee reportedly said at a town hall session at Universiti Sains Malaysia on Thursday (May 16) that removing the racial quota for the matriculation programme would only be considered when bumiputras are no longer turned away at job interviews for not being able to speak Mandarin.\nHis remarks did not go down well with other politicians, including his Pakatan Harapan colleagues.\nOn Facebook, Selangor executive councillor and Democratic Action Party (DAP) veteran Teng Chang Khim commented: “If the Education Minister really did say so, then he surely is foolish. What an idiot!”\nPenang Deputy Chief Minister P\xa0Ramasamy also took Dr Maszlee to task for\xa0thinking along racial lines. “What is the difference between him and United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) politicians?” he said in a statement.\n“He is saying as long as the private sector, in other words, Chinese employers, are recruiting on the basis of knowledge of Mandarin, then the government will maintain the present matriculation quota,” said the DAP politician.\nDr Ramasamy questioned Dr Maszlee’s motive in raising the issue, asking if he was seeking to “score political points in a predominantly Malay crowd”.\nThe pre-university matriculation programme was rolled out in 1998 to create more opportunities for bumiputras to seek higher education in science, technology and applied arts.\nTen per cent of the seats were subsequently allocated to non-bumiputras in 2003, hence putting in place the 90:10 ethnic quota.\xa0Every intake has 25,000 students.\nLast month, Dr Maszlee announced that the programme would be expanded to accommodate 40,000 students, with the racial quota remaining in place.\nThis meant that while an additional 1,500 seats were created for non-bumiputra students (bringing the total to 4,000), seats reserved for bumiputra students jumped by 13,500 to 36,000.\nHis announcement ignited a fresh round of debate on meritocracy and affirmative action in Malaysia.\nIn the Thursday town hall session, Dr Maszlee said the matriculation programme was put in place to balance the ratio of bumiputra and non-bumiputra students in public universities.\n“Non-bumiputra students come from rich families; they attend tuition classes and obtain good grades. Bumiputra students, including those originating from B40 (bottom 40 per cent) families in East Malaysia, do not go for tuition,” he was quoted as saying.\nMeanwhile, Ms Saw Yee Fung – a spokesperson of opposition Malaysian Chinese Association – said she was puzzled by the link between ethnic quota and bumiputras’\xa0command of the Chinese language.\n“If we want to enhance the employability of university graduates, shouldn’t we strengthen educational training instead of looking at the issue from a racial perspective?” she said.\nHIGHER EDUCATION FUND CORPORATION TO CLARIFY REINSTATING TRAVEL BAN FOR DEFAULTERS\nOn a separate issue, Dr Maszlee said on Friday that the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) has to clear the air over reintroducing travel ban for loan defaulters.\nIts chairman Wan Saiful Wan Jan had said a day earlier that it would propose to bring back the ban if the people agree to it, when launching an online public consultation to collect ideas for a new repayment scheme\xa0and measures to improve PTPTN’s sustainability.\nPTPTN was founded in 1997 with the aim of assisting students with funding their undergraduate degrees. However, it has struggled with loan defaults.\nPH, in the last general election, promised to abolish the blacklisting policy, which saw about a million defaulters barred from travelling overseas.\nDr Maszlee noted that\xa0the idea to reintroduce the travel ban did not come from PTPTN, but was made during a public consultation session.\n“It was not their idea, but when media asked him (Wan Saiful) about it, his answer implied so. In my opinion, PTPTN should explain to the media so that such misunderstandings do not occur,” he said.\n\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Thanks mum for not being a helicopter parent
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Growing up, my mother, who worked a 12-hour shift in retail, wasn’t a prominent figure at home.\nThe only times my siblings and I saw her were before school and just before bed. Our dad who worked “regular” hours was around more.\nStill, she was fully involved in our childhood. Before leaving for work, she’ll prepare lunch for us to eat after school. At work, she answered our calls – even for a short while. And during her off days, she would sometimes take us out.\nI wouldn’t be telling the truth if I said I wasn’t bothered by her absence then. There were times I was jealous of my peers whose mums were there to pick them up from school.\nIt wasn’t until I was older that I understood the trade-offs.\nNO PRESSURE\nBusy with their jobs, my dual-income parents were unintentionally less involved in school matters.\nIt may go against the grain of contemporary conventional parenting advice, which has led in\xa0more cases to many getting heavily involved in their children's\xa0lives, but the autonomy my parents gave us allowed me to escape the academic pressures many of my peers had to face.\nThere were no expectations on the kind of grades that I should get, or which after-school activities I should participate in.\nI might been competitive at times, but the pressure to do well in school never came from my parents.\nResearchers have warned that high expectations from pushy parents can create performance anxiety in kids, and potentially tip them into depression.\nBrian Poh, a senior clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), pointed out that academic-based stress is a common issue that the IMH sees in many patients, in a commentary for CNA.\nWhile this stress can be partly attributed to Singapore’s competitive culture, parents who place great emphasis on academic achievement add fuel to the fire, he said.\nOne may argue that some kids turn out well because of such pressures from parents.\nSophia and Lulu, daughters of Amy Chua, author of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, got into prestigious colleges. Sophia admitted that her parents had high expectations, but said that it was only because of her parent’s confidence in her that she could do “amazing things”.\nLulu said that she had a “tough childhood, but (it was) a happy one”, even when she was made to play the violin for six hours a day.\nStill, I’m not sure I would be happy if I had to play a musical instrument for so many hours each day or that it would have benefited me in the way it did Lulu.\nBUILDING INDEPENDENCE\nMuch can also be lost with “overparenting”.\nAmy Brown, a public health professor at Swansea University, has pointed out that a heavily involved parenting style, also known as helicopter parenting, can have adverse effects on a child’s development.\nSingaporean parents have been said to “helicopter” around their children. Even the Ministry of Education (MOE) stepped in to advise parents that “constantly hovering over your child may hurt his development” in 2017.\nA series of illustrations on MOE’s Facebook page suggests that a helicopter parent can be recognised by the way he/she debates with teachers for extra marks to increase their child’s grades, does homework on behalf of their child, and “flies” to school with their child’s homework when they forget to bring it – all of which my working parents thankfully never did.\nSenior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam also cautioned earlier this year against helicopter parenting. Citing studies in the United States, he said that such behaviour can have long-term psychological effects on children including “a greater sense of anxiety, a loss of a sense of individuality or independence, and greater stress”.\nNOT A ‘SUPER MUM’, BUT STILL AMAZING\nWhile my parents weren’t helicopter parents, they were still involved in our lives. Dad drove\xa0us to school each morning. Mum came to support us every Sports Day. During her days off, we spent afternoon picnics at the beach, we went cycling at the park, and we took many trips to local attractions. These fond memories are firmly etched in my mind.\xa0\nHow mum made time for us taught me an important thing about family time – that it’s not the quantity but quality that matters.\nWhen she was away, I had the space to be independent.\nMum also showed how one doesn’t have to be constantly present to show that they care, because love can manifest in many different ways – like a pot of curry or a clean home.\nMy mother isn’t like the “super mum” common in many media report profiles – she’s not one who juggles multiple jobs, a business and a family and she didn’t pack our days with enrichment classes. But she raised five kids well while working in the same company, and taught us how to be adaptive and resilient in small ways. That to me is already amazing.\nNow a housewife, my mother is very much present in our lives. When she’s not at her part-time job, she spends her time knitting, or playing with our cat at home.\nThis Mother’s Day, let’s celebrate the various, everyday roles mums play in our lives, the quality time they spend with us, and the space they give us to grow into the adults we’ve become.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Should universities even accept donations from hopeful parents?
  </h1>, 'text': 'LONDON: Earlier this week, the leaders of Cambridge university held a dinner in New York’s Public Library to “connect” with local alumni – a polite euphemism for the process of tapping those alums for cash, as part of an ongoing £2 billion (US$2.6 billion)\xa0fundraising campaign.\nThe Cambridge academics showcased the university’s intellectual prowess, as did the students who were also present.\nBut one significant category of people was not invited: Parents of students or of prospective students. “We decided against it,” an organiser explained, with an embarrassed laugh.\nWhy? A New Yorker might guess this was a recent decision, driven by the “optics”.\xa0Earlier in the year, the US was rocked by a college admissions scandal, when it emerged that wealthy parents had been buying places for their kids at places such as the University of Southern California, by paying for favourable treatment in admissions exams or by bribing coaches to testify to their children’s sporting prowess.\nIn fact, Cambridge university has long been vehemently opposed to anything that smacks of parents “buying” places for their kids, whether through connections or money.\nThis aversion to unfair influence is so deeply ingrained at some colleges that when I applied to Cambridge, three decades ago, my school teachers sternly warned me to avoid mentioning that my father had attended the same institution. Having a parental link was seen as a potential black mark, not a help.\nTo US ears this may seem bizarre. For while most of the country’s elites may recoil from the idea of outright fraud, the notion of using “legacy” connections is regarded as par for the course.\nIn the UK, however, Cambridge’s stance is unremarkable. If anything, British universities have become more outspoken against parental pressure in recent years, while such influence-peddling has quietly proliferated in the US.\n“Family connections or donations do not, and will not, play a role in that assessment process,” insists a Cambridge spokesperson. There is, in other words, a cultural gulf.\nDoes this mean that the British system is more “fair”? Not necessarily.\xa0\nMONEY AND CLASS\nMoney and class still buy privilege aplenty in the UK, albeit in a more subtle way, via access to select schools: A\xa0report from the Sutton Trust last year showed that almost half of all Oxbridge places go to children at private schools, although only 7 per cent of kids in the UK attend these.\nIf you look at the issue from a wider social perspective, the issue of “fairness” becomes more nuanced. The perception that American parents can use legacy links and donations to boost their children’s chances of following in their footsteps pushes many of them to try to do precisely that, which helps to explain why many of them stay closely in touch with – and give generously to – their alma mater.\xa0\n(Of course, many also give in the spirit of disinterested philanthropy; but self-interest cannot be ignored.)\nThose donations are then recycled through the colleges, and a big chunk is used to offer scholarships to poor students. This process creates inequities of its own, since big-name colleges garner vastly more donations than community colleges. And the system penalises middle-class kids who lack the connections and wealth of the elite but are not poor or “diverse” enough to qualify for aid.\nBut when it comes to issues of social mobility and university, the UK and US are not so far apart: The OECD calculates that while Americans from families with university degrees are 6.8 times more likely to attend college than people from families without a degree, this ratio is only slightly better, at 6.3, in England.\nIn Finland and South Korea, by contrast, it is just over one.\nPARENTAL DONATIONS\n\nThis raises a philosophical question: Is it better to shun any parental donations on moral grounds, if these seem intended to buy influence?\xa0\nOr is it better to create a wealthier university by any means, and give out more scholarships?\xa0\nTo put it more crudely: Is it right for US universities to accept some rich-but-dim kids as just the “price” for subsidising more poor-but-bright ones?\nWhen I put this question to senior figures at Cambridge, their answer – with a wince – was “no”. But their principled position comes at a cost: Today, Cambridge’s endowment (including university and colleges) is “only” £12 billion\xa0– bigger than most European universities but far smaller than Princeton or Stanford (both about US$26 billion), Yale (US$29 billion) or Harvard (US$38 billion).\nThat has not dented the ranking of Oxford and Cambridge so far: They still often top global leagues.\xa0\nAlthough Cambridge is scrambling to catch up – and recently received a record £100 million donation – university officials reckon its current fundraising intake is only a third of Stanford’s.\nSo the next time you get a letter from your old college begging for a donation – or are fretting about your kids’ prospects – ponder these moral quandaries.\xa0\nThere are no easy answers here. But dealing with difficult philosophical questions is, of course, one thing that university is supposed to teach in the first place.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      'Hard work' got me into Stanford, says Chinese teen whose parents paid US$6.5 million
  </h1>, 'text': 'Two years ago, when Molly Zhao Yusi first got into Stanford, the fresh-faced teenager hosted a 90-minute video chat to talk about how she was accepted\xa0into one of the most prestigious universities in America.\n“Hello everyone, I’m 17 now … I went to high school in England. This year in mid-September I’m going to Stanford … I’m really looking forward to it,” she says in fluent English, in one of a few snippets she speaks to demonstrate her proficiency in the language.\nLater in the video, she says in Mandarin that people had\xa0asked if she got into Stanford because her family was rich. No, she refutes, claiming that American university admissions officers “don’t know who you are”.\nThis week, the Los Angeles Times named Zhao as the student whose parents paid US$6.5 million (S$8.9 million) to a consultant who helped her get\xa0a place at the college.\nThis is the highest amount paid to the consultant, William “Rick” Singer, who has pleaded guilty to working with corrupt coaches, university administrators and exam monitors to get the children of wealthy families into prestigious colleges.\nOf the US$6.5 million paid by the Zhao family, Singer appeared to have pocketed US$6 million.\nProsecutors said that he made her out to be a competitive sailor, providing a fake list of sailing accomplishments, according to reports. Singer\xa0then made a US$500,000 donation to the school’s sailing programme after Zhao was admitted.\xa0\nZhao\xa0has since been expelled by the school.\nFATHER HOLDS SINGAPORE PASSPORT\nProsecutors have also charged other parents involved in the scheme but Zhao’s parents face no charges so far, and have claimed that they were duped by Singer.\nMs Zhao’s father, Zhao Tao, a pharmaceutical mogul, is listed on Forbes as the 21st richest man in Singapore with a current net worth of US$1.8 billion. According to Forbes, the Shandong Buchang Pharmaceuticals co-founder holds a Singapore passport.\nOn Friday, Hong Kong-based lawyers for Zhao\'s mother released a statement on her behalf in which she said the payment was made but that Singer had led her to believe it was a legitimate donation that would go towards Stanford\'s staff salaries and scholarship programme.\n""The donation is in the same nature as those that many affluent parents have been doing openly to prestigious universities,"" the statement read, adding they had made it a month after their daughter was accepted into Stanford.\nStanford has said in US reports that it never got the money.\nCHINESE NETIZENS SLAM VIDEO\xa0\nZhao Yusi’s 2017 video is now trending in China for all the wrong reasons and attracting vitriol from Chinese netizens who mock her “advice”.\nIn the video, she talks about how she was a mediocre student and recounts how a British history teacher told her she should aim for a “B”. She scored an A* in the subject by “burying her head and studying hard”, she said, using a Chinese idiom.\nShe also talks about her love for riding horses and how she gave it up for a time to focus on studying for major examinations.\nAs for how she learned English? She sang along to English songs, watched American shows and “initiated conversations with foreigners”, she says.\nShe also chose to study in the UK, at the elite Wellington College according to reports, to learn English, she claims.\n“Others may not recognise you can do it but you have to prove to them you can with your own hard work and actions,” she says at one point.\nAccording to the Stanford Daily, she was an East Asian Studies major and a member of Stanford’s Forum for American-Chinese Exchange.\nOn the website of a conference she attended, it said that she was interested in China’s international educational policy and “especially intrigued by the rural-urban education inequality in China”.\nA conference co-director praised her participation, saying that she did a “wonderful job” on a presentation on the US-China relationship.\nShe was also active in various academic programmes besides her studies, said the New York Times.\nHer father also extolled the virtues of hard work, discipline and frugality in a 2015 interview with the Chinese media.\n“Your ability should match your wealth. I really look down on kids who do not rely on themselves. If I see them, I will lecture them,” he said.\nUS$25 MILLION SCAM\nThe US$25 million university entrance scam, which was revealed by US prosecutors earlier this year, has seen some 50 people charged including Hollywood actors and industry CEOs.\nMost of the cases that have come to light through indictments or guilty pleas have involved parents paying anywhere between US$15,000 and US$600,000 to ensure their children got into the college of their choice.\xa0\nUS media have reported only one other family paid Singer a seven figure sum - a Chinese family who allegedly paid US$1.2 million to get their daughter, Sherry Guo, into Yale.

      Students graduating from local schools to receive ‘tamper-resistant’ digital certificates
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From this year, graduates from local schools – including secondary schools, junior colleges\xa0and tertiary institutions –\xa0will receive digital certificates for the qualifications they obtain, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung announced on Friday (May 3).\nThis is part of a national-level initiative called OpenCerts, which was jointly developed by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), Government Technology Agency (GovTech), the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP).\nOpenCerts\xa0is a blockchain-based platform that offers an “easy and reliable way” to issue and validate certificates that are tamper-resistant, according to a joint media release issued by SSG, GovTech and NP. This is the first time blockchain technology has been harnessed for use at the national level.\nThe change will benefit students graduating with N-, O- or A-Level certificates, those from the Institute of Technical Education, as well as those graduating from polytechnics, autonomous universities, LASALLE College of the Arts, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and the National Institute of Early Childhood Development. Those graduating with Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) will also receive a digital certificate.\nStudents graduating from these schools will receive digital certificates which will each have a unique cryptographic proof embedded for secure verification. They will receive it via email, and it will also be automatically added to the Skills Passports of their individual MySkillsFuture accounts.\nPlans are also in the pipeline to create digital certificates for those who have already graduated from the participating schools.\nWhen students use these certificates for job applications or to apply for further studies at other institutions, employers or schools would be able to verify these digital certificates directly through the OpenCerts online platform, OpenCerts.io.\nThe change is expected to simplify and reduce administrative processes and physical paperwork for employers. Local schools will also save time and costs by not having to manually verify issued certificates from individuals.\nA GOOD SOLUTION TO A REAL-WORLD PROBLEM\nSpeaking on Friday at Temasek Polytechnic’s graduation ceremony, Mr Ong described the initiative as a “tangible example” of the benefits of Singapore’s Smart Nation journey.\n“With OpenCerts, we are harnessing the power of blockchain in a practical way,” he said. “It allows for any education institute to issue OpenCerts, and for anyone to quickly check the validity of a digital certificate.”\n“This will in time make job application and hiring easier and smoother for both the applicant and the employer.”\nAs for students, Mr Ong noted that they would no longer need to\xa0“go through the hassle” of requesting for certified true copies of their certificates from their schools. Instead, they would be able to send potential employers their digital certificate together with the job application.\n“Employers can immediately validate the digital diplomas received as genuine, because that is what blockchain offers - secure and immutable records,” he said.\n“With OpenCerts, any unsavoury characters submitting forged certificates or degrees from Singapore institutions to try and get a job will be quickly found out and denied,” he added. “It is a good solution to a real-world problem.”\nSOLVING A “PRODUCTIVITY ISSUE”\nThe project was first piloted last year by GovTech and NP, and the first batch of digital certificates was issued to NP’s graduating cohort last year.\nExplaining why they embarked on the project, Director of NP’s Sandbox - Innovation and Entrepreneurship Office Patrice Choong said that issuing and verifying certificates was a “productivity issue” that they wanted to deal with.\nOn average, he said NP issues about 10,000 physical, certified-true copies of certificates every year, all of which have to be printed and stamped. They also receive about 2,000 verification requests from employers and other schools.\n“This is manual work for us,” he said. “So this system removes two needs - the need for physical, certified-true copies, and the need for verification requests.”\nAt the Singapore University of Social Sciences, it can take at least three days to process a request for verification from start to finish, according to its registrar\xa0Agnes Kwang.\n“This will really save us a lot of time,” she said. “It also helps us in the sense that we also need to recruit students and associates, so with this self-authentication, there will not be time wasted.”\nShe noted that the school currently has an online degree verification search portal, but will also come on board the national platform as it is “much more concerted and aligned”.\nNP’s Mr Choong stressed that physical certificates will still be given out to students. \xa0\n“After spending three years in a polytechnic, the students want to have a ceremony where they go on stage and receive the certificate,” he said. “That has cultural and psychological value to the person who studied, and also their parents.\n“It is a significant moment in a student’s life, and we have to keep that.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     Ngee Ann Polytechnic ', '     GovTech ', '     SkillsFuture ', '     Ong Ye Kung ']}"

      Malaysia’s Chinese independent schools face uphill climb in quest for qualification recognition
  </h1>, 'text': '\nKUALA LUMPUR: The clock struck 3pm on a Friday afternoon and a sharp school bell pierced the quiet Taman Kaya neighbourhood in Kuala Lumpur. Moments later, hundreds of students piled out of the gates; the all-white uniform of\xa0the male students giving away their identity as pupils of independent high schools.\nOn the façade of this Chong Hwa Independent School, red signage has been put up in commemoration of its centenary. The couplets in Chinese read: “Storms looming over the journey of Chinese education. We have been through 100 years and we will march on.”\nLike many of the other 60 self-funded Chinese independent high schools in Malaysia, Chong Hwa has grown over the years.\nIt started as a primary school back in 1919 and\xa0housed some 80 students in three shop lots in Setapak. Today, its 5,000 students study in a 24,000 sq ft site off Jalan Ipoh, which recently saw the addition of a 13-storey building.\nNext, the school management plans to construct a RM20 million (US$4.8 million) stadium equipped with swimming pool and a running track.\nFirst established by migrants from China, such Chinese-medium high schools stand out as a unique feature of\xa0the Malaysian education landscape. They do not come under the purview of the Education Ministry, and the highest certificate they offer - the senior-level Unified Education Certificate (UEC) - is not recognised officially as entry qualification into local public varsities.\nRecognition of UEC has been a drawn-out battle between these schools, the government as well as anti-recognition groups.\nThose who are against its recognition condemn Chinese independent schools schools as a threat to national unity and the Malay language, for refusing to fall in line with the national education system.\nPro-recognition groups cry foul over the fact that UEC has not been recognised in Malaysia, despite top foreign institutions such as National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Tokyo University and Hong Kong University long accepting it as an admission qualification.\n“The UEC recognition issue has been overpoliticised,” Chong Hwa’s board chairman Lim Keng Cheng told CNA. “It has turned into a racial issue.”\nMs Rebecca Yong, 40, whose daughter is currently in secondary three in Pay Fong Middle School in Melaka, concurred that the debate over UEC recognition appeared to be more about politics than anything else.\n“I do feel as a Chinese, recognition of UEC is more like recognition of the Malaysian Chinese community’s contributions to the country, and things would seem more equal for everybody.”\nShe said she does not have much confidence in the current national education system, as it does not reward based on merit.\n“I want my children to have fair treatment. You work hard, you get what you should get,” she said.\nThe Chinese independent schools, or du zhong in Chinese, survive largely on public donations and monthly school fees.\nThey use syllabus prepared by the United Chinese School Committees’ Association of Malaysia (Dong Zong), which also conducts UEC exams\xa0for third and sixth year of secondary education.\xa0\nThese tests are equivalent to the PMR (Lower Secondary Assessment) and STPM (Malaysian Higher School Certificate, a pre-university qualification) exams in national schools.\nHowever, since the UEC is not endorsed by the government, Chinese independent school students either sit for the STPM exams separately to gain admission into local universities, or pursue their tertiary studies in local private and foreign varsities.\nAccording to 2014 statistics, Taiwan was the top choice among some 2,500 Chinese independent school alumni who went overseas for tertiary studies. Sixty per cent of them headed to Taiwan, while 15 per cent chose Singapore.\nGOVERNMENT RECOGNITION AND PROMISES\xa0\nThe previous Barisan Nasional (BN) government had in 2010 relaxed its restrictions over UEC holders’ tertiary options, allowing UEC holders to enrol in the Bachelor of Education (Chinese) degree programme at the Education Ministry’s Malaysian Teachers Education Institute.\nPakatan Harapan (PH), meanwhile, has welcomed UEC holders to serve in state-owned companies in PH-led state Penang.\nSeparately, Sarawak announced its decision to accept UEC as a qualification of entry into its civil service in 2015. Defending his decision, then chief minister Adenan Satem said the federal policy of not recognising UEC was “stupid” as it had caused a brain drain and exodus of talent.\nIn the last general election, both BN and PH promised to recognise UEC if they were voted in to form the next federal government. BN said UEC holders would be allowed to enrol in public universities as long as they obtain a credit in Bahasa Malaysia and a pass in History in the SPM (secondary five\xa0Malaysian Education Certificate) exams.\nSimilarly, PH also pledged to recognise UEC as an admission qualification into public universities, provided the students earn a credit in SPM’s Malay paper.\nNonetheless, as PH’s one-year anniversary in power looms, recognition of UEC has remained unfulfilled.\nIn what may be an effort to address the concerns of the Chinese independent schools, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng announced a first-of-its-kind allocation of RM12 million for\xa0them in the 2019 federal budget.\nFINDING COMMON GROUND\nIn October last year, Education Minister Maszlee Malik announced in the Parliament that his ministry had\xa0set up a fact-gathering task force to look into UEC recognition.\nCentre for the Study and Documentation of Traditional Malay Performances founder Edin Khoo Bu Eng, Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia president Mohamad Raimi Ab Rahim and Malaysia-China Chamber of Commerce president cum Dong Zong vice-president Tan Yew Sing were tasked with engaging the various stakeholders.\nThe committee spotted a major underlying problem – the Malay community and the Chinese community have not exchanged thoughts on the UEC directly.\nAll previous engagement has been top-down, by the Education Ministry officials who meet each interest group on a one-on-one basis, Mr Khoo said.\nHe noted that there was no argument about fundamental national principles, such as the status of the Malay language as national language as well as the right of any community to pursue its own education system.\nThe fact that Malaysian society was based on cultural and constitutional consensus, such as the constitutional status of the Malay language, underpin Malays’ views on the matter, he said.\nThe Chinese community, on the other hand, is not disregarding or dismissing these questions. “It’s just that the two groups don’t talk to each other,” Mr Khoo said.\nCHINESE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS BELIEVED TO HAVE AN EDGE\nThere has been a trend of more non-Chinese sending their children to Chinese-medium schools. This year, close to 82,000 students are studying in Chinese independent schools nationwide. According to 2018 data, about 1.5 per cent of the student population in these schools are non-Chinese.\nParents believe the Chinese schools have an edge.\nSabah’s Chinese independent schools have\xa0the highest number of non-Chinese students. Mr Robert George Mangharam, of Kadazan descent, sent all four of his children to the Sabah Tshung Tsin Secondary School in Kota Kinabalu.\n“It’s not that government schools are bad, but these independent schools are a better alternative. Even though it costs more than if I were to send them to a government school, I am willing to pay because I want them to learn in a good environment and (be subject to) good influences,” Mr Robert, 51, said.\nTwo of his elder children sat for UEC exams, and then proceeded to study\xa0the government pre-university programme Form Six. They were later accepted into Universiti Malaya’s law faculty.\nMr Robert, a retired police officer, opined that UEC recognition would give all students a level playing field and have everyone compete fairly.\n“We’re in a globalised world. You can’t afford to not recognise UEC when other countries’ public universities are willing to take them in,” he said.\nMuslim Consumer Association of Malaysia chairman Nadzim Johan, who studied in a Chinese school, had all his children go through at least a Chinese primary school education. One of his daughters even attended the Confucian Private Secondary School in Kuala Lumpur.\n“Because we see the benefits from whatever was taught in Chinese culture, we need to take advantage of that to do well in life.\n“When I was sending my daughter to Confucian, I wasn’t looking at the recognition even,” said Mr Nadzim. “I want my kids to learn cultural traits such as work ethic.”\nMs Syamimi Yahaya, 33, who graduated from Pay Fong Middle School in 2005, said her parents saw the value of mastering a second language. Two of her sisters also attended Pay Fong.\n“I don’t think my parents knew UEC was not recognised,” she said.\nHer six years in Pay Fong paid off eventually when she was entrusted with important responsibilities at work. She found employment in a shipping company after obtaining a diploma.\n“Since I have a UEC and I can speak and understand Mandarin, my boss asked me to handle the China accounts,” she said.\nMs Syamimi, who now resides in Kuching, Sarawak, said her daughter is studying in a Chinese vernacular school and will most likely attend a Chinese independent school.\n“I’m sending my daughter to a Chinese school to learn and to be exposed to other cultures and languages. It helps prevent miscommunication,” she said.\nUEC A THREAT TO NATIONAL UNITY?\nHowever, others say that the UEC is a threat to national unity, while sidelining students that went through the national education system.\nProfessor Teo Kok Seong, who is Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia’s Institute of Ethnic Studies principal fellow, said it was a mistake for the PH government to pledge to recognise the UEC.\nOffering places at public universities to UEC holders - even if there are only a few - comes at the expense of students who went through the national education system, he said.\nIn fact, the UEC students would be taking up places reserved for the Chinese students who sit for the STPM exams, he said.\n“Is this fair? … Do not betray these ‘loyal students’ who uphold whatever is worth of the national education system, which in a way has no appeal to the UEC students (or their parents) who want to study Mandarin at all cost,” Prof Teo said.\nProf Teo opined that Chinese mother tongue education in Malaysia - be it the national Chinese primary schools or the Chinese independent schools - is indirectly a stumbling block to national unity.\nWhile the students are required to study English and Malay, they speak Mandarin,\xa0tend to read Chinese newspapers and watch Chinese television programmes, he observed.\n“They live a national life that is very much detached from other communities ...\xa0In short, living in the ‘Chinese world in Malaysia’ has made these Chinese less national or not national at all, and this is the very way that undermines the status of Malay as the national and official language of the country,” Prof Teo said.\nDr Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow with Singapore Institute of International Affairs, begged to differ. Unity, he said, cannot come at a price of submission and assimilation.\n“Unity must be based on equality. We must have due respect for all the different cultures and races. Each must have equal standing. Unity at the price of sacrificing one’s own culture is unacceptable to many of us,” he said.\nDr Oh, a UEC holder, said characterising Chinese independent schools as a threat to\xa0national unity is a biased approach.\n“Switzerland, for example, has four major languages - Swiss German, French, Italian and Romansh. The people speak their own mother tongue and come together as a country.\xa0It doesn\'t mean that if you have different languages, you are not one country,"" he said.\n""That is racial supremacy. Students of Chinese independent schools refuse to accept this sort of inequality, this sort of racial, linguistic and cultural supremacy.”\nFUTURE OF UEC UNCERTAIN\nCome July this year, the three-man committee’s report on the UEC will be released. Mr Khoo said the committee is planning an open town hall session for different stakeholders to have a conversation.\n“Our task is not to deliver a verdict. We provide recommendations, which will be forwarded to Cabinet for its decision,” he said.\nMeanwhile, parents are not holding their breath. Chong Hwa’s Mr Lim said: “Just because you don’t recognise it does not mean that the Chinese education in Malaysia will suddenly die.”\nDong Zong, when contacted, declined to comment, pending the task force\'s report.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Malaysia ', '     education ']}"

      MOE rolling out new system for fund collection at all schools
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) is rolling out a new billing system to all schools in Singapore to manage collection of money from students.\nThis comes as court cases of school staff members mishandling money made the news recently.\nMr Clarence Tang, MOE’s divisional director of finance and procurement, confirmed with CNA on Wednesday (Apr 24) that the new School Billing system will be available in all schools from this year.\n“The School Billing system was developed by MOE to help schools better manage the billing and payment collection for enrichment programmes and miscellaneous items such as jerseys and yearbooks,” said Mr Tang.\xa0\n“It provides parents and students with cashless modes of payment to minimise cash transactions in schools,” he said.\nWhen asked, MOE did not provide statistics for cash management issues in schools, nor did it elaborate on how the system works.\nThe new system comes after a high-profile court case in November last year where a Woodgrove Secondary teacher was accused of pocketing S$40,000 from students.\nMaslinda Zainal, who is still on trial for the alleged offences, stands accused of taking the money over two years by over-collecting cash from students for English learning materials.\nJust this month, primary school employee Siti Rafeah Hamid was jailed for four months for pocketing about S$36,000 in cash collected from students at Frontier Primary School.\nMOE had previously told CNA after Siti Rafeah’s case that it has been “taking steps to tighten the accountability of billing and collections through an MOE billing system for schools”.\xa0\nTeachers who spoke to CNA on condition of anonymity had mixed reactions to the new system, which is being rolled out in phases across schools.\nNO SOP FOR FUND COLLECTION CURRENTLY: TEACHER\nOne teacher welcomed the new system, saying there are currently ""no standard operating procedures"" for collection of funds in his school, unless the collection was school-wide.\n""For school-wide collection for enrichment and school-based activities, usually a letter will be issued to parents and then cash will be collected by form teachers,"" he said.\nHowever, for miscellaneous items and events which were not school-based, related to a subject or class-related, it is ""own time own target"", he added.\n""Teachers collect without the need of informing parents,"" he said. ""When we do, we just pay (for the items) and give the items to the students.""\nHe said that teachers should not be appointed to handle cash collection, and that there should be a centralised system under the general office for the handling of payments and collection of cash.\nThe\xa0same teacher said schools were ""wary"" after the court cases, with meetings held\xa0to educate teachers on the importance of professionalism and handling of funds.\n""Teachers discussed scenarios and went through pointers on why certain behaviour is\xa0not accepted and what is the expected code of conduct,"" he said.\xa0""Now, teachers are not allowed to collect cash on our own. We have to get the principal or the vice-principal\'s permission before money can be collected.""\nWhen funds are collected, he said, they have to be handed\xa0to the general office for safekeeping and teachers are not allowed to hold or keep cash.\nAnother teacher told CNA that his school was beginning to implement a system where no teacher is allowed to collect funds directly from students, unless they are for donations. All money at his school goes directly to the office finance administrators.\nBefore this, he said, teachers collected money for various fees and programmes from students in cash, which he said was ""quite a hassle"". There were sometimes hiccups on top of the administrative work and chasing of students.\nAnother teacher said she currently collects cash directly from students and gets them to sign off on a name list, which she photocopies and passes to the general office along with the cash.\nShe said she felt mishandling of students\' funds is ""uncommon"" and\xa0by ""dishonest teachers"".\n""The new procedures, while they do make it more difficult to mishandle money, are not fixing the actual problem,"" she said.

      Commentary: University campuses must be safe places for all
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The case of a student who filmed National University of Singapore\xa0(NUS) undergraduate Monica Baey while she was showering erupted on\xa0social media on Friday (Apr 19), when Ms Baey released a set of Instagram Stories\xa0calling for tougher action against him.\nResponding to both Ms Baey and the surge of online reactions that followed, NUS issued a statement the next day.\n""We hear the concerns expressed by members of our community and the public about having a safer and more supportive campus environment, and recognise that advances in camera technology can be easily abused,"" it said.\nArguably, it wasn’t technology that was abused but the very basic trust the 23-year-old had that she could take a shower where she lived without being spied on.\nIt was a fundamental violation of privacy, personal space and campus safety. Many have argued that it was criminal.\nSOME CLARIFICATIONS MAY HELP\nWhile we should avoid speculation that could add more fire to the fuel, there are gaps in our understanding of this story that would be beneficial for NUS authorities to clarify, in the interest of preserving public trust and informing debate over possible next steps.\nNotwithstanding the 12-month conditional warning given to the culprit by the police, it would be useful for NUS to clarify how they separately arrived at the measures imposed on the man - which included a one-semester suspension, 30 hours of community service, and a ban from\xa0on-campus housing premises, as well as counselling and rehabilitation sessions.\nNUS said the decision on disciplinary actions considered\xa0factors such as the severity of the offence, the need for justice for the victim, the rehabilitative needs of the student offender, the safety of the NUS community, and the penalties imposed by authorities.\nStill, its statement does not shed light on the calculations made by the discipline board based on the circumstances of this case.\nWas alcohol influence a mitigating or exacerbating factor, for instance? Should it even be a factor?\nWhat about Ms Baey’s point that he had access because he knew someone else in the same hall?\nWithout these details, online voices are asking if NUS had simply replicated a standard set of punishments without deeper thought given to the damage the incident has wrought on\xa0this young woman, its causes or how such offences can be prevented.\nOnline chatter suggests this wasn’t the first Peeping Tom case in bathrooms around NUS.\nAllegations of similar past transgressions have since emerged, and many are waiting to see how NUS will address these claims.\nBUSINESS AS USUAL?\nIn this fog of information, what is clear is it doesn’t seem like harsher punishment for the culprit is currently on the cards.\nMs Baey said she tried to appeal for a heavier sentence, but was told by the police\'s investigating officer ""You just have to accept the outcome"" or ""go to NUS and push for action"".\nYet NUS’ statement does not suggest the university will be taking further action on this specific case, even as they\xa0review current disciplinary frameworks.\nMs Baey’s account paints a picture of how hard it is for a victim to find closure in the administration of justice for such misconduct.\nIt\xa0doesn’t help that NUS’ prompt public response to media queries on this case didn’t seem mirrored in the very private manner in which they managed the case with Ms Baey.\nMs Baey’s screenshot of the letter of apology conveyed by NUS came in February, almost three months after her ordeal began.\xa0How whole-hearted then are NUS’ recovery actions?\nIn a climate of uncertainty, the risk is if people come away with the idea that NUS writes\xa0off such misconduct or sidesteps concerns over women’s safety because the problem isn’t serious enough to warrant attention. Until it gets media coverage.\nPetitions have sprouted up on Change.org, with one garnering 22,000 signatures and counting. Some online vigilantes are hunting for the man’s details.\nSUPPORT FOR VICTIMS\nWe should be careful not to suggest authorities should be pushing for some form of revenge, but a tougher course of action from NUS could send a clear message about what the educational institution stands for and act as a stronger deterrent against such acts.\nThe worry also is if remedial actions target preventive measures without increasing individual accountability.\nNUS Students’ Union says it condemns any form of sexual harassment, but calling it a serious community problem\xa0that everyone has a responsibility in handling skirts the issue that, in this case, something was done by one individual.\nSome have also called for greater awareness and education of sexual harassment on campuses, but hopefully such discussions have started since Ms Baey reported it to university authorities - and not after this past week.\nMore can also be done to provide a supportive environment for victims. NUS said on Saturday that it was “in the process of reaching out to her to offer our support and assistance”.\nWhere Ms Baey’s perpetrator had rehabilitative and counselling sessions, one hopes the same strong support and much more help were extended to Ms Baey well before this incident went viral.\nSAFE PLACE FOR STUDENTS\n“How can we place our trust in NUS … This trust is now broken,” said Ms Baey’s mother in a Facebook post on Sunday.\n“We, as parents, expect NUS to provide a safe and secure place for students to live in ad to protect them from such instances,” she added.\nA line has been crossed and a young woman’s privacy was violated. One case is one case too many.\nEach time campus safety is compromised, the education\xa0institute has a duty to restore confidence and provide speedy, timely and unqualified help to the victim – and not wait until the issue\xa0comes under the media spotlight.\nMore facts may emerge. Meanwhile, we should feel heartbroken by what has unfolded.\n', 'related_topics': ['     National University of Singapore ', '     education ']}"

      NUS Students’ Union to consider if ‘heavier punishments’ are needed for sex harassment cases
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The executive committee (Exco) of the National University of Singapore Students’ Union (NUSSU) said it is in the process of considering if there should be heavier punishments in cases of sexual harassment on campus.\nThis comes after undergraduate Ms Monica Baey revealed in a series of public Instagram Stories on Friday (Apr 19) that she had caught a student filming her with a mobile phone while she was in a hostel shower.\nShe called for tougher action against the student, adding that the man had been given a 12-month conditional warning by police.\nNUS said it would convene a committee to review its current disciplinary and support frameworks.\nIn a statement released on Facebook, the NUSSU committee said: “NUSSU Exco is in the process of considering whether for future cases, as a matter of general policy against sexual harassment, there should be heavier punishments as a matter of deterrence, and for retributive justice for victims.”\nIt added that it was drafting a report on whether existing sentencing guidelines should be revised, while “considering other processes”.\nIt said it condemned any form of sexual harassment, calling it “a serious community problem that everyone has a responsibility in handling”.\nThe committee also urged victims of sexual harassment to report cases to NUS, and that students should alert the students’ union if they have been told not to report such matters.\n“NUSSU Exco also recognises, that as opposed to a criminal court, that rehabilitation is an extremely strong principle in how student offenders are treated in the Board of Discipline, given that NUS is an educational institution,” the Exco wrote.\n“NUSSU Exco also notes that the Board of Discipline had acted in accordance with existing precedent and due process, and respects that the decision by the board was arrived at in good faith.”\nCALL FOR ‘REAL ACTION’\nMs Baey said she had filed a police report after the incident in November last year. CCTV footage of the suspect, as well as the actual video recording of her, were submitted to the police.\n""The outcome of the entire investigation was a 12-month conditional warning,"" Ms Baey wrote, adding the suspect would only get ""an actual punishment"" if he re-offended in the coming year.\xa0\nMs Baey said she tried to appeal for a heavier sentence, but was told by the investigating officer ""you just have to accept the outcome"" or ""go to NUS and push for action"".\xa0\nShe said she has been “seriously distressed” by the incident and that her mental health had suffered badly.\n“I live in fear. I need to know you will take real action and let the rest of the school know that what happened is wrong and will not be tolerated. You need to protect us! This keeps happening!"" wrote Ms Baey, appearing to address the university.\nShe also shared an apology letter, which was signed by the perpetrator.\nINCREASED AWARENESS AND EDUCATION\nThe students’ union committee said the university should review\xa0how it provides support for victims, and called for greater transparency and education on how sexual harassment cases are dealt with at the university.\nIt also wants increased awareness and education of sexual harassment on campus, while “improving the culture” of reporting such cases in NUS.\n“NUSSU Exco also stresses that all members of NUS have a role to play in creating a culture where sexual harassment is not acceptable,” the statement read.\n“This is not the sole responsibility of the administration, and NUSSU Exco encourages students to play their part in ensuring that we create an empowering, safe and trusting environment for all.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     NUS ', '     education ']}"

We look at the child, that’s why we call it the child support model. Whether the child needs financial support, social support, learning support, we will pull it together,” she said.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     ECDA ']}"

      Commentary: This March holidays, don't be a super planner-parent 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: We are heading into the first term break of the year and I can almost hear every parent heaving a sigh of relief. No more spelling, homework and ting xie to contend with. No need to wake before dawn for an entire week.\nSometimes I wonder who’s really looking forward to the holidays – the kids or the parents.\nWhile most of us can’t wait to catch up on rest, the super-planner in us has probably also kicked in. We’ve probably shortlisted and signed up our little ones for a few holiday camps.\nIf you’re not busy planning, you may be busy worrying. Questions such as “How do I keep my child entertained or suitably engaged?” may flood your mind.\nThe day I learned to relax about the holidays was the day I realised two things. First, it is not my responsibility to keep my children entertained. Second, the holidays are not empty slots that you must rush to fill in.\nCURB THE SUPER PLANNER-PARENT IN YOU\nEven as I write this, I\'ve already planned for my eldest to attend an art holiday programme. We also have an excursion to a museum planned with their Chinese tutor. Plus a couple of play dates.\nThe week looks set to be meaningfully engaging but also with a couple of free hours each day.\nSingaporeans tend to wear busy-ness as a badge of honour. As if some idle time is going to get us slapped with the label “lazy”.\nPerhaps a deep fear of missing out has been hardwired in our parental brains. Perhaps it\'s the Singaporean productivity mindset – we must always keep moving and learning otherwise we risk being left behind.\xa0\nBut what about balance? What about the value of rest?\xa0\nAfter working hard for an entire term, surely our kids deserve a good break?\xa0\nThat said, I too struggle with leaving their holidays alone, untouched.\xa0\nWill they get into my hair when I\'m rushing for a deadline? Will they start fighting among themselves? Will they keep bargaining for extra screen time?\nAll these ""hassles"" and ""what-ifs"" do make the idea of a completely empty holiday schedule seem utterly unpalatable.\nCOPING WITH BOREDOM\nThe biggest bugbear of the holiday season has to be boredom. Whenever my kids finish their stash of fresh library books, they start to get fidgety and restless.\xa0\nThey start asking for more screen time, more snacks or another trip to the library.\xa0\nThey start to irritate one another; tempers rise and fall.\nBut I see good things as well being born out of boredom.\nMy kids are avid collectors of Book Bug cards from the library. One fine day, all of them didn\'t any have homework so my elder two decided to design their own Book Bug characters. It was nice watching them conjure up their own unique characters, each with different superpowers.\nAt other times, they may start to deconstruct their old Lego sets and make new creations.\nOr they’d ask me to look up the Internet for new cake or cookie recipes so we can whip up a storm in the kitchen.\nAs a child, I recall having to accompany my godmother to the office and staying alone with a book or activity pad in a meeting room for hours. I had no idea at the time and probably complained, but those hours may well have honed my patience and uncanny ability to self-entertain.\nWhat happens when their schedules are filled to the brim with classes, meet-ups, and all manner of activities?\nFast forward some 30 years and our children’s schedules are looking even busier than their parents’.\nHow did we get here?\nYes, the activities are fun and beneficial no doubt, but I do wonder: What happens when a child is rushed through childhood at the speed of a Tokyo bullet train? How does this wire their brains to seek life experiences as a grown-up.\nTHE ABILITY TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES\nThis holiday break, it might be interesting to try out this challenge: Leave a day or two untouched and get the kids to plan what to do on those days.\nObviously some boundaries will need to be drawn so that they don’t end up watching TV or playing games from morning till night.\nFor the younger set or for children who are at a loss as to where to start, you can provide some ideas for them to choose from. Maybe there\'s a project that they really want to do, like dabbling in a science experiment or illustrating their own comic book. Or a place of interest they’d like to explore. If it\'s within reasonable limits, why not?\nWhile they\'re at it, get them to think about the time they’ll likely need to complete the task, as well as the things to prepare or buy in advance.\xa0\nThis will activate their planning and organisational skills, and give them a chance to be in charge.\xa0\nIf there are siblings, then all the better as negotiation and perspective taking comes into play. After all, as a family we need to work as a team and find solutions acceptable to everyone.\nWhen the day is over, we can also ask them how they felt about being able to plan and direct their day’s activities. This will encourage them to reflect on their choices and imagine what they’d do differently in the future.\nIn her book Mind in the Making, Ellen Galinsky visited three early childhood programmes in America that were deemed “gold standard”.\nThese programmes took in high-risk children from low-income families, but longitudinal studies have found that they (now adults) demonstrate better grade retention, higher high school graduation rates, and higher employment rates and monthly earnings than children from similar backgrounds who did not participate in the programmes.\nHer discovery? Each of the programmes presupposed children to be active learners who were expected to take increasing responsibility for their own learning. They made their own plans, carried them out, and then reviewed them at the end of the day.\nThis kind of goal-directed behaviour helps children grow to become self-directed adults – which are the kind of people we’d want to see leaving our nests 10 to 20 years down the road.\nAs 21st\xa0century parents, we have shown remarkable prowess at planning and structuring our children’s lives, down to a T.\nBut starting from this holiday, let’s choose to exercise some restraint and leave some space for our children to take over the reins. It might result in a couple of delightful creations and important life skills learnt along the way.\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of\xa0Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     children ', '     education ']}"

      The Big Read: Streaming — the good, the bad and the ugly side of an outdated policy
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Mr Fathul Hanif Ariffin recalled that as a student at Hougang Secondary School, co-curricular lessons were the only time when Express and Normal stream students had a chance to bond. But that did not exactly take place.\nVerbal grenades were lobbed at the Normal stream students instead.\n""The Express students would make snarky remarks that Normal stream students are not as smart as them or we’re slow learners,” recalled Mr Fathul, who was in the Normal (Academic) stream at the school from 2008 to 2012.\nTeachers, too, looked down on students like him. As his teachers at the time taught both Express and Normal stream students, they would make comparisons.\n“There were times when my classmates and I didn’t do well, they would say, ‘Don’t you want to go to Express? Do you want to spend an extra year?’”, said Mr Fathul, referring to the fact that Normal (Academic) students can do a fifth year in secondary education to take the GCE O-Level examination.\nThough the teachers perhaps intended to motivate students, such comments had the opposite effect and came across as “condescending”, said Mr Fathul, who is now 23.\nIt gave the impression that Express stream students were “more superior”, he added, and that Normal stream students “could not go far in life”.\nMr Fathul went on to Temasek Polytechnic, where he was later offered a bond-free scholarship to pursue his undergraduate studies in communications and media studies at the University of Western Australia. He is currently a first-year student there.\nHis experience as well as that of others — including Dr Felix Tan, a former Normal stream student who now lectures at SIM Global Education — highlight the downside of streaming.\nPigeonholing students demoralises them, while being put in a stream considered to be of “lower standing” carries a stigma that becomes self-limiting, education experts, past and present Members of Parliament (MPs) as well as former students said.\nEven government leaders had acknowledged that the adverse impact on students’ self-esteem is among the pitfalls of streaming.\nBut the effects of streaming are not exactly clear-cut, those interviewed said.\nFormer Normal stream students, including Mr Fathul, felt streaming enabled them to learn at their own pace.\nThe perennial debate on streaming took a decisive turn on Tuesday when Education Minister Ong Ye Kung announced that the system would be\xa0replaced by subject-based banding by 2024.\nIt marked the beginning of the end to a contentious policy after a similar move was made to do away with primary school streaming in 2008.\nThose interviewed said the jury is still out as to whether the school streaming system has been a success or failure.\nFor a while, streaming did serve its purpose, especially during Singapore’s nation-building years. It succeeded in cutting down drop-out rates and kept students in schools, they added.\nAs the country prospered, however, the inequality gap grew.\nOn top of that, the rigidity of streaming coupled with the growth of educational pathways and students’ changing aspirations made the system more untenable.\nIn short, streaming had become outdated, they noted.\nDr Intan Azura Mokhtar, an MP for Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency, recently spoke in Parliament of how her Normal (Technical) students felt demoralised.\nDr Intan was previously a secondary school teacher for six years, and is now an Assistant Professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology under its Design and Specialised Business cluster.\nShe reiterated that streaming has served its purpose.\n“It was well-intentioned and did show results,” said Dr Intan, who is also the deputy chair of the government parliamentary committee for education.\n“But ultimately, when society becomes more well-educated and more affluent, we aspire for an education system and landscape that can cater to differences and which can be customised to our diverse needs and expectations. Streaming is not able to provide that.”\nHOW STREAMING CAME TO SCHOOLS\nBefore there was self-government, schools were divided along vernacular languages.\nAfter the People’s Action Party (PAP) formed the first government of self-governing Singapore in 1959, it revamped the education system, starting with the introduction of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) in 1960.\nThree years later, a common education system was introduced — there would be six years of primary followed by four years of secondary education as well as two years in pre-university.\nStreaming could be traced back to the 1960s.\nBefore 1969, students were channelled into academic, technical and vocational schools at the end of their primary education.\nThe Government went on to introduce the Revised Primary Education System and the Revised Secondary Education System in 1976 and 1978, respectively.\nThis is “to cater for human differences and to reduce attrition”.\nUnder those systems, students who failed in primary and secondary schools were channeled to vocational courses.\nThese details were revealed in former Deputy Prime Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee’s landmark report — better known as the Goh report — published in 1979. It detailed the problems of Singapore’s education system then.\nIt was in this report where Dr Goh, then the Education Minister, raised the need for a proper streaming system to reduce the drop-out rate.\nPrimary students would be streamed at the end of Primary 3 into either the normal bilingual, extended bilingual or monolingual course. This took effect in 1981 and was later replaced with the labels EM1, EM2 and EM3.\nSecondary schools would have the Special, Express and Normal streams.\nThough he acknowledged concerns over streaming, he pointed out that “much of the prejudice” against it “derives from an egalitarian philosophy fashionable in the western world” after World War II. And this philosophy “partly rests on a prejudice against the pursuit of excellence”.\nHe reiterated the need for streaming again during a four-day parliamentary debate over the motion of Revised Structure of Education in Parliament in March 1979.\nWhile streaming was a “beastly thing to do”, it was necessary to advance the education system, he stressed.\nOver the decades, streaming did reduce the drop-out rate — from 30 to 40 per cent when the system was introduced to 5.3 per cent in 1997. It fell to 3.7 per cent in 2002 and now stands at less than 1 per cent.\nFrom 1994, further changes were made to primary and secondary streaming.\nAt the secondary level, students were later streamed into Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) courses. Over at the primary level, the EM1 and EM2 streams were merged in 2004, and in 2008, streaming was completely scrapped and replaced with subject-based banding.\nSince 1979, however, the debate over streaming has raged on till today.\nMemorable ones included the intense parliamentary exchange in March 1981 between former PAP MP Dr Tan Cheng Bock and then Education Minister Dr Tony Tan.\nThe MP questioned the psychological impact of streaming and whether “children of very high intellect in special schools where they only play and work together” could relate to the “less academically endowed”.\nDr Tony Tan responded that streaming enables each student to progress at a pace suited to his or her ability. It was too early then to “speculate on its long-term effects” on Singapore’s society and he did not see “the danger” that the MP had alluded to.\nIn 2014, MP Denise Phua called for removal of both PSLE and streaming. There should instead be a 10-year through-train education system.\nLast week, MP Louis Ng pointed out that students are not just streamed based on academic results, as students from Normal streams tend to have lower socioeconomic status.\nA SUCCESS OR FAILURE?\nFormer Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Calvin Cheng, who has cautioned against entirely removing the streaming system, pointed to its success in reducing the drop-out rate and improving the quality of education. As a result, Singapore is now an “educational powerhouse” that has consistently topped global rankings, he noted.\nOn the other hand, former MP Inderjit Singh described streaming as a failure due to its psychological impact and how it “widened the class divide”.\nThe intent was not wrong. We focused on not slowing down good students and paid less attention to allow slow students to catch up,” he added.\nOthers, however, said there is no clear-cut answer on whether streaming has worked or not.\nDr Intan said it would be too simplistic to describe streaming as a success or failure.\nAssociate Professor Jason Tan, from the National Institute of Education’s policy and leadership studies department, said that just like any policy, the Government has to constantly juggle conflicting priorities.\n“It depends on what their values and priorities are at any one point in time, and it’s tough to make everyone equally happy,” he added.\nStill, the majority of those interviewed agreed on one thing: Streaming succeeded at a time when it was needed. Over time, though, it became outdated due to several factors.\nDr Kirpal Singh, director of the centre for educational leadership at the Training Vision Institute, pointed out that streaming was introduced at a time when the playing field was very much levelled as the majority of Singaporeans were still poor.\nThen, parents had a “simple mindset” where they “just wanted their children to get an education, finish it quickly and go to work to supplement household income”.\nAs Singapore’s economy grew over time and its citizens became affluent, some parents had more resources to help their children do well in schools. For instance, by providing tuition.\nSlowly, the inequality gap widened. And streaming, said Dr Singh, could have exacerbated the divide as it allowed students from richer households to advance faster, while those from lower-income households lagged behind.\nGovernment statistics showed that from 2014 to 2018, 69 per cent of secondary school students who received assistance from the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) financial assistance scheme came from the Normal streams.\nAnother factor why streaming has run its course is because the system is “overly rigid”, said Assoc Prof Tan.\nIt did not allow much inter-stream mobility and instead “froze students into boxes”.\n\n\xa0\nStreaming also did not have sophisticated mechanisms to recognise students’ strengths in different subject areas and not many subject options were given to students, said Assoc Prof Tan.\nHe cited, for instance, how Normal (Technical) students are given vocational-type subjects, indicating that they could only go to certain post-secondary institutions and perform certain types of jobs.\nProfessor David Chan, the director of the Behavioural Sciences Institute at Singapore Management University, said that streaming did not take into account certain elements that can be found in the subject-based banding system.\nOne of them is that streaming relies too much on general instead of specific academic abilities. As such, “we miss out the important information on the profile of strengths and weaknesses of the diverse specific abilities”, said Prof Chan.\nSo, a student with great potential and ability in a specific subject but does not do well in other subjects could end up in the lower-ability Normal stream.\nMeanwhile, another student who does reasonably well in all subjects but outstanding in none could end up in the higher-ability Express stream, he added.\n“The problem is exacerbated if the Normal stream environment is associated with other factors that are not conducive to the development of the student’s specific abilities in particular subjects and are overall demotivating for the student to perform academically,” said Prof Chan.\nSuch rigidity does not help amid changing aspirations, said those interviewed. And students wanting to break out of the paths dictated for them to pursue growing job opportunities made streaming outdated, they added.\nOne other factor that made streaming “redundant” is the recognition that students have diverse strengths, as well as the opening up of educational pathways.\nEducation experts pointed out that this was reflected in the scrapping of primary school streaming. In addition, the MOE has ramped up efforts to open up routes for Normal stream students to polytechnics and place more emphasis on aptitude admissions.\nDr Intan said that the emphasis on different abilities and skills through the SkillsFuture movement, for instance, paved the way for the full implementation of subject-based banding. “The abolition of streaming is the next natural step,” she added.\nWHAT’S NEXT AFTER STREAMING IS ‘SLAYED’\nFormer NMP Cheng stressed that removing streaming will not solve the issue of social divide.\nOn the point that streaming has contributed to, or exacerbated, a class divide, he said critics had got the “cause and effect wrong”.\nChildren’s socioeconomic backgrounds contribute to their different academic abilities. It is not the other way around, he said.\nAs such, whether streaming exists or not, the solution should be to help children of poorer families perform in school.\n“Not streaming kids isn’t going to suddenly do away with socioeconomic differences later in life. Many other things determine whether one succeeds in life, including luck,” he added.\nScrapping streaming also will not address growing concerns over elitism and the effectiveness of meritocracy, said Mr Cheng, who is an entrepreneur.\nSocial stratification and elitism are complex issues that cannot be blamed on the education system alone.\nDr Intan echoed a similar point, saying that streaming, for all intents and purposes, is not meant to socially divide. It is seen as an “efficient way of sorting students into groups for efficient teaching and learning”.\n“However, we cannot extricate ourselves from our social interactions and social perceptions,” she noted.\n“Labelling and stigmatisation are the unintended outcomes of streaming, largely due to our natural tendency to categorise and create stereotypes based on our own personal biases.”\nShe therefore argued that “it is our beliefs and actions that stratify us, not streaming alone”.\nWhile there is a need to ensure students achieve success, the solution is not to scrap streaming or dumb down examinations. There is still a need to pursue excellence, said Mr Cheng.\nThe key, he added, is to widen the different definitions of success. “I think we attribute too much of life’s success and failures to academic achievement and streaming.”\nScrapping the labels Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) does not mean streaming has been abolished, said education experts. In fact, doing that means that streaming has only been partially removed.\nElite schools are unaffected by the move as they only have a single stream, said Assoc Prof Tan. There could be a situation where the divide between elite and non-elite schools will be more pronounced, he added.\nMr Cheng quipped: “It’s now the top 10 per cent and the rest … You cannot un-stream away differences. Policy cannot make equal what nature has made unequal.”\nThere is also the question of whether the tuition industry will be affected after secondary school streaming is scrapped. But the experts expect the impact to be minimal.\nDr Singh said that parents still rely on tuition as a form of “extra security” as they still feel the pressure from perceived competition.\nImplementation of the subject-based banding also raises questions on how students will be assessed when it comes to post-secondary institutions or even when they enter the workforce.\nAssoc Prof Tan pointed out that though the new system sort of provides “equal opportunities”, it “does not promise everyone equal outcomes”.\nEntry into junior colleges, he pointed out, should remain rigorous as their sole purpose is to prepare students for university education, and colleges are not at all vocationally oriented.\nWhen it comes to the workforce though, experts said the new system would not have much of an impact since students would receive similar certifications albeit with different subject combinations.\nMr Cheng said that it should not affect one’s employment assessment as an individual’s highest qualification should render the one before that irrelevant, as in other developed countries.\nExperts said that overall, subject-based banding will be beneficial in the sense that groups of students will no longer be tarred with the same brush.\nWhile many have described the changes as long overdue, Dr Singh said: “The MOE or the Government should not have to apologise or be embarrassed for making such changes only now. We are entering a more and more complex world, where no nation has come up with an ideal education system.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Government to end current system of secondary school streaming: What you need to know
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Streaming as we know it will soon be a thing of the past, with the Government on Tuesday (Mar 5) announcing major changes to the secondary school system.\nUnder these changes, secondary school students will not\xa0be posted\xa0into the current Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams, but\xa0will instead be able to take a mix-and-match approach and study subjects at different levels according to their abilities.\nO-Level and N-Level exams are also set to be scrapped, and be replaced by one common national exam instead.\nHere’s what you need to know:\n1. WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE?\nAt the moment, secondary school students go into Express, Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams. These will be scrapped and students will study under a subject-based banding system instead, which means they can take subjects at different levels according to their abilities.\nIt will be similar to how students taking A-Levels study subjects at H1, H2 and H3 levels. Secondary school students will take a combination of subjects at three different levels – General 1, General 2 and General 3.\n2. WHY THE CHANGES?\nThe changes aim to bring a greater degree of customisation, with students able to study more subjects at different levels, as well as subjects that previously might have been offered in another stream.\nStreaming can also negatively affect students\' self-perception. Announcing the changes in Parliament, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung spoke about the downsides to the current streaming system.\n""Entering a stream that is considered ‘lower’ can carry a certain stigma that becomes self-fulfilling and self-limiting,"" he said. ""Students can develop a mindset where they tell themselves, ‘I am only a Normal stream student, so this is as good as I can be\'.\xa0It becomes self-fulfilling.”\n3. A NEW WAY OF ORGANISING FORM CLASSES\nThe changes don’t just stop at the purely academic, but could affect how form classes are organised as well – bringing an opportunity to “reshape the social environment in schools”, according to Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, who announced the changes in Parliament.\nHe gave the example of Boon Lay Secondary, which organises form classes by Co-Curricular Activities, as well as Edgefield Secondary, which has this year re-organised form classes to include students from all three streams.\n“The pioneering practices such as in Boon Lay and Edgefield will become the norm,"" said Mr Ong.\n4. WHO IS AFFECTED?\nStreaming will be replaced by subject-based banding by 2024. About 25 schools will implement full subject-based banding from next year, with more schools joining subsequently.\nStudents entering Secondary 1 in 2024 – this year’s Primary 2 cohort – will be the first full batch of students to be banded according to subjects.\nThey will continue to be admitted across the three PSLE scoring bands, but once in secondary school they will be able to take a combination of subjects across different bands.\n5. NO MORE O-LEVELS, N-LEVELS\nGCE O- and N-Level exams will\xa0be consolidated into a new common national exam and certification framework, and students will receive a single national certification reflecting the level at which each subject is taken.\nThis takes effect when the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort reaches Secondary 4.\xa0\nSingapore and Cambridge will co-brand the new certificate as they are ""strong international brand names in education"", which will ""enhance recognition"" and its value.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Ong Ye Kung ']}"

      Lower compliance costs for private education institutions: Chee Hong Tat 
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The number of regulatory fees private education institutions have to pay will be reduced to lower compliance costs, Senior Minister of State for Education Chee Hong Tat said on Monday (Mar 4).\nThe number of fees payable will be cut from nine currently to three, and each provider is expected to save about S$380 to S$640 annually, he added.\nThese are some of the changes to be made later this year, as SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) reviews its rules to reduce compliance costs and to make it more “convenient” for private training providers seeking different types of regulatory approvals, said Mr Chee, who was speaking in Parliament during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate.\n“We want our regulations to be pro-business while maintaining quality training standards,” he said.\nA risk-based performance management system will also replace the current Continuous Improvement Review process for Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) Approved Training Organisations, in order to “simplify” the licensing process for providers offering both WSQ and private education programmes, said Mr Chee.\nSSG is also trying to further reduce the cost incurred by WSQ training providers issuing e-Certificates.\nSince 2014, the certificate fee has been reduced from $2.60 to $1.20.\n“We believe that smart regulation is an important enabler for supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and will help our training companies grow and export their services overseas,” said Mr Chee.\xa0\n“It can be one of Singapore’s competitive advantages. But we must not assume that smart regulation will automatically happen … government agencies must be open to feedback and listen to proposals from the industry.”\nMr Chee added that the Government is working with training providers to develop industry standards and expand overseas.\nHe said that existing adult educator training requirements for WSQ courses will be extended to SSG-funded, non-WSQ certifiable courses. These requirements will take effect in 2021.\nHe also highlighted a pilot initiative, supported by SSG and Enterprise Singapore, to develop\xa0and export\xa0training programmes referenced to WSQ standards. The\xa0initiative by the Strategic Association of Professional Training-Consulting Organisation\xa0will start with India and Vietnam.\n“This will help our training providers to export their services to overseas markets,” he said.\nADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR COMPANIES WHO WANT TO IMPROVE WORKERS’ SKILLS\nCompanies which qualify for the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG) will also be able to apply for an additional subsidy aimed at supporting them in improving the skills of workers, said Mr Chee.\nCalled the Productivity Solutions Grant (SkillsFuture Training Subsidy), or PSG (SFTS), it will cover 70 per cent of out-of-pocket training expenses for such companies, capped at S$10,000 per company.\nThis will be part of efforts to provide “extra support” for companies, and to “reinforce the message that worker training and skills upgrading are critical elements for business transformation"",\xa0Mr Chee added.\nThis will be on top of the existing training subsidies of up to 90 per cent, he said.\n“As companies restructure and transform with technology, they should also build capabilities in their workers to help them move up the value chain,” said Mr Chee.\n“Transformation must be ‘technology driven, people led’. Using technology alone is not adequate if the workers are not trained to optimise these tools. If we do it well, enterprise transformation should result in higher profits for the company and higher pay for our workers – a win-win outcome.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Chee Hong Tat ']}"

      Wealth tax, scrap secondary school streaming: MPs suggest measures to tackle inequality, social stratification
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Getting the rich to pay more taxes, giving vulnerable groups better\xa0employment opportunities, and slaying the “sacred cow” of\xa0streaming in secondary schools.\nThese were some suggestions Members of Parliament (MP) put forward to tackle inequality in the areas of income and employment, and social stratification in education during the second day of the Budget debate on Wednesday (Feb 27).\nMP for Fengshan SMC Cheryl Chan said Singapore has “done well” when it comes to distributing resources equitably, as its system is built on meritocracy, a fair and progressive tax system, and a redistribution of wealth which focuses on social outcomes.\nBut over the last decade, there is evidence that the increase in wealth inequality has become greater than income inequality, she said.\n“Those with the wealth are not only on a better footing to accumulate more, they have even better access to resources that helps preserve their wealth,” she said.\nWith that, Ms Chan asked if there was a possibility of introducing a net wealth tax and inheritance tax for ultra-high net worth individuals, who make up 1 to 2 per cent of society.\n“In the spirit of giving and sharing, will the ultra-high net worth individuals be willing to share more of their wealth to uplift the vulnerable and less privileged communities?” she asked.\nWhile Ms Chan acknowledged that subsidies like the Silver Support Scheme as well as GST and transport vouchers help lower-income groups defray basic living expenses, she said consumption taxes indirectly raises the general cost of living.\n“In order to maintain fiscal prudence, we need new revenue sources to sustain the many programs that may have a long tail in the years ahead,” she added.\nMs Chan also encouraged the top and middle tiers of the economy to pay more for the services of the lower-income groups.\n“The employers too have a fair share to play in this as they balance their profits, re-invest in the workers and give the workers a decent wage to begin with,” she said. “It is not how large or small the action is, but what we are willing to do and to what extent to effect the change.”\nWhile Ms Chan said the current Progressive Wage Model and Workfare Income Supplementary Scheme help raise the wages of lower-income individuals, she questioned if such schemes are sufficient in today’s context to meet their needs.\xa0\n“I feel that to effectively make a difference that impacts and uplifts the lower percentile group, in particular those with young families, giving them access to resources - especially a decent living wage, so that each worker at the end of the month would have more to spare - is actually more critical,” she stated.\nStill, Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim said “compensatory policies in the form of social safety nets” remain necessary to “cushion citizens who face disruption and are unable to fit into different industries immediately or perhaps unable to catch up at all”.\nFor example, the Adapt and Grow initiative - which was designed to help Singaporeans affected by economic slowdown and restructuring - has helped more than 76,000 job seekers find new employment from 2016 to 2018.\n“While the numbers seem impressive, it would be useful to know whether these job seekers who switched industries had comparable remuneration or had pay cuts, and how many could not find new employment even though they tried to sign up for the initiative,” Ms Lim said.\xa0HELP THE VULNERABLE\nBeyond the lower-income group, MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC Intan Azura Mokhtar urged the Government to help other vulnerable groups like those with special needs and mental health challenges.\n“These two groups of individuals continue to face stigmatisation and challenges in their effort to be like everyone else and in leading a life as normal as possible,” she said, adding that they need time and space to adjust to their work environments and commitments.\nDr Intan suggested including these groups under the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and Additional SEC, which support employers and\xa0raise the employability of older Singaporeans.\nBusiness owners or employers can get support in the form of tax reliefs or wage support to allow for flexi-work arrangements, she added, noting that this can provide better employment opportunities for the groups to work from home at a pace they are comfortable with.\n“Being gainfully employed is a start in helping those with special needs or with mental health challenges live independently like many others, and it accords sufficient opportunities to develop that much-needed self-belief and self-dignity,” Dr Intan said.\nAljunied MP Ms Lim also referred to low-income household residents who have taken up jobs in the gig economy as members of the “vulnerable workforce”.\nSome have told her they need the flexibility of time to attend to frequent family issues, she said, but do not have paid help or family support, and thus find it difficult to take time off regular work to attend to personal matters.\n“It is well known that gig economy jobs come with hardly any employee benefits, such as paid leave or bonuses, and do not attract CPF contributions,” Ms Lim added, although she noted that the Government is looking to improve terms and conditions for gig workers.\nBesides what employers can do, Dr Intan said society needs to be more accepting of people with different abilities, whether as employers, co-workers or neighbours.\n“Our personal acceptance paves the way for more of those among us who are considered vulnerable individuals, to have a place in our society, be independent and have that opportunity to lead a life that is as normal as possible,” she added.\nABOLISH SECONDARY SCHOOL STREAMING\nThis inclusivity should also extend to the education system, MP for Nee Soon GRC Louis Ng said, as “it is surely just as important” that high and low-income children learn, play and mix with one another.\nHowever, Mr Ng said streaming in secondary schools might prevent social mixing and harden social stratification, as he urged the Government to eliminate this practice.\n“I know that streaming is a sacred cow and this practice has existed for many decades. Members will know that I don’t like to cull animals, but it really is time to slay this sacred cow,” he said.\n“I am sure streaming was not meant to divide our nation by socioeconomic status, but we now see that streaming does contribute to it.”\nFor instance, Mr Ng said students in the Normal streams tend to have a lower socioeconomic status than those from the Express streams.\nHe pointed to statistics which show that students from the Normal streams make up a higher percentage of those who live in public rental flats, as well as\xa0those who get help from the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Financial Assistance Scheme.\n“Indeed, for some students there is\xa0strong stigma associated to being in the Normal stream,” Mr Ng said, citing a research paper which highlighted that Normal (Technical) or EM3 students are perceived as stupid.\nIn addition, Mr Ng said it is difficult for students in the Normal streams to move to the Express stream. Each year, 530 Normal (Technical) students transfer to the Normal (Academic) stream, and of this figure, only 10 to 20 eventually move on to the Express stream.\nThis stratification continues further up the education ladder, Mr Ng said, noting that over the past three years, most Normal (Technical) graduates finish their studies in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), earning a lower starting pay than their peers who graduate from university.\n“Why do students from the Normal streams struggle to move to the Express stream?” Mr Ng asked. “One reason could be the psychological barriers that streaming imposes on Normal-stream students.”\nIn contrast, Mr Ng said like in primary schools, Subject-Based Banding has been expanded to all secondary schools to benefit more students, attracting support from teachers and parents.\nCurrently, Subject-Based Banding\xa0allows suitable students\xa0to take specific subjects at a higher academic level starting from Secondary 1. For example, a\xa0student in the\xa0Normal (Academic) stream\xa0could\xa0take some subjects at Express level.\n“So what is stopping us from abolishing streaming in secondary schools?” Mr Ng\xa0questioned. “What is stopping us from preventing this kind of social stratification?\nWhile Mr Ng admitted that there will be inequality in Singapore’s education system as everybody is not the same, he said “our students are not stupid and should not feel that they are or face that kind of stigma”.\xa0\n“Every school is a good school and now let’s make every class a good class,” he added.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Commentary: Want your kids' vocab to improve? Read aloud to them
  </h1>, 'text': 'PERTH: Words are powerful, and a rich vocabulary can provide young people with significant advantages. Successful vocabulary development is associated with better vocational, academic and health outcomes.\nWhen parents read books aloud to their children from an early age, this offers notable advantages for children’s vocabulary development. This gives them a broader range of possible word choices.\nResearch also suggests children who don’t have the opportunity for shared reading are comparatively disadvantaged. If we want our children to be able to draw on a rich vocabulary to express themselves clearly, we need to read to them. Developing a child’s vocabulary is a valuable investment in their future.\n\n\nBENEFITS OF READING ALOUD\nIn the very early years, spoken vocabularies have been associated with higher achievement in reading and maths, and better ability to regulate behaviour. Vocabulary is also linked to success in reading comprehension and related word recognition skills.\nMuch of a child’s vocabulary is acquired through daily conversations. Shared reading aloud can provide a valuable additional source of new words children can use to power their expression. Research suggests the text of picture books offers access to more diverse vocabulary than child-directed conversations.\nAt some point, most of us have experienced the frustration of searching for an elusive word that is essential to clearly communicate an idea or a need. When children speak or write, they draw on their vocabulary to make word selections that will optimise the clarity and accuracy of their expression.\xa0\nBeyond vocabulary, reading aloud offers numerous additional benefits for children. Reading aloud may support students to develop sustained attention, strong listening skills, and enhanced cognitive development.\nRecent research also suggests children who are read to from an early age may be less likely to experience hyperactivity. Children who are at risk of reading difficulties may particularly benefit from being read to. Children who are learning English as an additional language may experience better reading comprehension when they are read to in English.\nReading aloud with your child is also valuable parent-child time. It can strengthen the parent-child relationship and foster reading engagement, which is essential if we want our children to enjoy the benefits of being a life-long reader.\nHOW CAN I OPTIMISE VOCABULARY GROWTH FOR MY CHILD?\nVocabulary development can be improved through explicit teaching techniques such as providing definitions for new words. For example, while reading to your child, when you encounter a new word you may pause and ask the child what they think it means.\nIf they’re unsure, you can then read a little further along so the word is encountered in a context that can give valuable clues about meaning. If the meaning is still unclear, you can provide a definition for your child so you can move on.\nA recent study found approaches that involve pointing, providing definitions, and asking some questions as you read together can be good for vocabulary building.\nRecent research found nearly identical gains in vocabulary where children were read to either using explicit techniques (such as pointing and giving definitions) or a more engaging storytelling approach.\xa0\nIn the storytelling approach, the adult reading to the child added contextual information, which made the child more interested and engaged in the story.\n\n\nChildren will also benefit from hearing the same story a number of times. It’s also a good idea to use some of the new language in subsequent conversation if possible. This can increase exposure and strengthen retention of new words.\nBut what if I don’t have a book? We may not always have a book at hand. In these cases, you can draw on your creativity and tell a story, which can also benefit vocabulary.\nWhile there is limited research in this area, one study compared telling a child a story or reading them a story with a child reading silently to themselves. The study found all three groups of children learned new words. But telling a story and reading a story to a child offered superior gains in vocabulary.\nBEATING THE BARRIERS\nResearch suggests that children may be aware of the benefits of listening to books read aloud. This awareness can be a source of regret for the child when reading aloud at home ends, but they still enjoy shared reading.\xa0\nChildren may continue to enjoy and benefit from being read to beyond the early years. You should keep reading with your children as long as they let you.\nBy far, the biggest barrier raised by parents to reading aloud to their children was the formidable barrier of time. If reading aloud becomes a routine part of family life, like dinner and bedtime, this barrier may be overcome as the practice becomes an everyday event.\nDue to diverse issues faced in homes and families, not all parents will be able to read their child a book, or tell them a story. This is why it’s still so important for schools to provide opportunities for students to regularly listen to engaging and culturally diverse books.\nBut reading aloud is not a typical daily classroom practice. We should increase the number of opportunities children have to hear stories both at home and in schools so children can experience the many benefits of a rich and varied vocabulary.\nMargaret Kristin\xa0Merga\xa0is senior lecturer in Education at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia.

      ‘We’re passing them hope’: The ITE student who found her purpose uplifting others
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: She’d just come out of what she calls the lowest point in her life – her upper secondary school years, when she was bullied and isolated to the point that she had to drag herself out of bed in the mornings.\nIn her first year at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Ng Pei Ying wanted a change for the better.\nShe even did a web search on “how do you find a purpose”. “If you don’t have a purpose, you wake up not knowing what to do for the day,” said the 17-year-old digital animation student.\n“Desperate” to get out of her rut, she attended an introductory talk on a pilot programme called ELEVATE – a service-learning project for ITE students to give back to the community – and decided to give it a try “because all my friends were in it”.\nIt turned out to be the thing that might well have transformed her life.\nThe once-withdrawn, insecure teenager who sought solace in her art, is today looking to spend her life helping others – all because of an opportunity that showed her the difference she could make in the lives of the disadvantaged.\nA LONELY, SHY GIRL\nPei Ying grew up a solitary, shy girl. Drawing was her avenue to express herself. And it was to art she turned, when she became a victim of bullying in secondary school.\n“They wrote some nasty things on a wall, and it went around the school,” she shared. The scribbles were erased – but then were rewritten by the unknown culprits. The harassment left the Normal (Technical) student “emotionally tired”.\xa0\nI just wanted to stay in bed.\nBut home was not a refuge either. “My home life … could be quite rowdy at times,” she said of the clashes that took place.\nDrawing centred her somewhat. But eventually, she was driven to distraction. She started skipping her track and field training and was kicked out of the co-curricular activity.\nShe also began hanging out with an older group outside school. “Most of the time, we just met and went to abandoned buildings,” she said. “I wasn’t focusing on my studies. All I wanted to do was go out.”\nSome of her friends would drink, some would buy her things, and it was easy to be lulled into thinking that she finally belonged. But one day, she realised this was a lifestyle she couldn’t afford – and a path she didn’t want to go down.\n“Money was one of the obstacles. Secondly, I knew that I didn’t want to do this in the future. I’m pretty sure my friends aren’t going to pay my bills then.”\n‘NEW YEAR, NEW ME’\nPei Ying’s desire for “something different” came as she settled into life at ITE College Central in 2018, where her love of drawing drew her to the digital animation course. She tried to convince herself to “be more cheerful”.\n“People don’t know about your past and everything, so why not?” she reasoned. “New year, new me.”\nAnd new opportunities came by way of ELEVATE. It is a project by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) for ITE students to use the vocational skills they learn in class to meet the community’s needs.\nIn Pei Ying’s case, she and six friends were assigned to teach drawing and animation to children at Care Corner Student Care Centre, which provides after-school support for children aged seven to 14 who are mostly from low-income families.\n“These children might (otherwise) not have the opportunity to go for digital animation courses or even high-level drawing workshops,” said social work associate Lim Hui Ying from AWWA, the organisation coordinating with the ITE and the student care centre.\nBut first, Pei Ying had her own hurdle – a lack of self-assurance – to overcome.\n“When I first saw her in the programme, she was very quiet,” recalled student care officer Jonathan Toh, who provides counselling services for ITE students. “She didn’t have that much confidence to complete certain tasks that were given.”\nSTEPPING UP TO LEAD\nOne thing Pei Ying\xa0had going for her, however, was her desire to learn and give of her best.\nShe studiously brushed up on the animation she’d been taught. “I didn’t want to go there and teach them something I didn’t understand myself,” she said of the four students under her direct charge.\nThe once-introverted, impatient teenager was shaping up to be a caring and encouraging mentor under ELEVATE. “She’d also really look out for her friends,” said Ms Lim.\xa0\nIf she felt that they were being left out, she’d try again and again to interact with and engage (them).\n“She wasn’t what you’d think of a 17-year-old student. She was very mature, very responsible.”\nIn fact, added Mr Toh, “during the whole process, she rose to become the group leader”.\nWATCH: How Pei Ying's life changed (6:48)\nThen, there were the excitable children to test Pei Ying’s mettle. “They were very active and kept roaming around,” the teenager recounted.\n“They forced me to be patient because I couldn’t flare up at them no matter what … I had to accommodate them because they wanted to learn.”\nThe children got to draw and animate Pac-Man, Spiderman and other things they liked. Aleeya Humairah Thong described Pei Ying’s instructions as “very clear”. Inspired, the 12-year-old declared: “I want to become a drawing and animation artist.”\nOne achievement Pei Ying remembers, was getting one particularly shy girl to open up to her. The girl didn’t know what to draw, and “I just kept asking her questions”, said Pei Ying.\n“In the end, she drew a hospital – because she wanted to be a nurse – and little cats at the bottom.”\n‘IT REACHES DEEP INTO YOUR HEART’\nFor Pei Ying, the experience may well have altered the course of her life. She has now set her sights on becoming a social worker.\nThat fire was lit when the ITE students got to do community service as part of an ELEVATE camp – in her case, singing for the elderly, which she “genuinely enjoyed”. “It just felt right,” she said.\nHaving a goal to work towards has made her a better student – one who now sits in front of the teacher, instead of at the back of the class as she used to.\nHer friend Erman Tan says she’s more vocal as well. “In Year One, she was very lost in (her) studies. When she didn’t know how to do stuff, she wouldn’t ask questions. Now, she opens up to ask.”\nIndeed, Pei Ying overcame one of her biggest fears – public speaking – when she had to share her ELEVATE story at the programme’s graduation ceremony after its June-to-November run. She delivered it in front of some 180 students across the three ITE colleges, as well as VIPs, beneficiaries, and the programme’s funders – Temasek Foundation Cares, Lorinet Foundation, Quantedge Foundation and Trafigura Foundation.\nThough her stint in ELEVATE is over, Pei Ying continues to do volunteer work through balloon sculpting, one of ITE College Central's co-curricular activities. She recently visited a kidney dialysis centre and an old folks’ home, sparking smiles and laughter from beneficiaries with her balloon creations.\nA PLATFORM TO SHINE\nTo Mr Toh, the change in the quiet girl he first saw has been impressive. “She might have had the potential, but it’s just that she hadn’t had the platform to shine,” he said.\n“I always tell students, ‘What you learn in the ITE, you can bring out and showcase to the community.\xa0\nIt isn’t just something for earning a living, but something (with which) you can make an impact.\nThat is the idea behind ELEVATE, which started in 2017 and was conceived to “nurture compassion in students to serve the community”, said NCSS director (Service Planning and Standards) Chan Whee Peng.\nFor example, ITE College West worked with YMCA, and ITE College East with Touch Community Services, to have students volunteer their skills to the elderly – such as by repairing and servicing wheelchairs, or doing simple home-fixes for them. The students were paired with groups such as the Lions Befrienders and Kampong Senang.\nRicky Saputra Ng, a student in mechanical technology, said that meeting old folks who kept a positive attitude despite living alone inspired him. “Usually, I view life negatively. I’ve been failing academically, and ever since my grandma passed away, I’ve felt even more depressed,” he said.\nHe now tries to be more responsible by showing up on time for class. “Last time I wouldn’t even show up,” he chuckled.\nA FUTURE WITH MORE CHOICES\nMr Chan added that if the programme’s “good progress” continues, “we hope to see ELEVATE replicated as an established model in the ITE colleges and made available to more students”.\nIts impact may well extend beyond the ITE students. Care Corner senior teacher Quaraisha Roslan shared that her charges were “fascinated” and “impressed” by the ITE College Central campus and the classes they attended.\n“They even told me, ‘When I grow up, and I can go to the ITE, I’d want to go, and I’d want to join this digital animation course,’” said the ITE alumna.\nThat was quite satisfying for Pei Ying to hear. “Other than skills, I think we’re passing them hope. It’s like we’re giving them more choices for what they want to do in future.”\nThere is every reason for them – and her – to aim high, believes Mr Toh, who graduated from ITE with a certificate in office skills nearly two decades ago.\n“Maybe 10 years down the road, she could be my colleague (or) fellow practitioner in the field,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised.”\nThis story by CNA Insider was done in partnership with Gov.sg.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     CNA Insider ', '     education ']}"

      Special Assistance Plan schools remain relevant: Ong Ye Kung
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools continue to have a place in the education system, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Saturday (Feb 23), despite questions about the relevance of such schools in multi-cultural, multi-racial Singapore.\nSAP schools were established in 1979 against the backdrop of falling enrolment in Chinese-medium schools. The aim was to preserve the best of these schools, to promote the learning of Chinese language and culture.\nThere are 26 SAP schools – 15 primary and 11 secondary schools.\nSpeaking at an event to mark 40 years of SAP schools, Mr Ong acknowledged that some SAP school students have lamented the lack of opportunities to interact with students from other racial communities.\nThis, however, should not have to lead to a “drastic change” to the SAP system, he said.\nWith Asia being the fastest growing region in the world and China being Singapore’s largest trading partner, Mr Ong said the learning of language and culture has become “more important than ever”.\nEven though bilingualism has been a “unique advantage” here, people in other countries are catching up and even surpassing\xa0Singaporeans, he added, noting that it is increasing common to meet Europeans and Americans who are fluent in Mandarin.\n\xa0“The right thing to do is to preserve the programmes and institutions that promote the learning of our Mother Tongues, and improve them where we can,” said Mr Ong in a speech at the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre.\n“We should be very careful not to undo any of these efforts as that would be bucking the strategic trend at a time when it matters the most.”\nOn a national level, Mr Ong said Singapore’s identity draws from the cultures of different communities.\n“Our nation-building journey is far from over. A nation’s identity takes centuries to develop and mature, and it has to draw from the cultural richness of individual communities,” he said.\nOver the years, some have criticised the SAP programme for creating greater ethnic segregation by reinforcing Chinese culture in a multiracial society.\nAddressing this issue, Mr Ong acknowledged that a key area for improvement is to expand and deepen opportunities for SAP students to make friends from other communities.\n“There is definitely room to do better,” he said.\n“Because the objective is not just getting students to interact occasionally with students of other races, but having the experiences of growing up together with friends from all ethnic backgrounds, developing mutual trust, understanding our multi-cultural society and appreciating the adjustments we have to make in order to maintain our social cohesion and racial harmony.”\nAt the same time, it has become increasingly challenging to run an SAP school, said the minister, because more students come from English speaking families and English has become the more commonly spoken language in schools.\n“Given Singapore’s language environment today, it will be an uphill task to make all our students effectively bilingual and bicultural,” he noted.\n“But with SAP schools, we will have a good chance to develop a core group in every cohort, with an intuitive understanding of Chinese culture, history and thinking, and with standards of Chinese close to those in China, Taiwan or Hong Kong.”\n', 'related_topics': ['     Ong Ye Kung ', '     education ']}"

      ‘We are here to help, not to judge’: Helping parents key to tackling long-term absenteeism in schools
  </h1>, 'text': ""\nSINGAPORE: With eight siblings at home and his mother the sole breadwinner, money is always tight for 17-year-old Nur Alamin Yusri and his family. To supplement the family income, he decided to work part-time two years ago.\xa0\nHe was then a Secondary 2 student at Bukit Merah Secondary.\xa0\n“I felt we were a burden to my mother, which is why I decided to reduce the burden on my family,” said Alamin, who took on odd jobs such as working as a banquet server for weddings, or at fast-food restaurants.\xa0\nBut the late nights soon took a toll on him, and his school attendance began to slip. Often, he admitted, he would prefer to stay at home where he would play games, and he showed up at school about twice a week on average.\xa0\n“It was difficult to wake up, especially after I got into the habit of sleeping late, and I also had to take care of my siblings,” he said. “I also felt that school was boring, and I got stressed when the teacher went too fast for me to follow.”\xa0\nBut fast forward two years, and Alamin’s now in Secondary 4, with an almost-perfect attendance record for the year and hopes of going into a business services or fitness-related course at the Institute of Technical Education when he graduates.\xa0\nAnd he recalls\xa0with a grin\xa0that it was a “learning journey” on a bus that brought him to where he is now.\xa0\nA LEARNING JOURNEY ... BACK TO SCHOOL \xa0\nIt all started with a knock on his door one morning. It was his school’s student welfare officer, Muhammad Erwin Othman, who had showed up to bring him to school.\xa0\n“I thought maybe we’d be taking a taxi to school, but I came down and I saw a bus,” said Alamin. “There were other students in it too. And I thought, what is this? A learning journey?”\nThe bus forms the centre of Bukit Merah Secondary’s efforts to tackle long-term absenteeism, as Mr Erwin explained. The initiative, which is called the BUS - or Bring U to School - programme, was launched two years ago and saw the school use an actual school bus to go around the surrounding areas and pick up students who\xa0failed to show up at school.\xa0\n“Honestly, we were running out of ideas, and we thought, maybe it was a transport issue,” said Mr Erwin. “Then one of the year heads just said, ‘Let’s get a bus and drag them all to school'.\xa0\n“That’s how it all started.”\xa0\nThe bus\xa0typically leaves the school at around 8am, after the attendance for the day has been finalised. About five staff members - including Mr Erwin, some teachers and even school leaders at times - are usually on board.\xa0\nThey use the time on board to build relationships with the students and motivate them, before returning to school. Students are then given a quick brunch before they go back to class.\xa0\n“Sometimes, the doors are opened by parents, sometimes by the students, and sometimes\xa0they purposely don’t want to open the door,” said Mr Erwin. “So we try and coax them to come out, and if the parents are there, we’ll tell them that we’re here to help, no judgement involved.”\nThe school also involved its leaders such as the vice principals and year heads to mentor the students who may need help catching up with their peers in their academics.\xa0\n“The students were more focused and less playful, and I think they saw that the school leaders actually care about them,” he said.\nToday, the school has seen a marked drop in the number of students with irregular attendance. From 17 students earmarked for the bus programme in 2017, the numbers dropped to 12 in 2018, and this year, there are only about 6 or 7 students on the list so far. Due to the lower numbers in 2019, Mr Erwin said the school has switched to using taxis instead - but the acronym remains.\xa0\n“Our priority is to help the students, and if they’re not in school, how to get help? So we just give them that structure, that habit of actually coming first, then we build up on that,” he said.\xa0\nPARENTS, FAMILY ENVIRONMENT A COMMON THREAD RUNNING THROUGH THESE CASES\xa0\nLike Bukit Merah Secondary, other schools already have existing programmes and support structures in place to help deal with the issue of long-term absenteeism. For example, St Andrew’s Secondary runs an after-school engagement programme with a similar concept to that of a drop-in centre, where students can use facilities like pool tables, foosball tables and game consoles. The programme also provides academic support and organises activities such as barbecues to engage the students. \xa0\nAt a broader level, student welfare officers such as Mr Erwin have been deployed by the Ministry of Education to support schools in their efforts. Mr Erwin’s duties, for example, include looking out for and befriending students who have issues coming to school or are chronically absent, working with their families or other community partners and overall, finding ways to assist them in coming to school.\xa0\nLong-term absenteeism is a problem that has been in the spotlight recently. In October last year, the Ministry of Education convened an inter-agency task force that aims to strengthen support for under-performing students from disadvantaged families, in particular by tackling long-term absenteeism and drop-out rates in schools.\xa0\nSecond Minister for Education Indranee Rajah\xa0chairs the task force, which is known as UPLIFT. She explained that the task force is part of the Government's ongoing work to reduce inequality and boost social mobility.\xa0\nIt will release its recommendations in the upcoming Committee of Supply Debate.\xa0\nAs Ms Indranee noted when she first announced the task force, the reasons behind long-term absenteeism are complex. But student welfare officers who spoke to Channel NewsAsia point out a common thread among the cases they have seen: Parents who may need help themselves.\xa0\nMr Austin Oon, a student welfare officer at St Andrew’s Secondary, pointed out that a “significant portion” of the boys who are referred to him have divorced parents or parents with poor spousal relationships.\xa0\n“When you talk to the parents, you can see it’s not a happy family,” he said. “I understand that most families won’t be perfect, but you can see there are issues at home.”\xa0\n“Parents are usually the strongest allies ... but the parents themselves can be in difficult situations and may need the help themselves,” he added.\xa0\nMdm Tiffany Yan, a student welfare officer at New Town Primary, pointed out that she has come across parents who are “too involved in their own lives” or do not have the time or energy to take care of the children”.\xa0\nAnd at the primary level, she said, the role of the parents is especially important.\xa0\n“The children are very dependent on their parents, especially the younger children in lower primary,” she said. “At the upper primary level, we can still work with the child and it’s easier to motivate them when they are old enough to come to school on their own.”\xa0\n“Some children have told us that they actually want to come to school, but there was no one who could send them to school,” she added.\xa0\n“And once they are allowed to do what they want and play till late at night, it gets harder and harder for them to catch up in school.”\xa0\nAnother major challenge raised by Bukit Merah Secondary’s Mr Erwin is that families who may need financial assistance are often unwilling to acknowledge that fact.\xa0\n“I think some families may look okay on paper, but there are underlying problems that the family won’t share because face is important to them,” he said. “So sometimes they may qualify for help, but will choose not to go for it.”\xa0\n“So we have to balance all their needs and their fears,” he added, citing an example where he and his team accompanied a student’s mother to get her CPF statements in order for her to get help.\xa0\n“But once we did it, she refused to sign it, because she was scared it would affect how people would view her or her children,” he said. “It took awhile for us to persuade her … but once she signed it, the child got tuition, the family got help, they are doing very well and there are no issues with attendance.”\xa0\nPARENTS NEED AFFIRMATION TOO \xa0\nThe importance of reaching out and building relationships with parents is one reason why, according to Mr Oon, his school works at building relationships with parents right at the start, before issues begin to crop up. For example, the\xa0school works with the parent support group to organise a coffee club which holds activities such as parenting seminars and sharing sessions for parents to support each other.\n“Knowing parents early is easier for us to make the first step,” he said. “Subsequently, if there’s a need to engage them at a deeper level or to report bad news, it’s easier if you already know them.”\xa0\nHe also stressed the importance of affirming and validating family members when things go right.\xa0\n“Can you imagine every time the school calls, it’s going to be bad news? Sooner or later you’re going to block that number,” he said.\xa0\n“But sometimes, it would really help when, after talking it through with the parents, you call and tell them that their boy is coming to school, there have been no complaints and he’s paying attention in class … this will validate the parents because they need support too.”\nIt is for this reason, therefore, that Mdm Yan hopes that the task force will reach out to parents and give them support in their parenting skills. \xa0\n“There are actually a lot of programmes and resources available for parents in the community, but I think sometimes the parents may not be aware of them, or may not be motivated,” she said.\xa0\n“I’ve always hoped there will be some sort of compulsory workshop for parents, so they know what is important for their children.”\xa0\nIn the area of financial assistance, meanwhile, Mr Erwin hopes that more flexibility can be given to families who may not have all the necessary paperwork.\xa0\n“A lost IC can cost S$300. I don’t think all of them are able to afford that fee,” he said. “I also have some families who have lost their children’s birth certificate, so they can’t even get help from the schools.”\xa0\nLooking ahead, he also hopes that more can be done to reach out to disadvantaged families to reassure them that help is available - without any judgement.\xa0\n“It is a fact that we are here to help, not to judge,” he said. “And their children will not be taken away from them.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Indranee Rajah ']}"

      A-Level results out next Friday; graduates who opt for polytechnics can skip semester
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The results of the GCE A-Level examinations will be released next Friday (Feb 22), the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Friday.\nStudents may collect their results from their schools from 2.30pm on that day, while private candidates will be notified of their results by post.\nThe ministry also announced on Friday that A-Level graduates who choose to further their studies at\xa0polytechnics can now skip the first semester for more than 100 courses.\nCurrently, most A-Level graduates apply for and enrol in a polytechnic only one year after getting their results. This is because most polytechnic admissions exercises would have closed by the time the A-Level results are announced.\nFrom Academic Year 2019, eligible A-Level graduates can be admitted directly to Year 1 Semester 2 each October for 110 polytechnic courses, up from the current nine. This will reduce their polytechnic course from three years to two-and-a-half years.\nThe 110 courses make up about half the diploma courses offered by the five polytechnics, and span several course clusters.\n“A-Level graduates who are not enlisting in National Service will be able to enter the polytechnics in the same year that they receive their A-Level results. As a result, this group will be able to graduate one year earlier,” MOE said.\nInterested A-Level graduates will be able to apply to the polytechnics directly for these 110 courses in mid-August, for matriculation at the start of AY2019 Semester 2 in October this year.\xa0\nMore details will be available on the respective polytechnics’ websites by March 2019.\n200 A-LEVEL GRADUATES ENROL IN POLYTECHNICS ANNUALLY\nPlaces for A-Level graduates will be separately catered for, and there will be no impact on the number of places for O-Level graduates or ITE graduates, MOE said.\n""The number of places for A-Level graduates will depend on the demand from and quality of applicants, and hence will vary from year to year,"" it said.\nAccording to the ministry, about 200 A-Level graduates are admitted each year to the five local polytechnics\xa0– Nanyang, Ngee Ann, Republic, Singapore and Temasek.\n""These are students who are keen to pursue an applied pathway at the polytechnics, that matches their area of interest or aptitude,"" it said, adding that the number includes both A-Level graduates who have applied and those who did not apply to the local universities.\nEducation Minister Ong Ye Kung said he hopes the changes will encourage more A-Level graduates to consider enrolling in polytechnics.\n""Every year, some students who receive their A-Level results wonder about their options if they do not enrol in one of the Autonomous Universities,"" he wrote in a Facebook post.\n""We hope that these changes will encourage more A-Level graduates who are thinking about pursuing their studies through an applied pathway to also consider the polytechnic option.""\nFor most polytechnic courses, A-Level graduates would need passes in two relevant H2 subjects to receive module exemptions. These requirements may differ for specific courses.\nCourses which offer module exemption have ""sufficient commonalities"" between the A-Level and polytechnic curriculums, MOE said. The exemptions are mostly for polytechnic foundational modules, and students would have covered similar curriculum in preparing for the A-Levels.\nFor example, A-Level graduates in Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Diploma in Information Technology may be exempted from the modules on Computing Mathematics\xa0and Programming 1\xa0if they have passed H2 Computing or Computing Science, and H2 Mathematics.\nSimilarly, A-Level graduates in Temasek Polytechnic’s Common Engineering\xa0Programme may be exempted from the modules on Engineering Mathematics 1, Engineering Physics, Digital Fundamentals 1\xa0and Circuit Analysis\xa0if they have passed H2 Mathematics and H2 Physics.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Ministry of Education ', '     education ', '     polytechnics ']}"

      Commentary: Disruption is coming for Singapore business schools
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The latest Global Innovation Index ranked Singapore as the fifth most innovative country in the world.\nWe come up top in many areas including high-tech manufacturing and high-tech net exports.\nTech innovation has propelled Singapore towards realising our ambition of becoming an innovation-based economy, but large foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) have been its primary engine.\nFor the instincts of tech innovation to be woven into the fabric of our economy requires us to groom local innovators – local talent who can create enterprise solutions to local problems that have the potential for international scale.\nWorldwide, research and development (R&D) activities in small, innovative economies are primarily driven by home-grown companies.\xa0In Sweden, local MNCs contribute almost half of total R&D expenses while Nokia contributed close to 50 per cent of R&D expenses in Finland during its prime.\nAs Budget 2019 draws near, the Ministry of Finance has asked for feedback from Singaporeans on how companies and workers can become more innovative to gain a long-term competitive edge.\xa0\nSo it is timely to examine how Singapore can develop local tech innovators and grow the next unicorn that can reap massive economic growth in an era of disruption.\nWHAT TRADITIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOLS OFFER\nSuppose a student wants to learn how to start a tech company. What can he do?\nThe conventional path for him is enrolment into business school. Yet this option is less than ideal where outdated programmes and case studies will lead him to learn the tepid vocabularies of entrepreneurship from dusty case studies such as Google and 3M, yet fail to develop the instincts needed for breakthrough innovation.\nHe might also learn business principles like minimum viable product, a risk-based approach towards business which encourages entrepreneurs to commit the least resources needed to build a functioning product.\nIn this, he might learn that to build a fully functioning four-wheel vehicle such as a car, he should start by thinking about building a two-wheel skateboard to gather feedback from customers before proceeding further.\nYet this paradigm is problematic because it assumes a linear, incremental model of innovation but the gestation journey of most game-changing technologies is often radical and aggressive.\nSeeking feedback on a faster horse carriage will not give rise to Ford’s gasoline-powered automobile.\nThe other problem is that traditional business schools, as a microcosm of the university education system, inculcates short-term thinking. Students are subjected to continuous short-term scholastic testing, including examinations, essays and class participation.\nInstead of fostering much needed imagination, creativity or a can-do attitude, business schools saddle students with academic endeavours and conditions them to prioritise their resources and attention for the short term.\nEntrepreneurship, in contrast, requires the entrepreneur to be able to think long term, seize new opportunities and pivot to solve problems.\nThe entrepreneur will inevitably make mistakes, encounter setbacks and experience uncertainty, and little in business school teaches him how to navigate these challenging circumstances.\nBeing encouraged to be risk-averse, the business school graduate instead avoids taking risks and fails to develop the killer business acumen vital for innovation.\nThese same instincts are needed in a student who eventually wants to work in a high-growth tech company, even if he doesn’t want to start his own company.\nSome say we expect too much out of business schools, which are also tasked with grooming professionals climbing up the corporate ladder and helping people switch industries mid-career.\nBut most of us can agree equipping graduates with skills for the future economy must remain a basic goal or business schools risk becoming obsolete.\nThe alarm bells have sounded. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing had remarked at an Industry 4.0 panel that the conventional education system alone is too slow to meet the needs of tomorrow.\nOver the past 20 years, more business schools around the world are offering entrepreneurship modules but it is worth considering bolder changes to these programmes in Singapore.\nBUSINESS SCHOOL 2.0\nI have five suggestions for business schools to consider in ensuring business programmes remain relevant.\nFirst, a closer partnership with industry leaders to develop programme components. Mentorship and coaching from industry leaders can move the needle.\nMany self-made billionaires around the world have committed plans to help students realise their entrepreneurial potential yet these programmes are still not part of mainstream business school education in Singapore.\nTaizo Son, a self-made billionaire, founded Vivita, an early education school that provides a 21st century makers’ space to nurture a children’s curiosity for entrepreneurship. They expose students to the latest cutting-edge technology, including virtual technology, 3D printing and the like.\nBy empowering students to create, experiment and prototype, Son’s programme propels students to solve problems and make the future.\nPeter Thiel, co-founder of Paypal and an early investor of Facebook, started the Peter Thiel Fellowship since 2011.\xa0\nEach year, he gives 20 to 30 students a two-year US$100,000 fellowship to drop out of college and commit full-time to build their business. His fellowship also provides a network of investors, customers and mentors that fellows can draw on for support.\nRETHINK THE DESIGN OF BUSINESS DEGREE PROGRAMMES\nSecond, instead of a model of teaching and passive knowledge acquisition, business schools should design their programmes to focus on practice as core curriculum\xa0in developing action-oriented graduates.\nBusiness programmes should be experiential and provide an immersive experience that allows students to develop, launch and operate real business plans. They should aim to get students out of the classroom and into the competitive world of solving real problems.\nBusiness schools should transform themselves into accelerators that aggregates programmes, events, initiatives and business competitions on a common platform for students - in partnership with entities such as Enterprise Singapore, incubators and the start-up ecosystem.\nThey could hold hackathons, business competitions or pilot studies so that students can pitch and pivot their ideas to fit the needs of enterprises.\nBusiness schools could design their programmes to fit each stage of the business life-cycle, from ideation, prototyping, beta-testing, early-stage venture capitalisation and rapid growth.\nThere are no lack of available suitable partners to business schools.\nThe Start-up Weekend Singapore (SWSG) Mega Hackathon, a space where diverse talent brainstorm and tackle specific challenges in 24 hours, helps entrepreneurs brainstorm ideas and meet people with different skills, and is a great module for the ideation phase.\nStartupX,\xa0partly run by SWSG’s founder, recently partnered with Temasek to start The Start, a programme that supports entrepreneurs with high-potential ideas in the prototype or beta stage with funding and coaching, so that they can become a viable company that attracts follow-on investor funding or customers.\nCompetitions such as the DBS-NUS Social Venture Challenge or the Lee Kuan Yew Global Business Plan Competition, with its exposure to venture capitalists, can provide useful testing grounds in the post-beta or revenue generation phases.\nIn all these, the school should also see itself as an enabler for the student, to provide links to relevant resources, networks and opportunities that support students in building their unique business model and mobilising resources to succeed. Professors would act in advisory capacities as mentors to be consulted on students’ business strategies.\nRETHINK PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT\nThird, business schools must keep case studies fresh and relevant. Instead of dusty old business cases, the school could draw on virtual accelerator programmes such as One\xa0Million by One Million or reality TV shows such as Shark Tank and Dragon’s Den, which do a better job in teaching students how to be entrepreneurs with stronger, more recent case studies.\nFourth, in terms of performance measurement, in lieu of grades, business schools could track students’ follow-on funding or revenue generated through hackathons or business competitions, complemented by annual reviews that track students’ assessment of their own growth and 360-degree feedback from mentors, customers and team mates.\nThe school should also track the number of projects that become inactive, as well as those at the ideation, prototype, beta, early or growth stage. Students whose projects become inactive could be matched, based on student's interests, to other teams whose projects are growing.\nRETHINK ADMISSIONS\nFifth, let’s rethink admissions. Business schools should select hungry, ambitious candidates who want to turn ideas into reality - and jettison traditional rule-based admission methods based on past performance and grades.\nBusiness schools should assess the potential of aspiring graduates and their proposed project through qualitative questionnaires and interviews, in the same way that many professional degree programmes select students based on their portfolio\xa0and field interests.\nIn this, the school could take a page from the playbook of established accelerators like Y Combinator, Tech Stars and Echoing Green, which select entrepreneurs based on their subject mastery and leadership skills, the innovativeness of their\xa0intended project and potential for huge impact.\nThe school could then try get students who might have common or complementary ideas to team up.\nRETHINK BUSINESS SCHOOL \nThe Times Higher Education has plans to launch a new way of ranking universities next April. It would capture the quality of jobs landed by graduates, contributions to economic growth and global partnerships forged.\nThe initiative is in line with Singapore’s push to measure an institute’s worth beyond the narrow measurement of research publications and is a step in the right direction.\nWhere even the ranking agencies have recognised that old methods of signaling which educational institutes have a better value proposition, it is time for business schools to step up and rethink its role in an age of disruption.\nSingapore must strive to grow our pool of local tech innovators and company founders, and business schools must transform themselves to aid this goal.\nOon Tian Sern is the founder of Acceset.

      Woodgrove teacher told MOE officer students' over-collected funds used on books, stationery
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: When asked about S$40,000 in over-collected funds from students she had allegedly misappropriated, a teacher at Woodgrove Secondary School said she used it on assessment books, practice papers and coloured markers.\nMaslinda Zainal, 44, claimed trial to two charges of criminal breach of trust over the alleged misappropriation of money collected from students for learning materials between January 2016 and April 2017.\xa0\nOn Monday (Dec 10), Ministry of Education (MOE) investigation officer Lucy Lim took the witness stand for the prosecution and described to the court how she took a 10-page statement from Maslinda, who had been the head of department for English since 2006.\nIn answers to Ms Lim’s questions on Apr 7, 2017, Maslinda said there was usually a balance of more than S$2,000 from money collected from students at the end of the school year.\nWhen asked what she did with this money, Maslinda said in her statement: “I used the remaining money to buy stationery\xa0such as coloured markers, foolscap papers, whiteboard markers, refills for whiteboard markers.”\nThese were used by the English department and by the students for group work, she said, and the teachers returned the stationery to Maslinda after they were done.\nMaslinda said the students were not aware that the money had been used to pay for stationery, and she did not think she told the other teachers that the stationery had been bought with the students’ balance money.\n“Do you still have the receipts for the stationery\xa0that you bought using the students’ money?” Ms Lim asked Maslinda on that day.\n“I don’t think so,” she answered. “I usually discard them when I do spring-cleaning.”\nWhen asked if she thought it was right to use students’ money to purchase stationery, Maslinda answered “no”.\n“Why did you still do it?” Ms Lim asked.\n“I thought it would be troublesome to return the money to the students and in exchange I just purchased stationery\xa0for use in classrooms and for projects,” she replied.\nShe added that she bought stationery such as colourful markers and foolscap paper which was at times given as prizes to students from the school bookshop or the Popular store.\nThe school’s general office stocked up on the usual colours red, green, blue and black, she said, and she had received feedback from students that they liked to use more colourful markers.\nWhen Ms Lim asked Maslinda about the alleged discrepancy of about S$22,000 in funds in 2016, Maslinda answered: “I am tired of this investigation because I know that I am not going to win anyway. All the odds are against me. Let’s just say that I took the money but I do not have the money with me. I want to end this statement now.”\nAccordingly, Ms Lim stopped taking her statement and she was handed over to the police, who had arrived.\nACCUSED KEPT MORE THAN S$10,000 IN HER HANDBAG: MOE OFFICER\nBefore Ms Lim took Maslinda’s written statement, she and her MOE colleague had an interview with her a few hours earlier, Ms Lim told the court.\n“Between 11am and 12.15pm, we had an oral interview with Maslinda where she said yes, she had used the remainder of the students’ money to purchase assessment books and print additional practice papers for the students,” Ms Lim said.\xa0\n“When we asked her if she had any receipts for these, she said all her purchases were done over the phone, and she had thrown away all the invoices and receipts earlier in the year.”\nThis was for the year 2016 - Maslinda explained that she had not bought any assessment books or printed additional practice papers for 2017 yet, and that the balance of the money collected for the year 2017 was in a box at her work station.\nThey then headed to Maslinda’s cubicle to inspect her belongings. They found cash of about S$5,330 inside a box, which was the leftover money collected from students for 2017.\nMs Lim also found the following inside Maslinda’s handbag: Cash of about S$4,500 in her wallet, S$6,085 in cash in an envelope marked Woodgrove Secondary School and cash of S$870 loosely stuffed in the bag.\nThe S$6,085 was her performance bonus, she said, while the S$870 was from the S$1,000 allowance her husband gave her.\nThe MOE investigators also found cash of S$630 in another envelope in a clear folder, along with a class list.\nMaslinda\'s defence lawyer Singa Retnam in his cross-examination of Ms Lim put it to her that Maslinda had told her the truth but Ms Lim ""refused to accept whatever explanation she gave"" to her.\nThe trial resumes on Dec 21.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     schools ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Public trust in our educators is fragile and can be easily fractured
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: From time to time, cases of teacher misconduct surface in the local press.\nJust last week, educators have been found engaging in reprehensible behaviour, for instance, leaking examination questions and answers as was the case at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\nIt did not help when further news of a Woodgrove Secondary teacher allegedly misappropriating money collected from students and that of a former Nanyang Technological University director being charged for conspiring with others to cheat the university out of more than S$200,000 broke on the same day.\nThese incidents have shone the spotlight on the professionalism of educators and threatened to erode public trust in the education line of work.\nA PROFESSION THAT DEMANDS HIGH STANDARDS\nThe Ministry of Education has placed the utmost importance on teacher professionalism and set the tone for the field for many years.\xa0\nIn 2011, the Ministry put in place its Ethos of the Teaching Profession in an attempt to codify professional standards for all teachers.\nPart of this ethos includes the teachers’ vision, centring around three key words: Lead, care and inspire.\nTeachers are called upon to care for their students and touch their lives. They are looked upon to lead and inspire their students to believe in themselves and to be the best that they can be. They are also expected to forge trusting partnerships with families and the community in the wider interests of students.\nIndeed, the vision expresses noble ideals that the Ministry hopes teachers will aspire towards and live by in their craft.\nVery often, it is not so much the formal lesson content that students recall after they have left school, but the simple and seemingly insignificant acts outside of the classroom that teachers perform.\nFor instance, a recent news report about a Teck Whye Primary School teacher hugging her students as she handed them their Primary School Leaving Examination results highlights how a teacher’s work goes far beyond classroom instruction and examination preparation.\nHer action illustrates the importance of attending to the socio-emotional well-being of students and how these connections form the basis of trust between teachers and students.\nEDUCATORS MUST UPKEEP TRUST\nHow can teachers establish trusting partnerships with their students and their students’ parents?\nThis question is especially pertinent in view of the relatively young profile of the teaching workforce and amid challenges wrought by long hours, huge class sizes and an increasingly heavier administrative workload\nFor one thing, teachers need to demonstrate not just in word but in deed that they are competent and hold high professional standards.\nFirst, teachers have to demonstrate to parents and students their competence - that they have a firm grasp of their subject content, and that they have a flexible pedagogical repertoire that meets their students’ varied learning needs.\nFor instance, an English language teacher might discover that some students learn more effectively through watching instructional videos that reinforce key grammar concepts. The teacher could then arrange for them to view the videos after school hours and monitor their progress in mastering these concepts.\nThird, teachers must connect with every student and motivate him or her to do their best. This means taking the trouble to know each student and guiding him or her through the ups and downs of life in school (and often outside of school as well).\xa0\nFor instance, teachers may detect signs of child abuse in the home and take appropriate measures to help the child, including seeking help from social services.\nNot only is trust difficult to build up, it can easily be dissolved at a moment’s notice. All it takes is one unhappy incident, one case of perceived teacher bias or one case of teacher insensitivity to a student’s inability to follow the pace of lessons.\nHaving said that, though, it is important that teachers uphold professional integrity and make tough decisions when necessary.\nIt can be all too tempting to pander to students’ whims, for instance in designing less demanding assessments, in order to be viewed favourably by them.\nTeachers also need to mete out punishments when there is clear evidence of student wrongdoing and be able to explain their rationale clearly to students and their parents if asked. \xa0\nSuch occasions often test the limits of parental and student trust in teachers as professionals, and may serve as a litmus test of teachers’ care for their students’ emotional and moral development.\nHow willing are teachers to stand up for what they believe to be sound pedagogy or moral principles in the face of possible adverse reactions from students and their parents?\nREMEMBER TEACHER AREN’T SUPERHUMANS\nAll in all, it does seem like we expect our teachers to be superhuman, in a job that is demanding and highly emotional.\nAmid the pressure of preparing students for examinations and competitions, teachers are also expected to be role models for their students.\nThey have to juggle these multiple tasks while having to meet tremendously high public expectations placed on their shoulders. It was just a few years ago that local media reports debated whether it was appropriate for teachers to smoke, drink or go clubbing.\nWhen cases of misconduct arise, it is easy to throw shade on these educators who do not live up to their high calling but we should be careful not to paint all teachers with a broad brush.\nParents and Singapore’s wider community need to support teachers. Let’s not forget an indispensable part of a constructive relationship between teachers and parents involves trusting teachers to do the right thing.\nOne factor that could challenge this longstanding public trust is the rise of overly interventionist parenting. Some parents might feel that some teachers fall short in attending to their children’s needs – and might constantly check in, intervene and suggest how teachers can do a better job.\nThese instincts need to be balanced against the need to put trust in teachers’ professionalism. When children see their parents constantly overriding school teachers, teacher-student trust is weakened.\nAnother challenge is the prevalence of private tutoring. When tutors offer alternative pedagogies that prove effective and can focus exclusively on the needs of a single student, there is a tendency for parents and students to measure school teachers’ work against private tutoring experiences – and come to view the teacher-student relationship in transactional terms.\nThe Ministry of Education claims that the future of the nation passes through teachers’ hands. In light of this, teachers’ work ought not to be under-estimated or denigrated.\nAt the same time, teachers have to constantly remind themselves that they have to uphold the ethos of the teaching profession so as to earn the respect of their students and the wider community.\nJason Tan is associate professor at the National Institute of Education.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     teacher ', '     MOE ']}"

      Woodgrove teacher trial: Principal did not know money was collected from students, says defence
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The principal of Woodgrove Secondary School did not know that teachers have been collecting money from students for learning materials for the various subjects, said the defence in the trial of a teacher accused of misappropriating students’ money.\nWhen questioned by the defence on Thursday (Nov 29), principal Chee Chit Yeng admitted that he found out money was collected for various learning materials, only after the case involving Maslinda Zainal was brought to his attention in March 2017.\nMaslinda, 44, stands accused of criminal breach of trust by misappropriating about S$40,000 meant for learning materials known as Excel packages. This allegedly happened between January 2016 and April 2017, while she was the Head of Department (HOD) for English.\nMaslinda was to hand the money to the school bookshop, which would print the materials for the students.\nHowever, she allegedly over-collected money from the students which amounted to S$40,000.\nDefence lawyer Singa Retnam charged that Mr Chee, the prosecution’s first witness, did not actually know how the Excel packages were prepared and paid for.\nIn response to questions, Mr Chee explained it was his understanding that the packages were prepared through ""teamwork"", with certain teachers in charge and level coordinators pulling the resources together.\nAsked about who prepared the packages specifically for the Secondary 1 students, Mr Chee said he could not recall.\n""This is because, Mr Chee, you have no idea what was going on in the school,"" charged Mr Retnam.\nAt this, the prosecution raised an objection that the question was ""without foundation at this point"".\nMr Retnam went on to question Mr Chee about how money collected from the students for the packages was handed to Maslinda by the teachers.\n""I have not witnessed it myself,"" said Mr Chee. ""But my understanding is that they passed her in envelopes with class lists sometimes to account for whatever they had collected.""\n""But in reality you do not know how money was handed over to the accused by each teacher,"" pressed Mr Retnam, to which the witness agreed.\nAt the defence\'s questioning, Mr Chee acknowledged that he had not given any written instructions to teachers about how money should be collected for the materials.\nMr Chee has been principal of the school since 2013. By that time, Maslinda had been English HOD for seven years.\nDuring the cross-examination, Mr Chee also shared that\xa0he had previously been vice-principal at Greenridge Secondary School, and that his role at Woodgrove was his first\xa0as principal.\nPROCEDURES NOT ADHERED TO: PRINCIPAL\nEarlier, Mr Chee told the court that procedures relating to the collection of money were not adhered to.\nPrompted by Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh, Mr Chee described the school\'s practice for money collection: ""In 2014, I\xa0shared with the school management committee consisting of key personnel that any collection, any letters to parents that involve the collection of money would have to be signed by myself or minimally one of the vice-principals.""\nThe key personnel informed included HODs, subject heads and level heads.\nMr Chee added that he had not signed any letters to parents indicating that money was to be collected\xa0for the Excel packages.\nHe said he was shocked by the discrepancies as it was ""not expected"".\nHe added that neither the procedures nor policies were adhered to, as there was ""no letter that accompanied the collection"", and that students should have paid for the materials at the bookshop directly.\nDistrict Judge Ng Cheng Thiam asked Mr Chee what usually happens\xa0if there was money left over after cash had been collected from students.\nMr Chee said there have been instances where money was deducted from the students\' Edusave accounts, and a portion was later refunded to the students when there was a reduction in costs.\nACCUSED WON AWARDS, WAS OVERLOADED WITH WORK, SAYS DEFENCE\nWhen asked by the defence what Maslinda\'s duties were, Mr Chee explained that she was in charge of instructional programmes for English, coordinating the different levels for the subject, vetting examinations and assessment papers.\nShe also put up yearly budget proposals, and was in charge of work performance of teachers.\nMr Retnam pointed out that on top of all this, she had a host of other duties, including a teaching role, leading six committees, heading a performance that was ""a roaring success"", as well as marketing the school by visiting primary schools in the neighbourhood to talk about Woodgrove.\n""She was coordinating the English language programme for five levels,"" said Mr Retnam. ""And there were 1,200 students and 30 classes.""\n""That\'s right,"" answered Mr Chee.\n""So don\'t you think she was overloaded with work?"" Mr Retnam asked.\n""In my opinion, as a senior education officer, holding on to an HOD role, I would say that is the more-or-less average workload for senior education officers,"" replied Mr Chee.\nHe added that he had ""many other officers who are also performing with that kind of workload"".\nMr Retnam showed the court photos of two awards Maslinda had received. One was an excellent service award in 2011, and the other was a caring teacher award in 2016, when Mr Chee was principal.\n""How was the accused\'s performance as head of department?"" Mr Retnam questioned.\n""I\'ve shared earlier - till the point of the incident, I\'ve assessed that she has performed satisfactorily,"" Mr Chee answered.\n""Wasn\'t she getting a 90 per cent pass rate for the O-Level exams for the English subject?"" Mr Retnam questioned.\n""Yes, for all the classes,"" Mr Chee said.\nHe then acknowledged that when he first became principal in 2013, the school had scored highly in what’s known as a school climate survey conducted by the Ministry of Education. The survey’s aim is to get a ground sensing of teachers’ sentiments about how things were running in schools.\nThe results of the survey was at 90 per cent, Mr Retnam said, asking Mr Chee what the figure was currently.\n""That last one that we had, I believe it was 51, 52 per cent,"" Mr Chee answered.\n""So it dropped from 90 per cent to 52 per cent in a few years,"" Mr Retnam said.\n""Yes,"" Mr Chee acknowledged.\nThe trial resumes next month with another witness on the stand, as Mr Chee is unable to attend court on that date.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     schools ', '     education ']}"

      Woodgrove Secondary teacher on trial for allegedly pocketing S$40,000 from students

The discrepancy between the cost of the packages and the amount she collected was about S$40,000.\nMaslinda, who is represented by defence counsel Singa Retnam, has been suspended.\nSHOCKED\xa0AT SUCH A LARGE OVER-COLLECTION: PRINCIPAL\nThe principal of the school, Mr Chee Chit Yeng, took the stand on Wednesday as the prosecution\'s first witness.\nHe described to the court how the misappropriation was first detected by the school\'s lower-secondary head for English, Ms Jacqueline Chan.\nMs Chan had asked the bookshop owner about the materials and if the packages had already been paid for.\n""The bookshop lady said yes and showed her invoices,"" said Mr Chee. ""When she looked at the amounts reflected, it was significantly different from the amount collected from the students.""\nThe information was then relayed to Mr Chee, and Maslinda was mentioned as she was ""the one who liaised with the bookshop vendor and settled payment"".\n""The materials were supposed to have been produced by the bookshop. The students should have paid for and purchased the materials directly from the bookshop,"" explained the principal. ""That would have been the normal procedure.""\nAfter this, Mr Chee tried to collect evidence by obtaining copies of the name lists of all the classes, book lists issued to the students and invoices from the bookshop.\nHowever, the shop was able to provide only invoices for the years 2016 and 2017, as it was not able to retrieve records from 2015 and earlier due to a round of housekeeping, he said.\nTogether with the vice-principal, Mr Chee created a table tallying up the figures of what the packages should have cost and how much Maslinda collected.\nHe found a discrepancy of about S$40,000.\n""Personally, I was quite shocked that there was such a large over-collection,"" Mr Chee said.\nHe said he had had a good working relationship with Maslinda and she had led the department satisfactorily during his time as principal, beginning in 2013.\nAfter this, Mr Chee contacted the discipline unit of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and made a police report on Apr 7, 2017.\nMaslinda was later released on bail and suspended. In her absence, Ms Chan took on her roles and shared her duties with other teachers.\nThe trial continues on Thursday.\nThe prosecution intends to call at least nine witnesses, including Ms Chan, the owner of the bookshop, teachers from the English department and MOE investigation officers.\xa0\nIf found guilty of criminal breach of trust, Maslinda could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\nIn response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, MOE said it takes a ""serious view"" of educator misconduct.\xa0\n""As the matter is before the courts, we are unable to reveal any details,"" it said.\n', 'related_topics': ['     crime ', '     schools ', '     education ']}"

      ‘Masculinity crisis’ in China leads parents to enrol kids in boot camp
  </h1>, 'text': 'BEIJING: He is nine years old, but his mother says he behaves as if he is still in kindergarten.\nIn his free time, Tao Youqi would like nothing more than to play. But Ms Polly Hou tells her son that he is not hard-working and does not read enough.\n“She says I’m extremely slow with my homework and that it’s of lousy quality,” said the boy.\nBecause of all that, she does not consider him a “manly man” – and because of his appearance too. “My mother thinks I’m too fat, so I’m not manly,” said Youqi. “A real man has to be slimmer.”\nCompared with his female classmates, Ms Hou finds that they “all behave and look two years older”. But he is not the only boy in Beijing who is not stacking up well in her eyes.\n“I feel that girls these days are too outstanding. Boys have got to catch up,” she said.\nFor parents like her who want their boys to grow into men, there is a recourse – a crash course, to be specific, in the form of a seven-day boot camp that aims to toughen boys aged between six and 12.\nAnd the man running it thinks Chinese society has nothing less than a “masculinity crisis” on its hands.\n""I’ve observed that there are some problems with our boys. Some are more effeminate, petty, weak-minded and emotionally fragile. Their fitness levels are also falling,” said Beijing Boys’ Club founder Tang Haiyan.\nI want to tackle this crisis, save our boys and nurture young men for China.\nNot everyone agrees with him, but as the new series Cram Course Asia discovers, there are crash courses across the continent for students of all ages and in any subject – from Indian dancing classes for families to go Bollywood at weddings, to training for cyber stardom.\nAnd each of them says something about contemporary Asia. (Watch this episode here.)\n‘FEW MALE ROLE MODELS’\nFor many of the children who are enrolled at the Beijing Boys’ Club, it would be their first time leaving home to attend a camp. Take, for example, eight-year-old An Zecheng, whose grandmother was worried about him being sent there.\n“I have a traditional mindset, so I don’t like it if children are away from home,” said Mdm Yao Shuqin.\nHis mother was worried too, but she signed him up anyway. “He’s timid and lacks confidence,” explained Ms Zhao Li. “He’s the sort who’s easily bullied by others because he doesn’t face up to problems.”\nZecheng’s primary caregivers are his grandmother and mother, who is a working mum, while his father often goes on work trips. “This lack of a fatherly figure in his life contributes to his lack of masculinity,” said Ms Zhao.\n“If he becomes a real man, I hope he’ll be responsible and be able to contribute to society.”\nMr Tang, who set up his boot camp in 2012, holds the same belief. “One big contributing factor in the current masculinity crisis is that boys are growing up in an environment with very few male role models,” he said.\n“These days, boys are brought up by their mothers. In primary school, 90 per cent of the teachers are female. Mothers and female teachers don’t know how to teach boys to be boys. They only know how to impart knowledge.”\nHe thinks the one-child policy, which was in place from 1979 to 2015, has not helped either.\n“If you’re an only child in China, you’d have six adults – father, mother and both sets of grandparents – revolving around you. Growing up in such an environment causes problems,” he said.\n“Girls can be nurtured to be more ladylike, gentle and reserved. But if boys are brought up in a similar way, they’d grow up being like girls. Boys won’t learn to be strong, brave and independent. They become too girly.”\nALL WORK AND NO PLAY\nIn Youqi’s case, he is not the only child, but his mother agrees that in the past, “you wouldn’t think the boys weren’t manly enough” – though for another reason.\n“All the boys and girls spent their days playing outdoors,” she said. “At that time, even the girls were boisterous.”\nHer son, on the other hand “lacks the time to play” because playtime has “made way for a range of extra-curricular activities”.\nMonday is for calligraphy; Tuesday is for piano and robotics; Wednesday is for language and calligraphy; Thursday is for English; Friday is for Weiqi (the intellectual board game Go); Saturday is for mathematics, English and Weiqi; and Sunday is for badminton, art and Weiqi.\nMr Tang is less concerned about the lack of play children have than their lack of a ""strong will” that he said characterised the earlier generation when life was tougher.\n“Everyone worked hard to overcome the tough times. Children had to work and do chores. These days, children don’t do anything,” he lamented.\nThat is why, to learn independence and responsibility, the boys at his boot camp must do chores, such as tidying their room and washing their clothes.\nThat was something 11-year-old Zhou Xiaoyu found troublesome during his time there. “I’ve done laundry at home using the washing machine – all I needed to do was press some buttons. Over here, I have to hand-wash my clothes,” he complained.\nHe was sent to the camp because, even though his mother knew him to be an “outgoing … innocent and kind boy”, she wanted him to have more self-discipline, including at school.\n“Before he was in third grade, he couldn’t even sit still for a moment,” said Ms Yu Yue. “Not only is he slower than the girls, he’s also slower than other boys his age.”\nFROM A ‘MAN’S CHEER’ TO A PLEDGE\nSo how else does the boot camp, which costs US$730 (S$1,000), go about transforming Beijing’s boys into the masculine men Chinese society expects them to be?\nIt starts even before they get there. On the bus to the camp, they are taught “a man’s cheer”.\nWhen their coaches ask them who the best is, they must yell, “I’m the best.” When they are asked who’s the strongest, they are to shout, “I’m the strongest.” And when they are asked who they are, they must cry out, “I’m a man.”\nIn his welcome remarks to the group including Youqi, Zecheng and Xiaoyu, Mr Tang made it clear that they would not be treated as “pampered little boys”.\n“Children, you must know that we’re men. What does it mean to be a man? It means you’re the pillar of your family,” he said.\n“In our families, fathers are very busy, and they shoulder heavy burdens. That’s a man’s responsibility. To a country and its people, men are the pillars of support. So I hope we’ll learn how to be responsible.”\nFor seven days, phone calls and visits are not allowed. It is not an army camp, but the coaches conduct military-style training such as drills.\n“We want them to feel that they can do what the average person can’t do … This is the reason we conduct military training here,” explained Mr Tang.\n“The military is the best place to train boys to be determined, courageous and have exemplary behaviour. Everyone knows that the military is a place where you train men to become better people.”\nAnd, he reasoned, every parent wants their children to have a strong character.\nWATCH: How to toughen up 6- to 12-year-olds (5:39)\nThere are also activities like American football and sumo wrestling – “rough” activities that children do not get to do at home and in school, he said.\n“Some parents may find them dangerous. But they’re important for building up the boys’ courage,” he added.\nThe boys are split into two teams to fight each other. Each day, the winning team is awarded what is known as The Red Flag, and one boy from that team is honoured as the Hero of the Day.\n“The teachers would often single out the student who wins the Hero of the Day badge and make him an example for the rest to follow,” said coach Cheng Long.\n“We’d get him to demonstrate some of the activities, so he’d get a lot of attention. I think that gives the children a strong sense of achievement.”\nThere is even a “men’s pledge”. As the children recited, “There are three things we need to protect and cultivate: Our country, honour and aspirations.”\nCHALLENGING STEREOTYPES\nNot everyone supports such efforts to “save” China’s boys. Women’s rights activist Feng Yuan, for one, does not think the crisis is real, especially if boys are being judged by examination results.\n“It’s not as if all the girls are doing better than the boys. But rather, traditionally, people are used to boys doing better ... Now that people see how well girls are doing, they start to feel anxious,” she said.\n“Everyone thinks it’s only right that males are stronger than females. So the moment boys aren’t performing up to expectations, people start to overreact.”\nThe co-founder of the non-governmental organisation Equality (Beijing) also questioned the different attributes associated with men and women in China.\n“The qualities that are important today – for instance strength, willingness to learn, open-mindedness, bravery, decisiveness and responsibility – are all qualities that shouldn’t be found only in a man,” she said.\n“These are qualities that every responsible, fully-functioning human being should strive to have.”\nOver at the Beijing Wing Chun General Association, Grand Master Wang Zhipeng has seen how girls want to be ""tough"" and ""more courageous”.\nAt his wushu school, the number of female students keeps going up, and they are increasingly winning the bouts against the boys. But that also leads him to conclude that boys today are “weaker and less manly”.\n“There are many boys who don’t know what they’re doing,” he said. “Compared to girls, boys have poorer coordination. The lack of exercise might be the reason they’re uncoordinated, impatient and distracted.”\nOne girl who is proving herself in the ring is 10-year-old Wu Jingshu. Before she had that chance, however, she had to win a battle at home: Her father was not keen on letting her learn Wing Chun.\nSaid her mother Shang Yanling: “He thinks it’s useless for girls to learn martial arts. He would rather have her learn skills that are more elegant and ladylike, such as dance, singing and piano.”\nBut Ms Shang was more supportive. “As a mother, what’s more important to me is that she’s able to protect herself, accept failure and also have the courage to charge forward,” she said.\n“That way, whenever she faces challenges, whether at work or in her learning journey, she’d be able to move forward.”\nJingshu does play the piano and practises every day. But she does not like it and finds it “tiring”. Wing Chun, on the other hand, has taught her to be confident and improved her fitness.\n“Now that I feel more capable, I don’t run away from my problems. I’m not scared any more,” she said.\nHOW THE BOYS FARED\nSo how did the likes of Youqi, Zecheng and Xiaoyu cope with the higher expectations for them at their camp?\nIt was not so easy for Zecheng, as one of the youngest boys there. His short attention span was apparent throughout the camp, like the time the coach was giving instructions on doing somersaults.\nBefore the coach could finish talking, the boy tried a somersault and bumped into another student. He was given a time-out, said Mr Cheng, so that his “recklessness” would not cause any injuries to his team.\nThat incident made Zecheng a little tearful. But even so, when the camp ended, he said: “Compared to the first day of the camp, I think I’m manlier now.”\nFor Xiaoyu, there were times when he was tired and missed his parents. He even once shouted under his blanket, “When can I go home?”\nBut he also wanted the Hero of the Day badge because he thought it would be an honour.\nFor four days, his team could not win The Red Flag. But on the fifth day, when he was appointed the group leader, they succeeded – and he got his wish.\nNot only that, he ended up with the Most Outstanding Student accolade. Excited as he was, he also felt “a little bit sad” that the camp had drawn to its close.\n“After coming here, I feel like a different person. I’m not so self-centred any more, and I see everything as a team effort,” he said.\nYouqi, too,\xa0imbibed some of the Beijing Boys’ Club’s ideas about manliness. He wrote in his camp diary: “We should create value in our lives with our own efforts.\n“If you rely on your mother to do everything for you, then when you grow up, you won’t even know how to wash vegetables. So we have to learn how to do our own chores from a young age.”\nIn the end, however, the seven days could not have flown by quick enough for him. “There are no iPads, computer games and mobile phones here. I don’t want to attend this camp any more,” he said.\nCram Course Asia airs on Tuesdays at 8pm. Or watch it here.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     China ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      Commentary: My generation has a fear of missing out - on a disrupted future
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Of all the acronyms I’ve heard thrown around in the first weeks of university life, “FOMO” probably tops the charts.\n“FOMO”, or “fear of missing out” encapsulates a fear of missing out on exciting or important events which you know many of your peers are going for. It shows up over and over again in conversations millennials have, usually in the phrase “FOMO is real”.\nIn May this year, it was even heard in Parliament when Dr Maliki Osman mentioned it in his response to the President’s Address.\nSo what do millennials experience FOMO on? We experience FOMO on social gatherings, overseas experiences, events, forums, networking dinners, capturing “Insta-worthy moments” and the list goes on. Even a simple “Do you want to join us for lunch?” is enough to invoke FOMO.\nTo millennials and their friends and family, this is not news. In fact, it has been so widely discussed that it doesn’t really warrant a full commentary.\nBut consider FOMO in relation to the economic challenges millennials face: FOMO with regard to career opportunities in an age of disruption or what I call “the fear of missing out on a disrupted future”.\nFEAR OF MISSING OUT ON OPPORTUNITIES\nAlmost two weeks ago,\xa0the World Economic Forum released the findings of a survey of 42,000 youths across six countries in ASEAN. The survey showed that youths in Singapore are among the most pessimistic in the region about the impact of technology on their employment prospects and earning potential, though this can be partially explained by higher education levels and age.\nSeparately, according to the National Youth Survey released last year, youths are tentative about having sufficient opportunities in Singapore to achieve their aspirations.\nWhile we should not jump to the conclusion that youths in general are pessimistic about the future, we can all agree that they face significant levels of uncertainty as they prepare to enter the workforce.\nThis should not be a surprise. Unlike their parents whose lives were affected by disruption, their lives will be defined by it.\xa0\nComing of age in an age of disruption, they are acutely aware that the jobs they are training for may no longer exist as they are in the future and that conventional signals of competence and potential (such as a degree, good grades or a strong internship track record) may no longer guarantee the stable employment it used to.\nFaced with significant levels of uncertainty, millennials seek to reduce it. But because there are no clear strategies or formulaic steps for doing so, and because they know their peers may be doing even more, every event, project, initiative, gathering starts to look like a potential opportunity to gain that certainty they so badly want.\nThe perceived cost of not seizing these opportunities and missing out on increasing one’s chances of personal and professional success skyrockets as well. The fear of missing out rears its ugly head once again.\nTHE COSTS OF FOMO\nSo why exactly is a fear of missing out a bad thing? Well, the first word says it all: fear. Yes, as with any dreaded emotion such as stress or anxiety, having a little of it is not necessarily bad – it spurs one to work hard and be clued in on potential opportunities.\nBut perhaps it’s no longer such a good thing when about 8 in 10 young professionals in Singapore suffer from a quarter life-crisis, according to survey by Linkedin released in May this year.\nOn a national level, this could translate into a second education arms race, which I discussed in an earlier commentary.\xa0\nSuch a race would be detrimental – university students would focus on securing internships, overseas experiences, leadership positions and the like for the sake of doing so, rather than focusing on value-adding and developing mastery, precisely the key ingredients needed for a resilient economy of deep capabilities.\nGOVERNMENT AGAIN?\nFaced with such a situation, it is easy to look to the Government again for solutions.\nHowever, we must remember that the Government can prepare for, but never guarantee, the future, even as it remains fully committed in preparing young people for a disruptive one.\nWhat this future will be like will always be beyond the reach of the Government. This is especially so for small states like Singapore, which have limited control over global trends and situations.\nGiven that macro-level solutions are already being extensively implemented with more in the pipeline, we should, for now, turn our attention to individuals instead.\nHow do we millennials better cope with such uncertainty? How can we prepare ourselves to seize the uncertain future? I’m not an expert, but I have three pieces of advice to offer my peers and, well, myself.\nFirst, we should recognise that the certainty that we so badly seek is right there – just in a different way than we thought. Uncertainty stems from not knowing what comes next, but if what comes next has yet to be defined, that means we have at least a chance to shape the future and determine what goes into the blanks, something our parents might not have been able to do.\nAnd unlike our parents, the world truly is our oyster. Never before have so many opportunities abroad lay so closely within our reach, a global playing field so open and accessible.\nSecond, with everyone seizing some form of opportunity to advance themselves, it may be tempting to do so too just for the sake of. But there’s really no need to.\xa0\xa0\nInstead of fretting over what the formula for success is and constantly comparing ourselves to our peers, we should stake out our own career paths and educational trajectories, bearing in mind that an unconventional combination of conventional actions can lead to productive, even better-than-foreseen outcomes.\xa0\nFor each of us, that combination will be different because each of us are different, and even a difference might be useful in differentiating ourselves from our competitors, including those from abroad.\nThird, even if our fears materialise and we have to settle for a job which we did not want, it might be more constructive to see this not as the end but just the beginning of our exciting professional journey.\xa0\nSettle down, build on it, work hard – and seek out new opportunities, which might present themselves more frequently precisely because of continued disruptive changes.\nSo yes, disruption can be scary and uncertain. However, it has also gifted us with unprecedented opportunities to find new pathways and forge fresh outcomes for ourselves, one that isn’t limited by our own knowledge and expectations at this young age.\nThus, over the next few years of university, I hope I can begin to see a shift from a narrative of fighting uncertainty to one of hope, hope that we can seize disruptive opportunities, chart our own course and remain resilient in the face of setbacks.\nNow that’s something I wouldn’t want to miss out on.\nNg Chia Wee is a first-year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and Tembusu College. \xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     employment ']}"

      How has Singapore's Chinese Language syllabus evolved? We went back to school to find out
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: The feeling of alienation first hit when the students seated around me stood up in unison, pushing their chairs backwards with a screech.\n“Lao shi zao an,”\xa0the students chanted, bidding their teacher good morning in a greeting that sounded the same to me as it did when I was at school. Awkwardly, I followed suit, feeling more like a fish out of water with every moment.\nIt was the first day of my attachment at Tanjong Katong Secondary, where I would be spending three days as a student to brush up on my abysmal Mandarin. And hearing the familiar greeting brought back several unfortunate memories of my time as a student – memories that I imagined had long been expunged.\nThere was the dreaded ting xie or dictation, a weekly test of vocabulary that\xa0I would often end up failing spectacularly, despite my best efforts to memorise and practise writing the words.\nAnd the endless pages of cheng yu,\xa0or Chinese idioms, that I had to memorise and somehow reproduce in the exams. Needless to say, the only cheng yu that appeared in my exams was feng he ri li: The same phrase that everyone used in their exams.\nAnd there was also the non-negotiable ban on speaking English in class – a ban that earned me death stares from many a teacher as I struggled to express myself in Mandarin.\nI shed real tears over the subject when I was a student, not least because of the hours I spent on rote learning with nothing to show for my efforts. And once I attained the bare minimum grade to make it to university, I gleefully chucked my Chinese textbook aside and swore to myself never to bother picking the language up again.\nBut here I was back in school, surrounded by classmates less than half my age and doing exactly what I had told myself I would never do.\nTHEN AND NOW\nIt all\xa0began with a conversation over a networking lunch with Ministry of Education staff, where I was intrigued to find out that the teaching and learning of the Chinese Language in schools has evolved over the years. Rather than the rote learning and memory work that had formed such an integral part of my personal experience, the focus of lessons nowadays has shifted: Emphasis is now placed on encouraging students to love the language, and use it in their daily life.\nGiven my past experience with the subject, I was doubtful. How could students – particularly those like me who speak only English at home – be encouraged to love the language? I had to see this in action for myself, and what better way to do so than to embed myself in a Chinese Language class as a student?\xa0\nAs a working adult – and a journalist to boot – going back to school just for three days, I was aware that there were limits to how authentic my experience would be. But I was assured by my teacher, Mrs Lee-Sem Seow Wei, that she would make it as real as possible and that I would be treated the same as any student.\nNot only would I need to fully participate in each class activity, I would also have to complete every class assignment and take every test that the students would go through over the three days of my attachment.\nIt sounded like a great opportunity. But when I realised I was to be joining a Higher Chinese class in the school, I began to wonder if I had bitten off more than I could chew.\nI questioned why the school had chosen to place me in a class of that standard, given that I could barely write my name in Mandarin, much less read the textbook. But Mrs Lee was strangely sanguine when I voiced my apprehension about my survival prospects.\n“Don’t worry,” she said with a smile. “Just come for the lesson first.”\n“And don’t worry about preparing for class,” she added, anticipating my next question. “Just come, and enjoy it. The students will help you along if you don’t understand.”\nBut despite her reassurances, my anxiety remained and reached a peak as I sat in the classroom watching my fellow pupils file in a sea of green and white uniforms. Some averted their eyes and scurried to their seats, while others looked curiously at me.\nPerhaps it was first day jitters, but my fear of being shunned by the students returned with a vengeance. However, they were soon put to rest when I was greeted with a friendly smile by my seatmate, Mandy Chan.\n“Are you all right? You look very nervous,” she said as she introduced herself and sank into her seat.\nTHE FIRST TEST\xa0\nThe\xa0week’s topic was dreams and aspirations, and Mrs Lee started the lesson\xa0by reading out some stories in a textbook about famous people in history, such as Shakespeare and Bruce Lee. As I tried to follow along with the words in the textbook, she slowed down and used English terms to explain some of the more complex terms.\nApart from my surprise at her use of English in class,\xa0I was also surprised to find out that speaking in class was also encouraged, so students could get instant help from each other when they had difficulty understanding some of the terms she was using, or practise using the language.\nShe proceeded to tell the class a little more about Shakespeare’s life, and about some of his more well-known plays. I shook my head in amazement: Shakespeare was difficult enough to understand even as a university undergraduate. And here she was explaining the plot of Romeo and Juliet to the students, in Mandarin no less.\nBut I was encouraged that I could follow more of the lesson than I thought I would, and that what I could understand was\xa0interesting and engaging. The laughter in class as Mrs Lee bantered with students in Mandarin also made it clear that the Chinese Language classroom was - for these students at least - not the nightmarish place I remembered it to be.\xa0\nApart from a few hiccups here and there, I was getting along swimmingly. But the real test was just around the corner.\nAs we approached the tail end of the lesson, Mrs Lee distributed a set of newspaper articles, each one featuring a person who has overcome obstacles and gone on to achieve something great in their fields. We were then divided into groups, assigned one article each and given five minutes to read it and answer a series of questions in our group.\nAs I flicked through the set of articles, looking at the walls of text I could not decipher, my eyes glazed over. I scanned the accompanying pictures hoping to get a clue, but apart from Olympic gold medalist Joseph Schooling, I had no idea who the rest of the people were.\nOkay, I thought to myself. I passed Chinese Language at the national exams, got my university degree and am now gainfully employed. If I put my mind to it, I can do this.\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t. My assigned article appeared to be about a group of students in China who had gained YouTube fame with their singing. But that was all I could gather based on the little that I could understand.\nWatch: The YouTube video we were shown in class\nAs I focused on slowly reading each word, I was distracted by Mrs Lee’s voice.\n“You should be done reading by now. Time to work on your questions!”\nI looked around me. Most of my classmates were already finishing the article. I was on the third line.\nI sighed, looking around for some backup, and my gaze landed on Mandy, who had not only finished the article, but was looking in my direction.\n“What does the article mean?” I muttered under my breath. Understanding dawned as she smiled encouragingly and summarised it for me.\nMAKING MANDARIN A “LIVING LANGUAGE”\nIt was\xa0clear that Mandy isn’t just good at Mandarin as a subject. She also loves the language, culture and pretty much everything to do with it.\nWhen we were given the lyrics of a song by Taiwanese singer Jay Chou and asked to identify lines which we could use to encourage a friend, she looked over my shoulder and offered to help me, telling me that she had\xa0already memorised all the lyrics to the song. And in an in-class essay about her dreams and aspirations, she wrote about how she hopes to influence others to love Chinese history, and learn more about it.\n“I love the culture because I think it’s very interesting,” she told me. “I love how in a Chinese word, just a small dot or dash could make a very big difference.”\nMandy, who comes from Malaysia and says she speaks mostly Mandarin at home, has a standard that I could only aspire to reach. But the number of students like her – who come from a Mandarin-speaking background – may be diminishing.\nAccording to the 2015 General Household Survey released by the Department of Statistics, 36.9 per cent of residents\xa0aged five and above used English as the main language at home, up from 32.3 per cent in 2010. At Tanjong Katong Secondary, Mrs Lee said about 70 per cent of students come from an English-speaking background.\n“They only use Mandarin when they are with us in school,” she explained. “So it is really important to keep them engaged and be really active in learning during Chinese lessons. That is why a lot of the pedagogies and teaching practices have changed to help students discover that it’s not a subject, but a living language.”\n“So besides the text, we use videos, additional reading and newspapers, and we open up all the possible modes of learning to students,” she added. “And the students can have the option to pursue their interests further by reading a novel or listening to Mandarin songs.”\n“For students who come from purely English-speaking families, this is a way in which they can learn to use the language in different contexts when they leave us and graduate.”\nBrina Lai, another of my classmates, said\xa0she speaks mostly English at home, and counts English Literature as one of her favourite subjects.\nShe agreed that it can be difficult at times to speak Mandarin fluently. But she makes it a point to practise by having conversations in Mandarin with friends and family members, and exposing herself to Chinese shows.\n“I enjoy it when the teacher shows videos in class,” she said. “I understand how the characters feel, and how they speak. I can learn a lot from the way they phrase their sentences.” \xa0\n“When I talk to my friends in class, it also helps,” she added. “Because my friends tell me if I make a mistake.”\nOVERCOMING THE STUMBLING BLOCKS\xa0\nTrue enough, I found that having to attend lessons regularly, read the materials and speak the language did help improve my fluency and raise\xa0my confidence.\nPerhaps it was the fact that I was now a working adult and fully understood – through painful experience – the importance of using the language in the course of my work. But I also felt that referencing current affairs and famous people in the lesson, as well as using news articles and song lyrics that we already knew of through our social media feeds helped tremendously in emphasising the importance and relevance of the language in our daily lives.\nThis, I felt, was a lesson that the 14-year-old me would have appreciated.\nAs the days went by, things started to take a turn for the better. My face lost the furrowed brow and perplexed expression that were a mainstay for much of the first lesson. As the teaching progressed, the in-class activities were designed to build on what I had already learnt, forcing me to constantly refer to my hastily scribbled notes and use the new vocabulary and cheng yu I had learnt in my assignments.\nOf course, there were moments when I stumbled. Like the time when I had to present my group’s work to the class, and couldn’t read the words my groupmate had written.\nOr the time when Mrs Lee called on me to answer one of her questions, and I unthinkingly blurted out, “Are you seriously asking me?” in English before I could stop myself, eliciting laughter from everyone in class.\nBut by my final day, I was able to produce a 150-word essay in class, on the topic of my dreams and aspirations.\nI was able to understand and appreciate the beauty and richness of the language, from the different literary devices used to the varying ways of structuring sentences in Mandarin.\nAnd I was able to make a farewell speech in Mandarin to the class, thanking them for all their help and encouragement, and promising them that I would go back and write an inspiring story about my experience.\nI wouldn't say that I become an overnight prodigy after my stint in the classroom. I also wouldn't say that the three short days\xa0worked a miracle in improving\xa0my fluency or getting me to love the language more.\nBut it has encouraged me to use the language more in my daily life. Where I once shunned everything and anything to do with Chinese culture, I now find myself actively seeking out Chinese-language songs to listen to on my daily commute, or practising my comprehension skills by reading news articles in Mandarin.\xa0\nMy spoken Mandarin might still be hesitant, and I may still lack the vocabulary to express myself in the same way I would in the English language.\xa0\nBut after thinking that I could do little more than write my name in Chinese, I emerged from the classroom with a little more confidence in myself and my abilities.\nAnd I now have four new cheng yu\xa0to add to my repertoire.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     school ']}"

      8 teachers receive President’s Award for dedication to students
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Eight educators from various institutions received the President\'s Award for Teachers\xa0from President Halimah Yacob\xa0at the Istana on Wednesday evening (Aug 29).\nThe award recognises the recipients’ dedication to the holistic development of their students.\nThe recipients were chosen from over 2,500 nominations by school leaders, teachers, former and current students, and parents.\nSeven other finalists were also recognised for their contributions. The finalists will receive their certifications at separate ceremonies.\nThey will also receive a professional development grant to attend any overseas or local conferences.\nSince 2017, the award has been extended to include educators from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and polytechnics.\nThis year, six finalists and recipients are educators from polytechnics and ITE, while nine teach in the primary school to junior college levels.\nGOING THE EXTRA MILE\nOne of the finalists is\xa0Mr Khalid Kassim, who teaches Mechanical Engineering in ITE College East.\nTo\xa0the veteran lecturer, building a student’s confidence takes more than just words of encouragement; it\xa0means showing his students how to apply their skills in real-life situations.\nThus, he rallies his students to volunteer in a special Student Home Outreach programme.\nIn this voluntary after-school activity, the students would help the family of a needy course-mate by fixing broken electrical appliances in their homes, helping with plumbing problems or even mending furniture – all these under Mr Khalid’s guidance.\nThis has helped build his students\' confidence, something that Mr Khalid has observed was lacking.\n“Most of my students didn’t do very well in school, and some have personal problems at home to deal with. So when they see that they can apply their skills outside the classroom, it builds their self-esteem,” he said.\nMAKING MUSIC INCLUSIVE\nFor Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School music teacher Ng Sheh Feng\xa0- one of the recipients of the President\'s Award - she faced a conundrum when\xa0two visually-impaired students wanted to enrol in her music programme.\nThe reason: No visually-impaired student had ever taken the O-Level music examination at that point in time.\nThe examination authorities initially turned down their request as exam components included score-reading and notation writing.\nBut Ms Ng persevered. She and her colleagues worked with the Education Ministry to experiment different ways of assessing the students. This included using music braille and dictation.\nAfter one-and-a-half years, the authorities approved the recommendations and allowed the students to take the exams.\nMs Ng said\xa0she tries to make music inclusive to quash the perception that it is exclusive, to the extent that she even pushed for lunch time concerts and a music corner.\n“We set up a music corner and we put up some instruments just for the students to be able to jam and relax,” she said.\nMs Ng said many of her\xa0students come from ""less resourced backgrounds"" and thus had less exposure to alternative pathways like music.\xa0\n""They would be thinking of careers in traditional professions like doctors or lawyers,"" she said. ""But we want to show them that there are alternative pathways in the arts too. Trying to change the mindset is slow, but it\'s happening.”\nWhile the award marks a milestone, Ms Ng says that in her 12 years as an educator, she has seen former students follow their aspirations to become composers, performers and music teachers.\nThat, she said with a bright smile, is rewarding enough.\nThe other seven\xa0winners of the award are Ms Goh Wai Leng from\xa0Geylang Methodist School (Primary), Mdm S Nirmala Devi from Guangyang Primary School,\xa0Mr Matthew Ong Yong Cheng from St Andrew\'s Junior School, Mr Edzra\xa0Iskandar from Bedok South Secondary School,\xa0Dr Lim Yi-En from National Junior College,\xa0Mr Teo Keng Ann from\xa0Singapore Polytechnic and Ms Tan Lay Khee from\xa0Temasek Polytechnic.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Strong pool of engineering talent key for Smart Nation push: Vivian Balakrishnan
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Nine recipients were awarded the inaugural Smart Nation Scholarship on Friday (Aug 17).\nThe scholarship was launched in March this year to develop and nurture a pool of next-generation leaders who will spearhead the national digital transformation.\nIt is jointly offered by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Government Technology Agency (GovTech), and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).\n“We will invest in our long-term engineering capabilities, to ensure that we have a core group of passionate innovators to lead and drive technology change, both within the civil service and across the private sector,” said Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister-in-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative.\nHe pointed out that the Government had outsourced much of its software development services to other countries a decade ago, but that has since changed.\nDr Balakrishnan added that attracting and retaining local talent was necessary as global competition for talent has never been stronger.\nThe Smart Nation Scholarship recipients were selected through a rigorous assessment process comprising aptitude tests, management interviews, and agency-specific assessments.\nThey will pursue undergraduate studies in information and communications technology (ICT)-related disciplines such as computer science, information security and mathematics at local and overseas universities.\nWOMEN IN TECH\nMs Ong Jing Yin is one of two women awarded the scholarship. Noting that the industry is conventionally male-dominated, she revealed that people are usually surprised to find out her area of study.\n“Most people would say: ‘Why would a female join this field? Isn’t it for guys?’. But I would like to correct this stereotype because after studying\xa0computer science and learning more about it, women can be equally capable and contribute to this field too.""\nShe added that as cybersecurity becomes increasingly important, the ratio between men and women in her computer science course has improved.\nMs Ong - who won the bronze award in the Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp Competition last year - become cognizant of the immeasurable threats associated with hacking during the contest when her team’s assets were hijacked and used to infect all the other participants’ without their knowledge.\n“What if the hack was not just on my team, but a greater scale like an attack on Singapore? Many people could lose money, industries could be impacted,” she said.\xa0\nANSWERING A CYBER CALLING\nLess than stellar grades in secondary school derailed Mr Alan Low’s plans to go to a Junior College.\xa0\nNoting his natural inclination towards technical subjects, his secondary school teacher advised Mr Low to consider the polytechnic route.\n""In a way you could say this was a silver lining, because given that I had a very strong passion in IT, why not take a career in IT? This is the time where cybersecurity is the \'in\'\xa0thing, with all the recent cyberattacks,"" he said.\nSo Mr Low joined the information security diploma in Republic Polytechnic (RP), where he excelled and was on the RP Director’s Roll of Honours every year.\nHe will enrol in NUS’s Information Security course and intends to pursue a career with the CSA.\nWhile data science, artificial intelligence and software development count among the hottest skills today, Dr Balakrishnan pointed out that a strong cyber ecosystem needs to be fortified with lawyers and scientists as well.\nUnlike the rest of his peers, Mr Marcus Ho\xa0chose\xa0an unconventional path under the Smart Nation scholarship.\nHe will read law at Cambridge, instead of pursuing an ICT-related degree. His choice of study comes after being inspired during his internship at Rajah & Tann.\nBut Mr Ho admits that tech is still his first love.\n""Growing up, tech was one of my passions. This has driven me to a critical intersection where I’d like to engage in a very niche area related to technology law and regulations,” he said.\nHe will join IMDA after graduation, where he hopes to use his skills to tackle legislation issues and craft public policies.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Smart Nation ', '     technology ', '     education ']}"

      Girl Guides forever: A sisterhood that's lasted over 50 years
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The sun was blazing down on Camp Christine, where schoolgirls were using sticks and twine to make racks for their bags, shoes and for drying their towels.\nIn one corner of the grounds, one group in pink were laughing, waving to the Boy Scouts at the campsite next door, and chatting about their most recent camping trip to Switzerland.\n""We kept getting scolded,"" Yvette Cheak said, gesturing at Anna Tham next to her. ""We had such a good time.""\n""We were the clowns,"" Petrina Giam chimed in. ""We brought the house down.""\nTheir laughter echoed through the grounds. Their conversation, filled with a yearning for adventure – their next camping trip is to Melbourne – sounded typical of young women. But, in fact, these lively ladies were approaching their 70s and into their 80s.\nThey have known each other for more than 50 years, and their friendship has remained the same, even now as proud grandmothers.\nThey are former Girl Guides who belong to the Trefoil Guild, the adult branch (25 and above) of the Guiding movement. And their bonds remain strong because of what they have cultivated since they first met: Teamwork.\n""It’s teamwork in action. It\'s not just talking about it,” said Mrs Cheak, 68. “This is really where you see how the girls team up together and then go for it.""\nAround them, the schoolgirls are part of an evolving organisation. And this sisterhood of old friends have also moved with the times. More importantly, they are passing on a rich legacy, not least of friendship.\nO CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN!\nMrs Cheak and Mrs Giam, 69, were 16 and 17 years old respectively when they became Ranger Guides after completing their O Levels and leaving their respective Guiding companies in the Singapore Chinese Girls’ School.\nThat was when they met Mrs Tham, their captain. ""She was a very fierce captain,"" Mrs Giam recalled, looking at her with a playful smile.\nAdded Mrs Cheak: ""We were always full of respect. There\'s no question about it. But at the same time, we were scared because she had this aura – very stern, very disciplined and very clever.”\nMrs Tham also has an air of wisdom that now comes from her 84 years of age. Sitting composedly and wearing blue eye shadow, the captain’s demeanour soon gave way, however, to her mischievous streak.\n""I liked to bring them to cemeteries,"" she said with a hearty laugh.\nIt was enough to set Mrs Giam off on an animated retelling of those moments: ""As you can imagine, we stumbled over tombstones, and we were like, ‘Sorry, sorry, sorry.’”\nAfter pitching many tents and starting many campfires together, the bonds they formed melted the ice queen. “And then they bullied me,"" Mrs Tham said with a chuckle.\nAt times, their Girl Guide adventures were much more harrowing than cemetery capers. Recalling one such experience in the late 1960s, when Singapore had many more farms, Mrs Tham said:\nSomebody went trekking around the farms, and the farmers came out with a gun.\nTheir farm explorations were otherwise less dangerous, however, and those memories are a reminder to them of how Guiding has changed, with a smaller range of outdoor opportunities nowadays.\nOn the other hand, Guiding is now offered as a co-curricular activity (CCA) in more schools – more than 55 per cent of primary and secondary schools – than it was back then.\nMrs Tham remembered that she had joined an open company at the headquarters, meant for girls from different schools. That was in 1949.\n""It was a choice we made, not that we were put into the CCA,"" she said. “And because it was a choice we made, we really put ourselves into the movement.""\nUntil today, her fellow Guides are proud of how well she has done throughout the years. ""She ran Singapore’s first Land Rangers company,"" said Mrs Cheak. ""Today, she\'s (still) our captain – she\'s known to us as captain.""\nGUIDES AT WORK AND AT HOME\nAlthough they had joined the Guiding movement for a taste of adventure, it gave them much more eventually, including in their careers. As they became mothers and grandmothers too, the values from their early Guiding days never left them either.\n""It helped a lot during my time as principal,"" said Mrs Tham, an ex-principal of Methodist Girls\' School, as she recalled the day when a pupil had sustained a deep cut on her leg after falling on a glass panel.\nIt was bleeding very badly. And everyone was so panicky. I said, ‘Lie down, calm down.’ I stopped the bleeding, called for the ambulance and then went back (to the office).\nMrs Cheak, a former regional head of compliance at a French bank who still acts as an adviser to the Association of Banks in Singapore, agreed that Guiding was good preparation for her career.\n“Because of my role (in compliance), I have to be very careful, very calm,"" she said. And nothing gave her more confidence that she could manage in her job than her Guiding experience.\nJuggling everyday life with their roles as Guides, however, was not easy.\nMrs Wah Teng Siew, 82, the chief commissioner of Girl Guides Singapore from 1984 to 1989, recalled her hectic schedule then, having had to travel multiple times for regional conferences.\nWhile she was in office, Singapore also worked to bring in the organisation’s world conference. ""I think I ran out of leave,” the former radiographer said wryly – a sentiment shared by the other three Guides, who are also good friends with her.\nThey were so involved in the Guiding community that their families would miss their presence at home. ""My son would complain, ‘Mummy, when you\'re not home, we only eat canned food,’"" Mrs Cheak said with a chuckle.\nPerhaps inevitably, however, their families have also carried on a strong tradition from them.\n""My second daughter is a President’s Guide (award winner),” beamed Mrs Tham, whose other daughter was also a Guide while her son was a Scout. ""And both granddaughters got the chief commissioner\'s award.""\nThere was no disguising the women’s sense of pride as they talked about their children and grandchildren who followed in their footsteps.\n“We left it to them. But then they’d see pictures (of us), and ask, ‘Who’s this? What’s this uniform?’ And this was when I’d tell them a little bit. Then they made their decisions,” said Mrs Cheak.\nAll three of her sons became Scouts, and two of them were awarded the President\'s Scout Award.\nWATCH: Over 50 years of friendship and Girl Guiding (5:05)\nSPENDING TIME WITH THE BOYS\nAnother topic of lively chatter among these ladies – but prompting more gales of laughter and playfully raised eyebrows – was boys, or rather, Boy Scouts.\n“We were always with the Scouts who taught us how to make gadgets,” said Mrs Cheak, who then gestured at Mrs Giam. “That\'s how she met her boyfriend.”\n“Boyfriends,” Mrs Giam interjected.\nBanter aside, the Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, in Singapore and elsewhere, have a long shared history.\nIt started in London in 1909, at the first Boy Scout Rally, which a handful of determined girls gatecrashed to request Robert Baden-Powell – the founder of the Scouts – to have “something for the girls”.\nAnd even now, these four friends collaborate with the senior Scouts.\n“When the Scouts have training, they’d invite our Guides to go, like for campfire training,” said Mrs Cheak. “Then the Guides who are free and our trainers who can manage will join them.”\nOne of the most recent get-togethers was on July 14, when the senior Scouts organised a walk in Kampung Lorong Buangkok, Singapore’s last kampung.\nIt was pouring, but that did not dampen the seniors’ spirits as they sang that famous nursery rhyme for the rain to go away.\nThese joint activities span the gamut from camping to purely social meet-ups, said 49-year-old Malcolm Tan, a “lawyer by profession, scout by choice”.\n“We arrange to have Chinese New Year gatherings, Christmas gatherings and … from time to time, we have hikes and all that,” said the Scout Guild assistant secretary.\nThe Singapore Scout Guild was established in 1996, while the Trefoil Guild here was founded in 1973 and has more than 100 members, with the oldest active member now 89 years old.\nDEVELOPING GIRLS IN DIFFERENT WAYS\nOne of the lasting legacies that Trefoil Guild members have left to newer generations of Guides has been Camp Christine, located at Jalan Bahtera and opened in 1988 after “fierce fundraising”, noted Mrs Wah.\nWith the changing times, however, there are also Guiding initiatives being rolled out that she and her friends would never have had.\nTake, for example, the Surf Smart Badge, which equips girls to be vigilant and responsible online citizens who can protect themselves and their rights on the Internet.\nThe four ladies agree that ""everything is Google"" now, but see hands-on training as crucial too.\nAnd they may no longer be as active in the Guiding movement as they once were, but this is where they continue to support its activities and help to develop girls in different ways.\nThey volunteer to be testers, for example, in the President’s Guide Award Camp. ""We’re like resources they can call on to help because we’re all retired or semi-retired,"" said Mrs Cheak.\nThe thing we can do as alumni is try to close that gap in experience – the character building, the values, the community, the communication, the leadership.\nTo some of the young Guides, however, because the camp was something for which they had been preparing “for a very long time"", they expected it to be “nerve-wracking” – until they got to know their testers.\n""I was quite scared of them at first because they were testing us, but they’re actually very nice, like the one who tested me (Mrs Tham),” said 15-year-old Alexa Yeo.\n“She gave me a lot of interesting advice and on things I hadn\'t come across in school. She taught me a completely different and new kind of lashing.""\nThe Raffles Girls\' School student may well be starting a journey like the one her testers embarked on all those years ago.\n“When I came to secondary school, I didn\'t expect to join the Guides either, but over the years, it has become a family to me,” she said.\nThe primary goals and values the Guiding movement inculcates remain the same, and ultimately, it is supposed to be fun – and a close sisterhood.\n“Guiding is supposed to be a game …” said Mrs Tham, “… And we\'re still playing the game,” continued Mrs Wah, completing the sentence.\n“The passion never dies …” added Mrs Cheak, “… And we want to give back,” went Mrs Giam, without hesitation.\nOnce a Guide, always a Guide – it is a core value these four are familiar with, and they are holding to it together.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     CNA Insider ']}"

      A sister’s sacrifice: At 22, she’s a sole breadwinner and ‘dad’ to 6 siblings
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Every weekday night, Nur Aqilah Selamat packs leftovers for her “lunch” – to be taken when the rest of Singapore is fast asleep. “At 1.30am, I’ll be eating this,” she says, scooping rice and egg curry into a plastic container. “There’s nothing (else) for us at night because most of the shops are closed.”\nAnd, with a quick adjustment to her headscarf and a swipe of coral lipstick, she heads out for the hour-long commute to work, with twins Nur Lutfiana and Nur Lutfiani, 9, running up to say a quick goodbye to their big sister at the door.\nFor about a year now, the 22-year-old has been an associate engineer at a semiconductor company, where her nine-hour shift starts at\xa010.45pm. She wanted these hours for they come with an extra allowance – meaning more money for her family.\nOn her slender young shoulders rests the responsibility of providing for her mother and six younger siblings, aged 9 to 20. “Being the eldest is one thing; but my love for my siblings is another,” she said.\xa0\n“In every little thing, I always think about them …. I don’t care much about myself at the moment. I want to do the best for them, just like how my dad did for me.”\nAfter her father retired as a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighter in\xa02014, the polytechnic graduate took it upon herself to be more than just a daughter and a sibling.\xa0\nShe became the family’s breadwinner, even to the exclusion of her youthful dreams for now.\nFROM STUDIES TO WORK\nWhen her father retired at the age of 52, he received a lump sum pension of about S$70,000. Though Ms Aqilah had just entered polytechnic then, she began to do the calculations about her family’s future.\n“If you have one child, it’s okay. But for the seven of us to go through that amount for a few years? It’s not enough,” she thought to herself.\nThe one thing she did not have to worry about: School expenses for her younger siblings, whose fees, uniforms and textbooks were fully covered under the Ministry of Education’s Financial Assistance Scheme.\n“With this help, we could cut down a lot on daily expenses,” said Ms Aqilah.\nEven so, without a steady stream of income, they had to find ways to reduce their household bills to not more than S$500 a month in total.\nShe got them all to take shorter showers (five minutes each), minimise their use of air conditioning, and not charge their electronic devices for too long. “Little things can save a lot of money,” she said. “I\xa0could see the difference.”\nIn 2017, after getting her diploma in aerospace engineering from Nanyang Polytechnic, she applied to local universities. While waiting, she looked for work to “save up a bit for university”. She found a job at a semiconductor company in next to no time, and expected to be working for six months at most.\nBut, as the universities’ rejection letters came one after another, she realised she had to put her plans on hold and focus on working full-time instead.\nAs a part-timer, she was earning\xa0about S$1,000. But if she were to convert to full-time employment, her take-home pay would be roughly double that including allowances. That made up her mind.\nThough she really wanted to get her degree, she said with her characteristic positivity: “I shouldn’t be disappointed because with my working experience, I know I can build my career to get a higher post or job.”\nFROM DAUGHTER TO DISCIPLINARIAN\nBecoming the family’s main source of income, however, was just one part of the role Ms Aqilah found herself stepping into.\nWhen her father decided to seek training overseas after leaving the SCDF, she became the ‘dad’ of the family in other ways. She has fashioned herself as a disciplinarian, scolding her siblings when it becomes necessary, such as if they are late home from school.\n“He passed on his responsibility to me, and I felt it had to be carried out for my siblings’ sake,” she said.\nSo she makes it a point to stay abreast of how they are doing academically: Besides the twins in primary school, three other siblings are in secondary school (the sixth is in National Service.)\xa0\nShe goes to parent-teacher meetings with her mother, Madam Aktar Banu Mohamed Osman, 54, who is not highly educated and relies on her eldest to understand how her other children are faring.\nNur Mursyida, 13, remembers how her big sister tutored her for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). The latter had wanted her siblings to get into her alma mater, Woodlands Ring Secondary, because she had good teachers and liked the culture there.\nThese days with her sister working the night shift, said Mursyida: “She has no time because she would be very sleepy, so she sleeps maybe all day.”\nMs Aqilah also handles all the financial matters at home – seemingly unfazed by tasks that, for many of her peers, “their parents would settle for them”.\nFor instance, she ensures her family does not exceed their monthly budget; makes bill payments on time; and goes to the bank. “At first I was like, ‘I already have school, and now I’ve to take care of a lot of things,’” she said, a pile of utilities and telephone bills spread out on the coffee table before her.\nBut at the same time, I was able to learn a lot of things by myself … so it’s kind of a good start\xa0at my age to have experienced all these things.\nAs a mother, however, it is a bitter-sweet thing for Mdm Aktar Banu to watch her eldest daughter grow into her role. “I do feel sad looking at her,” she said. “But I could depend only on her. Her other siblings were still very young.”\nShe added: “Aqilah has been taking care of her siblings since she was in kindergarten. I trained her so she can be independent.”\xa0\nWhen her dad was at work and her mum out buying groceries, the youngster would watch over her brother and sister, helping to prepare their milk and diapers.\nIt’s no wonder that mother and eldest daughter share the closest relationship and are like “best friends”. “She has always shared everything in her life with me… even now, anything that happens at her work place,” said the 54-year-old fondly.\nRESPONSIBILITIES NOT A BURDEN\nAs much as she strives to fill her father’s shoes, however, Ms Aqilah frets that she can never be a perfect father figure, mainly because “a dad’s love is different from a sister’s love”.\nLike in any family, the siblings get into fights, especially with some in their turbulent teenage years. “Some of them think our age gap isn’t so big, so I’m more like a friend. A parent is someone you’d respect more,” said Ms Aqilah.\nHer face softened as she added: “But I’d never say anything hurtful. I don’t take things to heart.”\nThe quietest time she has to herself is when she is back from work at about 8.30am and her siblings are at school. That’s when she kicks back and enjoys a movie or chats with her mother.\nSome days, fatigued from her night shift, sleep comes the moment her head hits the pillow. As a bit of sunlight spills into her darkened room around the edges of the curtains, she gets about six to eight hours of shut-eye.\nBut uninterrupted sleep is a rare thing, especially once the twins get back at 1.30pm, followed by the others. “I’d wake up once in a while, like every hour … because when my siblings come home, noise is normal,” she said. “Sometimes I have to force myself to sleep.”\nHaving any kind of a social life is difficult. She misses meeting her friends for dinner or going window-shopping in the evenings, which is when she wakes up to have dinner with her family and sometimes help her siblings with schoolwork.\nBut, rather than pining for youthful freedom as her peers might do, she feels like a parent would about their children. “I don’t really see (these responsibilities) as much of a burden. I feel it’s something you can enjoy,” she said with sincere conviction.\nWATCH: Nur Aqilah's journey (5:04)\nA LOAD OFF HER SHOULDERS\nWhile it seems like a huge responsibility for her young shoulders, one thing that has taken a significant part of the weight off is the help the family has received along the way.\nIn particular, her five siblings’ school expenses – such as fees, textbooks and uniforms – are covered by MOE’s Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS).\nThe children started receiving assistance in\xa02013 as their father was earning S$4,000 a month, which worked out to a per-capita income well under the qualifying threshold of S$625 then – a criterion introduced in\xa02012\xa0to benefit larger families like theirs. (Today, eligibility is based on either a gross household income of S$2,750 or less a month, or a per capita income of S$690 or less.)\nAnd under the School Meals Programme, in each school week, the primary-school-going twins enjoy subsidies of S$2 a meal for seven meals, while those in secondary school get S$2.50 a meal for 10 meals. The FAS also includes transport subsidies.\nAs for Ms Aqilah herself, when she entered polytechnic in\xa02014, her annual tuition fees of about $2,400 were covered by Mendaki’s Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy. She received a S$3,000 annual bursary from NTUC Income‘s OrangeAid Future Development Programme in her final two years.\nThe financial aid has not made the family complacent, however. Since young, the children have developed a habit of saving a portion of their weekly allowance. Each child has one, if not two, coin banks of various shapes and sizes.\nHolding up one shaped like a heart, which she has used since she was at secondary school, Ms Aqilah said with satisfaction: “The last (time) I counted, there was more than S$300.”\nHer siblings sometimes tap these savings to indulge in simple pleasures, like clothes or snacks. “You know the ice-cream uncle on a motorbike? They sometimes want to eat ice cream, so they’d take money out of their piggy banks,” she said, adding that they did not need any other financial assistance with the household expenses.\nA TEACHER-IN-WAITING?\nEven as her family’s needs preoccupy her, Ms Aqilah has not forgotten her dreams. She applied to university again this year, and hopes to pursue a teaching career some day.\nTeaching was her first love, and she had hoped to make it to junior college and then to the National Institute of Education (NIE). But when her grades landed her in polytechnic, even though one can apply to NIE with a diploma, she decided instead to pursue engineering as maths was her strongest subject.\nHer former teacher, Mr Soong Cheng Xiang, recalls how she would helpfully coach her classmates at Woodlands Ring Secondary in maths. “She would be very patient in clarifying their doubts, even if the questions were very simple ones,” he said.\nAnd it was Mr Soong who told her, after she qualified for polytechnic instead of JC, that he’d always seen her as “a future lecturer”. Ms Aqilah, who had all but given up on thoughts of becoming a teacher at that point, said:\xa0\nMy passion in teaching came back when he said that. It felt like he understood me, my inner self.\nHis final words to her at a recent reunion: “Serve to the best of your ability. What our school taught us was to be a worthy person, be someone who selflessly contributes to society.”\nFor now, she taps into that nurturing side of her in her workplace. Though the youngest in her team, she has been tasked to train newcomers and show them the ropes.\nAt home, she takes the time to tutor her younger siblings. But like any teacher should, she ensures that they learn independently too. “It isn’t good to spoon-feed,” she said. “They have their own examinations to go through. And during exams, you don’t have your parents beside you.”\nUltimately, her goal is to see her siblings excel in school – and in life.\n“With all the help they’ve already received from the FAS, they don’t have to worry so much about the burden on them,” she said. “And they can focus on their studies now that I’m already working.\n“(Attaining) good results wasn’t easy for me, especially when I had to juggle a lot of things … I tried my best, but I know they can do better than I.”\nThis story by CNA Insider was done in partnership with Gov.sg.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     CNA Insider ', '     education ']}"

      Commentary: Move by St Margaret’s Primary a test of parents’ ability to deal with change. Will they rise to the challenge?
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: We recently received news that my daughter’s school would be shifting come 2020. The school is preparing for a major upgrading exercise and has selected a temporary holding site some 4.5 km away.\nThe sudden news sparked off strong reactions from some angry parents. Some expressed concerns that their child will be preparing for PSLE during the two years at the holding site, and would have to not only adjust to the new school environment, but also the longer travel distance.\nOthers complained about the inconvenience as they have to juggle ferrying other siblings to and from school as well, and this would mean a disruption of their usual route.\nI was surprised to hear about the upset parents. And I can’t help but wonder, how resilient and future-ready can we expect our children to be if we are not open to change ourselves?\nDEALING WITH CHANGE GRACIOUSLY\nGranted, it’s human nature to react to change with a dash of negativity. Like a survival instinct that kicks in, metathesiophobia (or the fear of change) tells us to maintain the status quo. Stick with what is safe and predictable, and avoid the unknown.\nHowever, change can be for the better. And in getting out of one’s comfort zone, there are often lessons to learn along the way.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\nIf you think about it, there are many “inconvenient” things that we parents do for the sake of our offspring.\nWe move from one part of Singapore to another to be close to our alma maters. Some of us even rent homes close to our school of choice, to get within the 1 to 2km zone for better chances of entry. \xa0\nNow that our school of choice needs to shift, it can be frustrating, particularly if you’ve moved close to the school or have no one to help with transporting the kids.\xa0\nBut it may help to look at the bigger picture – the upgrading works will enhance the school’s ageing facilities and create a better environment for its future students, including its current batch of Primary 1 and 2 students.\nSince we have chosen this school, should we not trust that its leaders have done their best to select a site that meets the needs of its children?\nOn the other hand, could the school have done more to engage parents regarding the move?\xa0\nInstead of a brief letter that read like an announcement, could it have provided more details at the onset, and provided a space and time for concerned parents to meet the school principal and teachers – especially those who only recently enrolled their children in the school?\xa0\nWhile the school did send out a more detailed letter eventually, the truth is that no matter where the new location is, some parents will be more affected than others.\nPUTTING VALUES IN ACTION\nOne of the strengths of the school is in teaching their students timeless values such as graciousness, integrity and tenacity. The school emphasises a different value each month and sends out reminders to parents to reinforce the learning at home. \xa0\nPerhaps this change is a chance for us to exercise the values we preach to our children.\nWhat sort of values are we modelling to our young if we complain about the slightest changes in distance or travel times?\nOn the flipside, if we choose to be open-minded, they too will learn that change can be embraced.\nThrough the process, they will hone their adaptability and resilience, essential life skills that are much sought-after by employers in a digital age.\nFINDING THE SILVER LINING\nMy daughter currently takes the school bus to and from school. She will also be in the first batch of students taking the PSLE with the new scoring system in 2021.\xa0\nWhen she voiced her sadness at not being able to study at and graduate from her own school, I empathised. But I also encouraged her to find the silver lining. I told her that she’d be in upper primary by then and able to take a public bus on her own. \xa0\nIf we read between the lines, we’d realise that the children’s gripes have nothing to do with travel time or dollars and cents.\nTheirs is an emotional longing; this is after all a space that represents community, learning and friendship, and that holds fond memories of their growing-up years. It’s only natural for them to yearn to see what the transformed school will be like. \xa0\nPerhaps we can learn from our girls, and drop our fixation about time and convenience, or the lack of it.\nDon’t underestimate our children. With our support, I believe they will learn to embrace the changes and challenges ahead with optimism and tenacity. They may even surprise us by adapting to the new environment quicker than we expect. \xa0\nHopefully, this shift won’t go down in history as just a narrative of the years that have been lost, but about the values found, and the better environment created for generations of students to come.\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of\xa0Mama Wear Papa Shirt,\xa0a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Art teacher found guilty of molesting 13-year-old student in school
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: An art teacher was on Monday (Jul 16) found guilty of molesting a male student thrice on the same day in 2016.\nThe 38-year-old teacher, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, taught art to students in Secondary 2, 3 and 4.\nHe was the teacher in charge of the Higher Art O-Level subject at a school, which cannot be identified, and was the victim\'s art teacher.\nHe had claimed trial to three charges of outrage of modesty - he\xa0squeezed the boy\'s chest, touched the boy\'s buttock and his groin in the school\'s art room on Feb 17, 2016.\nThe victim, then 13 years old, was passionate about art and considered it his favourite subject before the offences were committed, the prosecution said.\xa0\nIn Secondary 2, the boy was elected the art representative of his class. He saw the teacher at least once or twice a week, both during classes and to conduct his duties as art representative.\nBOY STAYED BACK TO WORK ON ART PROJECT ON DAY OF OFFENCES\nOn the day of the offences, the victim had stayed back to work on a group art project. He had been with two other students, but they left early at about 2.30pm. There were other students in the room, but they were not seated near the victim.\nSometime after 3pm, the art teacher went to the boy and squeezed his chest. He told the boy that he looked like a character from Japanese hentai manga, or pornographic comics.\nThe boy was shocked and felt uncomfortable.\nAt around 4pm to 5pm, the boy carried the sculpture he was working on into the Higher Art room to ask his teacher for guidance.\nWhile helping the boy with the sculpture, the teacher asked him whether he had a girlfriend. \xa0He followed up by asking him a sexual question, making the boy feel uncomfortable.\nThe teacher then slid his hand up the boy\'s leg and molested him.\nThe boy later said he was ""shocked beyond words and ... stood rooted to the ground"".\n""WHY? TOO SHY?""\nThe teacher asked: ""Why? Too shy?"". He then withdrew his hand from the victim\'s shorts.\nThe boy backed away from his teacher, but the teacher pulled the boy towards him by his wrist and molested him again.\nThe boy was shocked and did not say anything, but used his hand to try and push his teacher\'s hand away.\nHe left the room carrying his sculpture, while the teacher repeated: ""Why? Too shy?""\nLater that night, he told his mother and sister what happened. His mother called the form teacher, who alerted the school\'s management.\nOn Feb 18, 2016, the principal of the school had a meeting with the art teacher and the vice-principal.\xa0\nAccording to the principal, the teacher appeared ""shocked and remorseful"" and told her ""he knew he was overboard"" in his interactions with the victim.\nBOY NOW WARIER\xa0OF TEACHERS\nAfter the molestation, the boy has been ""more wary of others, especially teachers"", the prosecution said.\xa0\nHe also feels very uncomfortable when in a room with only a teacher, as he is concerned that the incident may repeat itself, and\xa0does not like art as much as before, due to his ""bad memories of the incident of molest"".\nThe prosecution said the victim was an unusually convincing witness who gave\xa0credible and consistent testimony, while the teacher was ""a disingenuous and evasive witness whose testimony was incredible and rife with inconsistencies"".\xa0\nDistrict Judge John Ng on Monday found the teacher\xa0guilty of three charges of outrage of modesty, saying that he had ""no doubt based on the totality of the evidence before me"" that the teacher was guilty.\nHe will be back in court for sentencing next month.\nIn a statement to Channel NewsAsia on Monday evening, the Ministry of Education said the teacher was suspended from duty in February 2016. Disciplinary action will be taken against him, the ministry added.\xa0\n""Educators who fail to comply with our standards of conduct and discipline will be subjected to disciplinary action. In serious cases, they may be dismissed from the service,"" said a spokesperson.\n""Anyone convicted of a serious crime will no longer be accepted in our schools.""\nFor outraging the modesty of a person under 14 years of age, he can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of the three penalties.\nJust last week, a former physics teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student was sentenced to 16 months\' jail on three charges of committing or trying to commit indecent acts with a child or young person.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Best foot forward: How a simple dance performance changed these students with autism
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Dressed in a myriad of glittering costumes, the students moved energetically, yet gracefully to the strains of the upbeat music.\nIt was a whirl of activity at the Esplanade outdoor theatre, as students from various schools around Singapore showcased the best of their dance abilities at a special Singapore Youth Festival celebration performance held late last month. Set against the backdrop of the Singapore River and the twinkling city lights, it was a true visual spectacle.\nBut one item stood out. Not for its elaborate costumes, as the dancers were simply dressed in white tops and brightly coloured denim jeans. It was also not for the complexity of the moves or their intricate footwork, for the moves were simple, and easily executed.\nBut it was the awareness that the students on stage had overcome many obstacles to get to where they were\xa0that made members of the\xa0audience whip out their mobile phones and cameras, and cheer loudly for the performers.\nIt was a dance improvisation piece titled ‘Connectivity’, the result of a collaboration between Boon Lay Secondary School and St Andrew’s Autism School (SAAS), a special education school for those diagnosed with moderate to severe autism.\nOVERCOMING OBSTACLES\nIn a short introduction to the performance, SAAS dance teacher Cindy Zhuang summed up the experience for the audience.\n“It might be very simple movements, and maybe you can even do it yourself,” she told them. “But to these students, it’s one big notch up on their list.”\nMs Zhuang, a former freelance dance instructor who now teaches dance full-time at SAAS, knew right from the start that it was not going to be easy\xa0when her school was invited to collaborate with the dancers from Boon Lay Secondary.\nBut she went ahead, believing that her students would blossom.\n“I was as frank as I can,” she said, recalling the first discussion she had with her counterparts from Boon Lay. “I told them that I’ve tried modern contemporary dance with my students, and it doesn’t work.”\n“The one thing they cannot do is imagine,” she explained. “You cannot tell them that you want “soft arms”, because they will think, what do you mean by soft arms? My arms aren’t soft”.\nThe next barrier, she said, was communication and physical contact. The initial awkwardness of a first meeting was made even worse when she realised that the Boon Lay dancers were all girls, when the two schools had their first combined rehearsal.\n“We went through the teenage phase, and you want a girl to touch a boy ... and some of my boys are non-verbal,” she said.\n“I saw awkward moments, like when they were asked to hold hands,” she said, chuckling. “Some of my boys were also not used to unfamiliar faces, and they started dashing around.”\nBut she is thankful for the support she got from her students’ parents, as well as the flexibility of her Boon Lay Secondary counterparts. One logistical issue they initially faced, she explained, was the difficulty in scheduling combined rehearsals for both schools, which are located at the opposite ends of Singapore.\n“I was worried that my students would have meltdowns in the bus if it’s stuck in a jam during peak hour,” she said. “So I was so grateful when the Boon Lay teachers said they would come down to us instead.”\n“Each time when the girls come, I always tell them that I cannot thank them enough. If there is another word greater than thank you, I would use it.”\nMs Zhuang also conducted a briefing for the Boon Lay students. She told them more about autism, and how each student is unique. Each student was also briefed on the traits and preferences of their individual partners.\n“The girls took the feedback very well, and by the end of the next rehearsal, I could see they were much more confident.”\nBUILDING CONFIDENCE THROUGH DANCE \nThat confidence was also seen in 16-year-old Jovan Tan, one of Ms Zhuang's dance students. He appears nervous, but has a ready smile for his friends and teachers. Strapped in the bus seat next to him is a Pokemon soft toy, which he says is his “lucky charm” for the combined rehearsal at the Esplanade that the students are en route to.\nHe once refused to dance unless Ms Zhuang played a special song about dinosaurs. But today, he moves with confidence on stage, easily linking hands with his partner, Boon Lay Secondary student Gabriella Roselyn, forming a bridge with his arms and swaying to the beat of the music.\nDance, says his older sister Tan Li Xuan, has done him a world of good.\n“He wasn’t that verbal previously,” she said. “But now, he’s getting more talkative and will tell us what he did in school.”\n“When he’s at home, he also sometimes plays songs on YouTube and just dances along to them.”\nBut beyond this, psychologists also point out the benefits students with autism get from regular interaction with their mainstream peers.\n“Social interactions help children with autism increase awareness and shape socially-appropriate behaviour,” said Linda Lim, a senior psychologist with St Andrew’s Autism Centre. She explained that children with autism tend to have deficits in social communication skills, and difficulties in emotional expression.\n“Due to these challenges, children with autism may feel anxious in a social setting.”\n“Being involved in the dance performance collaboration would also help improve their self-esteem, as they feel they are involved and contributing to the community,” she added.\nBeyond this, principal consultant from the Autism Resource Centre Lam Chee Meng noted that going through the regular rehearsals can also build language and cognitive skills.\n“These rehearsals can take a long time, and this helps them build their stamina,” he said. “That’s actually a very important work skill in later life.”\nOPENING UP THEIR HEARTS AND MINDS \nBut the benefits of such collaborations do, in fact, cut both ways.\n“The mainstream students learn to realise that people who may be imperfect can still be relied on, because they have strengths that we may not have,” explained Dr Lam. “I think it will help them with accepting, understanding and building respect for each other.”\nAnd indeed, the transformation of the Boon Lay Secondary students over the course of the collaboration was evident, according to Siti Aishah Zahara, one of the\xa0teachers-in-charge for contemporary dance.\n“When we first told the girls about the collaboration, they were open to the idea, but I could tell they were scared,” she said. “And when we went over to SAAS and met the students for the first time, I could literally see my girls curling up in their seats, which is really not like them.”\n“Some of them also haven’t been exposed to students with autism before, because we don’t usually have them in mainstream schools,” she added.\n“But they have opened up their hearts and minds to accept those who may be different from them. And who knows? Maybe they’ll be inspired to help out in such schools in future.”\nShe has lofty dreams for her students.\xa0But in the meantime, progress is charted in baby steps.\nJovan’s partner, Gabriella, beamed as she recalled how Jovan – whom she initially described as “a bit shy” – was eventually coaxed out of his shell.\n“Some of the other students who are partnered up with my friends don’t really recognise them,” she said. “But every time, Jovan remembers me.”\n“That makes me happy.”\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Commentary: Can education fix inequality in Singapore? If not, what can?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Combating inequality has been declared a “national priority” in Singapore.\xa0\nThis makes sense, given the pernicious effects that persistently high inequality can have on economic growth, political stability, social cohesion, quality of life, and even national security.\nThe 2016 Brexit and Trump votes occurred in the two major developed countries with the greatest income inequality — the UK and US respectively. Studies suggest that socio-cultural as well as economic divides resulting from inequality contributed to these electoral results, which have since led to populist and protectionist policy proposals that will slow growth in the long run.\nInequality itself also directly lowers economic growth through under-realisation of scarce talent, and weaker consumption demand — both are of particular concern to Singapore given our small labour force and market size.\xa0\nAs an already mature, high-income and thus slow-growing economy, we can also no longer expect rapid growth to mask the economic effects and social challenges of rising inequality, as it did in previous decades.\nInstead we need to boldly confront the root causes of inequality, which lie in how our economic and social institutions actually work.\xa0Focusing on education policy as the main solution can actually worsen inequality.\nHOW DOES EDUCATION CONTRIBUTE TO INEQUALITY? \nIn developed economies like the UK, US and Singapore, income inequality increases with average incomes because growth increasingly derives from the application of capital and skills, rather than labour, to production, as comparative advantage and technology shift in a capital- and skills-biased direction.\nThis raises the returns to capital (profits and rents) and skills (PMET salaries) more than it does the returns to labour (wages). Education, especially university education, contributes to the widening skills premium (excess of skilled over unskilled labour income), and parents and students naturally clamour for more of it.\nThis is where education and inequality are mutually reinforcing. Higher-income families invest more in private tuition for academic subjects, extracurricular enrichment activities, and parental attention.\xa0\nThis enhances their children’s school performance and chances of getting into “good” (elite, brand-name) schools and universities, thus achieving credentials that employers value and reward with “good jobs” and high salaries.\xa0\nEmployers are known to use educational certification and school reputation as “screening devices” that differentiate between job candidates, and as proxies for behavioral characteristics and social networks they believe enhance employees’ contribution to the enterprise.\nExpansion of higher education has been accompanied by a widening “college premium” — or gap between graduate and non-graduate incomes — even as the supply of graduates increases.\nRecent studies in the US and UK suggest that this is due to losses to non-graduates, as well as gains to graduates, as employers start requiring degrees for work that did not need it 30 years ago.\nAnd as university degrees become more common, institutional reputation becomes more important, intensifying competition for places at the most selective institutions, and widening their graduates’ salary premium over graduates of less selective institutions.\nREAD:\xa0The relentless pursuit of\xa0university rankings is leading to a two-track system, a commentary.\nREAD:\xa0Is academic competition really necessary to be the best we can be? A commentary.\nCAN EDUCATION REFORMS REDUCE INEQUALITY? \nPolicy-makers in developed countries have focused on reforms in education to reduce inequality. In some countries, particularly the US, unequal resource allocation between “rich” and “poor” school districts is a major factor contributing to unequal educational, employment and income outcomes.\xa0\nThis is less of a problem in Singapore, given the Ministry of Education’s worthy efforts to equalise the allocation of resources — including the “best” teachers and administrators — between “neighbourhood” and “elite” schools.\xa0 But it is hard to improve already high-performing, well-resourced schools.\nMore importantly, as we noted in the New Nation in 1976: ”The effect of any school variable which can be manipulated by decision-makers is small relative to other determinants of student performance … Family background is a very important variable affecting educational performance and earnings of individuals ... changes within the school system itself will not necessarily bring about more equal performance of students in school or greater income equality among them when they are employed.”\nRecent, separate research by NTU associate professor of sociology Teo You Yenn, and NUS associate professor of social work Irene Ng, confirms the dominant impact of family circumstances on student performance in Singapore today.\nThe PISA test which we regularly top shows that 15-year-old students in Singapore on average perform better than those in OECD countries, but here the gap between the top and bottom scorers is wider and the dependence on parents' socio-economic status higher.\nAnother popular policy is to increase lower-income students’ access to more selective schools, including through priority admissions, as Singapore plans to do in Primary One and post-PSLE student assignments to elite schools.\nBut at best this can cater to only a small subset of low-income students, probably those already best qualified. This could widen the student performance gap between elite and neighbourhood schools, and subject more families to “exam stress”.\xa0\nSince school performance is heavily dependent on family resources, lower-income children could underperform relative to higher-income classmates in elite schools, reinforcing stigmatisation from priority admission, and lowering self-esteem which research shows is a major determinant of individual performance.\nPriority admission for lower-income children would also intensify competition among higher-income students for “fewer” elite school places, thus worsening the “education arms race”.\xa0\nIn the US, such competition has worsened inequality and increased social stratification by increasing home values (hence family wealth) in residential neighbourhoods in the top public school districts. \xa0\nTweaking Singapore’s education system will not reduce inequality because it does not change the underlying unequal socio-economic structure to whose incentives families of all income levels rationally respond.\nParents naturally seek for their children entry into secure, well-paid employment in large corporate and government bureaucracies, and cartelised high-earning professions, which still use traditional academic credentials to screen candidates and remunerate employees. \xa0\nREAD:\xa0Is there an education arms race? A commentary.\nREAD: Are we missing the point of education? A commentary.\nOUR ECONOMIC MODEL GENERATES HIGH INEQUALITY \nDespite Singapore’s rapid growth in economic output and average incomes, income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient has increased since the late 1970s, and is high relative to other developed countries, before taxes and transfers.\nThe Gini also counts only income from work, which in Singapore is under half of national income, a very low ratio by international standards.\xa0It does not consider wealth or property, which everywhere is more unequally distributed than income, especially in expensive dense cities.\nHigh inequality reflects several features of our economic development over the decades.\xa0\nMost significantly, increased output has come mainly from factor accumulation, the employment of more capital and labour, rather than from productivity growth, which has been relatively low, and is necessary for labour incomes to rise.\xa0 The long and heavy reliance by business on cheap foreign labour, facilitated by government policy, has depressed wages of the low-skilled.\nThe rapid increase in population necessary to propel this input-intensive growth model has also raised returns to owners of the scarcest factor in Singapore, land, thereby increasing the inequality that derives from residential home values and monopoly rents.\nCompared to other high-income countries, Singapore also has a relatively weak social safety net, lacking public provision for unemployment insurance and guaranteed social security (retirement income) that is almost universally provided elsewhere.\nTHE IMPACT OF MERITOCRACY\xa0\nThe Singaporean ideology that we are a “meritocracy” where economic success based on hard work and the right academic credentials justifies unequal returns, poses two problems.\xa0\nFirst, it entrenches hierarchy, and hence a systemic inequality to which social mobility can at best contribute slightly more diverse members at each level of the pyramid. Overall inequality does not decline, and at worst, those who fail to “make it” up the ladder are considered to “deserve” their inferior position on the social as well as income scale.\nBeginning with the competitive “streaming” of students by exam results at an early age, such stratification has stigmatising and demotivating effects which limit educational attainment and reduce intergenerational mobility.\xa0\xa0\nSecond, in the post-industrial society to which Singapore is inevitably transitioning, a laddered meritocracy and the social divide it subtends impede further economic progress.\nInnovation, and response to the disruption it causes, increasingly hinge on entrepreneurship rather than bureaucracy, risk-taking rather than risk-avoidance, diversity rather than similarity, collaboration rather than competition, imagination rather than instruction, contestation rather than conformity, and bottom-up rather than top-down initiative.\nIn short, meritocracy as currently construed in Singapore, and served by the educational system, is arguably the problem, not the solution, for both economic development and inequality, as it is in other highly unequal rich societies. \xa0\nA UK study shows that students from higher-income families are more likely to go to university, and to more selective universities. They also earn more than students from lower-income families who graduate from the same institutions in the same subjects, and with similar other characteristics.\xa0\nIn the US, Yale Law School professor Daniel Markovits has said\nAmerican meritocracy has become ... a mechanism for the dynastic transmission of wealth and privilege across generations. Meritocracy now constitutes a modern-day aristocracy.\nREDUCING INEQUALITY THROUGH REDISTRIBUTION NEED NOT HARM GROWTH \nWe need to look outside the education system for policies that do work to reduce income and wealth disparities. They include higher tax rates on high income earners, levies on capital gains, estates and inheritance, and a stronger social safety net — all of which Singapore has eschewed, believing these would reduce the incentive to work hard, save and invest, and thus harm economic growth.\xa0\nBut high-income Scandinavian countries, Switzerland and Germany, have reduced inequality over decades through progressive universal tax-and-transfer systems that included labour market policies, spending on healthcare and social protection while growing at respectable rates and ranking high on productivity and innovation indices — some even while maintaining budget surpluses and strong currencies. \xa0\nSome high earners may resent high tax rates, but all citizens benefit from subsidised public services, including health and education, and receive unemployment insurance and retirement pensions.\xa0\nBesides reducing economic and social divides, these policies may also encourage savings for growth-enhancing investments in business enterprises (rather than housing consumption, as in Singapore).\nRecent improvement in Singapore’s still-high Gini coefficient also results not from educational policy, but from increased social transfers to vulnerable groups — subsidies for low-wage workers, the elderly and elderly poor.\nBut these have been insufficient to narrow the cumulative wide income and wealth gaps created by past policies and market forces. Our post-tax-and-transfers Gini still ranks with the highest among developed countries (lower than the US but similar to the UK), is much higher than those of other small high-income economies (in Scandinavia), and is unlikely to be fiscally sustainable.\nHowever, we have run large budget and current account surpluses for decades, piling up huge foreign exchange reserves that have been well-invested by our sovereign wealth funds. More of these could be converted into social spending that could both increase productivity and reduce inequality.\nReforming the education system — by equalising resources, eliminating streaming, increasing curricular flexibility and minimising social segregation — can reduce inequality and social stratification, and foster the innovation and entrepreneurship required for post-industrial economic growth, only if the deep-seated institutional roots of inequality are addressed.\xa0\nThe political will to do this is what matters in the struggle for a more just and equal society that will benefit all of us.\nLinda Lim is Professor Emerita of Corporate Strategy and International Business, Stephen M Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.

      Commentary: Why investing in early childhood education cannot be the primary solution to inequality 
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Since the publication of This is What Inequality Looks Like in January, I have seen intensified interest in poverty and inequality in Singapore.\nReaders seem especially interested in my discussion of education and meritocracy. Many are disturbed that the education system is not the great equaliser we wish it to be.\xa0\nOur national leaders too have mentioned the importance of education as a social leveler and a way out of poverty. Much has been said about increased investment in early childhood education and ensuring that kids from low-income households are adequately prepared for primary school.\nI think parents would welcome greater support for them. As a sociologist, however, I have concerns.\nPursued on its own, without significant recalibration of other key principles currently embedded in the system, a focus on early childhood education risks intensifying the “education arms race.” It may bring forward and intensify competition while ultimately doing little to alter unequal opportunities and outcomes.\nTIME IS THE GIFT WORTH GIVING \nSeveral issues bear deeper consideration.\nFirst, the system currently rewards precocity of a particular sort. Over the years, our schools are requiring children to read and write at ever younger ages.\xa0\nThis advantages kids from higher-income households and disadvantages kids from lower-income households because higher-income parents have more resources to prepare their children in these areas before formal schooling begins.\nIt is tempting to think that the fix is to enable kids from lower-income households to also read and write earlier.\nWe need to step back to consider if this will really allow our schools to nurture the potential of all students. Differences in how well children do certain tasks at a certain age are not an accurate predictor of future abilities. There are natural variations in development that have no significant consequences over the long term.\nA child who walks at ten months old, for example, will not be a superior walker to one who walks at thirteen months; it would be ridiculous to force a child to walk before they are ready.\nIndeed, in places like Finland and Germany, school systems are not focused on narrow modes of reading and writing at early ages, and this is not detrimental to their kids’ long-term educational achievements.\nWhen kids cannot perform the narrow set of tasks that are recognised and rewarded, they become demoralised early on in their schooling journeys. This significantly impedes learning and growth in the longer term.\nIn the early years, time for kids to grow and develop would better reflect the realities of childhood development than trying to compel all kids to perform a narrow set of tasks at an increasingly early age.\xa0\nThis unrealistic pressure to accelerate academic performance also affects teachers. Effective teaching, like genuine learning, takes time.\nTime pressure pushes teachers to rely on parents — untrained and clueless about developments in pedagogy — to do their children’s homework with or for them. This promotes class inequalities and represents a waste of our societal investments in teachers.\nFor example, to help my Primary 4 child with Mathematics, my husband consulted a YouTube instructional video because his problem-solving method, learnt in school decades ago, was no longer acceptable at school.\nWhile parents often complain about shifting techniques, as an educator, I believe that new and better techniques should be welcomed. But parents cannot deliver them. If resources have been spent to train teachers in new techniques, let teachers teach. And to do so, they will need time.\nEXAMINATIONS: THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE DOG \nI once heard a vivid reference to examinations as the tail that wags the dog. When high-stakes examinations are administered at specific and early times in a child’s educational journey, school activities are unavoidably oriented toward preparing students for them.\nEducators know that examinations have limited pedagogical value, especially when students do not see exam scripts to learn from what they did right or wrong. A key purpose of examinations is to differentiate and hierarchise students—to place them on a scale and reward them differently. Examinations are an indispensable tool mainly if sorting is the key goal.\nStreaming has been called different things at different times, but the basic principle is that kids are identified and sorted into separate classes, to learn different things, with different trajectories within the system. Some form of this begins around Primary 3, and the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) at Primary 6 is a major fork in the road.\nOffering multiple pathways is hard to refute in the abstract. But if kids have multiple strengths that take time to develop, then sorting them prematurely entails major risks of misidentification, misalignment, and ultimately the loss of human potential.\nMoreover, as long as kids are rarely allowed to backtrack or change lanes, and if pathways lead to different destinations — different jobs, income, security, ability to meet needs — parents will continue to be anxious about their kids taking the pathways more likely to lead to economic and social security.\nIf multiple strengths are not equally rewarded, parents will not be able to make genuine choices to suit the talents of their kids.\nThe caricature of Singaporean parents as kiasu misses this important point—“losing” has major consequences. Most parents are trying to act responsibly. As long as high-stakes exams and streaming remain firmly embedded, parents have no choice but to try to get their kids to keep up.\nThis comes at great cost in their time, in the quality of parent-child relationships, and in a family’s financial resources. As long as there remain negative consequences to being in lower tracks, parents will try to keep their children out of them.\nIn such circumstances, investing in early childhood education risks merely intensifying competition.\nEDUCATION AND INEQUALITY: YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT\xa0ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER \nIf we take seriously what parents, teachers, and students are struggling with, we cannot detach education from high levels of income and wealth inequality. Our shared anxieties are fed by rising costs and precarity in housing, healthcare and retirement security.\nWe behave as we do because we are realistic about the society we live in.\nSocieties with less inequality have both downward and upward mobility; it must happen in both directions. Downward mobility is unfathomable for parents in societies where slight downward movement has major implications on the meeting of needs and well-being.\nIf we want parents to ease up on examination pressures, to spend less on tuition, to allow kids to develop myriad talents, to genuinely allow “merit” to land their kids where they land, attention must be paid to the meeting of needs at the end of the education road.\nInequality is not limited to one point in\xa0life's course, and cannot thus be resolved by exclusive focus on early childhood.\nInvestment in kids from low-income families must be accompanied by deep adjustments to move education away from getting kids to be able to perform narrow skills early, from persistent practices of sorting and hierarchising children, and from unequal rewards for people with varied strengths.\nLet’s not, as President Halimah Yacob puts it in her Presidential Address, “tweak things at the margins,” but instead aim for “bold changes”.

      Commentary: A liberal arts education in Singapore and the usefulness of ‘useless’ knowledge
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: If you were considering a tertiary education ten years ago, your top choices were likely to have been law, accounting or engineering.\nTo many in Singapore and Asia, the purpose of tertiary education is to equip students with technical or other specialised skills that qualify them for a specific job and stable employment.\nUniversities do more than this, of course, but they typically require early specialisation.\nThe idea of a liberal arts education challenges this view of the importance of vocational preparation.\nBroad-based and multidisciplinary in approach, it is less closely linked with a defined job path after graduation.\nLiberal arts colleges, which are based on this approach, are common in the United States.\nIn 2013, the Ministry of Education made a bold move to offer a new pathway of education for young people in Singapore by establishing a college here that would allow them to pursue a liberal arts education locally.\nBut many have yet to appreciate what a liberal arts education is and why Singaporeans should care about it.\nFLEXIBILITY IN THINKING\nThe key differentiator is that liberal arts students are exposed to a range of disciplines. This encourages flexibility in thinking and develops an ability to approach a problem from multiple angles. Students typically spend their first few years in classes in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences before selecting a major.\nAt Yale-NUS, this takes the form of immersion in a common curriculum, where the experience ranges from reading classics of literature and philosophy from India, China, Africa and Europe to studying scientific inquiry and quantitative reasoning.\nPart of my title, “the usefulness of useless knowledge”, is borrowed from a book first published in 1939 by Abraham Flexner, the founder and first director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Flexner had studied classics as an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University and then psychology at Harvard.\nHe argued that basic research – inquiry motivated by curiosity and imagination rather than by practical goals – can eventually lead to technological breakthroughs based on new discoveries. He saw that technologies based on old knowledge, like railroads, would eventually fail to match those based on new ideas, like digital computing.\nFlexner’s argument is also a good reminder that a liberal arts education does not ignore science but includes it. The physical and life sciences, along with mathematics and computer science, are part of the liberal arts curriculum.\nIn a liberal arts college, these subjects are studied as distinct and interesting ways of thinking, rather than mainly as a set of tools to be applied in solving engineering, medical or other technical problems.\nFor instance, a liberal arts student who majored in computer science, and has an understanding of regional political structures through courses in politics and economics, can potentially offer more value to an IT firm wishing to expand its regional business operations.\nA liberal arts education trains a person to develop the ability to learn new things and apply them quickly.\nBREADTH IN THINKING\nThis emphasis on breadth, along with the ability to look at a problem from a variety of angles that goes with it, is a quintessential aspect of the liberal arts curriculum. It enables liberal arts colleges to produce graduates who succeed because they have acquired the range of ideas and abilities needed to move from narrowly defined jobs to leadership positions.\nAdaptability is especially critical in today’s rapidly changing environment.\nAnother feature of a liberal arts education is its emphasis on discussion-based learning in small groups and early exposure to hands-on research. Students are encouraged to reflect on what they are learning and to articulate what they have learned. They must also practise how to reach reasoned consensus with their peers and instructors.\nThese are valuable qualities that liberal arts colleges, because of their small size and high teacher-student ratios, are better able than large universities to provide.\nSOUGHT-AFTER\nThe marketplace knows the value of these qualities. Liberal arts graduates are highly sought after. Employment statistics for Yale-NUS College, like those for liberal arts colleges worldwide, show that their graduates compete well, even in technological fields.\nAccording to the recently released Singapore Graduate Employment Survey, for example, Yale-NUS class of 2017 graduates achieved an employment rate of over 93 per cent within the first six months of graduation, as compared to overall employment rate of 88.9 per cent, as measured by a graduate employment survey which polled over 11,000\xa0fresh graduates from NUS, NTU and SMU.\nThe top six industries that graduates from the liberal arts college joined were business and management consultancy; financial and insurance; information and communication; education; public administration and defence; and arts, entertainment and recreation.\xa0\nOne Yale-NUS graduate, a Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences major, joined Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is now a country officer at the Ministry’s Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific directorate.\nLooking back on his time at Yale-NUS, he commented that subjects he had studied outside his major, such as history and philosophy, had strengthened his understanding of the geopolitical dimensions of Singapore’s foreign policy.\xa0\nEqually valuable were the analytical, writing and presentation skills that he acquired in the college’s small seminars.\nTHE CASE FOR\xa0A LIBERAL ARTS ENVIRONMENT\nThere are two reasons why these qualities are best cultivated in a liberal arts environment. First, liberal arts students learn to think and communicate in different modes because the education they receive is broad and diverse.\nSecond, the faculty-to-student ratio in a liberal arts college is designed to allow for close interaction. It is typically far lower than the ratio in universities. While universities offer some seminars, small seminars are the primary mode of instruction in liberal arts colleges generally and at Yale-NUS.\nMany liberal arts graduates go on to pursue postgraduate study, and several among the first batch of Yale-NUS graduates have won acceptance at leading universities. One was selected to join the prestigious Schwarzman Scholars programme at Tsinghua University and another to attend Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.\nThese successes are not limited to Yale-NUS. Evidence shows that liberal arts graduates are disproportionately successful in leadership positions.\nContributing to these successes is the advantage of having been able to spend their college years finding their way around many different subjects, cultivating a variety of skills and getting accustomed to different styles of thinking.\nIn contrast to a course of study that focuses on training students who are expected to specialise from the start in particular subjects, a liberal arts education encourages students to range widely beyond their eventual major, to enjoy learning for learning’s sake, and to sharpen their mental agility.\nA SENSE OF CURIOSITY, A SENSE OF CHARACTER\nBeyond the employability and successes of a liberal arts graduate lies a deeper point: If we say that knowledge must be for some good, we must ask what that good is, and why it is important.\nAre the things we usually think of as good – \xa0promises of better career prospects, wealth and the pleasures that money can buy – really the ultimate goods? Being able to think creatively is itself a pleasure. So is being able to read widely and to understand what one reads.\nWhile applications of knowledge to solving technical problems are important, so are the ideas on which they are ultimately based.\nThe goal of a liberal arts education is in part to cultivate a sense of curiosity and to allow new ideas to develop. We cannot know in advance which new ideas will be most exciting and illuminating, or prove useful in the long run.\nWhat then, is the ultimate point of chasing knowledge? Thinkers in Greece, China and elsewhere puzzled over these questions thousands of years ago. They concluded that the ultimate good is to realise one’s full human potential. This, to thinkers like Aristotle and Confucius, meant intellectual contemplation and moral virtue.\nTo contemplate is to think in a detached way about something in order to understand its assumptions and implications. And to understand moral virtue is to cultivate what we call “character”.\nWilliam Cory, Master of Eton College from 1845 to 1872, aptly captures how a liberal arts college cultivates character.\n“You go to a great school,” Cory said, “not so much for knowledge as for arts and habits; for the habit of attention, for the art of expression, for the art of assuming at a moment's notice a new intellectual position, for the art of entering quickly into another person's thoughts, for the habit of submitting to censure and refutation, for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated terms, for the habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the art of working out what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination, for mental courage, and for mental soberness.”\nSUCCESS STORIES\nYale-NUS graduated its first class only last year, so it cannot yet point to alumni who succeeded later in life. However, there are many successful liberal arts graduates. Here is an example that might resonate with those who love music, as many do.\nLuke Wood graduated in 1991 from Wesleyan University, an American liberal arts college, where he had majored in American Studies. Wood was able to turn his passion for music into an internship at Geffen Records, after which he signed artists for DreamWorks and Interscope.\nIn 2011 he became chief operating officer and president of Beats Electronics, the parent company of Beats by Dr Dre and Beats Audio, handling a wide range of strategic and operational activities in consumer electronics.\nIn 2014, Beats was acquired by Apple.\nWood’s success is another good reminder that “useless knowledge” can not only turn out to be useful after all, but also that usefulness is in the eye of the beholder.\nTerry Nardin is professor of political science and director of Common Curriculum at Yale-NUS College in Singapore.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     employment ']}"

There are many websites which curate internship opportunities and services that also coach job seekers to tackle psychometric tests and mock-case interviews.\nSince most IHLs already undertake this role to help students equip themselves with skills to secure a good job, these admission and interview coaching services are thus reminiscent of the academic tuition industry (or the “shadow education industry”).\nIn 2013, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong remarked in his National Day Rally speech as he discussed various suggestions raised to improve the Primary 1 admissions process that “anyway, whatever solution you make, parents will find ingenious ways to maximise their chances”.\nIf I may add to PM Lee’s words, students themselves too will do what it takes to maximise their chances when they seek entry into IHLs and the job market.\nAfter all, when standards are raised and everyone ups their game, one must work even harder to demonstrate how he or she can stand out from the crowd.\nWith degrees becoming more common, it is no longer the defining factor that decides if one gets hired – strong aptitude, skills and holistic experiences are the newly coveted signals.\nAnd so, a new race to obtain them could begin, one where the item in question is not a degree, but internships, leadership opportunities, community projects, communication skills, portfolio enhancements and other credentials.\nTo be fair, participation in non-academic activities usually stems from a genuine desire to pursue one’s interest. Nevertheless, students are also aware of the practical value these have in helping them stand out.\nAfter all, as Mr Ong himself acknowledges in his 2018 COS speech, “what students and parents need to understand is that passion and aptitude need to be demonstrated and is not declared, and that has to come through in the admission application”.\nDEALING WITH THE NEW EDUCATION ARMS RACE\nIn finding the best candidate for the job where “best” can no longer be defined in conventional metrics, it can be tempting for organisations to search for candidates that “check as many boxes as possible” and have a full set of qualifications, experiences and skills.\nThis in turn further incentivises the chase by students.\nFaced with a potential new arms race in education, both recruiters and future job seekers must approach this carefully to ensure it doesn’t spiral into a vicious cycle.\nWe cannot eliminate competition, but all stakeholders can play their part in enhancing how competition is managed and ensuring optimal outcomes.\nFirst, hiring managers and admission officers can finetune their selection processes by demanding and prioritising depth of experience and degree of value-adding.\nFocus not on how many internships or leadership positions one has taken up, but rather how much one has been able to value-add to the position or organisation during his or her stint there, backed up by verified testimonials.\nSecond, they could shift the focus of the selection process towards the latter stages where resumes matter less.\nOrganisations can demand interested candidates sit for on-site assessments if they wish to apply. These could take the form of scenario-based and business case tests. This has the benefit of allowing greater reliability and organisational-relevance of assessments but avoids the logistical challenges that would come with interviewing even more candidates.\nIn practical terms, this means eliminating less candidates during the resume-assessment stage and allowing more to proceed to the on-site assessment stage. This means assessing if candidates are as good as their resumes say they are.\nBy demanding that candidates go through a rigorous assessment, it helps organisations filter out candidates who submit their resumes to “try their luck” but are not serious about the job.\nMore importantly, it mitigates the unintended filtering out of candidates who may not have a strong resume but possess the necessary aptitude to excel, which is what organisations are ultimately looking for.\nThird, young people themselves, hungry for success, must also approach the process more judiciously. They should focus not on lengthening their resume but showing the depth and mastery of skills and experiences.\nDon’t take on activities so that your CV looks good but participate in internships and leadership positions with the view of value-adding.\nStudents must also be realistic about the competition they face and actively prepare for the scenario of not getting their dream jobs. Just as the Labour Movement encourages workers to learn a second skill, prospective job seekers should take modules during their schooling days to achieve some degree of familiarity in a secondary interest.\nFaced with a potential new arms race in education, recruiters and job seekers can take steps to make the job recruitment process more meaningful and productive.\nEven as competition gets stiffer, with the right approach and mindset, a virtuous cycle of skills-job matching could very well be what awaits us at the finishing line.\nNg Chia Wee will begin his undergraduate education at the National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences this August.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     employment ']}"

      Commentary: Lessons on how not to tackle inequality, a tale of China and India
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Wealth inequality continues to grow, according to the 2018 edition of the World Inequality Report.\nIn the past three decades, 28 per cent of the aggregate increase in real incomes in North America and Western Europe was captured by the top 1 per cent of earners. The bottom half saw less than 10 per cent of this increase.\nInequality has also settled at alarmingly high levels in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.\nThis crisis was never inevitable. Middle-class wealth reached its peak in the mid-1980s. But it’s been ravaged by stagnant incomes, unstable property and investment markets. Growing consumer debt is also a problem.\nFailed policy and weak political will are two culprits. More creativity and effort seems to have gone into election year soundbites and platitudes than into substantive solutions.\nMany developing nations have targeted poverty alleviation and improved living standards as ultimate policy goals. While China has achieved poverty alleviation on an historic scale, policy obstacles remain. These include bureaucratic inefficiency and failed policy implementation.\xa0\nIndia has likewise made progress in alleviating poverty though it lags significantly behind China.\nInequality hampers growth by leaving human potential unrealised. The middle class provides a crucial market for consumer goods and services, which in turn creates jobs. The cycle is interrupted when profits are excessively retained rather than reinvested into further capacity – such as strong health and education sectors.\nMarket purists argue simplistically that there should be no constraint to profiteering within legal bounds.\nGovernment policy is needed to balance private and social interests.\nREAD:\xa0A commentary on tackling inequality by moving from emotional to action.\nCHINA AND INDIA\nThe ability of China, India, and other developing countries to end poverty lies with job creation. Industrial jobs replace agricultural jobs, lifting incomes as labour is shifted to higher value-added work.\nHowever, this continuing shift also exacerbates the growing inequality gap. The World Inequality Report points out that in China, this gap is geographic. Coastal urban regions are leaving the more rural interior far behind.\nBetween 1978 and 2015, the report shows, urban share of national income increased from 30 per cent to 80 per cent. Today urban households earn 3.5 times more than do rural households.\nTwo Chinas are emerging. One is urban, educated, and mobile. The other is isolated, immobile and tethered to outdated livelihoods and social assistance.\nIndia, meanwhile, is expected to be the world’s fastest growing large economy in 2018. It’s now home to more than 200,000 millionaires and over 100 billionaires. India’s population of 78 million who earn US$10 per day are considered “middle class” by the National Council of Applied Economic Research.\nBy World Bank estimates, 270 million Indians – that’s nearly 20 per cent of its population – were considered poor as of 2012.\nIndia also saw the fastest rise in inequality of all major world regions between 1980 and 2016, and 55 per cent of the country’s income share is in the hands of the wealthiest 10 per cent.\nThere is little hope that these discouraging trends can be reversed. Across the developing world, blunt policies are not only proving ineffective at reducing poverty. They are also arguably widening the wealth gap.\nPOLICY FAILINGS\nInequality is decried at campaign rallies and in the global commentariat. But little is being done at any policy level.\nThomas Piketty’s proposed global tax on individual net worth – targeting the super rich – lacks an obvious coordinating body. Worse, it would trigger crippling panic from the right about imaginary one-world-order-style socialism.\nIn the absence of such a broad initiative, most national level policies are either ham-fisted or intentionally ineffective. Even genuinely concerned governments plod forward as though bewildered by the challenge.\nThey tinker at the margins with transfer payments and social programmes while failing to address structural causes such as gaps in educational achievement and public health.\nThere are numerous examples of policy ineptitude. Governments in the US and India are in thrall to oft-discredited claims about “trickle-down economics” and have passed sweeping tax reforms that substantially favour corporations.\nIn China, expectations of urban led economic growth are driving programmes to shift 100 million rural residents into urban environments. That includes third-tier cities which lack the advanced education and health services typically supporting growth. This comes on top of neighbourhood redevelopment programmes that are displacing low-income residents, particularly in Beijing.\nIn India, employment in agriculture is declining without a commensurate rise in urban manufacturing employment. Narendra Modi’s government has promised about 10 million new jobs per year; only about 230,000 materialised in 2016.\nThe twin reforms of demonetisation and a goods and services tax may have also stunted job growth by crippling the construction and informal sectors. It’s in these sectors that most migrant workers find jobs.\nFailure to improve basic services is one of the most glaring gaps in inequality policy. China’s economic rise has generated tax revenues to invest in schooling. But education gaps persist in the country’s rural areas. Private sector and philanthropic intervention, while helpful, is no substitute for equal access.\nIn India, the 2017 Economic Survey revealed that the government spends only about 1 per cent of GDP on health services, compared the world average of 6 per cent.\nADDRESSING THE GAPS\nInequality is not ignored for a lack of evidence; the challenge is made clear in research studies like the World Inequality Report and in daily press headlines.\nChina’s inequality garnered global attention in a recent story about the “ice boy”, an eight-year-old student in rural Yunnan province who walked three miles through freezing cold weather to reach school.\nPerhaps the personalisation of inequality would more effectively influence public sentiment and policy pressure.\nAt the moment political will is inexcusably weak. Mere statistics are failing to prod governments beyond election-year soundbites and platitudes. Both the economics and the ethics of inequality demand transformational thinking.\nBut the voice of the poor continues to be drowned out by a global minority enjoying elite status – and, based on voting patterns, even by the many who aspire to such status.\nAsit K Biswas is distinguished visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

      Commentary: Golf classes? What it really takes to raise a future CEO
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: In the name of giving our children the best start in life and helping them “check boxes”, many parents have been signing their young ones up for a wide array of classes.\nPiano grade 8 exams by the age of nine for instance, or the recent trend in China of parents sending children to “CEO school” to learn manners and social skills and golf classes said to be part of critical emotional quotient training - all at the tender age of three.\nIs it really beneficial to pack our kids’ schedules with classes, or to cram their young minds with as many lessons and experiences as possible?\nOr is there such a thing as\xa0too\xa0much?\nBefore jumping onto the latest enrichment fads, perhaps parents should stop and think:\xa0Does my child really need to take another\xa0course, and will it add real value to their lives?\nOr are these (often expensive) lessons really a means for us parents to live vicariously through our children, giving them opportunities that we ourselves never had in our growing years but perhaps wished we had?\nHOW EQ IS PICKED UP\nAt the age of three, my own kids were still deep in the throes of the terrible twos. Tantrums and battles were practically a daily occurrence.\nWe took pains to help them understand that we all experience big emotions, and that we can use our words or work together to solve the problem.\nStill, it required much time and patience before the storm clouds eventually parted. But when they did, out emerged slightly more socialised and eager-to-please pre-schoolers.\nEQ can be understood as the ability to recognise our feelings, and express them in ways that are socially acceptable and emotionally healthy. Seen to be as important as IQ in predicting future success, it includes the ability to regulate one’s own negative emotions and show empathy towards others.\xa0\nAcceptance has a big role to play – acceptance of ourselves, and our emotions and thoughts, while appreciating that others often\xa0have different needs and feelings.\nEven for the most patient and emotionally available parents among us, there are days that go haywire. What we do as parents when things don’t go our way is a key factor in predicting child behaviour.\nChildren look up to parents not just as authority\xa0figures, but also models to teach them how to respond to the world around them.\xa0\nWhen things go wrong, do we stay calm?\xa0Do we address issues constructively or back away from dealing with conflict altogether?\nDo we model timeless values such as kindness, honesty and self-control? If your child\xa0sees you saying one thing, and doing another, they are going to do what you did, and not what you said.\nBack to the frenzy about packing our kids’ lives with classes. Since much of the responsibility of raising well-socialised and dependable children falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, why bother entrusting this crucial task to a vendor?\xa0\nAre we paying for a quick fix, instead of getting our\xa0hands dirty in actively guiding and teaching our young?\nWouldn’t it be ironic if by signing them up for such classes, you actually send them the message that climbing to the top is of paramount importance, regardless of the cost (and I’m not just referring to the monetary aspect here).\nDO CHILDREN REALLY NEED TO BE 'CHARMING CEOS'?\nImpeccable manners and charm seem like excellent qualities to inculcate in a child, so it can be tempting to dish out some money to achieve this outcome, but is there a flipside to emphasising these qualities at an early age?\nIn his\xa0book The Hurried Child, David Elkind expounds on the importance of spontaneous play for children in fostering interpersonal and social\xa0smarts.\xa0He advises parents to allow\xa0their children\xa0to be\xa0children, and not leapfrog the childhood phase altogether.\nBy around three years of age, children begin to take turns during play, mimic adult behaviour, and may even show concern for a friend in distress. Most of the time, they will pick these social skills up naturally through everyday interactions with other children at the playground and at school.\nPlay dates are an excellent and low-cost way to develop these skills; kids learn to converse with their friends, share, negotiate, manage conflict, and make decisions both independently and as a group.\xa0\nSo is reading a book and using it to facilitate discussions about the storybook characters, exploring what each feels, and asking the child what they would have done in the protagonist’s shoes. Such discussions help to open a child’s mind to the perspectives of others, and connect the dots between feelings and actions.\nA child who is taught how to act like an adult may not truly feel like an adult. Just because they\xa0can imitate behaviour doesn’t mean they\xa0have internalised how to process stress or strife.\nEmotional maturation is a gradual process that begins in childhood and continues through early adulthood, and requires frequent practice in\xa0handling difficult emotions and situations.\nOverzealous parents seeking to\xa0accelerate\xa0this process through external coaching may have to contend with something more sinister in the long run.\nPlacing pressures on a pre-schooler to perform may lead children to learn to suppress their own child-like desires, instead of understanding how to express them in constructive ways.\nFar from feeling accepted for\xa0who they are, the child may instead feel anxious about falling short, especially when they are placed in novel situations where they have not learned the “script”.\nTheir minds may get distracted from truly learning and enjoying a subject, as they are focused on their own performance and reaching an invisible bar.\nSuch unnecessary pressures may hinder a child’s sense of identity, sense of agency, and willingness to try new things.\nEVERYDAY PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT\xa0STILL THE KEY\nAchievement in itself is not a bad thing. But we need to constantly examine our choices and ask ourselves: Is this truly for my child, or is it to fulfil my own dreams?\nThe things that children really need don’t come at a hefty price tag; they include having a strong parent-child bond based on unconditional love and acceptance, and open and active communication as well as adequate nutrition,\xa0sleep and\xa0unstructured playtime.\nIf these foundational needs are not met, everything else will be built on sand. The external graces and adult-ish mannerisms\xa0become temporary frills at best.\nIf you truly want to raise a future CEO or high flyer, recognise that the everyday things you do in the home matter.\nGiving your child small responsibilities, connecting with them, affirming them when they do well, confronting conflict with courage, and modeling the right values – all of these contribute to building a strong identity, self-esteem and resilience.\nMore than what external classes can ever achieve, these are the true essentials that will support your child in achieving their fullest potential.\nJune Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Parenting ', '     education ', '     children ', '     China ']}"

      Commentary: Why take up a postgrad education when I can Google almost anything?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Lifelong learning is encouraged in Singapore through incentives and myriad opportunities through programmes such as the SkillsFuture Initiative.\nInstitutions of higher learning also present an attractive platter of degree programmes and micro-credentials for continual learning.\nBut in a world where one can Google for almost anything, some may argue knowledge is almost ubiquitous. At the heart of it is this question - \xa0do we still need to accumulate knowledge if we can call up information so easily?\nFor many of us who have completed our formal education, do such trends suggest that the value of pursuing additional formal education qualifications to move up the career ladder has vastly diminished?\nLocal media reports submit that such a debate about degrees versus skills has been underway. If so, it is useful to focus this discussion on what acquiring skills mean in today’s world.\nIn delivering the Budget 2018 statement earlier this month, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat highlighted that the Singapore Government will continue to invest in education and skills upgrading to give every Singaporean the best chance to realise his or her potential and build deep skills for workers of all ages.\nMinister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung said during the Education Ministry’s Committee of Supply in Parliament that the Singapore education system should “anticipate the shape of things to come and build a system that can respond to and embrace the changes”.\xa0\nHe announced that autonomous universities will roll out micro-credentials, a repackacing of certain courses to create pathways that lead to smaller qualifications.\nThis ostensibly gives Singaporeans the flexibility and access to postgraduate education that will help them develop skills and knowledge relevant to their jobs.\nREAD:\xa0A commentary on Asia's shifting higher education landscape.\nIS FORMAL LEARNING NECESSARY?\nHaving been at the forefront of graduate studies and professional learning, I empathise with postgraduate students who have their reservations about pursuing paper qualifications set against competing demands on money, time and commitment.\nOne cannot help but ask if pursuing a postgraduate degree, whether through micro-credentials or the entire course of certification, can really make the sum difference in one’s career after one has had years of industry experience and demonstrated a proven track record.\nThe question of why anyone needs formal learning\xa0remains even as there are options to pursue postgraduate education through smaller modules.\xa0\nIndeed, some say as information relevant to workplace skills and knowledge have become more accessible, formal learning seems increasingly irrelevant.\nSuch questions are why as academic administrators of professional learning at the National Institute of Education (NIE), we have put much thought into how professionals in the teaching fraternity and other leading industries can have flexibility in the way they advance their learning.\nInvesting in a formal postgraduate education that teaches you to write reviews and carry out months of research seems out of step in an evolving digital era, where technical knowledge and mastery of a subject must be assimilated, processed and applied quickly.\nAfter all, rapid technological advancements calls for a new generation of professionals who are highly adaptable and agile.\nREAD:\xa0A commentary on agility, the secret skillset companies are looking to hire.\nSIGNALLING VALUE\nAll things considered, in my opinion, the utility of a postgraduate education remains high. It comes back to the question of relevance in the job market amid stiff competition.\nEmployers look for the best experiences and potential in the candidates they come across. The fact remains that a postgraduate education still has signalling value.\nOn top of achieving best grades in an undergraduate programme and developing formal expertise, a formal postgraduate education certification can offer a powerful indication that a candidate is highly responsive to new challenges.\nEmployers in the field also know tacitly that certain types of knowledge and skills require development over a sustained period of time – honing these with experts in a subject area will contribute to the professional development of the individual.\nWe see this too in subtle shifts in how postgraduate\xa0programmes aim to equip graduates with skills and work-relevant expertise that will carry them further in their careers.\xa0\nIn the past decade, postgraduate programmes have evolved tremendously to help students develop deep proficiencies in a wider scope of skillsets so that they emerge with deeper insights into a broader range of issues and a stronger ability to think creatively to solve real-world problems.\xa0\nPostgraduate programmes also have great networking value. Postgraduate students engage with other like-minded professionals through the course of the programme and make valuable connections in various industries, before they embark on the next phase of their career.\xa0\nThey may also in time come to develop a community of best practices. They \xa0are open \xa0to new ideas which drive a renewed sense of passion.\nWHAT PROGRAMME SHOULD I CHOOSE THEN?\nIt seems that the value of a postgraduate programme therefore can be subjective and unique to each person.\nI have always asked my students:\xa0“What part of the programme you have completed benefitted you the most?”\nTheir replies vary but most generally appreciate the opportunities to advance critical thinking and new, meaningful ways to grow their capabilities.\nA participant of the NIE Doctor in Education (EdD) programme, a research officer on adult education\xa0shared that the “learning experience in a postgraduate programme … developed my critical thinking and analytical capability which (are) fundamental competencies for the 21st century”.\xa0\xa0\nHe chose the EdD programme, a practitioner-researcher based higher degree, because it was directly relevant to his job.\nIn another example, new practices may be grasped and developed. A head of department for Physical Education (PE) in a secondary school said “The Master of Science (Exercise and Sport Studies) … introduced me to disability sports and inspired me to introduce it in my schools”. He subsequently incorporated disability sports into the PE scheme of work for Primary 4, 5 and 6 pupils.\nADD VALUE TO THE JOB IN NEW WAYS\nMany higher learning institutes recognise that they have a high bar to meet because postgraduate learners are already established in their field with ample opportunities to develop job-relevant skills.\nSo a good programme needs a strong curriculum that incorporates ways to mature one’s capabilities to new levels of advancements in their areas of specialisation. \xa0\nFor instance, a radiation therapist in the Master of Arts (Counselling and Guidance) programme once shared: “I felt powerless to help cancer patients cope emotionally”. Completing her course, she was able to apply knowledge from her postgraduate about phobias and relaxation therapy to help patients practise mindfulness techniques in overcoming the fear of treatment.\nSkills such as working in a team, developing new perspectives and supporting the social-emotional aspects of people postgraduate candidates come into contact with, are highly prized in a 21st century world.\nSo the argument that the ability to call up information instantaneously negates the relevance of further learning becomes tenuous.\nBack to the question about what good does a postgraduate programme do if you can Google anything. How do you search for that which you do not know?\xa0\nPostgraduate education, whether through full programmes or micro-credentials can help open minds. Incidentally, it does help one figure out what to google for and to discern if the search results are credible or relevant to one’s needs.\nTo this end, preparation and a clear goal in mind, solidifies the first steps toward a much-valued postgraduate learning journey.\nAssociate Professor Chang Chew Hung works at the Office of Graduate Studies and Professional Learning at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\xa0 \n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     employment ']}"

      Indonesian community harnesses ‘flower power’ to educate underprivileged children
  </h1>, 'text': 'BANDUNG, Indonesia: The sight of lustrous roses growing in the hills of Indonesia amid rice terraces and banana trees is unusual. The fact that the proceeds from these flowers are directly funding a school for underprivileged rural children is even more rare.\xa0\nIn the misty village of Geger Sunten, on the distant outskirts of Bandung, Indonesia’s fourth-largest city, education has\xa0been neglected. This has always been farming land where sons and daughters graduate in the fields, not in the classroom.\xa0\n“The first time I was here, I realised that many kids did not continue schooling. At the age of 14,\xa0they were able to get married. That was how it was in the past,” said Enung Mulyani, the principal and co-founder of the area’s community learning centre, PBKM.\nIn 2005, Enung and her husband Yusuf set out to change those attitudes, where young people can be prevented from enriching their future through learning because of the working needs of their family.\xa0\nFor the couple, it required an enormous personal sacrifice and toil to simply raise the issue.\xa0\n“I went to homes personally and asked their children to join PBKM. Some mothers allowed, some did not. Some were angry, some were alright. I was sad that they were angry,” she said.\xa0\n“Some families could not afford it. Some children were banned from going to school by their parents. Some children preferred to earn money and help the family. There was also no support from parents to pursue education.”\xa0\nOf course, with farming as the lifeblood of the community, it would take flexibility. School could not simply replace work, even for kids.\nAdaptable class schedules and attendance requirements means students like 18-year-old Nanang Atang have been able to traverse a once impossible path to graduation, while keeping the family afloat by working when needed.\xa0\n“I choose to go to this school because I don’t have to attend classes every day. There are lessons on farming as well. So in the future, I will be able to practice what I have learned here after graduating,” he said.\xa0\nInspired by Yusuf’s passion for education in particular, Nanang feels proud of his efforts even if his next step in life is to still remain working in local agriculture.\xa0\n“I’m glad that I will be able to go to the next level but I feel sad that I have to leave my friends who have been together with me, shoulder to shoulder, supporting each other in our studies here for a long time.” \xa0\xa0\nThere are now 120 children\xa0aged from five years to 18 who have access to an affordable, accessible education. The corridors around the simple classrooms, built gradually over time as space and money allowed, overflow\xa0with the sounds of playing, laughing and running.\xa0\nBut funding this endeavour has never been simple – Enung and Yusuf put their entire savings into their dream, even leaving their own child at home while they travelled the country seeking more money.\xa0\n“I sold my jewellery to build this school. I sold five of my motorcycles. Until today I still have debts incurred financing the materials for this school,” Enung said. The teachers at the school are volunteers, forsaking a regular paid job and travelling often long distances to take their classes.\xa0\nThe school’s tenuous financial situation was made worse when Yusuf died late last year. His premature death ripped a hole in Enung’s life and tested her spirit. He was her foundation, a major driver of the program and a motivating energy for the children.\nShe despaired but has carried on – still emotionally distraught by the loss.\nOne of Yusuf’s legacies was to build up the unconventional funding method for the school – roses. It is not a crop that is normally grown in this part of Indonesia and came at the end of lengthy experimentation for a non labour-intensive, profitable option.\xa0\nNow, 40 per cent of the proceeds from the roses go into the school’s operations; the rest is used to keep the farm going.\xa0\nRukma Setiabudi is the farm’s custodian. His daily workplace is in the perfume-filled greenhouses blooming with red, white, yellow and pink flowers that he meticulously cultivates.\nHe can harvest between 50 and 60 bundles of roses each week, with the Grade A bunches fetching about US$25 at local markets. Rose farming is more profitable, he explains, than regular vegetable farming that needs crops to be re-planted regularly. A rose bush here will produce flowers for more than five years.\xa0\nThere are also the less tangible benefits of spending time around beautiful blooms. “I’m very happy farming roses because each time I’m here, I see the beauty of the roses and it relieves my stress,” he said.\xa0\nRukma has also taken on duties at PBKM teaching students farming techniques, which he himself learned from Yusuf.\xa0\n“I’m very proud that I’m able to gain more knowledge as well as sharing my knowledge and applying it with the students. Education is very useful for not only kids but for everyone because learning goes a long way in life.”\nIt is pure dogged determination that has started to change the prospects of an entire community and hundreds of children here now have access to the education they need.\xa0\nAt the heart of\xa0this success has been\xa0agriculture, the ever-present and quintessential force in this part of the world. Attitudes about the land and learning are changing and the outcomes for the children who can benefit are already clear to see.\xa0\n“Starting a school is not easy. Never easy and never simple. I am not a teacher. But I have a wish in my heart. I do it as an act of service,” Enung said tearfully.\xa0\n“I am satisfied that all the sacrifices were worth it and you can see the results today. I am very proud.”\nFor more on this and other projects around Southeast Asia, watch\xa0Tapestry: The Heart of ASEAN\xa0on Toggle.\n', 'related_topics': ['     Indonesia ', '     agriculture ', '     education ']}"

It included a feature article on the return to education for graduates of private education institutions (PEI).\xa0\nThe study had aimed to offer new insights on the monetary returns to PEI and autonomous university (AU) degrees.\nAmong other metrics, it reported that AU graduates enjoyed an average of 28 per cent premium in starting wages compared to graduates of degree programmes\xa0from foreign universities that were taught offshore via PEIs.\nThese results mirrored the findings of the\xa0Graduate Employment Survey reported by the Committee for Private Education and SkillsFuture Singapore three months prior, which showed the median gross monthly salary of the graduates from PEIs in full-time permanent employment was S$2,550, compared to that of fresh AU graduates at S$3,325.\nWhen queried about the GES, SkillsFuture Singapore qualified it was “not intended as a comparison of the quality or value of the respective institutions, and should not be interpreted as such” given the small sample size for some of its data points.\xa0\nFor instance, 18 of the schools polled had fewer than 10 respondents, while 23 had fewer than 20.\nBoth studies did not identify the main reasons for this difference in starting salaries between AU and PEI degree holders.\xa0\nYet the MTI study suggested the wage gap could stem from “differences in … employers’ perceptions of the degrees”.\nWhile it is not uncommon knowledge that graduates from AUs are better paid, it is unfortunate that such surveys exacerbate\xa0an unhealthy fixation on starting salaries as the benchmark of returns from quality higher education.\nIn fact, such myopia misses the mark in our larger debate, where we should be setting our sights on how Singapore’s diverse ecosystem of higher education institutions can collectively raise the overall calibre of Singapore’s human capital to enable Singaporeans to better compete globally.\nREAD:\xa0A commentary on the myths surrounding private higher education.\xa0\nHIGHER EDUCATION BENEFITS INDIVIDUALS, THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY \nGranted there are some students who value higher education because of the benefits it brings in the form of a higher salary, improved career prospects, or a higher chance of securing a desirable job. Where higher education is seen as an enabler to better economic outcomes, it might be fair to keep starting salaries as one factor of consideration.\nBut the same argument could be made with those who are encouraged to embrace lifelong learning through SkillsFuture courses.\nYet a society steeped in a culture of learning will enable its citizens to benefit more widely from the opportunity to lead a more fulfilled life – through knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, learning to deconstruct entrenched and possibly outdated worldviews, holistic learning that integrates theory with practice or developing higher-order skills to be better prepared to face the challenges of the 21st\xa0century.\nIn The Lessons of History, Pulitzer Prize winners Ariel and Will Durant assert that “a society in which all potential abilities are allowed to develop, function and thrive will have a survival advantage in the competition of groups”.\nTo that end, by defining the returns of higher education in mere earnings, we are simply caricaturising the benefit that a better educated population brings instead of appreciating the impact that it has in unleashing potentialities for the collective well-being of society.\nSingapore’s transformation into a manpower-lean economy means we will have to rely less on talent from abroad while doubling-down on cultivating more talent\xa0from within. In that regard, everyone should be encouraged to both pursue a degree, and be competent to learn throughout life.\xa0\nWhere the benefits of lifelong learning have been so often touted in this country, it would be a mistake to believe that the accumulation of knowledge and vocabulary through higher education is not necessary and that lifelong learning arises naturally.\nCognisant of the relevance of higher education in the cultivation of home grown talent, the Ministry of Education has announced plans to evolve our publicly-funded institutes of higher learning (IHL) to be more closely aligned to Singapore’s efforts to champion this spirit of lifelong learning.\nREAD:\xa0A commentary why private higher education doesn\'t deserve its bad rep.\nPRIVATE EDUCATION AND HIGHER RETURNS\nIf we consider AUs, almost all of them aim for prestige which comes from academic research. A good university is associated with measures used in the league tables.\xa0\nClimbing the university rankings may be a laudable goal. But we should also open our eyes to other purposes of higher education.\nSome universities focus on applied research that is specifically relevant to the nation - to raise the standard of living of farmers, for example – rather than paying particular focus on theoretical research which has a higher tendency for acceptance in top-tier journals.\nWhile our AUs do well in this regard, it is important to recognise that if the role of higher education is to train a future workforce, then PEIs which focus more on teaching rather than research can also provide students with strong academic and non-academic support that prepares them for industry. \xa0\nGenerally speaking, PEIs facilitate student admission into diploma and degree courses that are based on interests and aptitudes, and not just on academic results. In that sense, they broaden access to higher education by believing your professional development and preparation for a career should also be enriched by one’s working experience and life experience.\nIt was heartening to hear Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills)\xa0Ong Ye Kung make a similar point in last week’s Committee for Supply debates.\xa0\nAt PEIs, more students even those relatively less academically inclined can enrol into a variety of diploma or degree courses as they are presented with these “differentiated paces”. And if more students are likely to enrol into courses that interest them, they may have a higher chance of going on to achieve success in studies, careers and life.\nREAD:\xa0A commentary on going beyond seeing private higher education as a ""second chance"" option.\nFor example, graduates from PSB Academy have earned first class degrees and gone on to work in prestigious Singaporean and multinational companies.\nMs Adora Sarah Chou is one of these graduates from PSB’s university partner, the University of Wollongong Australia. In recounting her story, Adora shared how she was “always deemed a failure – an N-level student, poor grades and a 32-pointer for O-levels”.\nBut through hard work and determination, Adora spent seven years pursuing her studies and is today doing well as a group marketing manager for a prominent pizza chain -\xa0a path that may not have been opened to her had she not had a chance to hone her skills in an institute of higher education.\nMany others have seized the opportunity of a second chance at a quality higher education and these stories need to be told - stories of personal growth and advancement of students who have their lives transformed by PEIs.\nThe important point is this - we must do more to do away with judging higher education institutions through a single scale, for good reasons.\xa0A higher education – whether through an AU or a PEI – is not an automatic ticket to a high paying job.\nAside from perpetuating this fallacy, unintended signals of bias against PEI graduates can add to the worrying cracks in Singapore’s social divide.\nBRIDGE, NOT EXACERBATE SINGAPORE\'S SOCIAL DIVIDE\nAn Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) survey on social capital last year reported that despite our aspiration to be a meritocratic society with high social mobility, Singapore may in fact be more divided by class.\nThis is a divide that may stem from the fact that as open economies, cities like Singapore cannot totally iron out the inequalities of rewards that globalisation accords in a meritocratic way.\nYet as a truly globally-oriented economy, Singapore should not fixate on education’s role in the mere allocation of jobs but instead take on a broader worldview of enabling all potential abilities to develop, function and thrive in our bid to raise our collective human capital and competitiveness as a global node in Asia.\nMoreover, when we make a distinction between AU and PEI degree holders through surveys that further entrench prevailing biases, we unknowingly contribute to Singapore’s class divide in two ways.\nFirst, through encouraging social exclusion where graduates from publicly funded education institutions might see themselves as socially more superior than others.\nSecond, in a scenario where such bias becomes deeply entrenched, Singaporeans might not feel motivated to upgrade themselves through formal education when they neither qualify for a place in a publicly-funded tertiary institution, nor can afford to study overseas.\nThis might result in a society divided by social classes, where the wealthy can well-afford to skirt the stigma of being a PEI graduate, and pursue his or her diploma or degree from overseas – as some already are doing so.\nREAD:\xa0A commentary on bridging the social divides in Singapore.\nSince 2009, the Committee for Private Education has done a remarkable job in raising the standard of private education in Singapore. There are PEIs of good standing in the market that offer students with\xa0many paths to good higher education when they miss\xa0out on the opportunity to acquire higher education qualification early in their life, or when other options simply aren\'t available.\nBut it would be unfortunate if in the pursuit of education and lifelong learning, the debate remains fixated on choosing among an AU, PEI or vocational SkillsFuture programme.\nWe should be a society that affords Singaporeans more choices in educational options, that encourages all Singaporeans to pursue a quality higher education, and that embraces a culture of lifelong learning where Singaporeans strive to make an impact for themselves and their communities, regardless of which stage in their career they might be.\nDr Sam Choon-Yin and Marcus Loh are dean and\xa0vice-president\xa0of PSB Academy respectively.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     employment ']}"

      Commentary: Millennials need a stronger grasp of personal finances
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: The financial picture millennials face today is vastly different from that of their parents.\nWith higher life expectancies, a higher cost of living and greater market volatility, the stakes are higher when it comes to the kinds of financial decisions a young adult has to make today compared to 50 years ago.\nNo doubt many would have picked up rudimentary knowledge about budgeting, saving and spending from their parents.\xa0\nHowever, to make educated financial decisions about investing money and saving for the future, more in-depth knowledge is clearly required.\nTIMELY FOR SCHOOLS TO PICK UP THE PACE\nFinancial literacy starts at home, but for a generation where past advice on personal finances don’t neatly apply to our experiences, a more deliberate effort is needed to equip young adults with relevant knowledge and skills.\nWith the advent of fintech, cryptocurrency and as societies embrace cashless payments, ours is a complex world with more financial opportunities but greater uncertainty.\nWhere education should prepare our youths for the practical challenges of modern life, it seems schools should play a bigger role in helping students understand money matters, alongside teaching traditional education curriculum.\nSo Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat’s announcement at Budget 2018 that a new financial education curriculum will be piloted at polytechnics and the Institute\xa0of Technical Education (ITE) colleges is a timely move.\nA STRUCTURED PROGRAMME\nDeveloping financial capability among young adults can help uncover blind spots and inform savings, investment and insurance decisions that contribute to one’s longer-term financial well-being.\nIn an effort to raise the level of financial literacy of young adults, Citi Singapore and Singapore Management University (SMU) launched the Citi-SMU Financial Literacy Programme for Young Adults in April 2012 with the support of the Citi Foundation.\nIt is Singapore’s first structured financial literacy programme for young adults, a brainchild of Jeremy Goh, an Associate Professor of Finance at SMU.\nThrough lectures, workshops and course curriculum, the programme seeks to equip young adults between the ages of 17 and 30 with essential personal finance knowledge and skills applicable to their life stage to give them a firm foundation in managing their money and a financial head-start early in their lives.\nThe programme utilises a unique peer-to-peer training model in which selected students from SMU, polytechnics and ITEs are trained by SMU faculty members, industry practitioners and government agencies including CPF Board and HDB\xa0to be financial literacy coaches.\nThey in turn, with the Citi-SMU programme team, conduct interactive workshops and creative initiatives including games, carnivals, camps and competitions to engage young adults from the ITE Colleges, polytechnics and community organisations including the Association of Muslim Professionals and the Chinese Development Assistance Council.\nSince its launch, close to 210 SMU students and more than 120 students from five polytechnics and three ITE colleges have been trained as financial literacy coaches.\xa0\nThe programme has also engaged over 18,000 young adults on a wide range of topics including basic money and credit management, financial and retirement planning, home and car ownership as well as principles of investment.\nFrom an introduction to the CPF system, to understanding of housing and healthcare insurance, the programme has provided them with an insight into the very issues they will find themselves concerned soon – saving to buy a house and starting a family.\nApart from high outreach, an impact assessment on 700 participants conducted by Assistant Professor Aurobindo Ghosh from SMU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Business and Principal Investigator (Research) of the programme demonstrates the efficacy of the programme.\n60 per cent of participants said they improved their basic understanding of financial literacy concepts.\xa086 per cent strongly agreed on the need to start a regular savings plan compared to 66 per cent before attending the programme.\n40 per cent said they have also been able to develop and use a simple personal budget to manage their expenditure and increase their savings by at least 10 per cent.\xa0\nFurthermore, the programme saw a 20 per cent increase in the number of students who said they were now investing more prudently.\nIt seems trainers who have graduated from the programme are generally more confident in managing their money, follow prudent investment strategies with their savings, and share knowledge with their peers. Many become leaders in advocating financial awareness among\xa0their peers.\nIf this model is to be scaled up, the hope is that it reaches more young adults – and delivers not just an understanding near-term issues like how much to save for your Built-to-Order flat but also a stronger grasp of longer-term challenges that youths tend to discount, including what makes for sufficient retirement adequacy.\nEDUCATION IS KEY\nFinancial literacy is a critical life skill today.\nGreater focus should be placed on teaching young adults how to plan their finances for their unique situations and aspirations.\nMore can also be done to motivate them to apply these newly acquired skills to take action. There is a gap between knowing what to do and doing the right thing. The closing of this gap is the next stage in the financial literacy movement, to progress from financial literacy to financial capability.\nWhere the goal is to give millennials the confidence in their financial future, a financial education curriculum may be the key.\nUltimately, it’s up to millennials to figure out modern life and how to live within their means, but they can be given a leg up if armed with a basic understanding of the mechanics of personal financing.\nVivian Quark Zhi Xian is a\xa0student trainer in the Citi-SMU Financial Literacy Programme for Young Adults.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     SMU ']}"

      Commentary: The benefits of bilingualism go beyond knowing two languages
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: While we know that bilingualism helps us to maintain contact with family and our cultural heritage, there are additional lesser known benefits that should convince us of its value.\nIt is timely to discuss some of these in light of International Mother Tongue Day on Feb 21. For those investing time and effort into bringing up bilingual kids, it can be valuable to consider additional benefits that bilingualism offers.\nResearchers have found that learning two languages can greatly enhance our mental development. Indeed, research shows us that bilingualism stimulates mental development in babies, grandparents and everybody in between.\nBETTER FOCUS AND CREATIVITY\nBilingualism improves several important mental functions. For example, research shows us that bilingual experience helps us to rapidly make sense of information.\nWhen given a task where children have to focus on one thing and ignore distracting information, bilingual children have shown themselves to be better at zooming in on the task. When they are asked to shift their focus elsewhere, bilingual children also do this more effectively.\nFocusing and shifting attention are critical abilities that go beyond bilingualism: This ability helps us to rapidly learn and process information and function well in school and other learning environments.\nIn addition, bilingual children show greater mental flexibility. For example, they are advantaged in adapting to new rules and situations. Greater mental flexibility can make also bilingual children more creative. In this way, bilingualism may nurture “mental innovation” in young children.\nIn other words, bilingual children are able to see the same situation in multiple ways. This capacity for divergent thinking helps bilingual children to solve complex problems. Similarly, when asked to solve problems they have never encountered before, bilingual children outperform their monolingual peers in finding new solutions.\nResearchers have shown that these advantages lead to bilingual benefits in academic problem solving, including building mathematics skills.\nEASIER TO LEARN NEW LANGUAGES\nBilingualism also makes it easier to learn new languages. Researchers have shown that bilingual adults learn new words from a foreign language more efficiently.\nHowever, this language learning advantage doesn't require years of being bilingual. Even bilingual infants demonstrate a greater ability to learn words in a foreign language. While monolingual children lock into one language, bilingual children remain open to language differences. This extended period of openness makes the uptake of new languages easier.\nAt the other end of our lifespan, bilingual adults also demonstrate healthier mental ageing. For example, bilingualism may delay the onset of memory loss, a devastating symptom of neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.\nSo in addition to stimulating the infant mind, bilingualism also preserves the ageing mind.\n(Read: A commentary on\xa0monolingual parents raising their kids to be bilingual.)\nBUILD SOCIAL BONDS\nBilingualism also helps to build social bonds. In addition to opening up a child’s world to different language communities, bilingual children think about other people differently compared with monolingual children.\nFrom early childhood, bilingual children have shown improved abilities to take other people’s perspectives and communicate the viewpoints of another person.\nResearchers in Montreal, Canada have recently discovered that bilingual children befriend others more democratically, resisting some of the “just-like-me” social preferences often evident in children.\nRecent research from the National University of Singapore shows that bilingual children demonstrate fewer racial biases than monolingual children. Bilingualism therefore opens up a child’s social world and unlocks early potential for building social connections.\nBUILDS THE BRAIN’S EXECUTIVE SYSTEM\nSo what is it about bilingualism that leads to all of these benefits? Bilingualism is thought to feed an important part of the mind – the executive system. Often thought of as the CEO of the brain, the executive system enables us to rapidly take in information and make sense of it in a short time.\nOne part of the executive system - the part that allows us to attend to things flexibly as the situation calls for - seems to grow more rapidly in bilinguals. Bilingual minds have to be flexible as they commit to two languages.\nBilingual minds also have to anticipate when to turn on one language and turn off the other. It is precisely the mental work of bilinguals – going back-and-forth between two languages – that pays mental dividends.\nOn the face of it, bilingualism can seem like a significant challenge, especially for young children and their parents. It is important to remember\xa0that babies are born neither monolingual nor are they born bilingual. They are born ready to learn one or more languages with equal potential.\nAnd the human mind, when placed in a bilingual environment, rises to the occasion and\xa0profits from the experience.\nLeher Singh is director for the National University of Singapore’s Infant and Child Language Centre and Associate Professor of Psychology.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Commentary: The hidden value of learning how to code
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: In a multilingual Singapore, people see benefits in being fluent in multiple languages.\xa0\nAny school-going child in Singapore would probably be well-exposed to the pressures of learning to be effectively bilingual. Chances are, they’ll be encouraged profusely by well-meaning parents to live and breathe English as well as Chinese, Malay or Tamil.\xa0\nAnd for good reason. A language opens the door to another world, offers a lens into another culture, and allows one to express oneself so as to be understood by more people.\xa0\nThis pressure doesn’t let up in adulthood – where there are significant economic and professional benefits to being conversant in several languages.\nIn fact, multilingualism and Singaporeans’ ability to understand the region around us are arguably cornerstones of Singapore\'s economic success.\xa0\nOne language of choice is standing out, amid\xa0the focus on bilingualism and the importance of being conversant in English and mother tongue – that of programming languages, such as Java or Python.\nMastery over coding, in knowing how to harness programming languages allows one to write computer programs that give instructions to a computer.\nWhere Singapore’s Smart Nation future is encouraging the build-up of capabilities by leveraging technology to solve everyday problems, it seems knowing to code may help your kid achieve an edge over others when he or she enters the workforce someday.\nCOMPUTATION TOUCHES US ALL\nBarely any discipline or any profession today remains untouched by computation.\xa0 A cursory search for the query ""computational"" on the National Library Board catalogue throws up books covering such subjects as computational finance, computational sciences, even computational approach to painting and calligraphy.\nWith computers and information technology permeating every aspect of how we work and live, modern-day multilingualism may involve picking up one or a few programming languages.\xa0\nMany Singaporeans are jumping on the\xa0bandwagon.\xa0\nIn some shopping malls,\xa0coding\xa0schools for kids can be found alongside Chinese enrichment centres.\xa0\nCoding fever is at an all-time high. 19 secondary schools now teach programming at the GCE O-Level. 6 IP schools or junior colleges offer computing as an A-Level subject. Applications to IT-related degrees are rising in\xa0local universities.\xa0\nProfessionals and new graduates attend short-term, intensive coding boot camps, hoping to transition to the tech industry.\xa0\nThis greater cognizance of the importance of programming and computing bodes well for our future digital economy and will serve our Smart Nation vision well.\nBut what we need to keep in mind is that learning programming needs to go beyond simply understanding specific syntax and the peculiarities of a programming language.\nCoding is useful, not because kids learn how to use computers, but because it helps them develop skillsets to think about the world and go about problem-solving.\nHOW TO BE AN EFFECTIVE CODER\nJust as knowing English grammar rules alone does not make one an eloquent speaker of English, knowing the syntax rules of how to put together a computer programme does not make one a proficient programmer.\xa0\nCommunicating well in a language involves a host of skills, not least of which is the empathic consideration for how the message will be processed and acted upon by the computer.\nThe phrase ""computational thinking"" has been coined by professor of computer science at Columbia University Jeanette Wing.\nIt encapsulates the thinking process involved in formulating a real-world problem in computational terms, and to design an algorithm – a sequence of step-by-step operations the computer can take in reaching a solution in good time.\xa0\nIn learning coding, kids may go away with a well-rounded\xa0education, provided they also develop a grasp of concepts that underpin computational thinking.\xa0\nThese include logical thinking, how to apply algorithms, abstraction and decomposition, among others.\nComputational thinking helps kids develop practical skillsets in questioning the world around them and learning how to approach problems from a variety of perspectives, applying axiomatic principles.\nOne computational thinking principle is to design algorithms that can still be executed in reasonable time even as the problem scales up.\xa0\nFor instance, it is an Olympic tradition to conduct a torch relay that visits a number of localities in the host country.\xa0One may use a computer to calculate the route with the shortest distance for instance.\nYet for Tokyo 2020, the fastest supercomputer today cannot investigate every possibility to arrive at the best route to tour the 47 prefectures in Japan, even within our grandchildren\'s lifetime. So a solution with less complexity, with a smaller set of possible solutions, may be more practical.\xa0\nAnother computational thinking principle is the importance of organising one\'s data well to allow a problem to be solved efficiently.\xa0You can only use a hard-copy dictionary quickly if you know that the words are ordered alphabetically.\xa0\nSimilarly, an understanding of how data is organised stands at the heart of search engines like Google – which can search trillions of pages on the World Wide Web, and yet return the relevant links to us within a second.\xa0\nKids need to take to heart the same adage when they learn how to programme.\nOnce kids begin to realize that at an abstract level many problems are fundamentally similar in computational terms, they will see the applications of computational thinking at every nook and cranny.\xa0\nFor example, Webpages link to one another just as Twitter users follow one another.\xa0Intuitively, there is similarity between finding an authoritative web page and finding an influencer on Twitter.\nFor another example, finding the fastest way to send a message over the Internet is not very different from finding the fastest way to go from one\'s home to Lau Pa Sat for supper.\xa0An algorithm that solves one could be applied to solve the other.\xa0\nThe computational thinking process allows kids to gain inspiration from a variety of problems, and thus widens the applicability of programming across various disciplines.\nWhen learning a foreign\xa0language, we learn not only new vocabulary, but more importantly a new way of thinking.\nIn the same way, coding can help our kids be better communicators and problem solvers, if it helps them develop these skillsets along the way.\nHady W Lauw is assistant professor of information systems at the School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

      Commentary: What hope do monolingual parents have in raising bilingual children?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: A series of videos promoting the use of mother tongues has recently been released by the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism.\nThese videos are intended to promote the use of mother tongues, stressing its importance in bridging connections with others and retaining a strong national identity.\nThe need for these videos may speak to some of the ambivalence and challenges families often face in raising bilingual children. Particularly in families where parents do not speak the mother tongue, they may feel overwhelmed and uncertain when it comes to figuring out how to raise a bilingual child.\nCan parents who don't speak their mother tongue raise children who do?\nAnd can they do so without resorting to expensive tuition classes?\nThankfully, research tells us that parents who do not speak two languages can raise bilingual children who become fully proficient in both languages.\nHowever, unlike bilingual families, these parents will be more dependent on outside sources, such as childcare facilities, community resources, schools or tutors, to provide second language exposure and instruction.\nWHO’S TEACHING THE MOTHER TONGUE?\nFor monolingual families, well-designed and effectively implemented bilingual education programmes can provide an excellent and sustainable route to bilingualism.\nBilingual education programmes that maintain best practices in second language instruction should be sufficient to build up mother tongue proficiency without the need for supplementary tuition.\nBut what distinguishes good bilingual education?\nThe sheer amount of time that children hear a mother tongue predicts their eventual success. Children with longer exposure to the mother tongue go onto greater proficiency.\nHowever, bilingual education is not just about clocking hours - it is also about how this time is being spent. In learning a mother tongue, it is good for children to have exposure and interaction with a variety of mother tongue speakers and for these interactions to be with fully proficient native speakers. Such speakers can provide the best language model for young learners.\nSo, the more the better, both in terms of time spent and the number of speakers encountered.\nThe success of mother tongue education relies on interaction with live partners. While many parents may be tempted to let the television playing cartoons or sitcoms in the mother tongue babysit children in the hope that kids will pick up the language with the passage of time, research shows children learn better from live interaction and conversation than passive media consumption.\nThe mode of instruction also matters, although some children draw more from spontaneous social opportunities whereas others draw more from more structured learning.\nThe reality is some children gravitate towards structured learning where they learn rules and word meanings, and armed with this knowledge, feel comfortable to engage in spontaneous conversation. Others much prefer spontaneous conversation and use these conversations to draw out rules and word meanings.\nBut crucial to both is a chance to interact and converse with a partner.\nWhile mother tongue tuition can be helpful, a good bilingual education should suffice to build up native mother tongue proficiency.\nParents can also resort to social opportunities, such as interest groups via Meetup, or immerse themselves in cultural events at Community Centres to seek out opportunities for their children to use the mother tongue.\nParents can also actively support peer friendships and play opportunities with native speakers of a mother tongue. Children are typically less deterred by a language barrier with those they meet than adults and they are often very willing to enjoy play with another child with shared interests, even if they speak a different language.\nCommunity and peer engagement will have to be a more active effort for monolingual families, but it is a worthy investment in their child’s bilingual journey.\nARE KIDS MOTIVATED TO MASTER THEIR MOTHER TONGUE?\nResearch shows us that motivation for second language learning in children is more important than language learning ability in reaching bilingual proficiency. A child who is highly motivated to learn their mother tongue will typically fare much better than one who is not.\nAs parents often recognise, creating and sustaining motivation for the mother tongue can present one of the biggest challenges to teaching children their mother tongue.\nMany children, even toddlers, simply refuse to talk in a mother tongue choosing to speak English, even though they understand their mother tongue. This is a common scenario that reflects in the child both a language preference and a selective appreciation for the usefulness of one language over the other.\nBut this barrier must be overcome so that kids don’t stay passive bilinguals (children who understand two languages but only speak in one) but make progress to become active bilinguals.\nThe reality is that children cannot be pressured to interact in a mother tongue, nor can they be easily convinced of the logic of why learning an additional language is important.\nChildren are motivated to learn a language when they believe that the language is useful to them in their eyes. For example, many parents believe that learning Chinese is a strategic choice that will give their children opportunities in their future careers, yet this is not a line of reasoning that would readily appeal to a 5-year-old.\nFor this reason, good bilingual education programmes often have clever, creative ways to engage children in the host culture of a second language to enliven the experience of learning. For example, learning about interesting cultural practices or popular culture in the mother tongue can fuel a curiosity for the language in children.\nWhile this is not directly teaching vocabulary or grammar, it is a crucial step towards building motivation than can bolster an uptake of vocabulary and grammar.\nBut if one language is actively used in a child’s life to converse in school, maintain friendships and family bonds, and access the ever-appealing world of entertainment while the other language is confined to textbooks and homework exercises, then both languages will start to mean different things.\nThe child may naturally gravitate towards the language that they actively use at the cost of the second language, limiting a child from realising their bilingual potential.\nBut a child who views their knowledge of a second language as a means towards forging important social bonds, pursuing their own hobbies or interests, or making valued cultural connections in their life will be more likely to persevere in the hard work of learning another language more than a child who sees a second language as just another examinable subject.\nBILINGUALISM A FAMILY AFFAIR\nFinally, as with all aspects of learning, children learn within the bounds of their own “ecosystem”. A child raised in a family environment where bilingualism is valued and prioritised by the parents – even if they are not providing bilingual input at home - is more likely to become bilingual than one whose family holds an indifferent view towards bilingualism.\nMany monolingual parents often approach bilingualism in a direction that is less than ideal. Specifically, we teach word by word. In other words, we hope that children will learn words in a Mother tongue to be able to access the “world” of the Mother tongue. But it can be equally important for children to be drawn to the “world” of the mother tongue in a way that makes them want to learn the words.\nChildren inherit their parents’ attitudes in many respects, and bilingualism is no exception.\nFor monolingual and bilingual families alike, developing a sustainable and consistent family language policy where each member of the family agrees upon and actively supports bilingual acquisition can greatly benefit a child.\nThis can mean actively seeking to create opportunities for children to engage in their mother tongue by attending community events or by forging partnerships with peers and neighbors to encourage mother tongue use.\nFamily language policies vary greatly depending on the languages spoken by each member of the family and on what works best for an individual child. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for all children.\nWhat is important is that children receive similar amounts of high-quality exposure and interaction opportunities for both languages and that children see the relevance and appeal of both languages in their lives.\nLeher Singh is director for the National University of Singapore’s Infant and Child Language Centre and Associate Professor of Psychology.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     Parenting ']}"

But what if there is no need for us to question in the first place?\nDEVELOPED, ADVANCED, SAFE\nWhenever someone asks what Singapore is like, we are likely to say “developed” or “safe” or “advanced” and we are all those things. As Singaporeans, the one story we all know best, is the story of survival. We know how vulnerable our little island nation is, how hard-won our stability and prosperity has been. But the unfortunate byproduct of that story is fear.Fear that if we walk a road other than the one painstakingly laid out for us, that our destination will no longer be certain. Over time, we have developed a deep-set belief that the tried and tested path is always safer.\nAnd it probably is. Stick to the road and you might never feel discomfort. And who wants to knowingly put themselves through tribulation?\nWe are not interested in the unknown, we are happy to be in our own cocoons of security. Poetry and fiction don’t allow for this.\n“Literature isn’t easy to score!” we hear again and again, but the bigger question we should be asking is, why do we see that score as the real marker of success or learning?\nYoung people in this country are our future, but if we continue to lay out specific roads for them, then how will their dreams be any different from ours? If we keep dreaming the same dream, how will we ever see real growth?\nEvery few years, we hear concerns about how Singaporeans aren’t creative enough, how we need to instill more entrepreneurial dare in our children. But if we are a people afraid of discomfort or alienated from it, how can we fully develop social consciousness or the ability to navigate complexity or uncertainty?\nThe conversations on complex issues like race and sexuality have become more recurring as we evolve as a society and they are issues that threaten to divide us.\nBut if we cannot trust ourselves to have difficult conversations, if we have not acquired the vocabulary for them, or if we\xa0believe it is easier to disengage, then how will we ever emerge better?\nSTRUGGLE TO TALK ABOUT DIFFICULT ISSUES\nYoung people of my generation seem more passionate than ever about ensuring our country is a reflection of all that we have to offer, but we are also struggling to talk about issues that are difficult and won’t fit into a neat box. We don’t know how to work with things we cannot easily define.\nWe are a society in love with pie charts, acroynms, data, neat slogans that help define and neatly explain our concerns.\nI remember a particularly frustrating meeting when I was still a Head of Department where we were all held hostage for three hours in a board room while the school insisted we had to find a way to “measure” leadership.\nBut there are things in the world, in life and in the human condition, where the most real things - like questions of belonging, identity and loss - cannot be quantified, neatly packaged, or sometimes, even named.\nThis is also why Singaporeans don’t read poetry. Poetry demands that you suspend yourself in uncertainty, it asks for meaning to unfold in its own time and this can be incredibly uncomfortable if you are used to constant certainty.\nI am guilty of that need for efficiency myself. On a rainy evening in Oxford, I find myself feeling a surge of anxiety because there is no app to tell me when exactly my bus will arrive.\xa0\nAs Singaporeans, we are “your Uber will arrive in\xa03 minutes”, we are “tracking your order”, we are “but the message has been blue-ticked”. We are programmed to want to know outcomes.\nBut it is precisely in situations where we are forced to struggle with the unknowns of life when we tend to turn to poetry. It is no coincidence that poetry resurges in difficult times like war or times of complex human emotions, like weddings and funerals. Poetry exists to give us language where we have none.\nPoetry demands that we feel instead of think, to sit in questions rather than rush for answers. It asks that we recognise no two people live in the world in the same way, the same poem can mean vastly different things to different people and neither meaning is “wrong” or “right”.\nPoetry demands that we examine all the contradictions, even the ones within ourselves. We cannot hate without the capacity for love, we cannot grieve if we do not feel joy, and we cannot build if we do not first tear down.\nDEFINING SUCCESS\nIt will do us no good to look away from our messy selves, however much temporary comfort that brings us. To look away means to deny and to silence large parts of who we are as a people. It means to allow ourselves to be reduced to numbers and fiscal growth and rankings.\nAll of these are valuable but are not enough. We cannot define success as scores and profit over and above human need, over and above possessing the language we need to build real bridges to make us genuinely stronger.\nReal growth will only come when we allow ourselves to experience all our feelings, even the ones that make us profoundly uncomfortable. Because that’s where the most important lessons are to be learnt. And we can realise these lessons through our poetry, our stories, our writers who are a lens to our anxieties, our alienations, asking the difficult questions.\nAudre Lorde also said:\xa0\nIf what we need to dream, to move\xa0our spirits most deeply and directly toward and through promise, is a luxury, then we have given up the core - the fountain - of our power.\nMetamorphosis isn’t just some beautiful physical transformation. It’s a stunning display of evolutionary mechanisms. It’s a testament to what it truly takes to grow.\nButterflies and caterpillars don’t just look different, they behave differently too. One lives in trees, the other flies. And everyone knows, the most diverse ecosystems are the most resilient ones.\nWe need poets as much as we need scientists if we are going to finish the 21st century stronger than we started it.\xa0\nPooja Nansi is the author of two collections of poetry.

      Commentary: With less focus on grades, is PSLE still a necessary checkpoint?
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: With the recent Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results out on Friday (Nov 24), the question on many parents' and educators’ mind is whether the PSLE should remain as a “checkpoint” for students.\nAs a father of two children, I have been through the nerve-wrecking PSLE results collection twice in the past eight years.\nThe days leading up were more stressful than any job interview I have ever attended. Honestly, I have never experienced such tension, anxiety, anticipation and stress in my life, even when proposing to my wife, preparing for my wedding or cheering my wife on during the birth of our two children.\nAs an education and parenting coach, I have routinely observed the national obsession with academic results, especially so in the PSLE. Students and parents alike, take extreme measures at times to prepare for the PSLE, some with extra classes seven days a week. The PSLE has even been jokingly termed as “Please Stress the Life out of Everyone” by some parents and students.\nCHANGES TO THE PSLE SYSTEM \nMinister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng mentioned many times the importance of “nurturing a joy of learning in children” so that students enjoy school.\nThe Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore has also taken steady steps to overhaul the education system, shifting the focus from academic achievements alone to the holistic development of students.\nSignificant milestones include the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme, which was introduced in 2004 to allow students to be accepted into reputable secondary schools based on non-academic achievements, such as sporting and artistic merits.\nIn 2014, a revised Physical Education syllabus was introduced in primary and secondary schools, setting aside 10 to 20 per cent of curriculum time for outdoor education and physical activities to boost the overall physical wellness of students. \xa0\xa0\nFrom 2018, the enhanced DSA scheme will see all secondary schools in Singapore embracing this scheme and reserving up to 20 per cent of their cohort space for students applying through the scheme.\nUnder the enhanced scheme, academic achievement will not constitute a criterion for the application for secondary school. Instead, the admission criteria for the enhanced scheme will be based on students' strengths in sports, arts, language, mathematics or science.\nThrough this shift in the admission criteria, the MOE hopes parents support the all-rounded development of their children and ease off the obsession with tuition and enrichment classes for them.\nIn 2021, the PSLE will be re-structured to put in place Achievement Level (AL) scoring bands (such as A, B and C) instead of the current aggregate T-scores. The new scoring bands will pave the way for students to be less differentiated in their academic results, given 29 new possible PSLE scores, compared to the current 200+ PSLE aggregate scores.\nWhile some educators and parents have lobbied to do away with the PSLE, I am of the view that the PSLE has its value as a checkpoint for all students. It is a gauge of a student’s learning progress and academic aptitude, after six years of primary school education.\nWithout the PSLE as a checkpoint, students will not be able to measure their own learning progress in a standardised fashion. They may not be able to identify their academic strengths and weaknesses relative to their peers or discover their interests in various niche areas through exposure supported by parents and the education system in schools.\nIS STRESS STILL NECESSARY?\nStress is a regular word that pops up in every one of my education and parenting talks. Students and parents have to recognise that stress is meant to be a healthy motivation for individuals to give their best. It is only when stress is undue and overwhelming for the individual that it becomes unhealthy and even toxic.\nChildren today need to learn resilience and adaptability in our fast changing and rapidly advancing social, economical and technological landscape. Stress and competition is healthy and necessary in allowing individuals to learn coping skills, time management, self-discipline and other priceless life lessons.\nThe role parents play is critical in helping their children manage stress, embrace failure and accept disappointment. Failing to achieve one’s goals and expectations, is a natural part of life. Without failure, there is no real success and learning. An old Chinese saying goes: “Experience is the best teacher. Only through failure, do we learn the fine art of success.”\nBEYOND ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE\nIn line with promoting holistic development, parents need to encourage a healthy lifestyle for their children – in terms of their daily diet, regular exercise and adequate sleep. Character building, a positive self-esteem and healthy values are just as if not more important than the pursuit of academic excellence.\nAmid academic progress, schools will need to nurture creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in their curriculum. There will be an increased emphasis on thinking questions, collaborative project work and opportunities for students to apply their learning in the real world.\nWith the PSLE system as a checkpoint for all students, parents possess great power in enabling their children to develop their strengths and discover their passions. Every child needs to be sufficiently self-motivated and equipped with healthy coping mechanisms and stress management skills.\nThese are effective skillsets in achieving long term success and sustenance in their field of choice.\nIn conclusion, I am in support of the PSLE system as a necessary checkpoint for all students. The PSLE allows students to gauge their academic aptitude and make a wise choice in their application for a secondary school education.\nIt is also a test of a child’s resilience and stress management skills which are extremely important in preparing them to be ready for the real world.\nJason Ng Boon Hui is an education and parenting coach. He is also the founder of PSLE Hub.\xa0\nRead also: A commentary on combating the culture of comparison in PSLE results.\xa0\n"", 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     schools ', '     Parenting ', '     children ']}"

      Commentary: The real culprit making our children dumb isn’t e-learning
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: “Technology cannot fix education,” said Steve Jobs in 1996 when asked about his spearheading of initiatives that give computer equipment to schools.\nThose four words uttered more than 20 years ago provide a guidepost for how we should think about e-learning and educational apps.\nIndeed, mobile technology has become pervasive and entrenched for most aspects of our lives today. From getting up to read the news on your phone, to scrolling through social media to see what your friends have been up to, the real world is merging with the one online.\nFor our children, this means that the traditional classroom will increasingly be complemented by the use of smartphones, as well as tablets and laptops.\nWhile the emergence of mobile learning apps has generated optimism about the opportunities they present for children to learn at their own pace and through their preferred learning styles, there has also been panic over children’s dependency on handheld digital gadgets at such a tender age.\nA recent news report from Channel NewsAsia asked to this effect if e-learning is making our kids dumb, and highlighted experts sounding a warning bell.\nLearning apps may not teach children anything but instead, mess with their brains in the long run, hooking children, getting them to stay the course for as long as possible, and eroding human connections with those around them, said the report.\nThe report also included a video showing four-year-old twins performing basic tasks to test their executive functional skills after drawing or using a learning app on a tablet, with the latter twin experiencing more difficulty after.\nWhile the report highlights the dangers of an overreliance on technology, it misses the mark on e-learning entirely for many reasons.\nTHE NEW SOCIAL REALITY\nAs our world becomes increasingly digital, the use of digital platforms to augment real life chores and activities will be a reality.\nMost of us are spending more time on our phones in the last few years alone. According to Yahoo’s Flurry Analytics, Americans spent on average 2 hours 42 minutes per day on their mobile devices in the fourth quarter of 2014. By the second quarter of 2015, an average of 3 hours 40 minutes was recorded – an astounding 35 per cent increase in just six short months.\nChildren are today’s digital natives, whose lives revolve around technology and media, and for whom the real and online worlds have little distinct boundaries. They reach out instinctively to these platforms – and most probably know how to swipe before they can walk.\nAs workplaces too increasingly migrate towards online meetings and discussions, isn’t it intuitive that the classroom uses similar tools to engage learners? Where too much screen time is obviously bad, did our parents tell us not to read because too much reading was causing short-sightedness?\nTo wish e-learning away in this context is therefore not only grossly myopic but naive. It is not a matter of if but how, when and where digital platforms are employed to augment our children’s learning journey.\nThe question then becomes what is a sensible and prudent approach to incorporating these tools into our homes and classrooms. Even as we ourselves are coming to terms with how to do so, one thing is certain - we should stop approaching online and offline learning as two separate spheres, and come up with a coherent, comprehensive approach to learning that considers this new social reality.\nIn a world where food, shopping and entertainment are at our fingertips, to tell our children to avoid mobile devices is to do as I say, not as I do. We surely cannot let our nostalgia for the pencil and paper override the inevitability of what education and learning in a digital world will entail\nENGAGEMENT STILL HAS TO BE HUMAN\nOne thing to bear in mind is that digital platforms are precisely just that – tools to be used for a purpose.\nTechnology cannot be a panacea for a well-rounded education with strong foundations, and certainly will not do anything in of itself to ensure our children develop a love for learning.\nComputers and apps cannot shoulder the responsibility that falls squarely on parents and educators alike.\nThe upside to digital technology has often been about how it promotes a less instructive, more explorative approach to learning via communication and collaboration.\nSocial media pages where students can share information related to the course and add to discussion threads, class polls for teachers to gain quick insights into students’ engagement and understanding, and live online documents for collaborative note-taking and editing are some examples where mobile technology, with careful thought and planning, can be effectively utilised for education.\nA further benefit lies in how technology can help boost participation. Where school lessons are constrained by time, tools like online boards allow discussions and debates to extend beyond the classroom and school hours. Shyer individuals can still have their feedback captured through polls or online forms.\nAt EduEdge, for example, online technology helps to boost student engagement through sharing viewpoints, raising disputes and analysing various current affairs issues.\nTherein lies the crux of the issue. With the right digital tools, a participatory and collaborative learning culture becomes possible. But the use of the “right” digital tools boils down to how educators use these tools to achieve specific ends. The thoughtfulness in which they incorporate these platforms and devices into their lessons, and their ability to mediate these discussions are ultimately key.\nParents too, have a role. It is their responsibility to have cultivated in their children respect for others’ opinions, online or offline as well as respect for quality family time without the use of technology.\nGOOD OUTCOMES \nMany studies attest to the fact that carefully designed educational apps do improve students’ learning. New evidence also show that early incorporation of such educational technology into the classroom can produce immense learning benefits later on.\nA 2010 study on an educational gaming app showed a 30 per cent improvement in the width of vocabulary of three-to-seven-year old kids who used it.\nOther studies have shown improvement in skillsets including arithmetic, communications, speech, articulation as well as motivation and engagement levels when using certain apps. These include studies on mobile learning for students with learning difficulties and special needs.\nWe can cite more studies, but that isn’t the point because it all depends on what skillsets apps are designed to hone and how they’re used.\nNOT A SILVER BULLET\nThe most important thing to remember is that mobile technology complements not substitutes teaching and learning; it is not a silver bullet.\nThis means that a concerted effort from all stakeholders in education namely, policy makers, schools, parents and students, is required to make e-learning viable so as to reap its full benefits.\nEffective teachers cannot be IT savvy without being pedagogically sound and vice versa. Yet when policymakers and educational institutes relook their curricula with a view to incorporating mobile technology, it should not be for the sole reason of moving with the changing times.\nThought must go into adjusting policies such as class participation assessment, to ensure the goal remains the students’ learning, instead of incentivising them to summarise and rephrase a random article off the Internet.\nParents should also take note that not all learning apps are made equal or will deliver what they promise. So-called educational videos that only serve to narrate at children for instance, will not be as impactful as programmes that encourage interaction. The fine line between games and educational tools must also be treaded carefully.\nParents should also check whether an app’s publisher is a credible provider of quality educational learning resources and for positive reviews before downloading the app.\nThe most important thing to do is to observe and engage your kids from time to time, to see if these learning apps and platforms are doing them good, instead of handing them the tablet before turning back to your Korean drama.\nLearning apps are poor babysitters.\n""Socialness"" is becoming a huge part of the learning experience characterised by peer-to-peer support and interaction, mentoring and knowledge sharing.\nWe would do our children a disservice if it were otherwise.\nEdwin Edangelus Cheng is founder and principal of EduEdge learning hub.\xa0\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ', '     technology ']}"

      Commentary: Self-control in childhood, the best predictor of success in adulthood
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: After examining the same cohort of 1,037 individuals for 45 years, tracking them from birth, throughout their adolescence and early adulthood, down to middle age, we have found one factor in particular that is incredibly predictive of success.\nThis is true whether success is defined as being in good physical, financial or emotional health.\nWhether you avoid gambling problems, whether you’re a good parent, your chances of achieving a whole range of important life goals or tasks are much better if you had high levels of this trait – or skill – as a child, as young as age three.\nIt’s not intelligence, measured by IQ, or socio-economic status as a child, the usual suspects that people think matter for how well you do. We adjusted for these variables, and this one x-factor still predicted outcomes much better than we thought it would.\nWhat is this x-factor? Self-control.\nLEARNING SELF-CONTROL\nHow much self-control you exhibit as a child – that is, the ability to control strong emotions, whether they be good or bad, and the will to persevere to attain a goal despite challenges, anticipates how much success you experience later in life.\nIt is a very important ingredient in life success. It’s not the sole ingredient – for there’s no such thing as a single or magic bullet. But if you have to pick one, this is a pretty good one to focus on.\xa0\nWe’re all born with an innate disposition towards having some degree of self-control – some low, some medium, some high.\xa0\nIf you were trying to spot self-control as a parent, what you should be looking for is your child’s ability to sit still on instruction, focus on tasks, follow instructions, to stick at things and persevere, inhibit impulses and not fly off the handle.\nBut the beauty of this trait or skill as I think of it, is that it can be taught like any other skillset.\nEveryone, no matter where we start from, can practise and learn to be better at it. And the more you practise it, the more you have of it, the better your chances of ending up successful down the track.\nTRIFECTA OF EFFECTIVE PARENTING\nHowever much attention an individual child requires may vary, but our years of research have revealed three dimensions of good parenting that parents need to focus on:\nBeing warm, sensitive and stimulating.\nThis is the magic trio.\xa0 A parent having one trait will do okay, but won’t really win any prizes in setting a child up for success. You need all three together.\nPositive brain development also needs to be driven by warmth, predictability and love.\nWhen children are born, they instinctively reach out to the world around them. When parents create an environment that the child trusts, by being warm in their interactions and sensitive to their child’s needs, the child learns to seek out novelty and responds to stimulation optimally because he or she feels safe.\xa0\nBy the time that child gets to three, you can see differences in terms of how much emotional regulation and brain development a child can display.\nThe thing is, you can spoil children, you can set no limits, let them do what they want. But that’s not good for a child’s development.\nParents have a responsibility to set limits on what is acceptable and what is not, and teach their child what the rules are. Because a child will eventually have to leave his or her parents’ house, go out to the world and realise that the world won’t entertain their every whim and fancy.\xa0\nSo warm, sensitive and stimulating parenting is not a contradiction to discipline, and should instead come in within these parameters.\nRECOGNISING THE VALUE OF PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATORS\nIf the pre-school is attuned to the importance of self-control, as an important skill to acquire, interactions there will be focused in a way that encourages this skill acquisition.\nYet, for a long time, people – politicians, policymakers, bureaucrats – have thought of pre-school as being more like a day care or a babysitting endeavour. Instead of presenting learning opportunities, pre-school has been viewed simply as a means of giving parents a break or allowing them to go to work.\nFor an extremely sophisticated period of development, you need equally sophisticated, well-trained teachers to maximise the experience for the children. This workforce would be well-versed in the types of interventions and exchanges that built critical skills, in the area of self-control for instance.\nAfter all, children typically spend at least five or six hours a day, five days a week, in a pre-school setting, learning socialisation skills.\nStrategies educators can practise include harnessing common games that children play and isolating the bits that emphasise self-control.\nMost childhood games, if you think deeply enough, have some element of inhibition. You need to wait your turn. Stop. Wait for the cue to start again. If you emphasise these, but still keep the fun going, life skills become easily integrated into everyday pre-school activities.\nMaking these enjoyable for children also increase the odds they go home and persuade their parents to play these games with them. In this manner, larger life lessons can be scaffolded and built upon, in school and at home.\nUltimately, spotting and cultivating self-control in kids is not rocket science. It’s kind of self-evident and logical.\nNone of us are born parenting experts. Practice is key for our children, and for us in improving our parenting, too.\nProfessor Richie Poulton is head of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health & Development Research Unit, which runs the ongoing Dunedin Study, a detailed study of human health, development and behaviour.

      Commentary: How we nurture children hasn’t changed, even if tools have become digital
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: Today, it is not uncommon to see iPads or mobile phones deployed as “babysitters” or for young children to use apps and smartwatches to make cashless payments.\nFor some, this is seen as a threat to learning through play or sensorial experiences, values or behaviour.\nHowever, this is the reality of our increasingly techno-centric world. As Singapore strives to become a Smart Nation, the question is not whether technology is good or bad – but how we can use it meaningfully.\nFor educators, it means coming to terms with the fact that it is here to stay and exploring how we can maximise its potential as a learning tool to set the right foundations for our children.\nWe should not be going digital for the sake of it, simply because it is now the new norm. Instead, I firmly believe that digital technology can be leveraged to enhance the very process of learning.\nIt is common to hear parents express pride in their child’s tech-savviness – so many children are “very good” at knowing where to click and how to zoom in or out on computers and mobile devices.\nThis is well and good, but what about their child’s ability to interact well with his or her peers? Does he or she take turns? Can he or she think creatively or solve problems innovatively?\nThese are important life skills that we should focus on, especially in early childhood. Even as we teach children the digital skills the 21st century demands, we must do it in a way that empowers them, and in concert with learning and building positive behaviours.\nHelping children develop a healthy relationship with technology at a young age will better ensure they use it wisely and not be used by it.\nINTEGRATED, ENGAGING LEARNING\nAs educators, we must be mindful of these objectives. Technology in the classroom should only add to the learning experience.\nIt should provide new means to give children the chance to exercise executive functioning, such as focus and self-control, communication, critical thinking and being self-directed, among others. It should also facilitate ways for children to interact with each other, and not just with a faceless technology platform.\nWhatever tools we use in the classroom, we always need to ensure that it gets our children thinking, discussing and questioning.\nOne approach we have found to be useful in integrating technology meaningfully into the curriculum is teaching pre-schoolers how to make animated films.\nOver the last two years, K1 and K2 children at our kindergarten made their own stop-motion animated films. They develop their own story, build the props and characters, shoot the film and refine the storyline.\nTechnology may be integral to this process, but their learning extends far beyond animation.\nAs they make their films, the children build a wide range of complex skills without even realising it. They enhance their language skills, develop creativity and exercise analytical thinking in a fun and engaging way.\nAt every step of the process, whether they are discussing the storyline, or who makes the props or goes next to take a photo for another frame in the story, they learn how to negotiate, delegate tasks and work collaboratively.\nIn making their film photo by photo, frame by frame, children experience delayed gratification, develop emotional intelligence and learn patience.\nThis is experiential, integrated, value-centric learning in practice, greatly facilitated by – but not narrowly focused on – digital technology.\nNURTURING TECH-SAVVY EDUCATORS\nFor programmes like these to succeed, early childhood educators must possess the right skills. Again, I am not talking merely about being good with technology, but knowing the right way to use it to enhance learning.\nEven as teaching becomes more digital, the educator’s touch remains central – perhaps becomes even more so.\nThe educator’s deliverables are changing. As we increasingly recognise the importance of letting every child find his or her own way, the educator’s role in facilitating learning cannot be understated.\nThey need to ask questions to trigger critical thinking and prompt independent thought. It is just as much about knowing when to step in as knowing when to step away so that our children can work things out on their own.\nThis means educators need to be more critical observers, focused on each child’s learning styles and strengths, and acutely aware of his or her character and behavioural traits.\nAs children learn, the educators must learn too – forming new insights about the children they are responsible for and using these observations to inform better ways of imparting knowledge.\nThus, to enable the best use of technology in the classroom, educators have to arm themselves with a growth mindset, and embrace learning about technology with the perspective of using it to change pedagogy.\nWe must understand that welcoming technology into our classrooms does not mean we do away with crayons and markers and paint, or the impulse to exercise creativity and expand our imagination that these old tools allow for.\nInstead, technology simply broadens our scope, giving us a bigger palette from which to choose from.\xa0\nThere is a time and place for both tablets and robots, and origami and paint in our classrooms.\nIt is critical that we have affinity with as wide a range of teaching materials as possible, to prepare our children for a colourful life of learning ahead.\nMs Narayanasamy Pushpavalli is the Principal of Ramakrishna Mission Sarada Kindergarten.

The programme seeks to give students a strong understanding of China’s economic, socio-political and geopolitical development.\nThis timely move, according to the Ministry of Education, was in response “to a need for Singaporeans to acquire a good understanding of China and the Chinese mindset, and to develop a deep appreciation of Chinese culture” in the context of China’s rise as a regional and global power.\nToday, some may question the value of an education in China studies given the deluge of information about China freely available on the Internet.\nWhile it may be true that Singaporeans know more about China today than compared with a decade ago, their knowledge, gleaned from disparate online sources and acquired out-of-context, is often shallow and detached from geopolitical complexities.\nThis is evident from how many Singaporeans responded to the Terrex incident by suggesting that our leaders should not have voiced out in the South China Sea territorial disputes considering that Singapore is not a claimant state. As their reasoning goes, Singapore is a small country whereas China is big and hence we should not have offended China.\nThis view betrays a woeful ignorance about how upholding a rules-based international order and the freedom of navigation in international sea lanes is of paramount importance to Singapore’s interests.\nAmid the fast-changing geopolitical landscape, it is perhaps time to rethink how we may best educate Singaporeans about China.\nCHINA STUDIES WITH SINGAPORE CHARACTERISTICS \nA student originating from China once remarked in class that my explanation of “Socialism with Chinese characteristics” \xaddeparted from how it was understood in China. \xadI had pointed out that “Chinese characteristics” is essentially a catch-all phrase to rationalise the inclusion of non-socialist elements in the ideology.\nAnd that is precisely how China studies taught in Singapore should be understood: China studies with Singapore characteristics, grounded in the broader context of regional geopolitics from a Singapore perspective.\nThere are three reasons why the teaching of China studies with Singapore characteristics is so crucial, in view of the rising power’s growing reach in Asia.\nFirst, it serves to forestall or guard against a disturbing trend that, hopefully, has not arrived in Singapore.\nIn her New York Times op-ed, Merriden Varrall, Director of the East Asia Programme at Australia’s Lowy Institute, raised concerns about Chinese students’ objection to any critical view of China in the Australian classroom and their proclivity to align themselves with the Chinese Communist Party’s official stance.\nVarrall’s account was corroborated by a recent spate of incidents in which lecturers in Australian universities were pressured by Chinese students into apologising for comments or using materials these students see as inimical to China’s interests and therefore are “offensive.”\nIn Singapore, Chinese students should be made aware that our China studies syllabus is not designed to toe any other country’s line.\nUnder no circumstances should educators of China studies in Singapore be cowed into apologising for teaching, for example, our nation’s official stance on the South China Sea disputes.\nSecond, a China studies programme that incorporates, for instance, the evolution of Singapore-China relations, will foster an understanding of Singapore’s consistent and pragmatic approach to foreign policy that has underpinned its survival as a small state.\nIn this era of fake news and fabricated social media posts, arming Singaporeans with such knowledge would make them more discerning of what they read.\nThis is in line with former Senior Minister S Jayakumar’s comments earlier this year on the importance of Singaporeans understanding our foreign policy, so that we do not fall prey to external influences and become an unwitting pawn in their stratagem to harm our own national interests.\nLast, while Singapore and Singaporeans continue to ride on China’s rise and tap into the opportunities afforded by its growing economic might, there is a need to ensure that Singaporeans do not lose sight of our nation’s interests.\nTo guard against the alarming prospect of Finlandisation, which refers to how a smaller state has to bend its policies to satisfy the demands of a larger neighbour, we have to nurture Singaporeans - which will include our future leaders, policymakers, diplomats and intellectuals - \xadwho understand the complexities of engaging China, as well as the opportunities and risks that come along with it.\nA China studies programme with a Singapore perspective will allow students to see China’s development from our position, as a small but nonetheless sovereign state in Asia.\nIn short, we need Singaporeans with not only a deep knowledge of China, but also a keen awareness of Singapore’s interests and vulnerabilities.\nAnd herein lies the value of an education in China studies, with Singapore characteristics.\nDr Yew Chiew Ping is head of the Contemporary China Studies Minor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.\n', 'related_topics': ['     China ', '     Singapore ', '     education ', '     South China Sea ']}"

      Commentary: The age-old question about university rankings
  </h1>, 'text': 'SINGAPORE: Recent news reports about Asia-Pacific university rankings have gotten people riled up.\nWhile many Singaporeans use the rankings to pit the National University of Singapore (NUS) against Nanyang Technological University (NTU), others lament the endless stream of university rankings.\n“Wasn’t there one released just a few weeks ago? Is this one or that one more credible?” asked some readers.\nIndeed, it can be confusing what we should pay attention to, when the rank placements of listed universities change frequently depending on what factors each ranking exercise weighs as more important, whether these are the volume of research, the teaching standards or the employability of graduates.\nBut the fact that we still keep a look-out for these rankings suggest that they do matter.\nTHEY MATTER TO PEOPLE AND UNIVERSITIES\nUniversity rankings matter for those in the professional services and technical professions that demand mastery over their domains and the people they serve.\nPart of this is largely psychological, for a highly-ranked school is a proxy for professional excellence, and people generally prefer to collaborate with the best to assure themselves of the highest chance for success.\nWhen you board a driverless car, does the fact that the car was designed by teams of engineers schooled at the highest-ranked university not give you a greater assurance of safety? And when you need a lawyer, isn’t it that much more encouraging when you hear that your lawyer comes from the top university in the land?\nWe also forget that education is an industry in itself. The higher a university\'s ranking, the more students and funding the school attracts, and the more the faculty gets potentially paid.\nIf the school doesn’t do well in one criterion, it has every incentive to improve its ranking on other indicators.\nGovernments are also heavily investing in research to enhance their universities’ rankings. The Chinese government for instance, announced a year ago that it wanted to see six of its universities crack the elite Top 15 universities by 2030 and has channelled billions into research at various Chinese universities.\nAdmittedly, it is near impossible to rank all universities across the Asia-Pacific region fairly.\nMost large, publicly funded universities are required to provide a comprehensive selection of degrees to equip a country or region’s future workforce, whereas smaller independent universities tend to specialise in specific programmes, which can give them a niche advantage.\nA generic ranking for a university also tells us nothing about the strengths of a university in a specific course. In that regard, rankings of universities in specific programmes may be more useful.\nTHEY MATTER TO EMPLOYEES AND BUSINESSES\nSo who do these rankings matter to? For one, rankings help top companies plan and prioritise their graduate hiring activities and costly campus recruitment programmes.\xa0\nNotably, such companies will only conduct university milk-rounds for top-ranked schools. Harvard Business Review reported that in one case, a management consulting firm budgeted nearly US$1 million for engagement and recruitment events in one university alone.\nRankings are also relevant for graduates applying for an overseas position with a foreign company. For hirers screening thousands of resumes from candidates from unfamiliar countries, a knee-jerk coping response is to correlate the quality of the candidate to the pedigree of the university inferred through a recognised university ranking publication.\nUniversity rankings are often used as a screening tool for prospective employers to qualify young job seekers for an interview. It can also be easier to get buy-in from superiors to hire someone from a top-ranked university.\nWhen companies start trusting artificial intelligence to screen resumes for hires, the tendency to rely on this statistic of university rankings as a basis to short-list candidates will increase. As it stands, many job descriptions already state a preference for “a good honours degree from a top university”.\nNaturally, the utility of this short-hand diminishes over time as job candidates accumulate sufficient working experience, enough to establish a professional track record such that his or her schooling history becomes a distant past.\nEven then, it remains attractive for a company to state that their top management came from prestigious schools as this bolsters the reputation of their leadership and in turn, their company. Just look at the annual reports of big companies like Changi Airport Group, where the schools of the Chairman and the CEO are mentioned.\nThere is a subtle difference between branding and ranking. There are universities, like the Singapore Management University, that do not feature highly in recent academic school rankings but are viewed positively given their strong school culture, perceived ""cool factor"" and extensive alumni network. Graduates from these schools can benefit from a positive hiring bias.\nTHEY MATTER TO GRADUATES\nNaturally, a university pedigree will help young graduates find jobs at the start. Coming from a highly-ranked university sends the signal that this person has potential and is poised for success because they beat many others to get into a top-notch school in their youth.\nYet, for many who do not come from a highly-ranked university, their sheer force of personality and drive may be enough to convince employers that they are a catch, without needing a degree from a highly-ranked university to prove their worth.\nThe challenge therefore is how young job seekers can attract the attention of a potential employer and score an interview in the first place, if their resumes do not carry a top-ranked or well-known university name.\nBut make no mistake, graduating from a highly-ranked university will do nothing to save someone who has gotten a job but performs badly in that new position. Their university background could also be held against them in such instances, as they risk being labelled as being only “book-smart”.\nSo to the popular debate whether university rankings matter – they do to hirers and the universities themselves. And if students’ key objective is getting a headstart in their working lives, it should matter to them too.\nPan Zaixian is general manager of Kerry Consulting and has more than 10 years\' experience in executive search.\n', 'related_topics': ['     education ']}"

      Students to be graded on 'achievement levels' in PSLE from 2021
  </h1>, 'text': ""SINGAPORE: From 2021, students taking their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) will be scored with Achievement Levels (ALs) of 1 to 8 in each of their four subjects. The sum of these ALs will make up students’ final scores, which will now be called the PSLE Score.\nIn detailing changes first announced in Parliament in April, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said it is moving away from the PSLE T-score, with the intention of reducing an over-emphasis on academic results. Students in this year's Primary 1 cohort will be first to be affected, as they take the PSLE in 2021, the ministry had said at the Committee of Supply debate.\nThe changes come amid a push to overhaul the PSLE system, to eradicate competition and stress among students and parents, however Acting Minister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng said people still have a strong faith in the current system and that “some things are best evolved and not revolutionised”. Speaking to the media on Wednesday (Jul 13), Mr Ng said: ”Our school system is a strong and robust one. In such a good system, I think it is premature to revolutionise it until such a time when we are clearer. And in many of the things we are doing on the ground besides PSLE, we have taken steps to engender more innovative and creative learning environment”.\nIn the new scoring system, an AL of 1 is the best score a student can achieve, with 8 being the worst. Possible aggregates of the ALs will range from the highest score of 4 to the lowest of 32. Students will no longer be as finely differentiated with the new scoring system, since there will only be 29 possible PSLE scores, compared to more than 200 T-score aggregates under the current system, MOE said.\nUnder the new scoring system, students will be graded based on their individual performance in the subjects. MOE said this is more educationally meaningful than the existing T-score system, which reflects how well students have done relative to their peers.\nBased on reference raw mark ranges provided by MOE, this means a student who scores 90 and above for a subject will be given an AL of 1, regardless of how other students perform in the same exam. MOE said this will allow students to focus on their own learning, rather than trying to outdo others.\nMOE added that the ranges are narrower at the top ALs, but said it estimates about half of all students will score AL4 or better.\nThe existing streams for secondary school education of Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) will be retained. Under the changes students, students will need a PSLE Score from 4 to 20 in order to qualify for the Express stream. MOE added that they do not expect significant changes in the percentage of students who qualify for the different streams.\n\nFoundation level subjects, which cater to upper primary students who may not be able to cope with regular or Standard level subjects at the PSLE, will also be scored on ALs, said MOE.\nStudents with achievements in Higher Chinese looking to get into Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools will also be given a posting advantage in the new system, as will students looking to get into a secondary school that is affiliated to their primary school.\nNEW “CHOICE ORDER” TIE-BREAKER IN SECONDARY 1 POSTING\nThe Secondary 1 posting system will also be tweaked, with a new “Choice Order” tie-breaker introduced. MOE said this is to recognize that families have different considerations when choosing a secondary school.\nIn the existing system, the T-score aggregate is the first criterion for posting, where students are posted to secondary schools based on the six schools of preference they indicate when making their choices. But the order in which a student lists the schools is not considered when deciding who will get a place.\nFor example, a Singaporean student who lists a particular school as his first choice would not get priority over a Singaporean student with the same T-score who lists the same school as his second choice. Tie-breakers like citizenship and computerised balloting are used to decide who gets a place in that school.\nIn the new system, a new tie-breaker called “Choice Order of Schools” will be introduced. While the PSLE Score will remain the first criterion for posting, the order in which a student lists the school in his choices will come into play.\nMOE said that currently, only a small amount of balloting is conducted as a tie-breaker. But with wider scoring bands in the new system, more students will attain the same PSLE score, and there could be more balloting if many students choose the same school. However, it anticipate that balloting will only affect a small proportion of students, as it is only used after earlier tie-breakers have been used up.\nBased on past cohorts’ performances and choice patterns, MOE added that about 9 in 10 students would not have to undergo balloting, but this figure could change depending on the actual choice patterns of students.\nIn order to guide families in their choices of secondary school, MOE said it will provide indicative cut-off points and information on each school’s unique programmes.\nLESS EMPHASIS ON CHASING NUMBERS, MORE CHOICE FOR STUDENTS: PRINCIPALS, TEACHERS\nWith a greater element of choice for parents and students in the new system, secondary schools will now need to differentiate their current niche programmes in order to make them more attractive, said principal of Pasir Ris Crest Secondary, Balamurugan Krishnasamy.\n“In the case of Pasir Ris Crest, we do have an Applied Learning Programme in Media, Broadcasting and Communications. Could we look at certain communication skills that articulates from secondary one right up to secondary three? So what would be the key areas? So things like Toastmastering can come in. It’s not just public speaking but to look at certified skills that students can pick up”, he said.\nMr Bala added that the differentiation becomes leverage and a selling point when one markets the school to parents and students.\nAt the primary school level, teachers said the changes would allow them to pace learning, as opposed to chasing the 3-digit number of the T-score. Ms Esther Tan, who teaches Chinese Language at Pioneer Primary, said the changes would also allow educators to work harder to differentiate their students’ learning capabilities. “Sometimes we tend to think that we need to drive everyone to all hit an A. In pushing this, some kids who are not performing as well may be neglected. With this change, the whole idea is that - let’s say you are a ‘C’ now, I will work at helping you become a ‘B’”, she said.\nIN RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE: GPC CHAIR FOR EDUCATION\nChair of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Education, Denise Phua, said the changes are “in the right direction”, but that more needs to be done to reduce an over-emphasis on grades. For example, she said the changes will not dampen the demand for tuition services unless mindsets change.\n“More schools need to be seen as good schools, excellent schools in form and substance. We need to review the Direct School Admission (programme) which allows for non-academic admission criteria but runs the risk of favouring people who can afford to develop their talents. On the employers side, under SkillsFuture, I’m very hopeful about that but we must do more to show that skills mastery not simply paper qualifications matter in one’s career development, one’s compensation,” she said. Ms Phua said all these “levers need to be pulled before people change their mind about using tuition as something to push their marks up”.\n"", 'related_topics': ['     Lee Hsien Loong ', '     MOE ', '     Singapore ', '     Ministry of Education ', '     Committee of Supply ', '     Ng Chee Meng ', '     parliament ', '     education ']}"
